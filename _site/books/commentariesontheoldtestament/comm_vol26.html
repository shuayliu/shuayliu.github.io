<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S
PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">PREJUDICE has often deprived many of advantages which
they might have otherwise derived: and this has been much the case with respect
to THE WORKS OF CALVIN; they have been almost entirely neglected for a long
time, owing to impressions unfavorable to the Author. In his own and the
succeeding age, the authority of Calvin as a Divine, and especially as an
Expounder of Scripture, was very high, and higher than that of any of the
Reformers. Though an eminent writer of the present day, Dr. D&#8217;Aubigne, has
pronounced Melancthon &#8220;the Theologian of the Reformation,&#8221; yet there
is sufficient reason to ascribe that distinction to Calvin; and to him, no
doubt, it more justly belongs, than to any other of the many illustrious men
whom God raised up during that memorable period.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not difficult to account for what happened to
our Author. Various things combined to depreciate his repute. In this country
his views on Church government created in many a prejudice against him; and then
the progress of a theological system, not more contrary to what he held than to
what our own Reformers maintained, increased this prejudice; and where the
former ground of difference and dislike did not exist, the latter prevailed: so
that, generally in our Church, and among Dissenting bodies, the revered name of
Calvin has been regarded with no feelings of affection, or even of respect; no
discrimination being exercised, and no distinction being made between his great
excellencies as an Expounder of Scripture, and his peculiar views on Church
discipline, and on the doctrine of Predestination.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the Continent other things operated against his
reputation. Popery owed him a deep grudge; for no one of the Reformers probed
the depths of its iniquities with so much discrimination, and with such an
unsparing hand as he did. His remarkably acute mind enabled him to do this most
effectually; and there is much on this subject in the present work, which
renders it especially valuable at this period, when Popery makes such efforts to
spread its errors and delusions. The two weapons which he commonly employed were
Scripture and common sense, &#8212; weapons ever dreaded by Popery; and to blunt
their edge has at all times been its attempt, the first, by vain tradition, and
the other, by implicit faith, not in God, or in God&#8217;s word, but in a
palpably degenerated Church. But these weapons CALVIN wielded with no common
skill<sub> </sub>dexterity, and power, being deeply versed in Scripture, and
endued with no ordinary share of sound and penetrating judgment. In addition to
this, his doctrinal views were diametrically opposed to those of Popery, and
especially to the papal system, as modified by and concentrated in Jesuitism,
which may be considered to be the most perfect form of Popery. For these
reasons, the Writings of Calvin could not have been otherwise than extremely
obnoxious to the adherents of the Church of Rome: and the consequence has been,
that they spared no efforts to vilify his name, and to lessen his
reputation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first writer of eminence and acknowledged
learning in this country, who has done any thing like justice to Calvin, was
BISHOP HORSLEY; and when we consider the very strong prejudice which at that
time prevailed almost in all quarters against Calvin, to vindicate his character
was no ordinary proof of moral courage. There were, no doubt, some points in
which the two were very like. They both possessed minds of no common strength
and vigor, and minds discriminating no less than vigorous. In clearness of
perception, also, they had few equals; so that no one needs hardly ever read a
passage in the writings of either twice over in order to understand its meaning.
But probably the most striking point of likeness was their independence of mind.
They thought for themselves, without being swayed by authority either ancient or
modern, and acknowledged no rule and no authority in religion but that which is
divine. The Bishop had more imagination, but the Pastor of Geneva had a sounder
judgment. Hence the Bishop, notwithstanding his strong mind and great acuteness,
was sometimes led away by what was plausible and novel; but Calvin was ever
sober-minded and judicious, and whatever new view he gives to a passage, it is
commonly well supported, and for the most part gains at once our
approbation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But something must be said of the present
work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It embraces the most difficult portion,<sub> </sub>in
some respects, of THE OLD TESTAMENT, and of that portion, as acknowledged by
all, the most difficult is THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET HOSEA. Probably no part of
Scripture is commonly read with so little benefit as THE MINOR PROPHETS, owing,
no doubt, to the obscurity in which some parts are involved. That there is much
light thrown on many abstruse passages in this Work, and more than by any
existing Comment in our language, is the full conviction of the writer. Acute,
sagacious, and sometimes profound, the Author is at the same time remarkably
simple, plain, and lucid, and ever practical and useful. The most learned may
here gather instruction, and the most unlearned may understand almost every
thing that is said. The whole object of the Author seems to be to explain,
simplify, and illustrate the text,<sub> </sub>and he never turns aside to other
matters. He is throughout an Expounder, keeps strictly to his office, and gives
to every part its full and legitimate meaning according to the context, to which
he ever especially attends.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The style of Hosea is somewhat peculiar. Jerome has
long ago characterized it as being <i>commatic, </i>sententious; and those
links, the connective particles, by which different parts are joined together,
are sometimes omitted. This is, indeed, in a measure the character of the style
of all the Prophets, but more so with respect to Hosea than any other. What at
the same time creates the greatest difficulty is the rapidity of his
transitions, and the change of person, number, and gender. Persons are spoken
<i>to </i>and spoken <i>of</i> sometimes in the same verse; and he passes from
the singular to the plural number, and the reverse, and sometimes from the
masculine to the feminine gender. To account for these transitions is not always
easy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It has been thought by many critics, that the
received Hebrew text of Hosea is in a more imperfect state than that of any
other portion of Scripture; but Bishop Horsley denies this in a manner the most
unhesitating; and those emendations which Archbishop Newcome introduced in his
version, about 51 in number, the Bishop has swept away as unauthorized, and,
indeed, as unnecessary, for most of them had been proposed to remedy the
anomalies peculiar to the style of this Prophet; and some of those few
emendations, which the Bishop himself introduced, founded on the authority of
MSS., Calvin&#8217;s exposition shows to be unnecessary. The fact is, that
different readings, collected by the laborious Kennicott and others, have done
<i>chiefly </i>this great good &#8212; to show the extraordinary correctness of
our received text. Throughout this Prophet, there is hardly an instance in which
the collations of MSS. have supplied an improvement, and certainly no
improvement of any material consequence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Work of CALVIN appears now for the first time in
the English language. There is a French translation, but not made by the Author
himself, as in the case of some other portions of his writings, and can
therefore be of no authority. The following translation has been made from an
edition printed at Geneva in 1567, three years after Calvin&#8217;s death,
compared with another, printed also at Geneva in 1610.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It has been thought advisable to adopt our common
version as the text, and to put Calvin&#8217;s Latin version in a parallel
column. His version is a literal rendering of the original, without any regard
to idiom, and to translate it has been found impracticable, at least in such a
way as to be understood by common readers. His practice evidently was to
translate the. Hebrew word for word, and to make this his text, and then in his
Comment to modify the expressions so as to reduce them into readable Latin, and
his version thus modified agrees in most instances with our authorized version.
The agreement is so remarkable, that the only conclusion is, that this Work must
have been much consulted by our Translators.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In making quotations from Scripture, the Author seems
to have followed no version, but to have made one of his own; and they are often
given paraphrastically, the meaning rather than the words being regarded. The
same is often done also with respect to the passages explained, the words being
frequently varied. In these instances the Author has been strictly followed
throughout in this Translation, and his quotations, and the text when
paraphrased, are marked by a single inverted comma.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew words which occur in the Lectures are not
accompanied with the points, and it has not been deemed necessary to acid them.
The words are given in corresponding English characters, with the insertion of
such vowels only as are necessary to enunciate them, and these vowels, to
distinguish them from the Hebrew vowels, are put in Roman characters. The Hebrew
vowels are uniformly given the same, and not with that almost endless variety of
sounds to which the points have reduced them. The
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>vau, </i>is always represented by u, except when in sonic instances it is
followed by a vowel, and then by v. The Hebrews have four vowels corresponding
with a, e, u, i, and o, in English.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This work is calculated to be of material help to
those engaged in translations. Our Missionaries may derive from it no small
assistance, as it gives as literal a version of the Hebrew as can well be made,
and contains much valuable criticism, and develops, in a very lucid and
satisfactory manner, the drift and meaning of many difficult passages. There is
no existing Commentary in which the text is so minutely examined, and so clearly
explained. There are also many of the most approved expositions given by others
referred to and stated; and the Translator has added, on interesting and
difficult passages, what has been suggested by learned critics since the time of
the Author.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be a right rule to judge of the impressions
which the perusal of this volume, now presented to the public, may produce on
others, by what one has himself experienced, the Editor will mention one thing
in particular, and that is, that he fully expects that those who will carefully
read this volume will be more impressed than ever with the extreme propensity of
human nature to idolatry, and with the amazing power and blinding effects of
superstition. The conduct of the Israelites, notwithstanding all the means
employed to restore them to the true worship of God, is here described with no
ordinary minuteness and specialty. Though God sent his Prophets to them to
remind them of their sins, to reason and expostulate with them, to threaten and
to exhort them, to draw and allure them with promises of pardon and acceptance;
and though God chastised them in various ways, and then withheld his
displeasure, and showed them indulgence, they yet continued obstinately attached
to their idolatry and superstition, and all the while professed and boasted that
they worshipped the true God, and perversely maintained that their mixed
service, the worship of God, and the worship of idols, was right and lawful, and
vastly superior to what the Prophets recommended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having this case of the Israelites in view, we need
not be surprised at the fascinating and blinding influence of Popery, whose
idolatry and superstitions are exactly of the same character with those of the
Israelites; no two cases can be more alike. Their identity is especially seen in
this, &#8212; that there is an union of two worships &#8212; of God and of
images; and this union was the idolatry condemned in the Israelites, and is the
very idolatry that now exists in the Church of Rome: and as among the
Israelites, so among the Papists, though God is not excluded, but owned, yet the
chief worship is given to false gods and their images. That the two systems are
the same, no one can doubt, except those who are under the influence of strong
delusion; and this is what is often referred to and amply proved in this
work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be useful to subjoin here an account of the
time in WHICH THE TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS lived. The precise time cannot be
ascertained: they flourished between the two dates which are here given. The
names of the other four Prophets are also added.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">POSTSCRIPT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">AFTER the preceding PREFACE had gone through the
press, it has been discovered that THE TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS cannot be comprised
in four volumes of the size generally published in the present Series of THE
WORKS OF JOHN CALVIN.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Translation, though it be as brief and concise as
the idiom of the English language will well admit, takes up more space than the
Editor at first anticipated. His first calculation was made from the Latin: he
was not then fully aware of the <i>great </i>disparity in the two languages as
to relative diffuseness of style. He has since found, by a minute comparison,
that a work in Latin, comprised in five volumes, would require at least
<i>six</i> of the same size and type in English: and in the present instance,
what was calculated would be contained in four, must be extended to<i> five
</i>volumes, on account of the respective PREFACES and NOTES, &amp;C. by the
Editor, besides the LITERAL TRANSLATIONS Of each of the BOOKS OF THE TWELVE
MINOR PROPHETS, which it has since been resolved shall be appended to each
successive COMMENTARY,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The arrangement of this Work, now made with some
degree of certainty, is as follows:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>First
</b></font><font face="Palatino">Volume is to contain
<b>HOSEA</b>;</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Second
</b></font><font face="Palatino">Volume, <b>JOEL</b>, <b>AMOS</b>, and
<b>OBADIAH</b>;</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Third
</b></font><font face="Palatino">Volume, <b>JONAH</b>, <b>MICAH</b>, and
<b>NAHUM</b>;</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Fourth
</b></font><font face="Palatino">Volume, <b>HABAKKUK</b>, <b>ZEPHANIAH</b>, and
<b>HAGGAI</b>; and</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Fifth
</b></font><font face="Palatino">Volume, <b>ZECHARIAH </b>and
<b>MALACHI</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On this account, the Volumes cannot be all of equal
size, some being considerably above, and some below, the average extent of the
present Series of CALVIN&#8217;S WORKS, being 500 pages on the average. To avoid
such inequality, it would have been needful to divide some of the Books &#8212;
a thing by no means desirable in any case, and which has been studiously shunned
in all the other Commentaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In addition to what was originally contemplated,
there will be given at the end of each Book a continuous LITERAL TRANSLATION OF
CALVIN&#8217;S LATIN VERSION, as modified by his Commentary; and the Editor is
requested to state that a similar plan is to be observed in all the other
Prophetical Books of the Old Testament.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><i>The King Of The Goths And
Vandals.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WHAT I once said, most excellent king, when the
ANNOTATIONS ON HOSEA, taken from my LECTURES, were published, I now again
repeat, &#8212; that I was not the author of that edition: for I am one who is
not easily pleased with works I finish with more labor and care. Had it been in
my power, I should have rather tried to prevent the wider circulation of that
extemporaneous kind of teaching, intended for the particular benefit of my
auditory, and with which benefit I was abundantly satisfied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But since that specimen, (THE COMMENTARY ON HOSEA,)
published with better success than I expected, has kindled a desire in many to
see that one Prophet followed by the other eleven MINOR PROPHETS, I thought it
not unseasonable to dedicate to your Majesty a work of suitable extent, and
replete with important instructions, not only that it may be a pledge of my high
regards, but also that the dedication to so celebrated a name might procure for
it some favor. It is not, however, ambition that has led me to do this, for I
have long ago learned not to court the applause of the world, and have become
hardened to the ingratitude of the many; but I wished that some fruit might come
to men of your station from the recesses of our mountains; and it has also been
my legitimate endeavor, that many to whom I am unknown, being influenced by the
sacred sanction of their king, might be made more impartial, and come better
prepared to read the work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this, I promise to myself, will be the case, as
you enjoy so much veneration among all your subjects, provided you condescend to
interpose your judgment, such as your singular wisdom may dictate; or, as age
may possibly not bear the fatigue of reading, such as your Majesty&#8217;s
eldest son <i>Heric, </i>the heir to the throne, may suggest, whom you have
taken care to be so instructed in the liberal sciences, that this office may be
safely intrusted to him. And that I might have less doubt of your kindness,
there are many heralds of your virtues, and even some judicious and wise men,
who are entitled to be deemed competent witnesses. It is not, therefore, to be
wondered, most noble king, that a present from so distant a region should be
offered to your Majesty by a man as yet unknown to you, who, on account of the
excellent and heroic endowments of mind and heart in which he has understood you
to excel, thinks himself to be especially attached to you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though the excellency of the Book may not,
perhaps, be such as will procure much favor to myself, you will not yet despise
the desire by which I have been led to manifest the high regards I entertain
towards your Majesty, nor will you yet find this present now offered to you
wholly unworthy, however much it may be below the elevated station of so great a
king. If God has endued me with any aptness for the interpretation of Scripture,
I am fully persuaded that I have faithfully and carefully endeavored to exclude
from it all barren refinements, however plausible and fitted to please the ear,
and to preserve genuine simplicity, adapted solidly to edify the children of
God, who, being not content with the shell, wish to penetrate to the kernel.
What I have really done it is not for me to say, except that pious and learned
men persuade me that I have not labored without success. But these Commentaries
may not, perhaps, answer the wishes and expectations of all; and I myself could
have wished that I had been able to give something more excellent and more
perfect, or at least what would have come nearer to the Prophetic Spirit. But
this, I trust, will be the issue, &#8212; that experience will prove to upright
and impartial readers, and those endued with sound judgment, provided they read
with well-disposed minds, and not fastidiously, what I have written for their
benefit, that more light has been thrown on the Twelve Prophets than modesty
will allow me to affirm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With the industry of others I compare not my own,
(which would be unbecoming,) nor do I ask any thing else, but that intelligent
and discreet Readers, profiting by my labors, should study to be of more
extensive advantage to the public good of the Church; but as it has not been my
care, nor even my desire, to adorn this Book with various attractives, this
admonition is not unseasonable; for it may invite the more slothful to read,
until, by making a trial, they may be able to judge whether it may be useful for
them to proceed farther in their course of reading. Indeed, the fruit which my
other attempts in the interpretation of Scripture have produced, and the hope
which I entertain of the usefulness of this, please me so much, that I desire to
spend the remainder of my life in this kind of labor, as far as my continued and
multiplied employment&#8217;s will allow me. For what may be expected from a man
at leisure cannot be expected from me, who, in addition to the ordinary office
of a pastor, have other duties, which hardly allow me the least relaxation: I
shall not, however, deem my spare time in any other way better
employed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return again to you, most valiant king. He who
knows your prudence and equity in managing public affairs, your moral habits,
your whole character and virtues, will not wonder that I have resolved to
dedicate to you this work. But as it is not my design to write a long eulogy on
what is praiseworthy in you, I shall only briefly touch on what is well known,
both by report and public writings: &#8212; God tried you in a wonderful manner
before he raised you to the throne, for the purpose not only of exhibiting in
you a singular proof of his providence, but also of setting forth to our age as
well as to posterity, an illustrious example of a steady perseverance in a right
course. You have, doubtless, been thus proved by both fortunes, that there might
not be wanting a due trial of your temperance and moderation in prosperity, and
of your patience in adversity, until it was given you from above to emerge at
length, no less happily than in a praiseworthy manner, from so many dangers,
perils, difficulties, and hindrances, that having set the kingdom in order, you
might publicly and privately enjoy a cheerful tranquillity. And now, by the
unanimous consent of all orders, you bear a burden more splendid and honorable
to you than grievous, for all venerate your authority, and show their esteem by
love as well as by commendations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In addition to these benefits of God comes this, the
chief, which must not be omitted, &#8212; that your eldest son, Heric, a
successor chosen by you from your own blood, is not only of a generous
disposition, but also adorned with mature virtues; and hardly any one more fit,
had you no children, could the people have chosen for themselves. And this,
among other things, is his rare commendation, that he has made so much progress
in the liberal sciences, that he occupies a high station among the learned, and
that he is not tired with diligent application to them, as far as he is allowed
by those many cares and distractions in which the royal dignity is involved. At
the same time, the principal thing with me is this, that he hath consecrated in
his palace a sanctuary, not only to the heathen muses, but also to celestial
philosophy. The more confidence therefore I have, that some place will be there
found, and some favor shown to these Commentaries, which he wall find to have
been written according to the rule of true religion, and will perceive
calculated to be of some small help to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">May God, O most serene king! keep your Majesty long
in prosperity, and continue to enrich you with all kinds of blessings. May He
guide you by his Spirit, until, having finished your course, and migrating from
earth to the celestial kingdom, you may leave alive behind you the most serene
king Heric, your successor, and his most illustrious brothers, John Magnus and
Charles: and may the same grace of God, after your death, appear eminent in
them, as well as fraternal and unanimous concord.</font><br></div>

CHRISTIAN READER, HEALTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">SINCE I can truly and justly say. and prove by
competent witnesses, that the writings, which I have hitherto sent forth to the
public, and which might have been finished with more care and attention, have
been almost extorted from me by importunity, it is evident that these
Annotations, which I thought might bear a hearing, but were unworthy of being
read, would have never through me been brought forth to the light. For if, by
many watchings, I can hardly succeed in rendering even a small benefit to the
Church by my meditations, how foolish were it in me to claim a place for my
sermons among the works which are published? Besides, if, with regard to those
compositions which I write or dictate privately at home, when there is more
leisure for meditation, and when a finished brevity is attained by care and
diligence, my industry is yet made a crime by the malignant and the envious, how
can I escape the charge of presumption, if I now force upon the whole world the
reading of those thoughts which I freely poured forth for the present
edification of my hearers? But since to suppress them was not in my power, and
their publication could not be otherwise prevented by me than by undertaking the
labor (which my circumstances allowed not) of writing the whole anew, and many
friends, thinking me to be too scrupulous a judge of my own labors, cried out,
that I was doing an injury to the Church, I chose to allow this volume, as it
<i>is, </i>taken from my lips,<i> </i>to go forth to the public, rather than by
prohibition to impose on myself the necessity of writing; which I was forced to
do as to The Psalms, before I found out, by that long and difficult work, how
unequal I am to so much writing.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa2A</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let, then, these explanations on Hosea go forth,
which it is not in my power to keep<i> </i>from the public. But how they have
been taken down, it is needful to declare, not only that the diligence,
industry, and skill of those who have performed this labor for the Church, may
not be deprived of their commendation, but also that readers may be fully
persuaded, that there are here no additions, and that the writers did not allow
themselves to change a single word for a better one. How they assisted one
another, one of their number, my best friend, and through his virtues, dear to
all good men, Mr. John Budaeus, will, as I expect, more fully
explain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it would have been incredible to me, had I not
clearly seen, when the day after they read the whole to me, that what they had
written differed nothing from my discourse. It would have perhaps been better
had more liberty been taken to cut off redundancies, to bring the arrangement
into better order, and to use, in some instances, more distinct or graceful
language: but I do not interpose my judgment; this only I wish to witness with
my own hand, That they have taken down what they have heard from my lips with so
much fidelity, that I perceive no change. Farewell, Christian reader, whoever
thou be, who desirest with me to make progress in celestial
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>GENEVA, February 13,

<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">JOHN BUDAEUS</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">TO CHRISTIAN
READERS, HEALTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WHEN some years ago the most learned JOHN CALVIN, at
the request and entreaty of his friends, undertook to explain in the School THE
PSALMS OF DAVID, some of us, his hearers, took notes from the beginning of a few
things in our own way, for our own private meditation, according to our own
judgment and discretion. But being at length admonished by our own experience,
we began to think how great a loss would it be to many, and almost to the whole
Church, that the benefit of such Lectures should be confined to a few hearers.
Having therefore gathered courage, we fully thought that it was our duty to
unite a care and concern for the public with our own private benefit, and this
seemed possible, if, instead of following our usual practice, we tried, as far
as we could, to take down the Lectures word for word. Without delay I joined
myself as the third to two zealous brethren in this undertaking; and it so
happened, through God&#8217;s kindness, that a happy issue was not wholly
wanting to our attempt: for when the labors of each of us were compared
together, and the LECTURES were immediately written out, we found that so few
things had escaped us, that the gaps could easily be made up. And that this was
the case as to the work in which was made the first trial of our capacities,
Calvin himself is a witness to us; and that this has been far more fully the
case with respect to the Lectures on Hosea, (as by long use and exercise we
became more skillful) even all the hearers will readily
acknowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the design on this occasion was to induce him, if
possible, to publish complete Commentaries on this Author; but it then happened
to us otherwise than we expected: for all hope of obtaining this object he cut
off from us from reverence to BUCER, who, in this case, as well as in all other
things, had performed most faithful and most useful services, as the whole
Church acknowledges, and as Calvin in particular has at all times most honorably
declared to us and to all. It therefore remained that the Lectures, as taken
down by us, should be published. And as all the most pious promised to
themselves great benefit from our labor, we daily increased our exertions, that
such a hope might not pass away into smoke. Being therefore stirred on by these
desires, as well, doubtless, as by the prospect of benefiting the godly, we
exerted ourselves so much, that all readily allowed that we exercised nothing
short of the greatest diligence. The more wonderful it may seem, that he was
afterwards induced to change his mind, so as to frustrate our hope and that of
many of the godly; and that, on the other hand, he was constrained, however
anxious to perform a most useful service to the Church, to incur the great envy
and implacable hatred of many. But those who plead only<i> </i>the authority of
Bucer in this affair are moved, I willingly acknowledge, by a reason not
altogether unjust; yet they will seem to me too stiff and unbending, if they
will not suffer themselves to be influenced by sufficient excuses, which I hope
will be the case before long. But as to those who are carried away by the insane
love of evil-speaking, and avail themselves of the least opportunity of strife,
as they ought to be disregarded and detested as monsters by all the godly, so it
is not needful to labor much to satisfy them, for the barking of dogs, provided
it hurt not the Church, may without great danger be passed by and
despised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have, indeed, prefaced these things for the sake
of those who have very often solicited us respecting the LECTURES ON THE PSALMS,
that they may not think themselves to have been deceived by us with a vain
expectation; for, let them know, that they shall sometimes have, through
God&#8217;s favor, correct and complete Commentaries on The Book of Psalms. But
if this long desire does much distress them, let them remember that we also no
less anxiously look for that great treasure. But it is right that we both should
pardon a man who has constant and most burdensome occupations, and somewhat
moderate our too prurient and premature wishes: and to indulge him seems right
even on this one account, that he, the least of all, indulges himself, never
taking any rest or relaxation of mind from his vast labors, so that it is a
matter of doubt to none but that he drags a little body, not only through the
divine kindness, but by a singular miracle, which cannot be told to posterity,
&#8212; a body, by nature weak, violently attacked by frequent diseases, and
then exhausted by immense labors; and, lastly, pierced by the unceasing stings
of the ungodly, and on all sides distressed and tormented by all kinds of
reproaches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this is not the place for making complaints, I
now come to you, Christian Readers, to whom it is our purpose to dedicate this
work, THE LECTURES ON THE PROPHET HOSEA; and we dedicate it, not that we claim
any thing as our own, except the diligence we employed in collecting it: but we
hesitate not to make it, as it were, our own, for it would have never come to
you except through our assistance. For though we judged the work altogether
excellent, which is now offered to the Church, yet we could hardly at last
convince the author of this; and he suffered himself to be overcome by our
importunate entreaties only on this condition, that we were to be accountable
for whatever judgment good men might form of the work: so unfit a judge he is of
his own productions. But we, though he may modestly extenuate them more than
what is right,<sub> </sub>yet dare to promise to ourselves, that not only the
author&#8217;s labor will be duly appreciated by you, but that we shall also
secure to ourselves no common favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These Lectures, we trust, will not be less acceptable
to you, because the author, regarding the benefit of the school, (as it was
right,)in some degree departed from the usual elegance of all his other works,
and from embellishment of style. For,<sub> </sub>being oppressed with a vast
quantity of business, he was constrained to leave home, after having had hardly,
for the most part, half an hour to meditate on these Lectures: he preferred to
advance the edification and benefit of his hearers by eliciting the true sense
and making it plain, rather than by vain pomp of words to delight their ears, or
to regard ostentation and his own glory. I would not, at the same time, deny,
but that these Lectures were delivered more in the scholastic than in the
oratorical style. If, however, this simple, though not rude, mode of speaking
should offend any one, let him have recourse to the works of others, or of this
author himself, especially those in which, being freed from the laws of the
school, he appears no less the orator than the illustrious theologian: and this
we declare without hesitation, and with no less modesty than with the full
consent and approbation of the best and the most learned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We do not indeed thus speak as if we would, by a
censorious superciliousness, claim for him alone the glory of an orator, or
would not, by calling him a theologian, acknowledge many others as celebrated
men. Far from us be such a folly. But an occasion such as this being offered of
testifying our mind, we could hardly, even in any other way, excuse our neglect
to the godly, to whom it is well known, that our silence concerning Calvin has
not hitherto well pleased turbulent men; who are more willing to have their
vanity expressly reprobated by us, than to suffer us by a tacit consent and
modest silence either to approve of his doctrine, and to acknowledge in him an
evidence, the most clear, of God&#8217;s kindness towards us, or to cover by a
fraternal dissimulation their madness; and thus each of us would have to mourn
by himself in silence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, as I have said, the language here is unadorned
and simple, very like that which we know was ever wont to be used formerly in
Lectures: not such as many of whom we have heard employ, who repeat to their
hearers from a written paper what had been previously prepared at home; but such
as could be formed and framed at the time, more adapted to teach and edify than
to please the ear. Except, then, we are greatly mistaken, he so expresses almost
to the life the mind of the Prophet, that no addition seems possible. For, after
having carefully examined every sentence, he then briefly shows the use and
application of the doctrine, so that no one, however ignorant, can mistake the
meaning: in short, he so unfolds and opens the subjects and fountains of true
theology, that it is easy for any one to draw from them what is needful to
restore and refresh the soul; yea, the ministers of the word may hence
advantageously derive ample streams, with which, as by a celestial dew, they may
abundantly refresh the people of God, whether by exhortation, or consolation, or
reproof, or edification. And of these things we clearly see some instances and
examples in all his discourses, especially in those in which he so accommodates
the doctrine of the Prophets to our own times, that it seems to suit their age
no better than ours.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that we may at length make an end, it remains,
Christian Readers, that we receive and embrace with suitable gratitude all the
other innumerable gifts of God which he daily pours on us in great abundance, as
well as this incomparable treasure of his goodness, and employ them for the
purpose of leading a holy and godly life to the glory of his name, and to the
edification of our brethren: and that this may be done, we must pray for the
Spirit of God, that we may come to the reading of Scripture instructed by him,
and bring a mind purified from the defilement&#8217;s of the flesh, and a meek
spirit capable of receiving celestial truth. And for this end much help may be
given us by the short prayers which we have taken care to add at the close of
every Lecture, as gathered by us with the same care and fidelity as the Lectures
were: the minds of the pious may by these be refreshed, and may collect new
vigor for the next Lecture; and the ignorant may also have in these a pattern,
as it were, painted before them, by which they may form their prayers from the
words of Scripture. For as at the beginning of the Lectures he ever used the
same form of prayer, which we intend also to add, that his manner of teaching
may be fully known to you; so he was wont ever to finish every Lecture by a new
prayer formed at the time, as given him by the Spirit of God, and accommodated
to the subject of the Lecture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we shall understand that these COMMENTARIES will
be acceptable to you, though the work is the fruit of anothers labor, we shall
yet engage, God favoring us, to do the same as to the remaining Prophets. When
he shall undertake to lecture on them, it is our purpose to follow him with no
less diligence, and take down what remains to the end. In the meantime, enjoy
these. Farewell.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">TO CHRISTIAN

<div><font face="Palatino">As it may seem wonderful to some, and indeed
incredible, that these LECTURES were taken down with such fidelity and care,
that Mr. JOHN CALVIN uttered not a word in delivering them, which was not
immediately written down; it may be needful here shortly to remind pious readers
of the plan they pursued who have transmitted them to us. And this is done, that
their singular diligence and industry may stimulate others to do the same, and
that the thing itself may not appear incredible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, first, it must be remembered, that CALVIN
himself never dictated, as many do, any of his Lectures, nor gave any orders
that any thing should be noted down while he was interpreting Scripture, much
less after finishing the Lecture, or on the day after its delivery; but he
occupied a whole hour in speaking, and was not wont to write in his book a
single word to assist his memory. When, therefore, some years ago, Mr. John
Budaeus and Charles Jonvill, with two other brethren, (whom Budaeus himself
mentions in his preface, and that so it was many know,) found, in writing out
THE EXPOSITION ON THE PSALMS, that their common labor would not be wholly in
vain, they were impelled by a stronger desire and alacrity of mind, so that they
resolved to take down, with more diligence than before, if possible, the whole
exposition on what are called THE TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS. And, in copying, they
followed this plan. Each had his paper prepared in a form the most convenient,
and each took down by himself with the greatest speed. If a word had escaped
one, (which sometimes happened, particularly on points of dispute and in those
parts which were delivered with some warmth,) it was taken up by another; and
when it so happened, it was easily set down again by the writer. Immediately at
the close of the Lecture, Jonvill took with him the papers of the other two,
placing them before him, and consulting his own, and collating them together, he
dictated to some other person for the purpose of copying what they had hastily
taken down. At last he read the whole over himself, that he might be able to
recite it the following day before Mr. Calvin at home. When sometimes any little
word was wanting, it was added in its place; or, if any thing seemed not
sufficiently explained, it was readily made plainer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus it happened that these Lectures came forth to
the light; and what great benefit they will derive from them, who will seriously
read them, can by no means be told: for who, endued with a sound judgment, does
not see that such was the way which this most illustrious man possessed in
explaining Scripture, that he had it in common with very few? lie everywhere so
unfolds the design of the Holy Spirit, so gives his genuine meaning, and also so
sets before our eyes every recondite doctrine, that you find nothing but what is
openly explained; and this is what his many writings most abundantly testify, in
which he has made every point of the Christian religion so plain, that all,
except they be wholly blind to the sun, acknowledge him to be a most faithful
interpreter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that I may now say nothing of his many
Commentaries, he has so surpassed himself in these Lectures, that one can hardly
persuade himself that a style so elegant, and so per-feet in all its parts,
could have flowed extemporaneously, for he explains the weightiest sentiments in
suitable words, clearly handles obscure things, clothes them with various
ornaments, and so proceeds in his teaching, that the language he uses,
spontaneously poured forth, seems to have been long and much labored. But of all
these things I prefer that a judgment should be formed by a perusal, rather than
that I should longer detain readers by a lengthened discussion of particulars.
Then farewell all ye who hope for some benefit from these
Lectures.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE
ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I HAVE undertaken to expound The Twelve Minor
Prophets. They have been long ago joined together, and their writings have been
reduced to one volume; and for this reason, lest by being extant singly in our
hands, they should, as it often happens, disappear in course of time on account
of their brevity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Twelve Minor Prophets form but one volume.
The first of them is HOSEA, who was specifically destined for the kingdom of
Israel: MICAH and ISAIAH prophesied at the same time among the Jews. But it
ought to be noticed, that this Prophet was a teacher in the kingdom of Israel,
as Isaiah and Micah were in the kingdom of Judah. The Lord doubtless intended to
employ him in that part; for had he prophesied among the Jews, he would not have
complimented them; since the state of things was then very corrupt, not only in
Judea, but also at Jerusalem, though the palace and sanctuary of God were there.
We see how sharply and severely Isaiah and Micah reproved the people; and the
style of our Prophet would have been the same had the Lord employed his service
among the Jews: but he followed his own call. He knew what the Lord had
intrusted to him; he faithfully discharged his own office. The same was the case
with the Prophet Amos: for the Prophet Amos sharply inveighs against the
Israelites, and seems to spare the Jews; and he taught at the same time with
Hosea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see, then, in what respect these four differ:
ISAIAH and MICAH address their reproofs to the kingdom of Judah; and HOSEA and
AMOS only assail the kingdom of Israel, and seem to spare the Jews. Each of them
undertook what God had committed to his charge; and so each confined himself
within the limits of his own call and office. For if we, who are called to
instruct the Church, close our eyes to the sins which prevail in it, and neglect
those whom the Lord has appointed to be taught by us, we confound all order;
since they who are appointed to other places must attend to those to whom they
have been sent by the Lord&#8217;s call.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see to whom this whole book of Hosea
belongs, &#8212; that is, to the kingdom of Israel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But with regard to the Prophets, this is true of them
all, as we have sometimes said, that they are interpreters of the law. And this
is the sum of the law, that God designs to rule by his own authority the people
whom he has adopted. But the law has two parts, &#8212; a promise of salvation
and eternal life, and a rule for a godly and holy living. To these is added a
third part, &#8212; that men, not responding to their call, are to be restored
to the fear of God by threatening and reproofs. The Prophets do further teach
what the law has commanded respecting the true and pure worship of God,
respecting love; in short, they instruct the people in a holy and godly life,
and then offer to them the favor of the Lord. And as there is no hope of
reconciliation with God except through a Mediator, they ever set forth the
Messiah, whom the Lord had long before promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the third part, which includes threats and
reproofs, it was peculiar to the Prophets; for they point out times, and
denounce this or that judgement of God: &#8220;The Lord will punish you in this
way, and will punish you at such a time.&#8221; The Prophets, then, do not
simply call men to God&#8217;s tribunal, but specify also certain kinds of
punishment, and also in the same way they declare prophecies respecting the
Lord&#8217;s grace and his redemption. But on this I only briefly touch; for it
will be better to notice each point as we proceed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to Hosea. I have said that his ministry
belonged especially to tHE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL; for then the whole worship of God
was there polluted, nor had corruption lately begun; but they were so obstinate
in their superstitions, that there was no hope of repentance. We indeed know,
that as soon as Jeroboam withdrew the ten tribes from their allegiance to
Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, fictitious worship was set up: and Jeroboam seemed
to have wisely contrived that artifice, that the people might not return to the
house of David; but at the same time he brought on himself and the whole people
the vengeance of God. And those who came after him followed the same impiety.
When such perverseness became intolerable, God resolved to put forth his power,
and to give some signal proof of his displeasure, that the people might at
length repent. Hence John was by God&#8217;s command anointed King of Israel,
that he might destroy all the posterity of Ahab: but he also soon relapsed into
the same idolatry. He executed God&#8217;s judgement, he pretended great zeal;
but his hypocrisy soon came to light, for he embraced false and perverted
worship; and his followers were nothing better even down to Jeroboam, under whom
Hosea prophesied; but of this we shall speak in considering the inscription of
the book.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This first verse shows the time in which Hosea
prophesied. He names four kings of Judah, &#8212; Uzziah, Jotham, Ahab,
Hezekiah. Uzziah, called also Azariah, reigned fifty-two years; but after having
been smitten with leprosy, he did not associate with men, and abdicated his
royal dignity. Jotham, his son, succeeded him. The years of Jotham were about
sixteen, and about as many were those of king Ahab, the father of Hezekiah; and
it was under king Hezekiah that Hosea died. If we now wish to ascertain how long
he discharged his office of teaching, we must take notice of what sacred history
says, &#8212; Uzziah began to reign in the twenty seventh year of Jeroboam, the
son of Joash. By supposing that Hosea performed his duties as a teacher,
excepting a few years during the reign of Jeroboam, that is, the sixteen years
which passed from the beginning of Uzziah&#8217;s reign to the death of
Jeroboam, he must have prophesied thirty-six years under the reign of Uzziah.
There is, however, no doubt but that he began to execute his office some years
before the end of Jeroboam&#8217;s reign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, then, there appear to be at least forty years.
Jotham succeeded his father, and reigned sixteen years; and though it be a
probable conjecture, that the beginning of his reign is to be counted from the
time he undertook the government, after his father, being smitten with leprosy,
was ejected from the society of men, it is yet probable that the remaining time
to the death of his father ought to come to our reckoning. When however, we take
for granted a few years, it must be that Hosea had prophesied more than
forty-five years before Ahab began to reign. Add now the sixteen years in which
Ahab reigned and the number will amount to sixty-one. There remain the years in
which he prophesied under the reign of Hezekiah. It cannot, then, be otherwise
but that he had followed his office more than sixty years, and probably
continued beyond the seventieth year.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears with how great and with how
invincible courage and perseverance he was endued by the Holy Spirit. But when
God employs our service for twenty or thirty years we think it very wearisome,
especially when we have to contend with wicked men, and those who do not
willingly undertake the yoke, but pertinaciously resist us; we then instantly
desire to be set free, and wish to become like soldiers who have completed their
time. When therefore, we see that this Prophet persevered for so long a time,
let him be to us an example of patience so that we may not despond, though the
Lord may not immediately free us from our burden.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus much of the four kings whom he names. He must
indeed have prophesied (as I have just shown) for nearly forty years under the
king Uzziah or Azariah, and then for some years under the king Ahab, (to omit
now the reign of Jotham, which was concurrent with that of his father,) and he
continued to the time of Hezekiah: but why has he particularly mentioned
Jeroboam the son of Joash, since he could not have prophesied under him except
for a short time? His son Zachariah succeeded him; there arose afterward the
conspiracy of Shallum, who was soon destroyed; then the kingdom became involved
in great confusion; and at length the Assyrian, by means of Shalmanazar, led
away captive the ten tribes, which became dispersed among the Medes. As this was
the case, why does the Prophet here mention only one king of Israel? This seems
strange; for he continued his office of teaching to the end of his reign and to
his death. But an answer may be easily given: He wished distinctly to express,
that he began to teach while the state was entire; for, had he prophesied after
the death of Jeroboam, he might have seemed to conjecture some great calamity
from the then present view of things: thus it would not have been prophecy, or,
at leas, this credit would have been much less. &#8220;He now, forsooth! divines
what is, evident to the eyes of all.&#8221; For Zachariah flourished but a short
time; and the conspiracy alluded to before was a certain presage of an
approaching destruction, and the kingdom became soon dissolved. Hence the
Prophet testifies here in express words, that he had already threatened future
vengeance to the people, even when the kingdom of Israel flourished in wealth
and power, when Jeroboam was enjoying his triumphs, and when prosperity
inebriated the whole land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, was the reason why the Prophet mentioned
only this one king; for under him the kingdom of Israel became strong, and was
fortified by many strongholds and a large army, and abounded also in great
riches. Indeed, sacred history tells us, that God had by Jeroboam delivered the
kingdom of Israel, though he himself was unworthy, and that he had recovered
many cities and a very wide extent of country. As, then, he had increased the
kingdom, as he had become formidable to all his neighbours, as he had collected
great riches, and as the people lived in ease and luxury, what the Prophet
declared seemed incredible. &#8220;Ye are not,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the people
of the Lord; ye are adulterous children, ye are born of fornication.&#8221; Such
a reproof certainly seemed not seasonable. Then he said, &#8220;The kingdom
shall be taken from you, destruction is nigh to you.&#8221; &#8220;What, to us?
and yet our king has now obtained so many victories, and has struck terror into
other kings.&#8221; The kingdom of Judah, which was a rival, being then nearly
broken down, there was no one who could have ventured to suspect such an
event.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive why the Prophet here says
expressly that he had prophesied under Jeroboam. He indeed prophesied after his
death, and followed his office even after the destruction of the kingdom of
Israel, but he began to teach at a time when he was a sport to the ungodly, who
exalted themselves against God, and boldly despised his threatening as long as
he spared and bore with them; which is ever the case, as proved by the constant
experience of all ages. We hence see more clearly with what power of the Spirit
God had endued the Prophet, who dared to rise up against so powerful a king, and
to reprove his wickedness, and also to summon his subjects to the same
judgement. When, therefore, the Prophet conducted himself so boldly, at a time
when the Israelites were not only sottish on account of their great success, but
also wholly insane, it was certainly nothing short of a miracle; and this ought
to avail much to establish his authority. We now then, see the design of the
inscription contained in the first verse. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here what charge was given him at
the beginning, even to declare open war with the Israelites, and to be, as it
were, very angry in the person of God, and to denounce destruction. He begins
not with smooth things, nor does he gently exhort the people to repentance, nor
adopt a circuitous course to soften the asperity of his doctrine. He shows that
he had used nothing of this kind, but says, that he had been sent like heralds
or messengers to proclaim war. The beginning, then, of what the Lord spake by
Hosea was this, &#8220;This people are an adulterous race, all are born, as it
were, of a harlot, the kingdom of Israel is the filthiest brothel; and I now
repudiate and reject them, I no longer own them as my children.&#8221; This was
no common vehemence. We hence see that the word <i>beginning</i> was not set
down without reason, but advisedly, that we may know that the Prophet, as soon
as he undertook the office of teaching, was vehement and severe, and, as it
were, fulminated against the kingdom of Israel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if it be asked, why was God so greatly
displeased? why did he not first recall the wretched men to himself, since the
usual method seems to have been, that the Prophet tried, by a kind and paternal
address, to restore those to a sound mind who had departed from the pure worship
of God, &#8212; why, then, did not God adopt this ordinary course? But we hence
gather that the diseases of the people were incurable. The Prophet, no doubt,
intimates here distinctly, that he was sent by God, when the state of things was
almost past recovery. We indeed know that God is not wont to deal so severely
with men, but when he has tried all other remedies; and this may doubtless be
easily learned from the records of Scripture. The ten tribes, immediately after
their revolt from the family of David, having renounced the worship of God,
embraced idolatry and ungodly superstitions. They ought to have retained in
their minds the recollection of this oracle,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;The Lord has chosen mount Zion,
where he has desired to be worshipped; this,&#8217; he said &#8216;is my rest
forever; here will I dwell, for I have chosen it,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:13,14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this prediction, we know, had not been once or
ten times repeated, but a hundred times, that it might be more firmly fixed in
the hearts of men. Since, then, they ought to have had this truth fully
impressed on their hearts, that the Lord would have himself worshipped nowhere
except on mount Zion, it was monstrous stupidity in them to erect a new temple
and to make the calves. That the people, then, had so quickly fallen away from
God was an instance of the most perverse madness. But, as I have said, they had
reached the highest point of impiety. When God punished so great sins by Jehu,
the people ought then to have returned to the pure worship of God, and there was
some reformation in the land; but they ever reverted to their own nature, yea,
the event proved that they only dissembled for a short time; so blinded they
were by a diabolical perverseness, that they ever continued in their
superstitions. It is not, then, to be wondered at, that the Lord made this
beginning by Hosea, &#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye are
all born of fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">, your kingdom is the
filthiest brothel; ye are not my people, ye are not beloved.&#8221; Who, then,
will not allow, that God, by fulminating in so dreadful a manner against this
people, dealt justly with them, and for the best reason? The contumacy of the
people was so indomitable that it could be overcome in no other way. We now
understand why the Prophet used this expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The beginning of speaking which
God made</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then it follows, <i>in
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hosea</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He had said in the first verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of Jehovah which was to
Hosea</i></font><font face="Palatino">; he now says,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[&ccedil;whn</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
beusho</i>, in Hosea; and he adds God spake and said to Hosea, repeating the
preposition used in the first verse. The word of the Lord is said to have been
to Hosea, not simply because God addressed the Prophet, but because he sent him
forth with certain commissions, for in this sense is the word of God said to
have been to the Prophets. God addresses his word also indiscriminately to
others whomsoever he is pleased to teach by his word, but he speaks to and
addresses his Prophets in a peculiar way, for he makes them the ministers and
heralds of his word, and puts, as it were, into their mouth what they afterwards
bring forth to the people. So Christ says, that the word of God came to kings,
because he constitutes and appoints them to govern mankind. &#8220;If he calls
them gods,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to whom the word of God came;&#8221; and that
psalm, we know, was written with a special reference to kings. We now perceive
what this sentence in the first verse contains.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of God came to
Hosea</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the Lord did not simply address the
Prophet in a common way, but furnished him with instructions, that he might
afterwards teach the people, as it were, in the person of God
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added in the second verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The beginning
of</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaking, such as the Lord made
by Hosea</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They who give this rendering,
&#8220;with Hosea,&#8221; seem to explain the Prophet&#8217;s meaning frigidly.
The letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth</i>, I know, has this sense often in Scripture; but the Prophet, no
doubt, in this place represents himself as the instrument of the Holy Spirit.
God then spake <i>in Hosea</i>, or by Hosea, for he brought forth nothing from
his own brain, but God spake by him; this is a form of speaking with which we
shall often meet. On this, indeed, depends the whole authority of God&#8217;s
servants that they give not themselves loose reins, but faithfully deliver, as
it were, from hand to hand, what the Lord has commanded them, without adding any
thing whatever of their own. God then spake in Hosea. It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord said to
Hosea</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8221; Now this, which is said the third
time, or three times repeated, is nothing else than the commission in different
forms. He first said in general, &#8220;The word of the Lord which was to
Hosea;&#8221; now he says, <i>The Lord spake thus,</i> and he expresses
distinctly what the word was which he referred to in the first
verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take to thee a wife of
wantonness, and the</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of
wantonness</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and the reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
by</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fornicating, or wantoning, has
the land grown wanton</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He doubtless speaks here
of the vices which the Lord had long endured with inexpressible forbearance.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By wantoning then has the land
grown wanton, that it should not follow Jehovah.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here interpreters labour much, because it seems very
strange that the Prophet should take a harlot for a wife. Some say that this was
an extraordinary case. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Certainly such a license could not have been borne in a teacher. We see what
Paul requires in a bishop, and no doubt the same was required formerly in the
Prophets, that their families should be chaste and free from every stain and
reproach. It would have then exposed the Prophet to the scorn of all, if he had
entered a brothel and taken to himself a harlot; for he speaks not here of an
unchaste woman only, but of a woman of wantonness, which means a common harlot,
for a woman of wantonness is she called, who has long habituated herself to
wantonness, who has exposed herself to all, to gratify the wish of all, who has
prostituted herself, not once nor twice, nor to few men, but to all. That this
was done by the Prophet seems very improbable. But some reply as I have said,
that this ought not to be regarded as a common rule, for it was an extraordinary
command of God. And yet it seems not consistent with reason, that the Lord
should thus gratuitously render his Prophet contemptible; for how could he
expect to be received on coming abroad before the public, after having brought
on himself such a disgrace? If he had married a wife such as is here described,
he ought to have concealed himself for life rather than to undertake the
Prophetic office. Their opinion, therefore, is not probable, who think that the
Prophet had taken such a wife as is here described.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then another reason, utterly unresolvable, militates
against them; for the Prophet is not only bidden to take a wife of wantonness,
but also children of wantonness, begotten by whoredom. It is, therefore, the
same as if he himself had committed whoredom. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  For if
we say that he married a wife who had previously conducted herself with some
indecency and want of chastity, (as Jerome at length argues in order to excuse
the Prophet,) the excuse is frivolous, for he speaks not only of the wife, but
also of the children, inasmuch as God would have the whole offspring to be
adulterous, and this could not be the case in a lawful marriage. Hence almost
all the Hebrews agree in this opinion, that the Prophet did not actually marry a
wife, but that he was bidden to do this in a vision. And we shall see in the
third chapter
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
3:1) almost the same thing described; and yet what is narrated there could not
have been actually done, for the Prophet is bidden to marry a wife who had
violated her conjugal fidelity, and after having bought her, to retain her at
home for a time. This, we know, was not done. It then follows that this was a
representation exhibited to the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some object and say, that the whole passage, as given
by the Prophet, cannot be understood as relating a vision. Why not? For the
vision, they say, was given to him alone, and God had a regard to the whole
people rather than to the Prophet. But it may be, and it is probable, that no
vision was presented to the Prophet, but that God only ordered him to proclaim
what had been given him in charge. When, therefore, the Prophet began to teach,
he commenced somewhat in this way: &#8220;The Lord places me here as on a stage,
to make known to you that I have married a wife, a wife habituated to adulteries
and whoredoms, and that I have begotten children by her.&#8221; The whole people
knew that he had done no such thing; but the Prophet spake thus in order to set
before their eyes a vivid representation. Such then, was the vision, a
figurative exhibition, not that the Prophet knew this by a vision, but the Lord
had bidden him to relate this parable, (so to speak,) or this similitude, that
the people might see, as in a living portraiture, their turpitude and
perfidiousness. It is, in short, an exhibition, in which the thing itself is not
only set forth in words, but is also placed, as it were, before their eyes in a
visible form. The reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for by wantoning has the land
grown wanton</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how the words of the Prophet ought to
be understood; for he assumed a character, when going forth before the public,
and in this character he said to the people, that God had bidden him to take a
harlot for his wife, and to beget adulterous children by her. His ministry was
not on this account made contemptible, for they all knew that he had ever lived
virtuously and temperately; they all knew that his household was exempt from
every reproach; but here he exhibited in his assumed character, as it were, a
living image of the baseness of the people. This is the meaning, and I see
nothing strained in this explanation; and we, at the same time, see the meaning
of this clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By wantoning has
the</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>land grown
wanton.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hosea might have said this in one word,
but he had to address the deaf, and we know how great and how stupid is the
madness of those who delight themselves in their own superstitions, they cannot
bear any reproof. The Prophet then would not have been attended to, unless he
had exhibited, as in a mirror before their eyes, what he wished to be understood
by them, as though he had said, &#8220;If none of you can so know himself as to
own his public baseness, if ye are all so obstinate against God, at least know
now by my assumed character, that you are all adulterous, and derive your origin
from a filthy brothel, for God declares thus concerning you; and as you are not
willing to receive such a declaration, it is now set before you in my assumed
character.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it should not follow
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, literally, <i>From after Jehovah</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrjam</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meachri</i>. We here see what is the spiritual chastity of God&#8217;s
people, and what also is the signification of the word wantoning. Then the
spiritual chastity of God&#8217;s people is to follow the Lord; and what else is
this to follow, but to suffer ourselves to be ruled by his word, and willingly
to obey him, to be ready and prepared for any work to which he may call us? When
then the Lord goes before us with his instruction and shows the way, and we
become teachable and obedient, and look up to him, and turn not aside, either to
the right or to the left hand, but bring our whole life to the obedience of
faith, &#8212; this is really to follow the Lord; and it is a most beautiful
definition of the spiritual chastity of God&#8217;s people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we may also, from the opposite of this, learn
what it is to grow wanton; we do so when we depart from the word of the Lord,
when we give ear to false doctrines, when we abandon ourselves to superstitions;
when we, in short, wander after our own devices, and keep not our thoughts under
the authority of the word of the Lord. But as to the word wantoning, more will
be said in chapter 2; but I only wished now briefly to touch on what the Prophet
means when he chides the Israelites for having all become wanton. Now follows
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast

goodness, nor abuse this thine incredible forbearance, but submit ourselves in
obedience to thee; that whenever thou mayest severely chastise us, we may bear

<div><font face="Palatino">WE said in yesterday&#8217;s Lecture, that God
ordered his Prophet to take a wife of whoredoms, but that this was not actually
done; for what other effect could it have had, but to render the Prophet
contemptible to all? and thus his authority would have been reduced to nothing.
But God only meant to show to the Israelites by such a representation, that they
vaunted themselves without reason; for they had nothing worthy of praise, but
were in every way ignominious. It is then said, Hosea <i>went and took </i>to
himself <i>Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim</i>.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rmg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Gomer</i>, means in Hebrew, to fail; and sometimes it signifies actively, to
consume; and hence <i>Gomer</i> means consumption. But <i>Diblaim</i> are masses
of figs, or dry figs reduced to a mass. The Greeks call them
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">palaqav</font><font face="Palatino">.
The Cabalists say here that the wife of Hosea was called by this name, because
they who are much given to wantonness at length fall into death and corruption.
So consumption is the daughter of figs, for by figs they understand the
sweetness of lusts. But it will be more simple to say, that this representation
was exhibited to the people, that the Prophet set before them, instead of a
wife, consumption, the daughter of figs; that is, that he laid before them
masses of figs or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">palaqav</font><font face="Palatino">,
representing Gomer, which means consumption and that he adopted a similar manner
with mathematicians, when they describe their figures, &#8212; &#8220;If this be
so much, then that is so much.&#8221; We may then thus understand the passage,
that the Prophet here named for his wife the corrupt masses of figs; so that she
was consumption or putrefaction, born of figs, reduced into such masses. For I
still persist in the opinion I expressed yesterday, that the Prophet did not
enter a brothel to take a wife to himself: for otherwise he must have begotten
bastards, and not legitimate children; for, as it was said yesterday, the case
with the wife and the children was the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the true meaning of this verse
to be, that the Prophet did not marry a harlot, but only exhibited her before
the eyes of the people as though she were corruption, born of putrified masses
of figs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows, the wife
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conceived</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8212; the imaginary one, the wife as represented and exhibited. She
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conceived</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and bare a son: then
said Jehovah to him, Call his name Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Many render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la[rzy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Izroal</i>, dispersions and follow the Chaldean paraphraser. They also think
that this ambiguous term contains some allusion; for as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zaro</i> is seed, they suppose that the Prophet indirectly glances at the
vain boasting of the people; for they called themselves the chosen seed, because
they had been planted by the Lord; hence the name Jezreel. But the Prophet here,
according to these interpreters, exposes this folly to contempt; as though he
said, &#8220;Ye are Israel; but in another respect, ye are dispersion: for as
the seed is cast in various directions so the Lord will scatter you, and thus
destroy and cast you away. You think yourselves to have been planted in this
land, and to have a standing from which you can never be shaken or torn away;
but the Lord will, with his own hand, lay hold on you to cast you away to the
remotest regions of the world.&#8221; This sense is what many interpreters give;
nor do I deny but that the Prophet alludes to the words sowing and seed; with
this I disagree not: only it seems to me that the Prophet looks farther, and
intimates that they were wholly degenerate, not the true nor the genuine
offspring of Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, as we see, much affinity between the names
<i>Jezreel</i> and <i>Israel</i>. How honourable is the name, Israel, it is
evident from its etymology; and we also know that it was given from above to the
holy father Jacob. God, then, the bestower of this name, procured by his own
authority, that those called Israelites should be superior to others: and then
we must remember the reason why Jacob was called Israel; for he had a contest
with God, and overcame in the struggle,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;013228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:28.) Hence the posterity of Abraham gloried that they were Israelites. And
the prophet Isaiah also glances at this arrogance, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Come ye who are
called by the name of
Israel,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
48:1;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">as though he said, &#8220;Ye are Israelites, but only
as to the title, for the reality exists not in you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to our Hosea.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Call</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his name
Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though he said, &#8220;They call themselves Israelites; but I will show, by a
little change in the word, that they are degenerate and spurious, for they are
Jezreelites rather than Israelites.&#8221; And it appears that Jezreel wag the
metropolis of the kingdom in the time of Ahab, and where also that great
slaughter was made by Jehu, which is related in 2 Kings:10. We now perceive the
meaning of the Prophet to be, that the whole kingdom had degenerated from its
first beginning, and could no longer be deemed as including the race of Abraham;
for the people had, by their own perfidy, fallen from that honour, and lost
their first name. God then, by way of contempt, calls them Jezreelites, and not
Israelites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A reason afterwards follows which confines this view,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For yet a little while, and I
will visit the slaughters of Jezreel upon the house of
Jehu</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here interpreters labour not a little,
because it seems strange that God should visit the slaughter made by Jehu, which
yet he had approved; nay, Jehu did nothing thoughtlessly, but knew that he was
commanded to execute that vengeance. He was, therefore, God&#8217;s legitimate
minister; and why is what God commanded imputed to him now as a crime? This
reasoning has driven some interpreters to take &#8220;bloods&#8221; here for
wicked deeds in general: &#8216;I will avenge the sins of Jezreel upon the house
of Jehu.&#8217; Some say, &#8220;I will avenge the slaughter of Naboth:&#8221;
but this is wholly absurd, nor can it suit the place, for, &#8220;upon the house
of Jehu,&#8221; is distinctly expressed; and God did not visit the slaughter on
the house of Jehu, but on the house of Ahab. But they who are thus embarrassed
do not consider what the Prophet has in view. For God, when he wished Jehu with
his drawn sword to destroy the whole house of Ahab, had this end as his object,
&#8212; that Jehu should restore pure worship, and cleanse the land from all
defilements. Jehu then was stirred up by the Spirit of God, that he might
re-establish God&#8217;s pure worship. When a defender of religion, how did he
act? He became contented with his prey. After having seized on the kingdom for
himself, he confirmed idolatry and every abomination. He did not then spend his
labour for God. Hence that slaughter with regard to Jehu was robbery; with
regard to God it was a just revenge. this view ought to satisfy us as to the
explanation of this passage; and I bring nothing but what the Holy Scripture
contains. For after Jehu seemed to burn with zeal for God, he soon proved that
there was nothing sincere in his heart; for he embraced all the superstitions
which previously prevailed in the kingdom of Israel. In short, the reformation
under Jehu was like that under Henry King of England; who, when he saw that he
could not otherwise shake off the yoke of the Roman Antichrist than by some
disguise, pretended great zeal for a time: he afterwards raged cruelly against
all the godly, and doubled (<i>duplicavit</i> &#8212; duplicated) the tyranny of
the Roman Pontiff: and such was Jehu.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we duly consider what was done by Henry, it was
indeed an heroic velour to deliver his kingdom from the hardest of tyrannies:
but yet, with regard to him, he was certainly worse than all the other vassals
of the Roman Antichrist; for they who continue under that bondage, retain at
least some kind of religion; but he was restrained by no shame from men, and
proved himself wholly void of every fear towards God. He was a monster, (<i>homo
belluinus</i> &#8212; a beastly man)and such was Jehu.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will avenge the slaughters of
Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> upon the house of Jehu, it is no matter
of wonder. How so? For it was the highest honour to him, that God anointed him
king, that he, who was of a low family, was chosen a king by the Lord. He ought
then to have stretched every nerve to restore God&#8217;s pure worship, and to
destroy all superstitions. This he did not; on the contrary, he confirmed them.
He was then a robber, and as to himself, no minister of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the whole then is this: &#8220;Ye are
not Israelites, (there is here only an ambiguity as to the pronunciation of one
letter,) but Jezreelites;&#8221; which means, &#8220;Ye are not the descendants
of Jacob, but Jezreelites;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Ye are a degenerate people,
and differ nothing from king Ahab. He was accursed, and under him the kingdom
became accursed. Are ye changed? Is there any reformation? Since then ye are
obstinate in your wickedness, though ye proudly claim the name of Jacob, ye are
yet unworthy of such an honour. I therefore call you
Jezreelites.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For yet a little while, and I
will visit the slaughters upon the house of
Jehu</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God now shows that the people were
destitute of all glory. But they thought that the memory of all sins had been
buried since the time that the house of Ahab had been cut off. &#8220;Why? I
will avenge these slaughters,&#8221; saith the Lord. It is customary, we know,
with hypocrites, after having punished one sin, to think that all things are
lawful to them, and to wish to be thus discharged before God. A thief will
punish a murder, but he himself will commit many murders. He thinks himself
redeemed, because he has paid God the price in punishing one man; but he lets go
others, who have been his accomplices, and he himself hesitates not to commit
many unjust murders. Since, then, hypocrites thus mock God, the Prophet now
justly shakes off such senselessness, and
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, I will avenge these
slaughters.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Do ye think it a deed worthy
of praise in Jehu, to destroy and root out the house of Ahab? I indeed commanded
it to be done but he turned the vengeance enjoined on him to another end.&#8221;
How so? Because he became a robber; for he did not punish the sins of Ahab,
because he did the same himself to the end of life, and continued to do the same
in his posterity, for Jeroboam was the fourth from him in the kingdom.
&#8220;Since, then, Jehu did not change the condition of the country, and ye
have ever been obstinate in your wickedness, I will avenge these
slaughters.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage; for it shows that it is
not enough, nay, that it is of no moment, that a man should conduct himself
honourably before men, except he possesses also an upright and sincere heart. He
then who punishes evil deeds in others, ought himself to abstain from them, and
to measure the same justice to himself as he does to others; for he who takes to
himself a liberty to sin, and yet punishes others, provokes against himself the
wrath of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the true sense of this sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will avenge the slaughters of
Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to be this, that he would avenge the
slaughters made in the valley of Jezreel on the house of Jehu. It is added
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will abolish the kingdom of
the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The house of Israel he
calls that which had separated from the family of David, as though he said,
&#8220;This is a separated house.&#8221; God had indeed joined the whole people
together, and they became one body. It was torn asunder under Jeroboam. This was
God&#8217;s dreadful judgement; for it was the same as if the people, like a
torn body, had been cut into two parts. But God, however, had hitherto preserved
these two parts, as though they were but one body, and would have become the
Redeemer of both people, had not a base defection followed. And the Israelites
having become, as it were, putrified, so as now to be no part of his chosen
people, our Prophet, by way of contempt and reproach, rightly calls them the
house of Israel. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse was intentionally added; for the
Israelites were so inflated with their present good fortune, that they laughed
at the judgement denounced. They indeed knew that they were well furnished with
arms, and men, and money; in short, they thought themselves in every way
unassailable. Hence the Prophet declares, that all this could not prevent God
from punishing them. &#8220;Ye are,&#8221; he says, &#8220;inflated with pride;
ye set up your velour against God, thinking yourselves strong in arms and in
power; and because ye are military men, ye think that God can do nothing; and
yet your bows cannot restrain his hand from destroying you. But when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will break the
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he mentions a part for the whole; for
under one sort he comprehends every kind of arms. But as to what the Prophet had
in view, we see that his only object was to break down their false confidence;
for the Israelites thought that they should not be exposed to the destruction
which Hosea had predicted; for they were dazzled with their own power, and
thought themselves beyond the reach of any danger, while they were so well
fortified on every side. Hence the Prophet says, that all their fortresses would
be nothing against God; for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
that day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, when the ripe time for vengeance
shall come, the Lord will break all their bows, he will tear in pieces all their
arms, and reduce to nothing their power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are here warned ever to take heed, lest any thing
should lead us to a torpid state when God threatens us. Though we may have
strength, though fortune (so to speak) may smile on us, though, in a word, the
whole world should combine to secure our safety, yet there is no reason why we
should felicitate ourselves, when God declares himself opposed to and angry with
us. Why so? Because, as he can preserve us when unarmed whenever he pleases, so
he can spoil us of all our arms, and reduce our power to nothing. Let this verse
then come to our minds whenever God terrifies us by his threatening; and what it
teaches us is, that he can take away all the defences in which we vainly
trust.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as Jezreel was the metropolis of the kingdom,
the Prophet distinctly mentions the
place</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">, <i>I will break in pieces the
bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that
is, the Lord sees what sort of fortress there is in Samaria, in Jezreel; but he
will make an end of you there, in the very midst of the land. Ye think that you
have there a place of safety and a firm position; but the Lord will bring you to
nothing even in the valley of Jezreel. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows in this verse that things were
become worse and worse in the kingdom of Israel, that they sinned, keeping
within no limits, that they rushed headlong into the extremes of impiety. He has
already told us, by calling them Jezreelites, that they were from the beginning
rejected and degenerate; as though he said, &#8220;Your origin has nothing
commendable in it; ye think yourselves to be very eminent, because ye derive
your descent from holy Jacob; but ye are spurious children, born of a harlot: a
brothel is not the house of Abraham, nor is the house of Abraham a brothel. Ye
are then the offspring of debauchery.&#8221; But he now goes farther and says,
that as time advanced, they had ever been falling into a worse state; for this
word, Loruchamah, is a more disgraceful name than Jezreel: and the Lord also
denounces here his vengeance more openly, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will no more add to pursue with
mercy the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rechem</i>, means to pity, and also to love: but this second meaning is
derived from the other; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rechem</i>, is not simply to love, but to show gratuitous favour. By calling
the daughter, then, Lo-ruchamah, God intimates that his favour was now taken
away from the people. We know, indeed, that the people had been freely chosen;
for if the cause of adoption be inquired for, it must be said to have been the
mere mercy and goodness of God. Now then God, in repudiating the people, says,
&#8220;Ye are like a daughter whom her father casts away and disowns, because he
deems her unworthy of his favour.&#8221; We now, then, comprehend the design of
the Prophet; for, after having shown the Israelites to have been from the
beginning spurious, and not the true children of Abraham, he now adds, that, in
course of time, they had become so corrupt, that God would now utterly disown
them, and would no longer deem them as his house. He, therefore, charges them
with something more grievous than before, by saying, &#8216;Call this daughter
Lo-ruchamah;&#8217; for she was born after Jezreel. Here he describes by degrees
the state of the people, that it continually degenerated. Though they were at
the beginning depraved; but they were now, after the lapse of some time, utterly
unworthy of God&#8217;s favour.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will no more
add,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to pursue with favour the house
of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God here shows what constant
forbearance he had exercised towards this people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will no more
add</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says; as though the Lord had said,
&#8220;I do not now sally forth at the first heat of wrath to take vengeance on
you, as passionate men are wont to do, who seize the sword as soon as any
affront is given; I become not so suddenly hot with anger. I have, therefore,
hitherto borne with you; but now your obstinacy is intolerable; I will not then
bear with you any more.&#8221; The Prophet, as we see, evidently intimates that
the Israelites had very long abused the Lord&#8217;s mercy, while he spared
them, so that now the ripe time of vengeance had come; for the Lord had, for
many years showed his favour to them, though they never ceased at any time to
seek destruction to themselves. Hence we learn, as stated yesterday, that the
Prophet&#8217;s vehemence was not hasty: for God had before given warnings, more
than sufficient, to the Israelites; he had also forgiven them many sins; he had
borne with them until the state of things proved that they were altogether
incurable. Since, then, the forbearance of God produced no effect on them, it
was necessary to come to this last remedy, that the Lord should, as it were,
with a drawn sword, appear as a judge to take vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;hl a&ccedil;a aw&ccedil;n
yk</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ki neshua asha lem</i>. This sentence is
variously explained. Some think that the verb is derived from the root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nesche</i>, with a final
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>he</i>; which means &#8220;to forget&#8221;, as though it was said &#8220;By
forgetting, I will forget them;&#8221; and the sense is not unsuitable. The
Chaldean paraphraser wholly departs from this meaning, for he renders the
clause, &#8220;By sparing, I will spare them.&#8221; There is no reason for
this; for God, as the context clearly shows, does not yet promise pardon to
them; this meaning, then, cannot stand. They come nearer to the design of the
Prophet who thus translate, &#8220;I will bring to them,&#8221; that is, the
enemy; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nesha</i>, signifies to take, and also to bring into the middle. But I prefer
embracing their opinion who consider that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;hl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lem</i>, is placed here for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;twa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>autem</i>; for the servile letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed</i>, has often the same meaning with the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>at</i>, which is prefixed to an objective case. Then the rendering is,
literally given, &#8220;For, by taking away, I will take them away:&#8221; and
the Hebrews often use this mode of speaking, and the sense is plainer, &#8220;By
taking away, I will take them away.&#8221; Some render the passage, &#8220;I
will burn them;&#8221; but this explanation is rather harsh. I am satisfied with
the meaning, to take, but I understand it in the sense of taking away. Then it
is, &#8220;By taking away, I will take them away.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what the following verse confirms; for
when the Prophet speaks of the house of Judah, the Lord says, &#8220;With mercy
will I follow the house of Judah, and will save them.&#8221; The Prophet sets
&#8220;to save&#8221; and &#8220;to take away&#8221; in opposition the one to
the other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may then learn by the context what he meant by
these words, and that is, that Israel had hitherto stood through the
Lord&#8217;s mercy; as though he said, &#8220;How has it happened that ye
continue as yet alive? Do you think yourselves to be safe through your own
valour? Nay, my mercy has hitherto preserved you. Now, then, when I shall
withdraw my favour from you, your ruin will be inevitable; you must necessarily
perish, and be brought to nothing: for as I have hitherto preserved you, so I
will utterly tear you away and destroy you.&#8221; A profitable lesson may be
farther gathered from this passage, and that is, that hypocrites deceive
themselves when they boast of the present favour of God, and, at the same time,
exult without any fear against him; for as God for a time spares and tolerates
them, so he can justly destroy and reduce them to nothing. But the next verse
must be also joined.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse sufficiently proves what I said yesterday,
that the Prophet was specifically appointed to the kingdom of Israel; for he
seems here to speak favourably of the Jews, who yet, we know, had been severely
and deservedly reproved by their own teachers. For what does Isaiah say, after
having spoken of the dreadful corruptions which then prevailed in the kingdom of
Israel? &#8216;Come,&#8217; he says, &#8216;into the house of Judah, they at
least continue as yet pure: there,&#8217; he says, &#8216;all the tables are
full of vomiting; they are drunken; there reigns also the contempt of God and
all impiety,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:8.) We see then that the Jews were not a virtuous people, of whom the Prophet
has spoken so honourably. For though the exterior worship of God continued at
Jerusalem, and the temple, at least under Uzziah and Jotham, was free from every
superstition, and also under king Hezekiah; yet the morals of the people, we
know, were very corrupt. Avarice, and cruelty, and every kind of fraud, reigned
there, and also filthy lusts. The conduct, then, of that people was nothing
better than that of the Israelites. Why, then, does the Prophet dignify them
with so great an honour as to exempt them from God&#8217;s vengeance? Because he
had an eye to the people to whom he was appointed a Prophet. He therefore
institutes a comparison. He interferes not with the Jews, for he knew that they
had faithful pastors who reproved their sins; but he continued among his own
hearers. But this comparison served, in an especial manner, to touch the hearts
of the people of Israel; for the Prophet, we know, made this reference
particularly for this end, to condemn fictitious worship. He now sets the
worship at Jerusalem in opposition to all those superstitions which Jeroboam
first introduced, which Ahab increased, and all their posterity followed. Hence
he says, &#8220;I will show favour&#8221; to the house of
Judas.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That we may better understand the mind of the
Prophet, it may be well to repeat what we said yesterday: &#8212; The kingdom of
Judah was then miserably wasted. The kingdom of Israel had ten tribes, the
kingdom of Judah only one and a half, and it was also diminished by many
slaughters; yea, the Israelites had spoiled the temple of the Lord, and had
taken all the gold and silver they found there. The Jews, then, had been reduced
to a very low state, they hardly dared to mutter; but the Israelites, as our
Prophet will hereafter tell us, were like beasts well fed. Since, then, they
despised the Jews, who seemed despicable in the eyes of the world, the Prophet
beats down this vain confidence, and
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, With mercy will I follow
the house of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> &#8220;The house of
Judah seems now to be almost nothing, for they are few in number, nor are they
very strong, and wealth abounds not among them as among you; but with them shall
dwell my favour, and I will take it away from you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will save them by Jehovah
their God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Salvation is here set in opposition
to the destruction which the Prophet mentioned in the last verse. But Hosea
shows that salvation depends not in the least either on arms or on any of the
intervenients  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, as they
say, of this world; but has its foundation only on God&#8217;s favour.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will save
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says &#8212; why?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because my favour will I show
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This connection ought to be
carefully noticed. Where the Lord&#8217;s favour is, there is life. &#8216;Thou
art our God, then we shall never perish,&#8217; as it is written in the first
chapter of Habakkuk. Hence the Prophet here connects salvation with God&#8217;s
gratuitous favour; for we cannot continue safe, but as long as God is propitious
to us. He has, on the other hand, declared that it would be all over with the
Israelites as soon as God would take away from them his favour.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By Jehovah their
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> An antithesis is to be understood here
between the false gods and Jehovah, who was the God of the house of Judah. It is
the same as though the Prophet said, &#8220;Ye indeed profess the name of God,
but ye worship the devil and not God: for ye have nothing to do with Jehovah,
with the God who is the creator and maker of heaven and earth; for he dwells in
his own temple; he pledged his faith to David, when he commanded him to build a
temple for him on mount Zion; he dwells there between the cherubim, as the
Prophets invariably declare: but the true God is become exiled from you.&#8221;
We hence see how he condemns here all the worship which the Israelites then so
highly valued. Why did he do so? Because it was not acceptable to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage deserves to be noticed, for we see
how stupid men are in this respect. When once they are persuaded that they
worship God, they are seized by some fascination of Satan so as to become
delighted with all their own dotages, as we see to be the case at this day with
the Papists, who are not only insane, but doubly frantic. If any one reproves
them and says, that they worship not the true God, they are instantly on fire
&#8212; &#8220;What! does not God accept our worship?&#8221; But the Prophet
here shows by one word that Jehovah is not in any place, except where he is
rightly worshipped according to the rule of his word. I will save them, he says
&#8212; How? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By Jehovah their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and God himself speaks: He might
have said, &#8220;I will save them by myself;&#8221; but it was not without
reason that he used this circuitous mode of speaking; it was to show the
Israelites that they had no reason to think that God would be propitious to
them. How so? Because God had chosen an habitation for himself on mount Zion and
in Jerusalem. A fuller declaration afterwards follows, I will save them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither by the bow, nor by the
sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by
horsemen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But this clause, by
God&#8217;s favour, I will explain tomorrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we were
from our beginning lost, when thou wert pleased to extend to us thy hand, and to
restore us to salvation for the sake of thy Son; and that as we continue even
daily to run headlong to our own ruin, &#8212; O grant that we may not, by
sinning so often, so provoke at length thy displeasure as to cause thee to take
away from us the mercy which thou hast hitherto exercised towards us, and
through which thou hast adopted us: but by thy Spirit destroy the wickedness of
our heart, and restore us to a sound mind, that we may ever cleave to thee with
a true and sincere heart, that being fortified by thy defence, we may continue
safe even amidst all kinds of danger, until at length thou gatherest us into
that blessed rest, which has been prepared for us in heaven by our Lord Jesus
Christ. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE

<div><font face="Palatino">We have to explain first this clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will save the house of Judah
neither by the bow, nor by the sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by
horsemen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What the Prophet had touched upon
before is here more clearly expressed, and that is, that God has no need of
foreign aids, for he is content with his own power. But Hosea continues his
contrast; for the people of Israel, as they possessed much carnal power, thought
themselves, as they say, beyond the reach of darts: but the kingdom of Judah was
exposed to all dangers, as it was not powerful in forces and arms. This folly
the Prophet exposes to contempt, and says, that safety is dependent on God
alone, that men in vain trust in their own velour, and that there is no reason
why the needy and destitute should despair of their safety, as God alone is
abundantly sufficient to preserve the faithful. The meaning then is, that though
the destitute condition of the kingdom of Judah was an object of contempt to
all, yet this would be no obstacle, that it should not be preserved through
God&#8217;s favour, though it obtained no aid from men. And let us learn from
this place, that we are not so preserved by the Lord, that he never employs any
natural means; and further, that when he has no recourse to them, he is
abundantly sufficient to secure our safety. We ought then so to ascribe our
safety to the Lord as not to think that any thing comes to us through ourselves,
or through angels, or through men. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>weaning</i> the Prophet mentions here is by
some understood allegorically; as though he said, that the people would for a
time be deprived of prophecies, and of the priesthood, and of other spiritual
gifts: but this is frigid. The Prophet here, I have no doubt, sets forth the
patience of God towards that people. The Lord then, before he had utterly cast
away the Israelites, waited patiently for their repentance, if, indeed, there
was any hope for it; but when he found them be ever like themselves, he then at
length proceeded to the last punishment. Hence Hosea says, that the daughter,
who was the second child, was weaned; as though he said, that the people of
Israel had not been suddenly cast away, for God had with long patience borne
with them, and thus suspended heavier judgement, until, having found their
wickedness to be unhealable, he at length commenced what follows, <i>Call</i>
the third child Lo-ammi.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason is added
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye are not my people, and I
will not hereafter be yours.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">This, as I have
said, is the final disowning of them. They had been before called Jezreelites,
and then by the name of the daughter God testified that he was alienated from
them; but now the third name is still more grievous,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye are not my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for God here abolishes, in a
manner, the covenant he made with the holy fathers, so that the people would
cease to have any pre- eminence over other nations. So then the Israelites were
reduced to a condition in which they differed nothing from the profane Gentiles;
and thus God wholly disinherited them. The Prophet, doubtless, was not well
received, when he denied them to be God&#8217;s people, who had yet descended
from Abraham according to the flesh, who had ever been so accounted, and who
continued proudly to boast of their election.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us hence learn, that those awfully mistake
who are blind to their own vices, because God spares and indulges them. For we
must ever remember what I have said before, that the kingdom of Israel was then
opulent; and yet the Prophet denies them, who flourished in strength, and power,
and riches, to be God&#8217;s people. There is then no reason for hypocrites to
felicitate themselves in prosperity; but they ought, on the contrary, to have
regard to God&#8217;s judgement. But though these, as we see to be the case,
heedlessly despise God, yet this passage reminds us carefully to beware lest we
abuse the present favours of God. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows consolation, yet not unmixed. God seems
here to meet the objections which we know hypocrites had in readiness, whenever
the Prophets denounced destruction on them; for they accused God of being
unfaithful if he did not save them. Arrogating to themselves the title of
Church, they concluded that it would be impossible for them to perish for God
would not be untrue in his promises. &#8220;Why! God has promised that his
Church shall be for ever: we are his Church; then we are safe, for God cannot
deny himself.&#8221; In what they took as granted they were deceived; for though
they usurped the title of Church, they were yet alienated from God. We see that
the Papists swell with this pride at this day. To excuse all their errors they
set up against us this shield, &#8220;Christ promised to be with his own to the
end of the world. Can the spouse desert his Church? Can the Son of God, who is
the eternal Truth of the Father, fail in his faithfulness?&#8221; The Papists
magnificently extol the faithfulness of Christ, that they may bind him to
themselves: but at the same time, they consider not that they are covenant
breakers; they consider not that they are manifestly the enemies of God; they
consider not that they have divorced themselves from him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, therefore seeing that he had to do with
proud men, who were wont to arraign the justice of God, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The number of the children of
Israel shall be as the sand of the sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, &#8220;When the Lord shall cut you off, still safe will remain this
promise which was given to Abraham;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Look at the stars
of heaven, number, if thou can&#8217;t, the sand of the sea; so shall thy seed
be,&#8217;&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
22:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed know, that whenever the Prophets severely
reproved the people and denounced destruction, this was ever opposed to them,
&#8220;What! can it be that the Lord will destroy us? What would then become of
this promise, Thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the
sea?&#8221; Hence the Prophet here checks this vain-confidence, by which
hypocrites supported themselves against all threatening, &#8220;Though God may
cut you off, he will yet continue true and faithful to the promise, that
Abraham&#8217;s seed shall be innumerable as the sand of the
sea.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I indeed admit that the Prophet here gave hope of
salvation to the faithful; for it is certain that there were some remaining in
the kingdom of Israel. Though the whole body had revolted, yet God, as it was
said to Elijah, had preserved to himself some seed. The Prophet then was
unwilling to leave the faithful, who remained among that lost people, without
hope of salvation; but, at the same time, he had regard to hypocrites, as we
have already stated. We now see the design of the Prophet, for he teaches that
there would be such a vengeance as he had spoken of, though God would not yet be
forgetful of his word; he teaches that there would be such a casting away of the
people, though God&#8217;s election would yet remain firm and unchangeable; in
short, he teaches that the adoption by which God had chosen the offspring of
Abraham as his people would not be void. This is the import of the whole. Then
the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which is
not to be measured nor numbered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in the place
where it had been said to them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> (shall
be said, literally,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye are not
my people; there it shall be said, Ye are the sons of the living
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It has been asked, whether this
prophecy belongs to the posterity of those who had been dispersed. This, indeed,
would be strange; for so long a time has passed away since their exile, and
dejected and broken, they dwell at this day in mountains and in other desert
places; at least many of them are in the mountains of Armenia, some are in Media
and Chaldea; in short, throughout the whole of the East. And since there has
been no restoration of this people, it is certain that this prophecy ought not
to be restricted to seed according to the flesh. For there was a prescribed time
for the Jews, when the Lord purposed to restore them to their country; and, at
the end of seventy years, a free return was granted them by Cyrus. Then Hosea
speaks not here of the kingdom of Israel, but of the Church, which was to be
restored by a return, composed both of Jews and of Gentiles. So Paul, a fit
interpreter of this passage, reminds us,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Whom he has called, not only of
the Jews, but also of the Gentiles; as he says by Hosea, I will call a people,
who were not mine, my people; and her beloved, who was not beloved: and it shall
be, where it had been said to them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be
called the sons of the living God,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
9:24, etc.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul applies this passage, and that rightly, to the
whole body of the faithful, collected without any difference, from the Jews as
well as from the Gentiles: for otherwise, as we have said, the correctness and
truth of prophecy would not be evident: and this view also agrees best with the
design of the Prophet which I have just explained. For, since hypocrites in a
manner tie to themselves the power of God, the Prophet says, that God can, if he
chooses, raise up in an instant a new Church, which would exceed in number the
sand of the sea. How so? God will create a Church for himself. From what? From
stones, from nothing: for, as Paul says elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;he calls those
things which are not, as though they
were,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
4:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, God, as it has been said, by his
goodness contended with the wickedness of that people; for though they rejected
his favour, yea, and obstinately thrust it away from themselves, yet such
perverseness did not hinder the Lord from preserving a remnant for
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this passage teaches, that they are very
perverted in their notions, who, by their own feelings, form a judgement of the
state of the Church, and accuse God of being unfaithful, when its external
appearance does not correspond with their opinion. So the Papists think; for
except they see the splendour of great pomp, they conclude that no Church
remains in the world. But God at one time so diminishes the Church, that it
seems to be almost reduced to nothing; at another time, he increases and
multiplies it beyond all hope, after having raised it, as it were, from death.
Isaiah says in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:22,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Were the number of the
children of Israel as the sand of the sea, a remnant only shall be
saved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet there designedly exposes to scorn the
hypocrites, who falsely pleaded that prophecy, &#8216;Look on the stars of
heaven, and on the sand of the sea, if thou can&#8217;t number them; so shall
thy seed be.&#8217; Since, then, Isaiah saw that hypocrites, relying on that
prophecy, were rising so perversely against him, he said, &#8220;Be it so, be it
so, that ye are as the stars of heaven, and as the sand of the sea; yet a
remnant only shall be saved;&#8221; which means, &#8220;The Lord will at last
cut you down, and reduce you to so small a number, that ye shall be extremely
few.&#8221; Now, on the other hand, Hosea says, That after the Israelites shall
be reduced to a very small number, that nothing but waste and solitude will
appear, then the Lord will restore the Church beyond all human thoughts and will
prove that he had not in vain promised to Abraham that his seed would be as the
sand of the sea. Since, then, the Lord wonderfully defends his Church, and
preserves it in this world, so that at one time he seems to bury it, and then he
raises it from death; at one time he cuts it down as to its outward appearance,
and then afterwards he renews it; we ought to take heed, lest we measure
according to our own judgement and carnal reason, what the Lord declares
respecting the preservation of his Church. For its safety is often hid from the
eyes of men. However the case may be, God does not bind himself here to human
means, nor to the order of nature, but his purpose is to surpass by his
incredible power whatever the minds of men can conceive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus then ought this passage,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The number of the children of
Israel shall be as the sand of the sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
to be expounded: God will gather his Church from all quarters, from the Gentiles
as well as from the Jews when the whole world will think it to be
extinct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in the place where
it had been said, Ye are not my people; there it shall be said, Ye are the sons
of the living God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, in these
words, amplifies by a comparison the grace of God; as though he said,
&#8220;When God shall restore anew his Church, its state shall be more excellent
than before.&#8221; How so? &#8220;They shall not only,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;be the people of God, but also the sons of the living God;&#8221; which
means, that God will more familiarly show himself a Father to those, whom he
will thus suddenly gather into one body. I indeed allow that the ancients under
the law were honoured with this title; but we ought to attend to the present
passage; for the Prophet contrasts the two clauses, the one with the other:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in the place
where it had been said, Ye are not my people; it shall be said there, Ye are the
sons of the living God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He might have
said, &#8220;And it shall be in the place where it had been said, Ye are not my
people; there it shall be said, Ye are not my people:&#8221; but he ascends
higher; God will confer more honour on his new people, for he will more clearly
manifest his favour to them by this title of adoption: and it belongs in common
to all, to the Gentiles as well as to the Israelites. We ought not to apply
this, as it is commonly done, exclusively to the Gentiles: for Hosea speaks not
here only of the Church which God attained for himself from the Gentiles, but of
the whole Israel of God, a part of whom is the seed of Abraham. Let us then know
that God here offers his grace generally, to the Israelites as well as to the
Gentiles, and testifies, that after having justly cast away this people, he
would make all to know that he had not been unmindful of his covenant, for he
would attain to himself a much larger Church &#8212; from whom? From the
children of Abraham, as it has been said, as well as from
strangers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And there is an important meaning in the verb,
&#8216;It shall be said:&#8217;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be where it had been
said, Ye are not my people, there it shall be
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212;</i> The Prophet means, that
our salvation appears not, before the Lord has begun to testify to us of his
good-will. Hence the beginning of our salvation is God&#8217;s call, when he
declares himself to be propitious to us: without his word, no hope shines on us.
Hosea might have said, &#8216;It shall be in the place where it had been said,
Ye are not my people, there they shall begin to be the sons of God:&#8217; but
he expresses more, &#8216;It shall be where it had been said, Ye are not my
people, there it shall be said, Ye are the sons of the living
God.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the first clause, it must be referred to the
threatening which have been already explained; and in this way was also checked
the contumacy of the people, who heedlessly despised all the Prophets.
&#8220;What! God has bound himself to us: we are the race of Abraham; then we
are a holy and elect nation.&#8221; But the Prophet here claims authority to
himself as a teacher: &#8220;I am a herald of God&#8217;s vengeance, and
seriously proclaim to you your rejection: there is then no reason why ye should
now harden your hearts and close your ears; for now at length will follow the
execution of that vengeance which I now declare to you.&#8221; The Prophet then
declares here that he had not rashly pronounced what we before noticed, that it
was not an empty bug bear, but that he had spoken in the Lord&#8217;s name; as
Paul also says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Vengeance is
prepared by us against all them</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">who
extol themselves against Christ,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 10:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we see also what was said to Ezekiel, &#8216;Go
and besiege Jerusalem; turn thy face, and stand there until thou stormest it,
until thou overthrowest it.&#8217; The prophet was not certainly furnished with
an army, so that he could make an attack upon Jerusalem: but God means there
that there is power enough in his word to destroy all the ungodly. So also Hosea
signifies the same here: &#8220;When by the word alone the Israelites shall be
cast away it shall be said, Ye are the sons of the living God.&#8221; Let us
then know, that God rises upon us with certain salvation, when we hear him
speaking to us. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet speaks here peculiarly of the children of
Abraham; for though God would make no more account of them than of other
nations, he yet wished it to be ascribed to his covenant, that they in honor
excelled others; and the right of primogeniture, we know, is everywhere given to
them. Then as Abraham&#8217;s children were first-begotten in the Church, even
after the coming of Christ, God here especially addresses them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend together from the land
shall the children of Israel and the children of Judah, and they shall assemble
together, and appoint for themselves one
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In the last verse, Hosea spoke of
the universal gathering of the Church; but now he confines his address to the
natural race of Abraham. Why? Because God commenced a restoration with that
people, when he extended his hand to the miserable exiles to bring them back
from the Babylonian captivity to their own country. As then this was the
beginning of the gathering, the Prophet, not without reason, turns his address
here to them, and thus sets them in higher honor, not that they were worthy, not
that they could by any merit claim this dignity; but because God would not make
void his covenant, and because he had chosen them that they might be the
first-begotten, as it has been already stated, and as they are also elsewhere
called, &#8216;My first-begotten is Ephraim,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:9) We now then understand the order and arrangement of the Prophet, which is
to be carefully noticed, and the more so, because interpreters confound all
these things, and make no distinctions, when yet the Prophet has not here
mingled together the children of Israel and the children of Judah with the
Gentiles, except for a certain purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now consider the words of the Prophet.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assembled
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> shall be the children of
Israel and the children of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> No
doubt, the Prophet has in view the scattering, which had now lasted more than
two hundred years, when Jeroboam had led away the ten tribes. Inasmuch as the
body became then torn asunder, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Together shall be gathered the
children of Judah and the children of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And designedly does he thus
speak, lest the Israelites should felicitate themselves on their own power;
since they were a mutilated body without a head; for the king of Israel,
properly speaking, was not legitimate. The Lord had indeed anointed Jeroboam;
and afterwards Jehu, I admit, had been anointed; but is was done for the sake of
executing judgment. For when the Lord intended really to bless the people, he
chose David to rule over them; and then he committed the government over all the
children of Abraham to the posterity of David. There was therefore no legitimate
head over the people of Israel. And the Prophet intended distinctly to express
this by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gathered together
shall be the children of Judah and the children of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which means this, &#8220;Ye are
now secure, because fortune smiles on you; because ye are overflowing with money
and all good things; because ye are terrible to your neighbors; because ye have
cities well fortified; but your safety depends on another thing, even on this,
that ye be one body under one head. For ye must be miserable except God rules
over you; and the only way in which this can be is, that ye be under the
government of David. Your separation, then, proves your state to be accursed;
your earthly happiness, in which you felicitate yourselves, is unhappiness
before God.&#8221; The Prophet then reminded the people of Israel, that God
would at last deal kindly with them by restoring them to their first unity. The
import of the whole then is, that the children of Abraham shall then at length
be blessed, when they shall unite again in one body, and when one head shall
rule over them. They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be gathered together, and
appoint one head.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here also
what kind of assembling this will be which he mentions, which was to be this,
they shall be gathered under the government of one king. For whenever God speaks
of the restoration of the people, he ever calls the attention of the faithful to
David: &#8216;David shall rule, there shall be one shepherd.&#8217; Then one
king and one head shall be among them. We now perceive the design of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage clearly teaches, that the unity of
men is of no account before God, except it originates from one head. Besides, it
is well known that God set David over his ancient people until the coming of
Christ. Now, then, the Church of the Lord is only rightly formed, when the true
David rules over it; that is, when all with one consent obey Christ, and submit
to his bidding, (<i>pendebunt ab ejus nutu</i> hang on his nod:) and how Christ
designs to rule in his Church, we know; for the scepter of his kingdom is the
gospel. Hence, when Christ is honored with the obedience of faith, all things
are safe; and this is the happy state of the Church, of which the Prophet now
speaks. It seems, indeed, strange, that what is peculiar to God should be
transferred to men that is, to appoint a king. But the Prophet has, by this
expression, characterized the obedience of faith; for it is not enough that
Christ should be given as a king, and set over men, unless they also embrace him
as their king, and with reverence receive him. We now learn, that when we
believe the gospel we choose Christ for our king, as it were, by a voluntary
consent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins, They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall ascend from the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He expresses more than at the beginning
of the verse; for he says, that God would restore them from exile to their own
country. He then promises what was very necessary, that exile would be no
hindrance to God to renew his Church; for it was the people&#8217;s ruin to be
removed far from their country, and consequently to be deprived of their
promised inheritance during their dispersion among heathen nations. The Lord
then takes away this difficulty, and distinctly declares, that though for a time
they should be as wholly destroyed, they shall yet come again to their own land.
They <i>shall</i>, therefore, <i>ascend</i> (this is said with regard to Judea,
for it is higher than Chaldea) they <i>shall,</i> therefore, <i>ascend </i>from
Chaldea and other places in which they had been dispersed. We now understand
what the Prophet means by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gathered together shall be the
children of Israel and the children of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">
that is, into one body; and further, they <i>shall appoint</i> for themselves
one head. This is the manner of the gathering; and it must be also added, that
the Church then obeys God, when all, from the first to the last, consent to one
head: for it is not enough to be constrained, unless all willingly offer
themselves to Christ; as it is said in Psalm 110, &#8220;There shall be a
willing people in the day in which the King will call his own.&#8217; Then the
Prophet intended to express the obedience of faith, which the faithful will
render to Christ, when the Lord shall restore them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the land; for great shall be
the day of Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may be asked, why does
he here call the day of Jezreel great; for it seems contrary to prophecy? This
passage may be explained in two ways. Great shall be the day of Jezreel, some
say, because God will sow the people whom he had before scattered. So they think
that the Prophet, as in a former instance, alludes to the word, Jezreel. But the
sense seems to me to be another. I do not restrict this clause to the last, nor
to the promise, but apply it to the slaughter which has been before mentioned;
for they correspond with one another.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall ascend from the land;
for great shall be the day of Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
Israelites were as yet resting in their nests, and thought that they could not
by any means be torn away; besides, the kingdom of Judah did not then fear a
near destruction. The Prophet, therefore, intimates here, that there would be a
need of some signal and extraordinary remedy; for it shall be the severe and
dreadful slaughter in the day of Jezreel. We now perceive the real meaning of
the Prophet, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall ascend
from the land; for</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great shall be the day of
Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They might, indeed, have otherwise objected, and
said, &#8220;Why dost thou thus prophesy to us about ascending? What is this
ascending? Do we not rest quietly in the inheritance which God formerly promised
to our fathers? What meanest thou, then, by this ascending?&#8221; The Prophet
here rouses them, and reminds them that they had no reason to trust in their now
quiet state, as wine settled on its lees; and this very similitude is even used
in another place,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:11.) The Prophet here declares, that there would be a most dreadful
slaughter, which would call for the signal mercy of God; for he would in a
wonderful manner restore the people, and draw them out like the dead from their
graves: <i>for great </i>then shall be the day of Jezreel; that is, &#8220;As
the calamity which the Lord shall bring on you will be grievous and dreadful, I
do not in vain promise to you this return and ascending.&#8221; This seems to be
really the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet having spoken of the people&#8217;s
restoration, and promised that God would some time receive into favour those
whom he had before rejected, now exhorts the faithful mutually to stir up one
another to receive this favour. He had previously mentioned a public
proclamation; for it is not in the power of men to make themselves the children
of God, but God himself freely adopts them. But now the mutual exhortation of
which the Prophet speaks follows the proclamation; for God at the same time
invites us to himself. After we are taught in common, it remains then that each
one should extend his hand to his brethren, that we may thus with one consent be

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems in this verse to contradict
himself; for he promised reconciliation, and now he speaks of a new repudiation.
These things do not seem to agree well together that God should embrace, or be
willing to embrace, again in his love those whom he had before rejected, &#8212;
and that he should at the same time send a bill of divorce, and renounce the
bond of marriage. But if we weigh the design of the Prophet, we shall see that
the passage is very consistent, and that there is in the words no contrariety.
He has indeed promised that at a future time God would be propitious to the
Israelites: but as they had not yet repented, it was needful to deal again more
severely with them, that they might return to their God really and thoroughly
subdued. So we see that in Scripture, promises and threatening are mingled
together, and rightly too. For were the Lord to spend a whole month in reproving
sinners they may in that time fall away a hundred times. Hence God, after
showing to men their sins adds some consolation and moderates severity, lest
they should despond: he afterwards returns again to threatening, and does so
from necessity; for though men may be terrified with the fear of punishment,
they do not yet really repent. It is then necessary for them to be reproved not
only once and again, but very often.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive what the Prophet had in view: he
had spoken of the people&#8217;s defection; afterwards he proved that the people
had been justly rejected by the Lord; and then he promised the hope of pardon.
But now seeing that they still continued obstinate in their vices, he reproves
again those who had need of such chastisement. He, in a word, has in view their
present state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Almost all so expound this verse as if the Prophet
addressed the faithful: and with greater refinement still do they expound, who
say, that the Prophet addresses the faithful who had fallen away from the
synagogue. They have and I have no doubt, been much deceived; for the Prophets
on the contrary, shows here that God was justly punishing the Israelites, who
were wont to excuse themselves in the same way as hypocrites are wont to do.
When the Lord treated them otherwise than according to their wishes, they
expostulated, and raised up contention &#8212; &#8220;What does this
mean?&#8221; So do we find them introduced as thus speaking, by Isaiah 58.
There, indeed, they fiercely contend with God, as if the Lord dealt with them
unjustly, for they seemed not conscious of having done any evil. Hence the
Prophet, seeing the Israelites so senseless in their sins, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Contend, contend with your
mother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks here in the person of God:
and God, as it has been stated, uses the similitude of a marriage. Let us now
see what is the import of the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When a husband repudiates his wife, he fixes a mark
of disgrace on the children born by that marriage: their mother has been
divorced; then the children, on account of that divorce, are held in less
esteem. When a husband repudiates his wife through waywardness, the children
justly regard him with hatred. Why? &#8220;Because he loved not our mother as he
ought to have done; he has not honoured the bond of marriage.&#8221; It is
therefore usually the case, that the children&#8217;s affections are alienated
from their father, when he treats their mother with too little humanity or with
entire contempt. So the Israelites, when they saw themselves rejected, wished to
throw the blame on God. For by the name, &#8220;mother&#8221;, are the people
here called; it is transferred to the whole body of the people, or the race of
Abraham. God had espoused that people to himself, and wished them to be like a
wife to him. Since then God was a husband to the people, the Israelites were as
sons born by that marriage. But when they were repudiated, the Israelites said,
that God dealt cruelly with them, for he has cast them away for no fault. The
Prophet now undertakes the defence of God&#8217;s cause, and speaks also in his
person, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Contend, contend, he says
with your mother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In a word, this
passage agrees with what is said in the beginning of
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
50:1,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Where is the bill of repudiation?
Have I sold you to my creditors? But ye have been sold for your sins, and your
mother has been repudiated for her iniquity.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Husbands were wont to give a bill of divorce to their
wives, that they themselves might see it: for it freed them from every reproach,
inasmuch as the husband bore a testimony to his wife: &#8220;I dismiss her, not
that she has been unfaithful, not that she has violated the bond of marriage;
but because her beauty does not please me, or because her manners are not
agreeable to me.&#8221; The law compelled the husband to give such a testimony
as this. God now says by his Prophet, &#8220;Show me now the bill of
repudiation: have I of my own accord cast away your mother? No, I have not done
so. Ye cannot accuse me of cruelty, as though her beauty did not please me, and
as though I had followed the common practice approved by you. I have not
willingly rejected her, nor at my own pleasure, and I have not sold her to my
creditors, as your fathers were sometimes wont to do, as to their children, when
they were in debt.&#8221; In short, the Lord shows there that the Jews were to
be blamed, that they were rejected together with their mother. So he says also
in this place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Contend, contend
with your mother;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which means,
&#8220;Your dispute is not with me:&#8221; and by the repetition he shows how
inveterate was their perverseness, for they never ceased to glamour against God.
We now see the real meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In vain then do they philosophise, who say that the
mother was to be condemned by her own children; because, when they shall be
converted to their former faith, they ought then to condemn the synagogue. The
Prophet meant no such thing; but, on the contrary, he brings this charge against
the Israelites, that they had been repudiated for the flagitious conduct of
their mother, and had ceased to be counted the children of God. For the
comparison between husband and wife is here to be understood; and then the
children are placed as it were in the middle. When the mother is dismissed, the
children indignantly say that the father has been too inhuman if indeed he
wilfully divorces his wife: but when a wife becomes unfaithful to her husband,
or prostitutes herself to any shameful crime, the husband is then free from
every blame; and there is no cause for the children to expostulate with him; for
he ought thus to punish a shameless wife. God then shows that the Israelites
were justly rejected, and that the blame of their rejection belonged to the
whole race of Abraham; but that no blame could be imputed to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And for a reason it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let her then take away her
fornication from her face, and her adulteries from the midst of her
breasts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, by saying,
&#8220;Let her then take away her fornications&#8221;, (for the copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau,</i> ought to be regarded as an illative,) confirms what we have just now
said; that is that God had stood to his pledged faith, but that the people had
become perfidious; and that the cause of the divorce or separation was, that the
Israelites persevered not, as they ought to have done, in the obedience of
faith. Then God says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let her
take away her fornications.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let her take away from her face
and from her breasts</i></font><font face="Palatino">, seems singular; and what
does it mean? because women commit fornication neither by the face nor by the
breasts. It is evident the Prophet alludes to meretricious finery; for harlots,
that they may entice men, sumptuously adorn themselves, and carefully paint
their face and decorate their breasts. Wantonness then appears in the face as
well as in the breasts. But interpreters do not touch on what the Prophet had in
view. The Prophet, no doubt, sets forth here the shamelessness of the people;
for they had now so hardened themselves in their contempt of God, in their
ungodly superstitions, in all kinds of wickedness, that they were like harlots,
who conceal not their baseness, but openly prostitute themselves, yea, and
exhibit tokens of their shamelessness in their eyes as well as in every part of
their bodies. We see then that the people are here accused of disgraceful
impudence as they had grown so callous as to wish to be known to be such as they
were. In the same way does Ezekiel set forth their reproachful
conduct,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Spread has the
harlot her feet,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">she called on all
who passed by the way,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
16:25.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why the Prophet expressly
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let her take away from her
face her fornication, and from her breasts her
adulteries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for he teaches that the
vices of the people were not hidden, and that they did not now sin and cover
their baseness as hypocrites do, but that they were so unrestrained in their
contempt of God, that they were become like common harlots.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here is a remarkable passage; for we first see that
men in vain complain when the Lord seems to deal with them in severity; for they
will ever find the fault to be in themselves and in their parents: yea, when
they look on all impartially, they will confess that all throughout the whole
community are included in one and the same guilt. Let us hence learn, whenever
the lord may chastise us, to come home to ourselves, and to confess that he is
justly severe towards us; yea, were we apparently cast away, we ought yet to
confess, that it is through our own fault, and not through God&#8217;s
immoderate severity. We also learn how frivolous is their pretext, who set up
against God the authority of their fathers, as the Papists do: for they would,
if they could, call or compel God to an account, because he forsakes them, and
owns them not now as his Church. &#8220;What! has not God bound his faith to us?
Is not the Church his spouse? Can he be unfaithful?&#8221; So say the Papists:
but at the same time they consider not, that their mother has become utterly
filthy through her many abominations; they consider not, that she has been
repudiated, because the Lord could no longer bear her great wickedness. Let us
then know, that it is in vain to bring against God the examples of men; for what
is here said by the Prophet will ever stand true, that God has not given a bill
of divorce to his Church; that is, that he has not of his own accord divorced
her, as peevish and cruel husbands are wont to do, but that he has been
constrained to do so, because he could no longer connive at so many
abominations. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Though the Prophet in this verse severely threatens
the Israelites, yet it appears from a full view of the whole passage, that he
mitigates the sentence we have explained: for by declaring what sort of
vengeance was suspended over them, except they timely repented, he shows that
there was some hope of pardon remaining, which, as we shall see, he expresses
afterwards more clearly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now begins by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I strip her naked, and set
her as on the day of her nativity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This
alone would have been dreadful; but we shall see in the passage, that God so
denounces punishment, that he cuts not off altogether the hope of mercy: and at
the same time he reminds them that the divorce, for which they were disposed to
contend with God, was such, that God yet shows indulgence to the repudiated
wife. For when a husband dismisses an adulteress, he strips her entirely, and
rightly so: but God shows here, that though the Israelites had become wanton,
and were like a shameless woman, he had yet so divorced them hitherto, that he
had left them their dowry, their ornaments and marriage gifts. We then see that
God had not used, as he might have done, his right; and hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I strip her
naked</i></font><font face="Palatino">; which means this, &#8220;I seem to you
too rigid, because I have declared, that I am no longer a husband to your
mother: and yet see how kindly I have spared her; for she remains as yet almost
untouched: though she has lost the name of wife, I have not yet stripped her;
she as yet lives in sufficient plenty. Whence is this but from my indulgence?
for I did not wish to follow up my right, as husbands do. But except she learns
to humble herself, I now gird up myself for the purpose of executing heavier
punishments.&#8221; We now comprehend the whole import of the
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet means by the day of nativity, we may
readily learn from Ezekiel 16; for Ezekiel there treats the same subject with
our Prophet, but much more at large. He says that the Israelites were then born,
when God delivered them from the tyranny of Egypt. This then was the nativity of
the people. And yet it was a miserable sight, when they fled away with fear and
trembling, when they were exposed to their enemies: and after they entered the
wilderness, being without bread and water, their condition was very wretched.
The Prophet says now, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I set
her as on the day of her nativity</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set her as the
desert</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some regard the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k
</font><font face="Palatino">caph to be understood, as if it were written,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbdmbk</font><font face="Palatino">
as in the desert; that is, I will set her as she was formerly in the desert; and
this exposition is not unsuitable; for the day of nativity, the Prophet
doubtless calls that time, when the people were brought out of Egypt: they
immediately entered the desert, where there with the want of every thing. They
might then have soon perished there, being consumed by famine and thirst, had
not the Lord miraculously supported them. The sense then seems consistent by
this rendering, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I set her as
in the deserts and as in a dry land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But
another exposition is more approved,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I set her like the desert
and dry land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to what the Prophet had in view, it was
necessary to remind the Israelites here of what they were at their beginning.
For whence was their contempt of God, whence was their obstinate pride, but that
they were inebriated with their pleasures? For when there flowed an abundance of
all good things, they thought of themselves, that they had come as it were from
the clouds; for men commonly forget what they formerly were, when the Lord has
made them rich. As then the benefits of God for the most part blind us, and make
us to think ourselves to be as it were half-gods, the Prophet here sets before
the children of Abraham what their condition was when the Lord redeemed them.
&#8220;I have redeemed you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;from the greatest miseries
and extreme degradation.&#8221; Sons of kings are born kings, and are brought up
in the midst of pomps and pleasures; nay, before they are born, great pomps, we
know, are prepared for them, which they enjoy from their mother&#8217;s womb.
But when one is born of an ignoble and obscure mother, and begotten by a mean
and poor father, and afterwards arises to a different condition, if he is proud
of his splendour, and remembers not that he was once a plebeian and of no
repute, this may be justly thrown in his face, &#8220;Who were you formerly?
Why! do you not know that you were a cow-herd, or a mechanic, or one covered
with filth? Fortune has smiled on you, or God has raised you to riches and
honours; but you are so self-complacent as though your condition had ever been
the same.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the drift of what the Prophet says: <i>I will
set</i> thy mother, he says, as she was at her first nativity. For who are you?
A holy race, a chosen nation, a people sacred to me? Be it so: but free adoption
has brought all this to you. Ye were exiles in Egypt, strangers in the land of
Canaan, and were nothing better than other people. Besides, Pharaoh reduced you
to a base servitude, ye were then the most abject of slaves. How magnificent,
with regard to you, was your going forth! Did you not flee away tremblingly and
in the night? And did you not afterwards live in a miraculous way for forty
years in the desert, when I rained manna on you from the clouds? Since then your
poverty and want has been so great, since there is nothing to make you to raise
your crests, how is it that you show no more modesty? But if your present
condition creates in you forgetfulness, I will set you as on the day of your
nativity.&#8221; It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Lord now comes close to each individual, after
having spoken in general of the whole people: and thus we see that to be true
which I have said, that it was far from the mind of the Prophet to suppose, that
God here teaches the faithful who had already repented, that they ought to
condemn their own mother. The Prophet meant nothing of the kind; but, on the
contrary, he wished to check the waywardness of the people, who ceased not to
contend with God, as though he had been more severe than just towards their
race. Now then he reproves each of them;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not pity; for they are
spurious children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He had indeed said
before that they had been born by adultery; but he afterwards received them into
favour. This is true; but what I have said must be remembered that the Prophet
as yet continues in his reproofs; for though he has mingled some consolation, he
yet saw that their hearts were not as yet contrite and sufficiently humbled. We
must bear in mind the difference between their present state and their future
favour. God before promised that he would be propitious to apostates who had
departed from him: but now he shows that it was not yet the ripe time, for they
had not ceased to sin. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not pity your
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having spoken of the mother&#8217;s divorce, he now
says that the children, born of adultery, were not his: and certainly what the
Prophet promised before was not immediately fulfilled; for the people, we know,
had been disowned, and when deprived of the land of Canaan, were rejected, as it
were, by the Lord. The Babylonian exile was a kind of death: and then when they
returned from exile, a small portion only returned, not the whole people; and
they were tossed, we know, by many calamities until Christ our Redeemer
appeared. Since then the Prophet included the whole of this time, it is no
wonder that he says that the children were to be repudiated by the Lord, because
they were born of adultery: for until they returned from captivity, and Christ
was at length revealed, this repudiation, of which the Prophet speaks, ever
continued<i>. </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not
pity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At first sight it seems very dreadful,
that God takes away the hope of mercy; but we ought to confine this sentence to
that time during which it pleased God to cast away his people. As long, then, as
that temporary casting away lasted, God&#8217;s favour was hid; and to this the
Prophet now refers, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then pity her children,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for they are born by
adultery</i></font><font face="Palatino">. At the same time, we must remember
that this sentence specifically belonged to the reprobate, who boasted of being
the children of Abraham, while they were profane and unholy, while they
impiously perverted the whole worship of God, while they were wholly
ungovernable. Then the Prophet justly pronounces such a severe judgement on
obstinate men, who could be reformed by no admonitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards declares how the children became
spurious; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their mother, who
conceived</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or bare <i>them,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has been wanton; with
shameful acts has she defiled herself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wb
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>bush,</i> means, to be ashamed; but here the
Prophet means not that the Israelites were touched with shame, for such a
meaning would be inconsistent with the former sentence; but that they were like
a shameless and infamous woman, touched with no shame for her baseness.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their
mother</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been wanton, and she who bare
them had become scandalous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the
Prophet strips the Israelites of their foolish confidence, who were wont to
profess the name of God, while they were entirely alienated from him: for they
had fallen away by their impiety from pure worship, they had rejected the law,
yea, and every yoke. Since then they were wild beasts, it was extreme stupidity
ever to set up for their shield the name of God, and ever to boast of the
adoption of their father Abraham. But as the Jews were so perversely proud, the
Prophet here answers them,
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your mother has been
wanton, and with shameful acts has she defiled
herself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> I will not therefore count nor
own you as my children, for ye were born by adultery.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage confirms what I have shortly before
explained, &#8212; that it is not enough that God should choose any people for
himself, except the people themselves persevere in the obedience of faith; for
this is the spiritual chastity which the Lord requires from all his people. But
when is a wife, whom God has bound to himself by a sacred marriage, said to
become wanton? When she falls away, as we shall more clearly see hereafter, from
pure and sound faith. Then it follows that the marriage between God and men so
long endures at they who have been adopted continue in pure faith, and apostasy
in a manner frees God from us, so that he may justly repudiate us. Since such
apostasy prevails under the Papacy, and has for many ages prevailed, how
senseless they are in their boasting, while they would be thought to be the holy
Catholic Church, and the elect people of God? For they are all born by
wantonness, they are all spurious children. The incorruptible seed is the word
of God; but what sort of doctrine have they? It is a spurious seed. Then as to
God all the Papists are bastards. In vain then they boast themselves to be the
children of God, and that they have the holy Mother Church, for they are born by
filthy wantonness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues still the same subject:
&#8220;She said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will go after
my lovers, the givers of my bread, of my waters, of my wool, and of my flax, and
of my oil, and of my drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet
here defines the whoredom of which he had spoken: this part is explanatory; the
Prophet unfolds in several words what he had briefly touched when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your mother has been
wanton</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. Now</i>, if the Jews object and say,
How has she become wanton? Because, &#8220;she said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will go after my lovers, who
give me my bread and my waters, </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>etc.</i> The
Prophet here compares false gods to lovers, who seduce women from their conjugal
fidelity; for he pursues the similitude which he had introduced. The Church, to
whom God has pledged his faith, is represented as a wife; and as a woman does,
when enticed by gifts, and as many women follow covetousness and become
lascivious, that they may dress sumptuously, and live luxuriously, so the
Prophet now points out this vice in the Israelitic Church,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She said, I will go after my
lovers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some understand by lovers either
the Assyrians or the Egyptians; for when the Israelites formed connections with
these heathen nations, they were drawn away, we know, from their God. But the
Prophet inveighs especially against false and corrupt modes of worship, and all
kinds of superstitions; for the pure worship of God, we know, is ever to have
the first place, and that justly; for on this depend all the duties of life. I
therefore doubt not, but that he includes all false gods, when he says, &#8220;I
will go after my lovers&#8221;.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by introducing the word, &#8220;said&#8221;, he
amplifies the shamelessness of the people, who deliberately forsook their God,
who was to them as a legitimate husband. It indeed happens sometimes that a man
is thoughtlessly drawn aside by a mistake or folly, but he soon repents; for we
see many of the unexperienced deceived for a short time: but the Prophet here
shows that the Israelites premeditated their unfaithfulness, so that they
wilfully departed from God. Hence <i>she said</i>; and we know that this
<i>said</i> means so much; and it is to be referred, not to the outward word as
pronounced, but to the inward purpose. <i>She</i> therefore <i>said</i>, that
is, she made this resolution; as though he said, &#8220;Let no one make this
frivolous excuse, that they were deceived, that they did it in their simplicity:
ye are, he says, avowedly perfidious, ye have with a premeditated purpose sought
this divorce.&#8221; He, however, ascribes this to their mother: for defection
began at the root, when they were drawn away by Jeroboam into corrupt
superstitions; and the promotion of this evil became as it were hereditary. He
therefore intended to condemn here the whole community. Hence, &#8220;she said,
I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my waters&#8221;. But I
cannot finish today; I must therefore break off the sentence.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

not only of late adopted us as thy children, but before we were born, and as

obtained for us by the blood of thy only begotten Son, though we have by our
ingratitude renounced so great a benefit, &#8212; O grant, that being mindful of
our defection and unfaithfulness, of which eve are all guilty, and for which
thou hast justly rejected us, we may now with true humility and obedience of
faith embrace the grace of thy gospel now again offered to us, by which thou
reconciles thyself to us; and grant that we may steadfastly persevere in pure
faith, so as never to turn aside from the true obedience of faith, but to
advance more and more in the knowledge of thy mercy, that having strong and deep

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
FIFTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains for us to explain what the Prophet
declares concerning the Israelites, that they boasted of their abundance of wine
and oil, and all good things as having come to them through their superstitions.
What, then, they ought to have ascribed to God alone, they absurdly transferred
to their idols. Of this ingratitude the Prophet here accuses them in the person
of God himself, and at the same time shows that the ungodly are so deluded by
prosperity, that they harden themselves more and more in their superstitions;
and this is not the case only at one time, but almost universally in the world.
We see how full of pride the Papists are at this day, because they bear rule in
the world, and possess riches and honours. They think their services acceptable
to God, because he shows not himself openly opposed to and angry with them; and
so it has been from the beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet here condemns this foolish
presumption, that we may learn not to judge at all times of God&#8217;s love by
the prosperous issue of events. There are then two things to be observed here,
&#8212; that the superstitious falsely ascribe to their idols what comes from
God alone; &#8212; and further, that they conclude that they are loved by God,
whenever he does not immediately take vengeance on them. The Sodomites, we find,
became obstinate in their sins for the same reason; when all kinds of pleasures
abounded, they thought themselves to be approved of God. Let us now proceed to
what follows.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; . There is a special meaning in these
words; for God testifies that he becomes the avenger of impieties, when people
are brought into straits; as though he said, &#8220;Though the Israelites are
not ready to confess that they suffer justly, yet I now declare that to punish
them will be my work, when they shall be deprived of their pleasures, and when
the occasion of their pride shall be removed from them.&#8221; And he intimates
by the metaphorical words he uses, that he would so deal with them, as to keep
the people from wandering, as they had done hitherto, after their idols; but he
retains the similitude of a harlot. Now when an unchaste wife goes after her
paramours, the husband must either connive at her, or be not aware of her base
conduct. However this may be, wives cannot thus violate the marriage-vow, except
they are set at liberty by their husbands. But when a husband understands that
his wife plays the wanton, he watches her more closely, notices all her ways day
and night. God now takes up this comparison,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will close
up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, her way with thorns, and
surround her with a mound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that there
may be no way of access open to adulterers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by this simile the Prophet means that the people
would be reduced to such straits, that they might not lasciviate, as they had
done, in their superstitions; for while the Israelites enjoyed prosperity, they
thought everything lawful for them; hence their security, and hence their
contempt of the word of the Lord. By <i>hedge,</i> then, and by <i>thorns,</i>
God means those adversities by which he restrains the ungodly, so that they may
cease to flatter themselves, and may not thoughtlessly follow, as they were
before wont to do, their own superstitions.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She shall

to groan under the burden of evils, that they shall no longer, as they have
hitherto done, allow loose reins to themselves.&#8221; It afterwards follows

<div><font face="Palatino">God now shows what takes place when he chastises
hardened and rebellious people with heavy punishment. In the first clause he
shows that perverseness will cleave so completely to their hearts, that they
will not immediately return to a sound mind.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She will follow her lovers, he
says, and seek them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet tells us,
that though the Israelites should be chastised by frequent punishments, they
would yet continue in their obstinacy. It hence appears how hard a neck they
had, and how uncircumcised in heart they were; and such did the Prophets, as
well as Moses, represent them to be. And we hence learn, that had they been only
moderately corrected, it would not have been sufficient for their amendment.
Amazing, indeed, was their obstinacy; for God had divorced them, and then led
them into great straits; and yet they went on in their course, as though they
were utterly stupid and destitute of every feeling. Is it not a prodigious
madness, when men run on so obstinately, even when God sets his hand so strongly
against them? Such, however, is represented to have been the obstinacy of the
Israelites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, that when they were subdued, God
would not immediately soften their hearts. Then God, though he bruised, did not
yet reform them; for their hardness was so great, that they could not be turned
immediately to a docile state of mind; but, on the contrary, they followed their
lovers. By the word, <i>follow,</i> is expressed that mad zeal which possesses
idolaters; for as we see, they are like men who are frantic. As then the
superstitious know no bounds, nor any moderation, but a mad zeal at times lays
hold on them, the Prophet says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She will follow her lovers and
shall not overtake them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What does the latter
clause mean? That God will frustrate the hope of the ungodly, that they may know
that they in vain worship false gods and follow with avidity absurd
superstitions. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will seek
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and shall not find
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He ever speaks of the people under the
character of a shameless and unfaithful wife.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see what the Prophet intended to do, &#8212;
to vindicate God from every blame, that men might not raise a glamour, as though
he dealt unkindly with them. He shows that God, even when so rigid, produces
hardly any effect; for the ungodly in their perverseness struggle against his
scourges, and suffer not themselves to be brought immediately into due
order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in the second clause the Prophet adds, that some
benefit would at length arise, that though idolaters abused God&#8217;s
goodness, and even hardened themselves against his rods, yet this would not be
perpetually the case; for the Lord would grant better success. Hence it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She will then say, I will go and
return to my former</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>husband</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Here the Prophet shows more clearly a hope of pardon, inasmuch as he speaks of
the people&#8217;s repentance; for men, we know, repent not without benefit, as
God is ever ready to receive them when they return to him in genuine sorrow.
Then the Prophet here avowedly speaks of the repentance of the people, that the
Israelites might hence know, that corrections, which men naturally ever dislike,
would be profitable to them. It is our wish that God should always favour us,
and that we should be nourished kindly and tenderly in his bosom; but in the
meantime, he cannot allure us to himself, by whatever means he may try to do so:
and hence it is, that chastisements are bitter to us, and our flesh immediately
murmurs. When the Lord raises his finger, before he strikes us, we instantly
groan and become angry, and even roar against him: in short, men can never be
brought willingly to offer themselves to be chastised by God. Hence the Prophet
now shows, that the severity of God is profitable to us; for it drives us at
length to repentance: in a word, he commends the favour of God in his very
severity, that we may know that he furthers our salvation, even when he seems to
treat us most unkindly. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She will
then say, I will go and return to my former husband.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe, that when men really repent,
they do so through the special influence of the Spirit; for they would otherwise
perpetually remain in that perverseness of which we have spoken. Were God for a
hundred years continually to chastise perverse men, they would not yet change
their disposition; and true is that common saying, &#8220;The wicked are sooner
broken than reformed.&#8221; But when men, after many admonitions, begin to be
wise, this change comes through the Spirit of God. We may also learn from this
passage what true repentance is; that is, when he who has sinned not only
confesses himself to be guilty, and owns himself worthy of punishment, but is
also displeased with himself, and then with sincere desire turns to God. Many,
we see, are ready enough, and disposed, to confess their sins, and yet go on in
the same course. But the Prophet shows here that true repentance is something
very different, &#8220;I will go and return&#8221;, he says. Repentance then
consists (as they say) in the act itself; that is, repentance produces a
reforming change in man, so that he reconciles himself to God, whom he had
forsaken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will </i>then<i> go and return to
my former husband</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>better was it with me then than
now</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet again confirms what I lately
said, &#8212; that the faithful are not made wise, except they are well
chastised; for the Prophet speaks not here of the reprobate, but of the remnant
seed. The people of Israel were to be exterminated; but the Prophet now declares
that there would be some remaining who would at last receive benefit from
God&#8217;s chastisements. Since then we must understand the Prophet as speaking
of the elect, we may hence readily conclude, that chastisements are necessary
for us; for we grow torpid in our vices, as long as God spares us. Unless, then
it appears that God is really displeased with us, it will never come to our
minds, that we ought to repent. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God here amplifies the ingratitude of the people,
that they understood not whence came such abundance of good things.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She understood not, he says, that
I gave to her corn and wine</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The superstitious
sin twice, or in two ways; &#8212; first, they ascribe to their idols what
rightly belongs to God alone; and then they deprive God himself of his own
honour, for they understand not that he is the only giver of all things, but
think their labour lost were they to worship the true God. Hence the Prophet now
complains of this ingratitude,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She understood not that I gave to
her corn and wine and oil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And this was an
inexcusable stupidity in the Israelites, since they had been abundantly
instructed, that the abundance of all good things, and every thing that supports
man, flow from God&#8217;s bounty. Of this they had the clear testimony of
Moses; and then the land of Canaan itself was a living representation of the
Divine favour. It was then a prodigious madness in the people, that they who had
been taught by word and by fact, that God alone is the Giver of all things,
should yet not consider this truth. The Prophet, therefore, condemns this
outrageous folly of the people, that neither experience nor the teaching of the
law availed anything, <i>She knew not</i>, he says. There is stress to be laid
on the pronoun, she; for the people ought to have been familiarly acquainted
with God, inasmuch as they had been brought up in his household, as a wife, who
is her husband&#8217;s companion. It was then incapable of any excuse, that the
people should thus turn their minds and all their thoughts away from
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She knew
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I had given to her corn and
wine and oil, that I had multiplied to her the silver, and also the gold she has
prepared for Baal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">
means specifically, to make: but here to appropriate to a certain purpose. They
have, therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared gold
for Baal;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> when they ought to have dedicated to
me the first-fruits of all good things, in obedience to me and to the honour of
my name, they have appropriated to Baal whatever blessings I have bestowed on
them. We then see that in this verse two evils are condemned, &#8212; that the
people deprived God of his just honour, &#8212; and that they transferred to
their own idols what they ought to have given to God only. But he touched upon
the last wickedness in the fifth verse, where he said in the person of the
people, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will go after my
lovers, who give my bread and my waters, my wool and my wine,
etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here again he repeats, that they
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared gold for
Baal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word Baal, no doubt the superstitious
included under this name all those whom they called inferior gods. No such
madness had indeed possessed the Israelites, that they had forgotten that there
is but one Maker of heaven and earth. They therefore maintained the truth, that
there is some supreme God; but they added their patrons; and this, by common
consent, was the practice of all nations. They did not then think that God was
altogether robbed of his own glory, when they joined with him patrons or
inferior gods. And they called them by a common name, Baalim, or, as it were,
patrons. Baal of every kind was a patron. Some render it, husband. But foolish
men, I doubt not, have ever had this superstitious notion, that inferior gods
come nearer to men, and are, as it were, mediators between this world and the
supreme God. It is the same with the Papists of the present day; they have their
Baalim; not that they regard their patrons in the place of God: but as they
dread every access to God, and understand not that Christ is a mediator, they
retake themselves here and there to various Baalim, that they may procure favour
to themselves; and at the same time, whatever honour they show to stones, or
wood, or bones of dead men, or to any of their own inventions, they call it the
worship of God. Whatever then, is worshipped by the Papists is Baal: but they
have, at the same time, their patrons for their Baalim. We now then perceive the
meaning of the Prophet in this verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore will I return, and take
away my corn in its time, and my new wine in its stated
time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here, again, the Prophet shows that God
was, by extreme necessity, constrained to take vengeance on an ungodly and
irreclaimable people. He makes known how great was the hardness of the people,
and then adds, &#8220;What now remains, but to deprive those who have been so
ungrateful to me of all their blessings?&#8221; It is, indeed, more than base
for men to enjoy the gifts of God and to despise the giver; yea, to exalt his
creatures to his place, and to reduce, as it were, all his authority to nothing.
This the superstitious indeed do, for they thrust God from his pre-eminence, and
insult his glory. Will God, in the meantime, so throw away his blessings as to
suffer them to be profaned by the ungodly, and himself to be thus mocked with
impunity? We now then see the object of the Prophet; for God here shows that
there was no other remedy, but to deprive the Israelites of all their gifts: he
had indeed enriched them, but they had abused all their abundance. It was
therefore necessary to reduce them to extreme want, that they might no longer
pollute God&#8217;s gifts which ought to be held sacred by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he uses a very suitable word; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lxn</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>natsal</i> means properly, to pluck away to set free.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will by force take
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my wool and my
flax.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It seems, indeed, to denote an unjust
possession, as when one takes away by force from the hand of a robber what he
unjustly possesses, or as when any one rescues wretched men from the power of a
tyrant. So God now speaks, &#8216;I will pluck away my gifts from these men who
basely and unjustly pollute them.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to cover her
nakedness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">Hwr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>orue,</i> properly, though not simply, means nakedness: it is the nakedness
of the uncomely parts. Moses calls any indecorous part of the body
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>orue,</i> and so it means what is uncomely. This word we ought carefully to
notice; for God here shows, that except he denudes idolaters, they will ever
continue obstinate. How so? Because they use coverings for their baseness. While
the ungodly enjoy their triumphs in the world, they regard them as veils drawn
over them, so that nothing base or disgraceful can be seen in them. The same is
the case with great kings and monarchs; they think that the eyes of all are
dazzled by their splendour; and hence it is, that they are so audaciously
dissolute. They think their own filth to be fine odour: such is the arrogance of
the world. It is even so with the superstitious; when God is indulgent to them,
they think that they have coverings. When, therefore, they abandon themselves to
any kind of wickedness, they regard it as if it were a holy thing. How so?
Because, whatever obscene thing is in them, it is covered by prosperity. When
God observes such madness as this in men, can he do otherwise than pluck away
his blessings, that such a pollution may not continually prevail? For it is an
abuse extremely gross, that when God&#8217;s blessings are so many images of his
glory, and when his paternal goodness shines forth even towards the ungodly, the
world should convert them to a purpose wholly contrary, and make them as
coverings for themselves, that they may conceal their own baseness, and more
freely sin and carry on war against God himself. Hence he says, &#8220;That they
may no longer cover their baseness, I will pluck away whatever I have bestowed
on them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away the corn and
wine in its time, and in its stated time,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he
alludes, I have no doubt, to the time of harvest and vintage; as though he said,
&#8220;The harvest will come, the vintage will come: there has been hitherto
great fruitfulness; but I will show that the earth and all its fruits are
subject to my will. Though, then, the Israelites are now full, and have their
storehouses well furnished, they shall know that I rule over the harvest and the
vintage, when the stated time shall come.&#8221; Now, the Spirit of God
denounced this punishment early, that the Israelites, if reclaimable, might
return to a right course. But as their blindness was so great that they despised
all that had been said to them, no excuse remained for them. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject; and the Prophet explains
at large, and even divides what he had briefly said before, into many clauses or
particulars. He says firsts </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will uncover her baseness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. How was this done?
By God, when he took away the coverings by which the Israelites kept themselves
hid: for, as we have said hypocrites felicitate themselves on account of
God&#8217;s gifts, and thus hide themselves as thieves do in caverns; and they
think that they can mock God with impunity; for, through the fatness of their
eyes, as it is said in

he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I uncover her

By this sentence he intimates a change, of which the people were not
apprehensive; for, as long as the wicked feel not the strokes, they laugh at all
threatening. Hence God, that he might rouse them from such an indifference,
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now will I uncover her
before the eyes of her lovers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, no
doubt, speaks of false gods, and of all those devices by which the Israelites
corrupted the pure worship of God: for I cannot be persuaded to explain this
either of the Assyrians or of the Egyptians. I indeed know, as I mentioned
briefly yesterday, that the treaties into which the Jews, as well as the
Israelites, entered with idolaters, were the tenter-hooks of Satan: this I
allow; but at the same time, I look on what the Prophet especially treats of;
for he directly inveighs here against absurd and vicious modes of worship. What
then does he mean by saying, that God will uncover the baseness of the people
before their lovers? He alludes to shameless women, who dare, by terror, to
check their husbands, that they may not exercise their own right. &#8220;What!
do you treat me ill? there is one who will resent this conduct.&#8221; Even when
husbands indignantly bear their own reproach, they often attempt not to assert
their own right, because they see that fear is in the way. But God says,
&#8220;Nothing will hinder me from chastising thee as thou deserves (for he
addresses the people under the character of a wife;) before thy lovers then will
I uncover thy baseness.&#8221;</font><br></div>

my hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word man is put here for idols;
for it is a word of general import among the Hebrews. Sometimes when brute
animals are spoken of, this word, man, is used; and it is also applied to the
fragments of a carcass. For when Moses describes the sacrifice made by Abraham,
&#8216;Man,&#8217; he says, &#8216;was laid to his fellow;&#8217; that is,
Abraham joined together the different parts of the sacrifice, as we say in
French, <i>Il n&#8217;y a piece.</i> God then speaks here of idols:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall rescue them from my
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We now comprehend the meaning of
the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, at the same time, see what he had in view.
The Israelites indeed thought, that as long as their corrupt modes of worship
prevailed, they were safe and secure: it seemed impossible to them that any
adversity should happen to them while idolatry continued. As, then, they
imagined their false gods to be to them like an invincible rampart, &#8220;Thy
idols,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall remain, and yet thou shalt fall: for I will
before thy lovers uncover thy baseness, and not one of them shall deliver thee
from my hand.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now descends to particulars; and, in the
first place, he says, that the people would be deprived of their sacrifices and
feast-days, and of that whole external pomp, which was with them the guise of
religion. He then adds, that they would be spoiled of their food, and all their
abundance. He has hitherto been speaking of their nakedness; but he now
describes what this nakedness would be: and he specially mentions, that
sacrifices would cease, that feast days, new-moons, and whatever belonged to
external worship, would cease. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will make to cease</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all her
joy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks doubtless, of sacred joys; and
this may be easily collected from the context. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her every
festal-day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As they were wont to dance
on their festal-days, this word may be referred to that practice. He afterwards
adds, &#8220;her sabbath&#8221;, and all feast-days. Then the first kind of
nakedness was, that God would take away from the Israelites that fallacious and
empty form of religion in which they foolishly delighted. The second kind of
nakedness was, that they were to be stripped of all earthly riches, and be
reduced to misery and extreme want. But I cannot finish to-day.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as we
are so dull and slothful, that though often admonished, we yet consider not our
sins, yea, though chastised by thy hand, we yet return not immediately to a
right mind, &#8212; O grant, that we may hereafter profit more under thy rod,
and not he refractory and untractable; but as soon as thou raises thy hand, may
each of us mourn, know our own evils, and then, with one consent, surrender
ourselves to be ruled by thee; and may we, in the meantime, patiently and calmly
endure thy chastisements, and never murmur against thee, but ever aspire to the
attainment of true repentance, until, having at length put off all the vices and
corruptions of our flesh, we attain to the fulness of righteousness, and to that
true and blessed glory which has been prepared for us in heaven by Jesus Christ.
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
SIXTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain the verse in which the
Lord speaks of the intermission of the Sabbath, and of the new-moon, and of
external worship. The people of Israel, as we have stated, were to be deprived
of these excellent gifts with which they had been favoured. And God, we know, is
in two respects bountiful to men. There is his common bounty as to foods and
other earthly benefits: but he is especially bountiful to his people in those
gifts which are called supernatural. Hence the Prophet says in the first place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make to cease the sabbath,
and the new-moon, and the festal-days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
They indeed thought themselves, blessed when they celebrated the festal-days,
when they offered sacrifices, and in a word, when the external pomp of
God&#8217;s worship shone forth among them: yet we know that they worshipped God
neither in a lawful place nor in a right manner, as he had commanded in the law;
for they mingled many superstitions; nay, the whole of religion among them was
polluted; and yet they thought that their worship pleased God. We now see that
the object of their punishment was this, &#8212; that the people of Israel might
now cease to felicitate themselves on account of their external form of
religion, when deprived of their temple, and sacrifices, and all outward
worship: and all this happened when the Israelites were driven away into exile.
We indeed know that they did not leave off their superstitions until they were
deprived of their country and driven into banishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to the second kind of nakedness: the
Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroy her vine and her
fig-tree, of which she has said, Reward are these to
me;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> that is,</i> These things are wages to
me, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which my lovers have given to
me: and I will make them a forest, and feed on them shall the beast of the
field</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The second part of the spoiling, as we
have said, is, that the Israelites would be reduced to miserable want, who,
before, had not only great abundance of good things, but also luxury, as we
shall hereafter see more fully in other passages. As then they were swollen with
pride on account of their prosperity, the Prophet now announces their future
nakedness,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will take
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vine and the
fig-tree</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is a mode of speaking by which a
part is to be taken for the whole; for under the vine and the fig-tree the
Prophet intended to comprehend every variety of temporal blessings. Whatever
then belongs to man&#8217;s support, the Prophet here includes in these two
words: and he repeats what he had said before, that the Israelites falsely
thought, that it was a reward paid them for their superstitions, while they
worshipped false gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She said, These are my
reward.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word is derived from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnt</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>tene:</i> some have rendered it gift, but not rightly. I indeed allow that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wntn
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;natnu&#8221;, which means to give, follows
shortly after; from which some derive this word. But we know that in many parts
of Scripture
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>atne,</i> is strictly taken for reward; and is sometimes applied to hired
soldiers: but the Prophets often use this word when they speak of harlots. Hence
the Prophet here introduces the people of Israel under the character of a
harlot; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are my
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things are my reward, which
to me have my lovers
given</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since then the Israelites had so hardened themselves
in their superstitions, that this false persuasion could not be driven out of
them, until they were deprived of all their blessings, he announces to them this
punishment, &#8212; that God would take away whatever they thought had come to
them from their idols or false gods:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
turn</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all these into a
forest</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, &#8220;I will reduce to a
waste, both the vineyards and all the well cultivated parts; so that they will
produce nothing, as is usually the case with desert places.&#8221; We now
understand the whole meaning of the Prophet. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he taught last. We have said before,
that this admonition is very necessary, that whenever God deals severely with
men, he thus visits their sins, and inflicts a just punishment. For though men
may consider themselves to be chastised by the Lord, they yet do not thoroughly
search and examine themselves as they ought. Hence the Prophet repeats what we
have before met with, and that is, that this chastisement would be just; and at
the same time, he shows us as by the finger what chiefly displeased God in the
Israelites, which was, that religion was corrupted by them: for there is nothing
more necessary to be known than that in order that men may ever habituate
themselves to worship God in a pure manner, this should be testified to them,
that all superstitions are such an abomination to God that he cannot bear
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit upon her the days of
Baalim</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, when the Israelites shall find
themselves to be without a temple, deprived of sacrifices and new-moons, and
having no more any external form of worship, let them know that they are thus
punished, because they worshipped Baalim instead of the only true God. The
Prophet, at the same time, alludes again to harlots, who more finely adorn
themselves and with greater care, when they look for their lovers, that they may
captivate them with their charms.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She decked
herself</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with her ear-ring and her
jewel</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This the superstitious usually do, when
they celebrate their fast-days; for they think that a great part of holiness
consists in the splendour of vestments; and we see that this stupidity prevails
at this day among those under the Papacy: for they would think themselves to be
doing great dishonour to God, or rather to their idols, were they not to adorn
themselves when going to perform sacred duties. This, no doubt, was then a
common error and custom. But in order to show more clearly that God abominated
each gross superstitions, the Prophet says that they were like harlots. For as a
strumpet, in order to allure men, paints herself, and also dresses splendidly,
puts on her ornaments, and decks herself with jewels and gold; even so, he says,
the Israelites did; they played the wanton, and bore the tokens of their
lewdness. This then is the allusion, when the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she decked herself with jewels
and an ear-ring, and went after her lovers.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But most grievous is what he adds at the end of the
verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Me</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has she
forgotten</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God here complains that the
fellowship of marriage availed nothing: though he had lived with the people a
long time, and treated them bountifully and kindly, yet the memory of this was
buried,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Me</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has she forgotten.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">There is then here an implied comparison
between the Israelites whom God had joined to himself, and other nations who had
known nothing of true religion, nor understood who the true God was. It was
indeed no wonder for the Gentiles to be deceived by the impostures of Satan: but
it was a monstrous ingratitude for the Israelites, who had been rightly taught
and long habituated to the pure worship of God, to cast away the recollection of
him. It was like the bestial depravity of a wife, who, having for a time lived
with her husband, and having been kindly treated by him, afterwards prostitutes
herself to adulterers, and no more cherishes or retains in her heart any love
for her husband. We now see for what end it was added, that the Israelites had
forgotten God. It was indeed a grave and severe reproof to say, that they, after
having long worshipped the true God, had been led away into such madness as to
worship false gods, the figments of their own brains: for they had before learnt
who the true and the only God was.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, in a word, confirms in this verse (as I
have before reminded you) the truth, that the punishment which God was about to
inflict on this ungodly people would not only be just, but also necessary; and
he proves at the same time, how basely they had violated their marriage-vow,
since the recollection of God did not prevail among them, after they had become
the followers of idols, and of the figments of their own hearts. Let us now go

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Lord more clearly expresses, that after
having long, and in various ways, afflicted the people, he would at length be
propitious to them; and not only so, but that he would also make all their
punishments to be conducive to their salvation, and to be medicines to heal
their diseases. But there is an inversion in the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will incline her, and I
will make her to go into the wilderness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
and so they ought to be explained thus, &#8220;Behold, I will incline her, or,
persuade her, after I shall have drawn her into the desert; then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will speak to her
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">htp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pete</i> is often taken in a bad sense, to deceive, or, to persuade by
falsehoods or, to use a vulgar word, to wheedle: but it means in this place, to
speak kindly; so that God persuades a rebellious and obstinate people as to what
is right: and then he declares that this would take place, when he led the
people into the wilderness. This is connected with the former sentence, where it
is said, &#8216;I will set her as on the day of her nativity:&#8217; for God
alludes to the first redemption of the people, which was like their birth; for
it was the same as though the people had emerged from their grave; they obtained
a new life when they were freed from the tyranny of Egypt. God therefore begot
them a people for himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet adds, After having led her into the
wilderness, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will incline
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, render her pliable to
myself. He intimates by these words, that there would be no hope of repentance
until the people were led to extreme evils; for had their punishment been
moderate, their perverseness would not have been corrected. Then God shows in
this verse, that there would be no end or lessening of evils until the people
were drawn into the wilderness, that is, until they were deprived of their
country and sacrifices, and all their wealth; yea, until they were deprived of
their ordinary food, and cast into a wilderness and solitude, where the want of
all things would press upon them, and extreme necessity would threaten them with
death. If then the people had been visited with light punishment, nothing would
have been effected; for their hardness was greater than could have been softened
by slight or common remedies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this declaration was full of great comfort. The
faithful might have otherwise wholly desponded, when they found themselves led
into exile, and the sight of the land, which was, as it were, the mirror of the
divine adoption, was taken from them, when they saw themselves scattered into
various parts, and that there was now no community, no seed of Abraham. The
Lord, therefore, that despair might not swallow up the faithful, intended in
this way to ease their sorrow; assuring them, that though they were drawn again
into the wilderness, God, who first redeemed them, was still the same, and
endued with the same strength and power which he put forth in behalf of their
fathers. We now apprehend the design of the Prophet. Calamity might have shaken
their hearts with so much terror, as to take away every confidence in
God&#8217;s favour, and make them to think themselves wholly lost: but God sets
the desert before them, &#8220;What! have I not once drawn you out of the
desert? Has my power diminished since that tithe? I indeed continue to be the
same God as your fathers found me to be: I will again draw you out of the
wilderness.&#8221; But at the same time, God reminded them that their diseases
would be unhealable, until they were led into the wilderness, until they were
deprived of their country and all the tokens of his favour, that they might no
more delude themselves with vain confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After I shall draw her into the
wilderness, then I will persuade</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I prefer the word, turning or inclining,
though the word, persuading, is by no means unsuitable. But there seems to be an
implied comparison between the present contumacy of the people, and the
obedience they would render to their God after having been subdued by various
afflictions. &#8220;The people,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will be then pliable,
when they shall be drawn into the wilderness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will speak then to her
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What is the import of this expression we
know from Isaiah 40. To speak to the heart is to bring comfort, to soothe grief
by a kind word, to offer kindness, and to hold forth some hope, that he who had
previously been worn out with sorrow may breathe freely, gather courage, and
entertain hope of a better condition. And this kind of speaking ought to be
carefully observed; for God means, that there was now no place for his promises,
because the Israelites were so refractory. Paul did not say in vain to the
Corinthians</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Open ye my
mouth,</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa7</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
O Corinthians; for I am not narrow towards you; but ye are narrow in your own
bowels,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 6:11,12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Corinthians, when alienated from Paul, had
obstructed, as it were, the passage of his doctrine, that he could not address
them in a paternal manner. So also in this place, the Lord testifies that the
floor was closed against his promises; for if he gave to the Israelites the hope
of pardon, it would have been slighted; if he had invited them kindly to
himself, they would have scornfully refused, yea, spurned the offer with
contempt, so great was their ferocity; if he had wished to be reconciled to
them, they would have despised him, or refused, or proceeded in abusing his
kindness as before. He then shows, that it was their fault that he could not
deal kindly and friendly with them. Hence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After I shall draw her into the
wilderness, I will address her heart.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know, that whenever we are deprived of
the sense of God&#8217;s favour, the way has been closed up through our fault;
for God would ever be disposed willingly to show kindness, except our contumacy
and hardness stood in the way. But when he sees us so subdued as to be pliable
and ready to obey, then he is ready in his turn, to speak to our heart; that is,
he is ready to show himself just as he is, full of grace and
kindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how well the context of the Prophet
harmonises. There are, in short, two parts, &#8212; the first is, that God takes
not away wholly the hope of pardon from the Israelites, provided there were any
healable among them, but shows that though the chastisement would be severe, it
would yet be useful, as it would appear from its fruit; this is one clause;
&#8212; and the other is, that they might not be too hasty in inquiring why God
would not sooner mitigate his severity, he answers that the time was not as yet
ripe; for they would not be capable of receiving his kindness, until they were
by degrees subdued and humbled by heavier punishment. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now plainly declares, that God&#8217;s
favour would be evident, not only by words, but also by the effects and by
experience, when the people were bent to obedience. The Prophet said in the last
verse, &#8216;I will speak to her heart;&#8217; now he adds, &#8216;I will bring
a sure and clear evidence of my favour, that they may feel assured that I am
reconciled to them.&#8217; He therefore says that he would give them vines. He
said before, &#8216;I will destroy her vines and fig-trees;&#8217; but now he
mentions only vineyards: but as we have said, the Prophet, under one kind,
comprehends all other things; and he has chosen vines, because in vines the
bounty of God especially appears. For bread is necessary to support life, wine
abounds, and to it is ascribed the property of exhilarating the heart, Psalm
104: &#8216;Bread strengthens,&#8217; or, &#8216;supports man&#8217;s heart;
wine gladdens man&#8217;s heart.&#8217; As then vines are usually planted not
only for necessary purposes, but also for a more bountiful supply, the Prophet
says, that the Lord, when reconciled to the people, will give them their
vineyards from that place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will
give</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the valley of
Achor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.. He alludes to their
situation in the wilderness: as soon as the Israelites came out of the
wilderness, they entered the plain of Achor, which was fruitful, pleasant, and
vine-bearing. Some think that the Prophet alludes to the punishment inflicted on
the people for the sacrilege of Achan, but in my judgement they are mistaken;
for the Prophet here means nothing else than that there would be a sudden change
in the condition of the people, such as happened when they came out of the
wilderness. For in the wilderness there was not even a grain of wheat or of
barley, nor a bunch of grapes; in short, there was in the wilderness nothing but
penury, accompanied with thousand deaths; but as soon as the people came out,
they descended into the plain of Achor, which was most pleasant, and very
fertile. The Prophet meant simply this, that when the people repented, there
would be no delay on God&#8217;s part, but that he would free them from all
evils, and restore a blessed abundance of all things, as was the case, when the
people formerly descended into the plain of Achor. He therefore brings to the
recollection of the Israelites what had happened to their fathers,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her vines, then, will I give her
from that place,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8220;As soon as I
shall by word testify my love to them, they shall effectually know and find that
I am really and from the heart reconciled to them, and shall understand how
inclined I am to show kindness; for I shall not long hold the people in
suspense.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For an opening, or a door of
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He signifies here, that their
restoration would be as from death into life. For though the people daily saw
with their eyes that God took care of their life, for he rained manna from
heaven and made water to flow from a rock; yet there was at the same time before
their eyes the appearance of death. As long, then, as they sojourned in the
wilderness, God did ever set before them the terrors of death: in short, their
dwelling in the wilderness, as we have said, was their grave. But when the
people descended into the plain of Achor, they then began to draw vital air; and
they felt also that they at length lived, for they had obtained their wishes:
they had now indeed come in sight of the inheritance promised to them. As then
the valley of Achor was the beginning, and as it were the door of good hope to
their fathers, so the Prophet, now alluding to that redemption, says, that God
would immediately deal with so much kindness with the Israelites as to open for
them a door of hope and salvation, as he had done formerly to their fathers in
the valley of Achor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And she shall sing
there</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We may easily learn from the context
that those interpreters mistake who refinedly philosophise about the valley of
Achor. It is indeed true that the root of the word is the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rk[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ocar,</i> which means, to confound or to destroy, and that this name was
given to the place on account of what had occurred there: but the Prophet
referred to no such thing, as it appears clearly from the second clause; for he
says, &#8220;She shall sing there as in the days of her youth&#8221;, and as in
the day in which she ascended from the land of Egypt. For then at length the
people of God openly celebrated his praises, when they beheld with their eyes
the promised land, when they saw an end to God&#8217;s severe vengeance, which
continued for forty years. Hence the people then poured forth their hearts and
employed their tongues in praises to God. The Prophet, therefore, teaches here,
that their restoration would be such, that the people would really sing praises
to God and offer him no ordinary thanks; not as they are wont to do who are
relieved from a common evil, but as those who have been brought from death into
life. She </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
sing</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as in the days of her childhood,
as in that day when she ascended from the land of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we see that a hope of deliverance is here given,
that the faithful might sustain their minds in exile, and cherish the hope of
future favour; that though the face of God would for a time be turned away from
them, they might yet look for a future deliverance, nor doubt but that God would
be propitious to them, after they had endured just punishment, and had been thus
reformed: for as we have said, a moderate chastisement could not have been
sufficient to subdue their perverseness. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now expands his subject, and shows that
when the people repented, the fruits of repentance would openly appear. One
fruit he records, and that is, that they would then begin to worship God purely,
all superstitions being abolished.

and true to their conjugal vow. Hence,

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet more clearly unfolds what
he said before, that there would be a new mind in the people, so that they would
worship God purely, though they were before entangled in their superstitions.
The meaning then is, that religion will then return to its true state, for the
names of Baalim shall cease. We have already stated whence this name had arisen.
Not even the heathens wished to thrust the only true God from his celestial
throne, by forming for themselves many gods: but while they allowed some Supreme
Being, they wished to have patrons, whom they employed in conciliating his
favour and good-will. That this was for the most part the common doctrine, may
be easily learnt from Plato: and the Jews also, no doubt, thought of becoming
wise by following the common judgement of others; they hence had their Baalim.
But though they called their patrons Baalim, they yet gave this name to God:
&#8220;Let us worship Baalim.&#8221; The Papists do the same; when they enter
their temples, they immediately turn to the image of Mary or of some saint, and
dare not come to God. At the same time they worship God, that is, pretend to
worship God, and they call superstition God&#8217;s worship. So it was among the
Israelites; though the majesty of the Supreme God was not denied, yet that
happened which the Papists also say, &#8220;That Christ is not distinguished
from his Apostles;&#8221; all things were with them mixed together and confused.
He therefore says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take
away Baalim from her mouth, and she will no more remember the name of
Baalim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which means, &#8220;They will be
content with the profession of pure faith, and will celebrate the name of the
only true God; they will no more mix their own glosses with the doctrine of the
law, and thus vitiate the pure and holy worship of God;&#8221; We now understand
the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we learn from this place, that the Church cannot
be rightly reformed except it be trained to obedience by the frequent scourges
of God; for the Lord thereby creates a new people for himself. We see at this
day what great stupidity possesses their minds, who have not been well prepared
for the worship of God. They indeed laugh at the superstitions of the Papacy;
but, at the same time, they are a sort of Cyclops: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we see
that there is nothing but barbarous ignorance in their hearts. The Prophet then
says, not in vain, that the state of religion would then be right, when the Lord
had wholly subdued his people. Hence &#8220;in that day&#8221;, which refers to
the heavy punishment which God would inflict on the Israelites &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saith the Lord, thou wilt no more
call me, Baal; but thou wilt call me,
Husband</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> How so? Because &#8220;I will
take away&#8221; the names of Baalim from thy mouth; that is, I will make the
people to cast away their own devices, and to be content with the pure doctrine
of my law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought also to remember that a confession of faith
is here commended by the Prophet. It is no doubt the fruit of true penitence,
when we testify by the mouth and tongue that the only true God is our God, and
when we are not ashamed to confess his name before the world, though it may rage
madly against us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are further reminded by these words, that too much
diligence and care cannot be taken to cleanse ourselves wholly from all sorts of
pollutions; for as long as any relics of superstition continue among us, they
will ever entangle us, and thus we shall stumble, or, at least not run so
briskly as we ought. Since, then whatever men retain of their own corrupt
devices is a hindrance to them in obtaining a direct access to God, it is meet
for us to labour that the names of Baalim should cease, and be abolished among
us; and for this end, that nothing may hinder and retard us in the true worship
of God. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we set up

door against thy goodness and paternal favour, O grant, that our hearts may be
so softened by thy Spirit, and the hardness which has hitherto prevailed may be
so corrected, that we may submit ourselves to thee with genuine docility,
especially as thou dost so kindly and tenderly invite us to thyself, that being
allured by thy sweet invitation, we may run, and so run as not to be weary in
our course, until Christ shall at length bring us together to thee, and, at the
same time, lead us to thee for that eternal life, which he has obtained for us
by his own blood. Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here that the people would be in
every way happy after their return to God&#8217;s favour: and, at the same time,
he reminds us that the cause of all evils is, that men provoke God&#8217;s
wrath. Hence, when God is angry, all things must necessarily be adverse to us;
for as God has all creatures at his will, and in his hand, he can arm them in
vengeance against us whenever he pleases: but when he is propitious to us, he
can make all things in heaven and earth to be conducive to our safety. As then
he often threatens in the Law, that when he purposed to punish the people, he
would make brute animals, and the birds of heaven, and all kinds of reptiles, to
execute his judgement, so in this place he declares that there would be peace to
men when he received them into favour.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make a

5:19;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">by which words God shows that we cannot escape his
vengeance when he is angry with us; for he will arm against us lions and bears
as well as serpents, both at home and abroad. But he says here, &#8216;I will
make a covenant for them with the beasts;&#8217; so that they may perform their
duty towards us: for they were all created, we know, for this end, &#8212; to be
subject to men. Since, then, they were destined for our benefit, they ought,
according to their nature, to be in subjection to us: and we know that Adam
caused this, &#8212; that wild beasts rise up so rebelliously against us; for
otherwise they would have willingly and gently obeyed us. Now since there is
this horrible disorder, that brute beasts, which ought to own men as their
masters, rage against them, the Lord recalls us here to the first order of
nature, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make a covenant
for them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the beast of the
field</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which means, &#8220;I will make brute
animals to know for what end they were formed, that is, to be subject to the
dominion of men, and to show no rebelliousness any more.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the intention of the Prophet: he
reminds the Israelites that all things were adverse to their safety as long as
they were alienated from God; but that when they returned into favour with him,
this disorder, which had for a time appeared, would be no longer; for the
regular order of nature would prevail, and brute animals would suffer themselves
to be brought to obedience. This is the covenant of which the Prophet now speaks
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make a
covenant for them, that is, in their name, with the beast of the field, and with
the bird of heaven, and with the reptile of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will shatter the bow, and the
sword, and the battle</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, every warlike
instrument; for under the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmjlm
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;milchamah&#8221;, the Prophet includes every
thing adapted for war. Hence, &#8220;I will shatter&#8221; every kind of weapons
&#8220;in that day, and make them dwell securely&#8221;. In the last clause he
expresses the end for which the weapons and swords were to be shattered, &#8212;
that the Israelites before disquieted by various fears, might dwell in peace,
and no more fear any danger. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is meet for us to call to mind what we have
before said, that the Prophet so speaks of the people&#8217;s restoration, that
he extends his predictions to the kingdom of Christ, as we may learn from
Paul&#8217;s testimony already cited. We then see that God&#8217;s favor, of
which the Prophet now speaks, is not restricted to a short time or to a few
years but extends to Christ&#8217;s kingdom, and is what we have in common with
the ancient people. Let us therefore know, that if we provoke not God against us
by our sins, all things will be subservient to the promotion of our safety, and
that it is our fault when creatures do not render us obedience: for when we
mutiny against God, it is no wonder that brute animals should become ferocious
and rage against us; for what peace can there be, when we carry on war against
God himself? Hence were men, as they ought, to submit to God&#8217;s authority,
there would be no rebelliousness in brute animals; nay, all who are turbulent
would gently rest under the protection of God. But as we are insolent against
God, he justly punishes us by stirring up against us various contentions and
various tumults. Hence, then swords, hence bows, are prepared against us, and
hence wars are stirred up against us: all this is because we continue to fight
against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must, at the same time, be further noticed, that
it is a singular benefit for a people to dwell in security; for we know that
though we may possess all other things, yet miserable is our condition, unless
we live in peace: hence the Prophet mentions this as the summit of a happy life.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again makes known the manner in
which God would receive into favor his people. As though the people had not
violated the marriage vow, God promises to be to them like a bridegroom, who
marries a virgin, young and pure. We have before spoken of the people&#8217;s
defection; but as God had repudiated them, it was no common favor for the people
to be received again by God, and received with pardon. When a woman returns to
her husband, it is a great thing in the husband to forgive her, and not to
upbraid her with her former base conduct: but God goes farther than this; for he
espouses to himself a people infamous through many disgraceful acts; and having
abolished their sins, he contracts, as it were, a new marriage, and joins them
again to himself. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will espouse thee to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We now perceive the import of the word,
espouse: for God thereby means, that he would not remember the unfaithfulness
for which he had before cast away his people, but would blot out all their
infamy. It was indeed an honorable reception into favor, when God offered a new
marriage, as though the people had not been like an adulterous
woman.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will espouse thee to me for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is here an implied contrast between
the marriage of which the Prophet had hitherto spoken, and this which God now
contracts. For God, having redeemed the people, had before entered, as we have
said, into marriage with them: but the people had departed from their vow; hence
followed alienation and divorce. That marriage was then not only temporary, but
also weak and soon broken; for the people did not continue long in obedience:
but of this new marriage the Prophet declares, that it will continue fast and
for ever; and thus he sets its durable state in contrast with the falling away
which had soon alienated the people from God. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will espouse thee to me for
ever.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then declares by what means he would do this, even
in righteousness and judgment, and then in kindness and mercies, and thirdly, in
faithfulness. God had indeed from the beginning covenanted with the Israelites
in righteousness and judgment; there was nothing disguised or false in his
covenant: as then God had in sincerity adopted the people, to what vices does he
oppose righteousness and judgment? I answer, These words must be applied to both
the contracting parties: then, by righteousness God means not only his own, but
that also which is, as they say, mutual and reciprocal; and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is meant rectitude, in which nothing is wanting. We now then perceive what the
Prophet had in view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds, secondly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In kindness and
mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino">: by which words he intimates, that
though the people were unworthy, yet, this would be no impediment in their way,
to prevent them to return into favor with God; for in this reconciliation God
would regard his own goodness, rather than the merits of his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the third place, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
faithfulness</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and this confirms what we have
before briefly referred to, &#8212; the fixed and unchangeable duration of this
marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words, righteousness and judgment, are, I know,
more refinedly explained by some. They say that righteousness is what is
conferred on us by God through gratuitous imputation; and they take judgment for
that defense which he affords against the violence and the assaults of our
enemies. But here the Prophet, I doubt not, intimates in a general way, that
this covenant would stand firm, because there would be truth and rectitude on
both sides. That this may be more clearly understood, let us take a passage from
the 31<sup>st</sup> chapter of
Jeremiah</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">where God complains, that the covenant he had
made with the ancient people had not been firm; for they had forsaken it.
&#8216;My covenant,&#8217; he says, &#8216;with your fathers has not
continued.&#8217; &#8212; Why? &#8216;Because they departed from my
commandments.&#8217; God indeed in perfect sincerity adopted the people, and no
righteousness was wanting in him; but as there was no constancy and faithfulness
in the people, the covenant came to nothing: hence God afterwards adds, &#8216;I
will hereafter make a new covenant with you; for I will engrave my laws on your
hearts,&#8217; etc.. We now then see what the Prophet means by righteousness and
judgment, even this, that God would cause the marriage vow to be kept on both
sides; for the people, restored from exile, would no more violate their pledged
faith nor act unfaithfully.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice what is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In goodness and
mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And this part Jeremiah does not omit,
for he adds, &#8216;Their iniquities I will not remember.&#8217; As then the
Israelites, conscious of evils might tremble through fear, the Prophet
seasonably anticipates their diffidence, by promising that the marriage which
God was prepared anew to contract, would be in kindness and mercies. There is
then no reason why their own unworthiness should frighten away the people; for
God here unfolds his own immense goodness and unparalleled mercies. The Prophet
might indeed have expressed this in one word, but he adds mercies to goodness.
The people had indeed sunk into a deep abyss, that restoration could have been
hardly hoped: hence the word, kindness, or goodness, would have been hardly
sufficient to raise up their minds, had not the word, mercies, been added for
the sake of confirmation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he adds, <i>in faithfulness</i>; and by
faithfulness is to be understood, I doubt not, that stability of which I have
spoken; for what some philosophize on this expression is too refined, who give
this explanation, &#8216;I will espouse thee in faith,&#8217; that is by the
gospel; for we embrace God&#8217;s free promises, and thus the covenant the Lord
makes with US is ratified. I simply interpret the word as denoting
stability.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet shows afterwards that this covenant
would be confirmed, because faithfulness would be reciprocal,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, <i>Jehovah</i>. Jeremiah, I
doubt not, borrowed from this place what is written in the 31<sup>st</sup>
chapter; for there he also adds, &#8216;No one shall hereafter teach his
neighbor, for all, from the least to the greatest shall know me, saith
Jehovah.&#8217; Our Prophet says here in one sentence,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall know
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Hence then is the stability of
the covenant, because God by his light shall guide the hearts of those who had
before strayed in darkness and wandered after their own superstitions. Since
then a horrible darkness prevailed among the Israelitic people, Hosea promises
the light of true knowledge; and this knowledge of God is such, that the people
fall not away from the Lord, nor are they seduced by the fallacies of Satan.
Hence God&#8217;s covenant stands firm. We now understand the import of the
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jerome thinks that the Prophet promises espousals
thrice, because the Lord once espoused the people to himself in Abraham, then
when he led them out of Egypt, and, thirdly, when once he reconciled the whole
world in Christ: but this is too refined, and even frivolous. I take a simpler
meaning, &#8212; that the Prophet proclaims an espousal thrice, because it was
difficult to restore the people from fear and despair, for they well understood
how grievously and in how many ways they had alienated themselves from God: it
was hence necessary to apply many consolations, which might serve to confirm
their faith. This is the reason why the Lord does not say once,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will espouse thee to
myself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> but repeats it thrice. The
Prophet indeed seemed then to speak of a thing incredible: for what sort of an
example is this, that the Lord should take for his wife an abominable harlot?
Nay, that he should contract a new marriage with an unclean adulteress, immersed
in debauchery? This was like something monstrous. Hence the Prophet, that
nothing might hinder souls from recumbing on the promise, says, &#8220;Doubt
not, for the Lord very often assures you, that this is
certain.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, since we have this promise in common with them,
we see by the words of the Prophet what is the beginning of our salvation: God
espoused the Israelites to himself, when restored from exile through his
goodness and mercies. What fellowship have we with God, when we are born and
come out of the womb, except he graciously adopts us? for we bring nothing, we
know, with us but a curse; this is the heritage of all mankind. Since it is so,
all our salvation must necessarily have its foundation in the goodness and
mercies of God. But there is also another reason in our case, when God receives
us into favor; for we were covenant-breakers under the Papacy; there was not one
of us who had not departed from the pledge of his baptism; and so we could not
have returned into favor with God, except he had freely united us to himself:
and God not only forgave us, but contracted also a new marriage with us, so that
we can now, as on the day of our youth, as it has been previously said, openly
give thanks to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice this short clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall know
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We indeed see that we are in confusion
as soon as we turn aside from the right and pure knowledge of God, nay, that we
are wholly lost. Since then our salvation consists in the light of faith, our
minds ought ever to be directed to God, that our union with him, which he has
formed by the gospel, may abide firm and permanent. But as this is not in the
power or will of man, we draw this evident conclusion, that God not only offers
his grace in the outward preaching, but at the same time in the renewing of our
hearts. Except God then recreates us a new people to himself, there is no more
stability in the covenant he makes now with us than in the old which he made
formerly with the fathers under the Law; for when we compare ourselves with the
Israelites, we find that we are nothing better. It is, therefore, necessary that
God should work inwardly and efficaciously on our hearts, that his covenant may
stand firm: nay, since the knowledge of him is the special gift of the Spirit,
we may with certainty conclude, that what is said here refers not only to
outward preaching, but that the grace of the Spirit is also joined, by which God
renews us after his own image, as we have already proved from a passage in
Jeremiah: but that we may not seem to borrow from another place, we may say that
it appears evident from the words of the Prophet, that there is no other bond of
stability, by which the covenant of God can be strengthened and preserved, but
the knowledge he conveys to us of himself; and this he conveys not only by
outward teaching, but also by the illumination of our minds by his Spirit, yea,
by the renewing of our hearts. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Lord promises again that he will not be wanting
to the people, when they shall be reconciled to him. We must, indeed, in the
first place, seek that God may be propitious to us; for they are very foolish
who desire to live well and happily, and in the meantime care nothing for
God&#8217;s favor. The Prophet shows when the happiness of men begins; it begins
when God adopts them for his people, and when, having abolished their sins, he
espouses them to himself. It is therefore necessary, in the first place, to seek
this; for as we have said, the desire of being happy is preposterous, when we
first seek the blessings of an earthly life, when we first seek ease, abundance
of good things, health of body, and similar things. Hence the Prophet now shows,
that we are then only happy when the Lord is reconciled to us, and not only so,
but when he in his love embraces us, and contracts a holy marriage with us, and
on this condition, that he will be a father and preserver to us, and that we
shall be safe and secure under his protection and defense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But at the same time he comes down to things of the
second rank. Our happiness is, indeed, as we have said, in the enjoyment of
God&#8217;s love; but there are accessions which afterwards follow; for the Lord
provides for us, and exercises a care over us, so that he supplies whatever is
needful for the support of life. Of this later part the Prophet now treats: he
says, <i>In that day</i>. We see that he reminds us of the covenant, lest we be
content with worldly abundance; for as it has been said, men are commonly
devoted to their present advantages. Hence the Prophet sets here before our eyes
the Lord&#8217;s covenant; he afterwards adds, that God&#8217;s favor would
reach to the corn, and to the wine, and the oil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the Prophet&#8217;s words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
answer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>one,</i> means to answer, but it is here equivalent to
hear,)</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will hear the heavens, and they
will hear the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The repetition is not
superfluous; for the Israelites had been for some time consumed by famine,
before they were led away into exile; as though the heavens were iron, no drop
of rain came down. They might hence have thought that there was now no hope; but
God here raises them up, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
hear, I will hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says; as though he
said, &#8220;There is no reason for the miserable condition in which I have
suffered you long to languish as your sins deserved, to discourage you; for I
will hereafter hear the heavens.&#8221; As the Prophet before reminded them that
when the beasts were cruel to them, it was a token of God&#8217;s wrath; so also
he teaches by these words that the heavens are not dry through any hidden
influence; but that when God withholds his favor, there is no rain by which the
heavens irrigate the earth. Then God here plainly shows that the whole order of
nature, as they say, is in his hand, that no drop of rain descends from heaven
except by his bidding, nor can the earth produce any grass; in short, that all
nature would be barren were he not to fructify it by his blessing. And this is
the reason why he says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will
hear the heavens and they will hear the earth, and the earth will hear the corn,
and the wine, and the oil, and all these will hear
Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet used the word, Jezreel, before in a bad
sense; for his purpose was to reproach the Israelites with their unfaithfulness:
when they boasted of being the seed of Abraham, and always claimed that
honorable and noble distinction, the Lord said, &#8216;Ye are Jezreel, and not
Israel.&#8217; It may be that the Prophet wished to show again what they
deserved; but he teaches, at the same time, that God would by no means be
prevented from showing kindness to the unworthy when reconciled to him. Though,
then, they were rather Jezreelites than Israelites, yet their unworthiness would
be no impediment, that God should not deal bountifully with them. There may also
be an allusion here to a new people; for it follows in the next verse,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyt[rzw</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>usarotie,</i> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will sow
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and the word, Jezreel, has an
affinity to this verb, it is indeed derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>saro, </i>which is to sow: and as the Prophet presently adds, that Jezreel
is, as it were, the seed of God, I do not disapprove of this supposed allusion.
But yet the Prophet seems here to commend the grace of God, when he declares
that they were Jezreelites with whom God would deal so kindly as to fructify the
earth for their sake.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now again repeat the substance of the whole,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The corn, and the wine, and the
oil, will hear Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Israelites
were famished, and as it is usual with those in want of food, they cried out,
&#8216;Who will give us bread, and wine, and oil?&#8217; For the stomach, as it
is said, has no ears; nor has it reason and judgment: when there is extreme
want, men, as if they were distracted, will call for bread, and wine, and oil.
God then has regard for these blind instincts of men, which only crave what will
gratify them: hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
corn, and wine, and oil, will hear
Jezreel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8212; but when? Even when the
earth will supply trees with sap and moisture, and extend to the seed its
strength; it is then that the earth will hear the corn, and the wine, and the
oil: for these grow not of themselves, but derive supplies from the earth; and
hence the earth is said to hear them. But cannot the earth of itself hear the
corn, or the wine, or the oil? By no means, except rain descends from heaven.
Since, then, the earth itself draws moisture and wetness from heaven, we see
that men in vain cry out in famine, except they look up to heaven: and heaven is
ruled by the will of God. Let men, therefore, learn to ascend up to God, that
they may seek from him their daily bread.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see how suitable is this gradation
employed by the Prophet, by which God, on account of the rude and weak
comprehension of men, leads them up at last to himself. For they turn their
thoughts to bread, and wine, and oil; from these they seek food: they are in
this matter very stupid. Be it so; God is indulgent to their simplicity and
ignorance; for by degrees he proceeds from corn, and wine, and oil, to the
earth, and then from the earth to heaven; and he afterwards shows that heaven
cannot pour down rain except at his will. It follows at last

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here takes the occasion to speak of the
increase of the people. He had promised a fruitful and large increase of corn,
and wine, and oil; but for what end would this be, except the land had numerous
inhabitants? It was hence needful to make this addition. Besides, the Prophet
had said before, &#8216;Though ye be immense in number, yet a remnant only shall
be preserved.&#8217; He now sets God&#8217;s new favor in opposition to his
vengeance, and says, that God will again sow the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this sentence we learn that the allusion in the
word, Jezreel, has not been improperly noticed by some, that is, that they, who
had been before a degenerate people and not true Israelites shall then be the
seed of God: yet the words admit of two senses; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rz</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>saro,</i> applies to the earth as well as to seed. The Hebrews say,
&#8216;The earth is sown,&#8217; and also, &#8216;The wheat is sown,&#8217; or
any other grain. If then the Prophet compares the people to the earth, the sense
will be, I will sow the people as I do the earth; that is, I will make them
fruitful as the earth when it is productive. It must then be thus
rendered</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, I will sow her for me
as the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, as though she were my
earth. Or it may be rendered thus, I will sow her for myself in the earth, and
for this end, that the earth, which was for a time waste and desolate, might
have many inhabitants, as we know was the case. But the relative pronoun in the
feminine gender ought not to embarrass us, for the Prophet ever speaks as of a
woman: the people, we know, have been as yet described to us under the person of
a woman.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmjwrAal</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>La-ruchamae.</i> He speaks here either of <i>La-ruchamae,</i> an adulterous
daughter, or an adulterous woman, whom a husband takes to himself. As to the
matter itself, it is easy to learn what the Prophet means, which is, that God
would diffuse an offspring far and wide, when the people had been brought not
only to a small number, but almost to nothing: for how little short of entire
ruin was the desolation of the people when scattered into banishment? They were
then, as it has been stated, like a body torn asunder: the land in the meantime
enjoyed its Sabbaths; God had disburdened it of its
inhabitants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then understand the meaning of the Prophet to be,
that God would multiply the people, that the small remnant would increase to a
great and almost innumerable offspring.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sow her in the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, throughout the whole land;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will have mercy on
La-ruchamae</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, I will in mercy embrace
her, who had not obtained mercy;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will say to the no-people,
Ye are now my people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We see that the
Prophet insists on this, &#8212; That the people would not only seek the outward
advantages of the present life, but would make a beginning at the very fountain,
by regaining the favor of God, and knowing him as their propitious Father: for
this is the meaning of the Prophet, of which something more will be said
to-morrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we are in

blame of all our evils, that we may be thus led to a genuine feeling of
repentance, and so strive to be reconciled to thee in Christ, that we may wholly
depend on thy paternal love, and thus ever aspire to the fulness of eternal
felicity, through thy goodness and that immeasurable kindness which thou

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said in our lecture yesterday, that the Prophet
does not in vain bear a testimony again to God&#8217;s paternal favor to his
people; for it is our chief happiness, when God acknowledges us as his own, and
when we also can come to his presence with sure confidence. Hence the order of
the Prophet&#8217;s words ought to be noticed:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will have
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on
Lo-ruchama</i></font><font face="Palatino">; which means, I will be propitious
to the Israelites whom I have hitherto deprived of my favor: &#8220;and I will
say to the no-people, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people
are you</i></font><font face="Palatino">: then it follows
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they will say to me, Thou art
our God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, indeed, means that God anticipates us
with his favor; for we are otherwise restrained from access to him. Then God of
his own good-will precedes, and extends his band to us, and then follows the
consent of our faith. Hence God first speaks to the Israelites, that they might
know that they are now counted his people: and then, after God has testified of
his favor, they answer, &#8216;Thou beginnest now to be from henceforth our
God.&#8217; We hence see that the beginning of all good is from God, when he
makes of aliens friends, and adopts as his sons those who were before his
enemies.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The substance of this chapter is, That it was
God&#8217;s purpose to keep in firm hope the minds of the faithful during the
exile, lest being overwhelmed with despair they should wholly faint. The Prophet
had before spoken of God&#8217;s reconciliation with his people; and he
magnificently extolled that favor when he said, &#8216;Ye shall be as in the
valley of Achor, I will restore to you the abundance of all blessings; in a
word, ye shall be in all respects happy.&#8217; But, in the meantime, the daily
misery of the people continued. God had indeed determined to remove them into
Babylon. They might, therefore, have despaired under that calamity, as though
every hope of deliverance were wholly taken from them. Hence the Prophet now
shows that God would so restore the people to favor, as not immediately to blot
out every remembrance of his wrath, but that his purpose was to continue for a
time some measure of his severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that this prediction occupies a middle
place between the denunciation the Prophet previously pronounced and the promise
of pardon. It was a dreadful thing, that God should divorce his people and cast
away the Israelites as spurious children: but a consolation was afterwards
added. But lest the Israelites should think that God would immediately, as on
the first day, be so propitious to them as to visit them with no chastisement,
it was the Prophet&#8217;s design expressly to correct this mistake, as though
he said, &#8216;God will indeed receive you again, but in the meantime a
chastisement is prepared for you, which by its intenseness would break down your
spirits were it not that this comfort will ease you, and that is, that God,
though he punishes you for your sins, yet continues to provide for your
salvation, and to be as it were your husband.&#8217; We now perceive the
intention of the Prophet. But I shall first run over the words, and then return
to the subject</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah said to me, Go yet and love
a woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no doubt but that God
describes here the favor he promises to the Israelites in a type or vision: for
they are too gross in their notions, who think that the Prophet married a woman
who had been a harlot. It was then only a vision, as though God had set a
picture before the eyes of the people, in which they might see their own
conduct. And when he says, &#8220;yet&#8221;, he refers to the vision, mentioned
in the first chapter. But he bids a woman to be loved before he took her to be
the partner of his conjugal bed; which ought to be noticed: for God intends here
to make a distinction between the people&#8217;s restoration and his hidden
favor. God then before he restored the people from exile, loved them as it were
in their widowhood. We now understand why the Prophet does not say, &#8216;Take
to thee a wife,&#8217; but, &#8216;love a woman.&#8217; The meaning is this: God
intimates, that though exile would be sad and bitter, yet the people, whom he
treated with sharpness and severity, were still dear to him. Hence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Love a woman, who had been loved
by a husband</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ro,</i> is here to be taken for a husband, as it is in the second chapter of
Jeremiah, where it is said, &#8216;Perfidiously have the children of Israel
dealt with me, as though a woman had departed from her husband,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[rm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meroe,&#8217;</i>, or, &#8216;from her partner.&#8217; And there is an
aggravation of the crime implied in this word: for women, when they prostitute
themselves, often complain that they have done so through too much severity,
because they were not treated with sufficient kindness by their husbands; but
when a husband behaves kindly towards his wife, and performs his duty as a
husband, there is then less excuse for a wife, in case she fixes her affections
on others. To increase then the sin of the people, this circumstance is stated
that the woman had been loved by her friend or partner, and yet that this
kindness of her husband had not preserved her mind in chastity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the love of Jehovah
towards the children of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
As God loved the people of Israel, who yet ceased not to look to other gods.
This metaphor occurs often in Scripture, that is, when the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnp
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;panah&#8221;, which means in Hebrew, to look
to, is used to express hope or desire: so that when men&#8217;s minds are intent
on any thing, or their affections fixed on it, they are said to look to that.
Since then the Israelites boiled with insane ardor for their superstitions, they
are said to look to other gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they love flagons of
grapes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet, I doubt not, compares this
rage to drunkenness: and he mentions flagons of grapes rather than of wine,
because idolaters are like drunkards, who sometimes so gorge themselves, that
they have no longer a taste for wine; yea, the very smell of wine offends them,
and produces nausea through excessive drinking; but they try new arts by which
they may regain their fondness for wine. And such is the desire of novelty that
prevails in the superstitious. At one time they go after this, at another time
after that, and their minds are continually tossed to and fro, because they
cannot acquiesce in the only true God. We now then perceive what this metaphor
means, when the Prophet reproaches the Israelites, because they loved flagons of
grapes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to what the Prophet, or rather God, had
in view. God here comforts the hearts of the faithful, that they might surely
conclude that they were loved, even when they were chastised. It was indeed
necessary that this difference should have been well impressed on the
Israelites, that they might in exile entertain hope and patiently bear
God&#8217;s chastisement, and rise that this hope might mitigate the bitterness
of sorrow. God therefore says that though he shows not himself as yet reconciled
to them, but appears as yet severe, at the same time he is not without love. And
hence we learn how useful this doctrine is, and how widely it opens; for it
affords a consolation of which we all in common have need. When God humbles us
by adversities, when he shows to us some tokens of severity or wrath, we cannot
but instantly fail, were not this thought to occur to us, that God loves us,
even when he is severe towards us, and that though he seems to cast us away, we
are not yet altogether aliens, for he retains some affection even in the midst
of his wrath; so that he is to us as a husband, though he admits us not
immediately into conjugal honor, nor restores us to our former rank. We now then
see how the doctrine is to be applied to ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time notice the reproachful
conduct of which I have spoken, &#8212; That though the woman was loved yet she
could not be preserved in chastity, and that she was loved, though an
adulteress. Here is pointed out the most shameful ingratitude of the people, and
contrasted with it is God&#8217;s infinite mercy and goodness. It was the summit
of wickedness in the people to forsake their God, when he had treated them with
so much benignity and kindness. But wonderful was the patience of God, when he
ceased not to love a people, whom he had found to be so perverse, that they
could not be turned by any acts of kindness nor retained by any
favors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the flagons of grapes we may observe,
that this strange disposition is ever dominant in the superstitious, and that
is, that they wander here and there after their own devices, and have nothing
fixed in them. Lest, then, such charms deceive us, let us learn to cleave firmly
and constantly to the word of the Lord. Indeed the Papists of this day boast of
their ancientness, when they would create an ill-will towards us; as though the
religion we follow were new and lately invented: but we see how modern their
superstitions are; for a passion for them bubbles up continually and they have
nothing that remains constant: and no wonder, because the eternal truth of God
is regarded by them as of no value. If, then, we desire to restrain this
depraved lust, which the Prophet condemns in the Israelites, let us so adhere to
the word of the Lord, that no novelty may captivate us and lead us astray. It
now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">These verses have been read together, for in these
four the Prophet explains the vision presented to him. He says, first, that he
had done what had been enjoined him by God; which was conveyed to him by a
vision, or in a typical form, that by such an exhibition he might impress the
minds of the people: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
bought</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, a wife for fifteen silverings,
and for a corus of barley and half a corus; that is, for a corus 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and a
half. He tells us in this verse that he had bought the wife whom he was to take
for a small price. By the <i>fifteen</i> silverings and the corus and half of
barley is set forth, I have no doubt, her abject and mean condition. Servants,
we know, were valued at thirty shekels of silver when hurt by an ox,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
21:32.) But the Prophet gives her for his wife fifteen silvering; which seemed a
contemptible gift. But then the Lord shows, that though he would but scantily
support his people in exile, they would still be dear to him, as when a husband
loves his wife though he does not indulge her, when that would be inexpedient:
overmuch indulgence, as it is well known, has indeed often corrupted those who
have gone astray. When a husband immediately pardons an adulterous wife, and
receives her with a smiling countenance, and fawningly humbles himself by laying
aside his own right and authority, he acts foolishly, and by his levity ruins
his wife: but when a husband forgives his wife, and yet strictly confines her
within the range of duty, and restrains his own feelings, such a moderate course
is very beneficial and shows no common prudence in the husband; who, though he
is not cruel, is yet not carried away by foolish love. This, then is what the
Prophet means, when he says, that he had given for his wife fifteen silverings
and a corus and half of barley. Respectable women did not, indeed, live on
barley. The Prophets then, gave to his wife, not wheat-flour, nor the fine flour
of wheat, but black bread and coarse food; yea, he gave her barley as her
allowance, and in a small quantity, that his wife might have but a scanty
living. We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some elicit a contrary sense, that the Lord would
splendidly and sumptuously support the wife who had been an adulteress; but this
view by no means harmonizes with the Prophet&#8217;s design, as we have already
seen. Besides, the words themselves lead us another way. Jerome, as his practice
is, refines in allegorizing. He says, that the people were bought for fifteen
silverings, because they came out of Egypt on the fifteenth day of the month;
and then he says, that as the Hebrew homer contains thirty bushels, they were
bought for a corus and half, which is forty-five bushels. because the law was
promulgated forty-five days after. But these are puerile trifles. Let then the
simple view which I have given be sufficient for us, &#8212; that God, though he
favored her, not immediately with the honor of a wife and liberal support, yet
ceased not to love her. Thus we see the minds of the faithful were sustained to
bear patiently their calamities; for it is an untold consolation to know that
God loves us. If a testimony respecting his love moderates not our sorrows, we
are very ill-natured and ungrateful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then more clearly proves in these words,
that God loved his people, though he seemed to be alienated from them. He might
have wholly destroyed them: he yet supplied them with food in their exile. The
people indeed lived in the greatest straits; and all delicacies were no doubt
taken from them, and their fare was very sordid and very scanty: but the Prophet
forbids them to measure God&#8217;s favor by the smallness of what was given
them; for though God would not immediately receive into favor a wife who had
been an adulteress, yet he wished her to continue his wife.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I said to her, For many days
shalt thou tarry for me, and thou shalt not become wanton, and thou shalt not be
for any man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8216;Thou shalt remain
a widow; for it is for this reason that I still retain thee, to find out whether
thou wilt sincerely repent. I would not indeed be too easy towards thee, lest I
should by indulgence corrupt thee: I shall see what thy conduct will be: you
must in the meantime continue a widow.&#8217; This, then was God&#8217;s small
favor which remained for the people, even a sort of widowhood. God might,
indeed, as we have said, have utterly destroyed his people: but he mitigated his
wrath and only punished them with exile, and in the meantime, proved that he was
not forgetful of his banished people. Though then he only bestowed some scanty
allowance, he yet did not wholly deprive them of food, nor suffer them to perish
through want. This treatment then in reality is set forth by this
representation, that the Prophet had bidden his wife to remain
single.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I also shall be for
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> why does he say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I also?</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">A wife, already joined to her husband, has no right
to pledge her faith to another. Then the Prophet shows that Israel was held
bound by the Lord, that they might not seek another connection, for his faith
was pledged to them. Hence he says, I also shall be for thee; that is, &#8216;I
pledge my faith to thee, or, I subscribe myself as thy husband: but another time
must be looked for; I yet defer my favor, and suspend it until thou givest proof
of true repentance.&#8217; &#8220;I also&#8221;, he says, &#8220;shall be for
thee&#8221;; that is, &#8216;Thou shalt not be a widow in vain, if thou
complainest that wrong is done to thee, because I forbid thee to marry any one
else, I also bind myself in turn to thee.&#8217; Now then is evident the mutual
compact between God and his people, so that the people, though a state of
widowhood be full of sorrows ought not yet to succumb to grief, but to keep
themselves exclusively for God, till the time of their full and complete
deliverance, because he says, that he will remain true to his pledge. &#8220;I
will then be thine: though at present, I admit thee not into the honor of wives,
I will not yet wholly repudiate thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how does this view harmonize with the first
prediction, according to which God seems to have divorced his people? Their
concurrence may be easily explained. The Prophet indeed said, that the body of
the people would be alienated from God: but here he addresses the faithful only.
Lest then the minds of those who were healable should despond, the Prophet sets
before them this comfort which I have mentioned, &#8212; that though they were
to continue, as it were, single, yet the Lord would remain, as it were, bound to
them, so as not to adopt another people and reject them. But we shall presently
see that this prediction regards in common the Gentiles as well as the Jews and
Israelites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For many days shall the
children of Israel abide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He says, for
many days, that they might prepare themselves for long endurance, and be not
dispirited through weariness, though the Lord should not soon free them from
their calamities. &#8220;Though then your exile should be long, still
cherish,&#8221; he says, &#8220;strong hope in your hearts; for so long a trial
must necessarily be made of your repentance; as you have very often pretended to
return to the Lord, and soon after your hypocrisy was discovered; and then ye
became hardened in your wilful obstinacy: it is therefore necessary that the
Lord should subdue you by a long chastisement.&#8221; Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The children of Israel shall
abide without a king and without a
prince</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may still be further asked, What is the number
of the days of which the Prophet speaks, for the definite number is not stated
here; and we know that the exile appointed for the Jews was seventy years?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:10.) But the Prophet seems here to extend his prediction farther, even to the
time of Christ. To this I answer, that here he refers simply to the seventy
years; though, at the same time, we must remember that those who returned not
from exile were supported by this promise, and hoped in the promised Mediator:
but the Prophet goes not beyond that number, afterwards prefixed by Jeremiah. It
is not to be wondered at, that the Prophet had not computed the years and days;
for the time of the captivity, that is, of the last captivity, was not yet come.
Shortly after, indeed, four tribes were led away, and then the ten, and the
whole kingdom of Israel was destroyed: but the last ruin of the whole people was
not yet so near. It was therefore not necessary to compute then the years; but
he speaks of a long time indefinitely, and speaks of the children of Israel and
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall abide without a
king and without a prince:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and inasmuch as they
placed their trust in their king, and thought themselves happy in having this
one distinction, a powerful king, he says, They shall abide without a king,
without a prince. He now explains their widowhood without similitudes: hence he
says, They shall be without a <i>king</i> and a <i>prince,</i> that is, there
shall be among them no kind of civil government; they shall be like a mutilated
body without a head; and so it happened to them in their miserable
dispersion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And without a sacrifice, he says,
and without a statue.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrews take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsabe,</i> often in a bad sense, though it means generally a statue, as a
monument over a grave is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsabe,</i>: but the Prophet seems to speak here of idols, for he afterwards
adds, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yprt
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;teraphim&#8221;; and teraphim were no doubt
images, (Genesis 31:19-30,)<i> </i>which the superstitious used while
worshipping their fictitious gods, as we read in many places. The king of
Babylon is said to have consulted the teraphim; and it is said that Rachel stole
the teraphim, and shortly after Laban calls the teraphim his gods. But the
Hebrews talk idly when they say that these images were made of a constellation,
and that they afterwards uttered words: but all this has been invented, and we
know what liberty they take in devising fables. The meaning is, that God would
take away from the people of Israel all civil order, and then all sacred rites
and ceremonies, that they might abide as a widow, and at the same time know,
that they were not utterly rejected by God without hope of
reconciliation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, why &#8220;ephod&#8221; is mentioned;
for the priesthood continued among the tribe of Judah, and the ephod, it is well
known, was a part of the sacerdotal dress. To this I answer, that when Jeroboam
introduced false worship, he employed this artifice &#8212; to make religion
among the Israelites nearly like true religion in its outward form: for it seems
to have been his purpose that it should vary as little as possible from the
legitimate worship of God: hence he said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;It is grievous and
troublesome to you to go up to Jerusalem; then let us worship God here,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Kings 12:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he pretended to change nothing; he would not
appear to be an apostate, departing from the only true God. What then?
&#8220;God may be worshipped without trouble by us here; for I will build
temples in several places, and also erect altars: what hinders that sacrifices
should not be offered to God in many places?&#8221; There is therefore no doubt
but that he made his altars according to the form of the true altar, and also
added the ephod and various ceremonies, that the Israelites might think that
they still continued in the true worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afterwards shall the children of
Israel return and seek Jehovah their God, and David their
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet shows by the fruit of
their chastisement, that the Israelites had no reason to murmur or clamour
against God, as though he treated them with too much severity; for if he had
stretched out his hand to them immediately, there would have been in them no
repentance: but when thoroughly cleansed by long correction, they would then
truly and sincerely confess their God. We then see that this comfort is set
forth as arising from the fruit of chastisement, that the Israelites might
patiently bear the temporary wrath of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afterwards</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
return</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he said, &#8220;They are now
led away headlong into their impiety, and they can by no means be restrained
except by this long endurance of evils.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return, and then will they seek
Jehovah their God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The name of the only true
God is set here in opposition, as before, to all Baalim. The Israelites, indeed,
professed to worship God; but Baalim, we know, were at the same time in high
esteem among them, who were so many gods, and had crept into the place of God,
and extinguished his pure worship: hence the Prophet says not simply, They shall
seek God, but they shall &#8220;seek Jehovah their God&#8221;. And there is here
an implied reproof in the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Elohehem&#8221;;
for it intimates that they were drawn aside into ungodly superstitions, that
they were without the true God, that no knowledge of him existed among them;
though God had offered himself to them, yea, had familiarly held intercourse
with them, and brought them up as it were in his bosom, as a father his own
children. Hence the Prophet indirectly upbraids them for this great wickedness
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall seek
their God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And who is this God? He is even
Jehovah. They had hitherto formed for themselves vain gods: and though, he says,
they had been deluded by their own devices, they shall now know the only true
God, who from the beginning revealed himself to them even as their God. He
afterwards adds a second clause respecting King David: but I cannot now finish
the subject.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou often
dost justly hide thy face from us, so that on every side we see nothing but
evidences of thy dreadful judgment, &#8212; O grant, that we, with minds raised
above the scene of this world, may at the same time cherish the hope which thou
constantly settest before us, so that we may feel fully persuaded that we are
loved by thee, however severely thou mayest chastise us and may this consolation
so support and sustain our souls, that patiently enduring whatever chastisements
thou mayest lay upon us, we may ever hold fast the reconciliation which thou
hast promised to us in Christ thy Son. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have now to consider the second clause, respecting
King David. The Prophet tells us, that when the Israelites shall be moved with
the desire of seeking God, they shall also seek David their king. They had, as
it is well known, departed from their allegiance to him; though God had set
David over the whole people for this end, &#8212; that they might all be happy
under his power and dominion, and remain safe and secure, as though they beheld
God with their own eyes; for David was, as it were, the angel of God. Then the
revolt of the people, or of the ten tribes, was like a renunciation of the
living God. The Lord said to Samuel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Thee have they not
despised, but rather
me,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Samuel 8:7:)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">this must have been much more the case with regard to
David, whom Samuel, by God&#8217;s command, had anointed, and whom the Lord had
honored with so many bright commendations; they could not have cast away his
yoke, without openly rejecting, as it were, God himself. Hence Hosea, speaking
of the people&#8217;s repentance, does not, without reasons distinctly mention
this, that they shall return to David their king: for they could not sincerely
and from the heart seek God, without subjecting themselves to that lawful
authority to which they had been bound, not by men, nor by chance, but by
God&#8217;s command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed true that David was then dead; but Hosea
sets forth here, in the person of one man, that everlasting kingdom, which the
Jews knew would endure as the sun and moon: for well known to them all was this
remarkable promise,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;As long as the sun and moon shall
shine in heaven, they shall be faithful witnesses to me, that the throne of
David shall continue,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
72:5,18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, after the death of David, the Prophet shows
here that his kingdom would be forever, for he survived in his children; and, as
it evidently appears, they commonly called their Messiah the son of David. We
must now of necessity come to Christ: for Israel could not seek their king,
David, who had been long dead; but were to seek that King whom God had promised
from the posterity of David. This prophecy, then, no doubt extends to Christ:
and it is evident that the only hope of the people being gathered was this, that
God had testified that he would give a Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet had in view: the
Israelites had become degenerate; and, by their perfidy, they ceased to be the
true and genuine people of God, as long as they continued alienated from the
family of David. The Prophet, speaking of their full restoration, now joins
David with God; for they could not be restored to the body of the Church,
without uniting with the Jews in honoring one and the same head. But we must, at
the same time, remember, that the king, whom the Prophet mentions, is not David,
who had been long dead, but his son, to whom the perpetuity of his kingdom had
been promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine is especially useful to us; for it
shows that God is not to be sought except in Christ the mediator. Whosoever,
then, forsakes Christ, forsakes God himself; for as John says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;He who has not the
Son, has not the Father,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 2:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the thing itself proves this; for God dwells in
light inaccessible; how great, then is the distance between us and him? Except
Christ, then, presents himself to us as a middle person, how can we come to God?
But then only we begin really to seek God, when we turn our eyes to Christ, who
willingly offers himself to us. This is the only way of seeking God
aright.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some, with more refinement, contend, that Christ is
Jehovah, because the Prophet says, that he is to be sought not otherwise than as
God is. By the word, seeking, the Prophet indeed means, that the Israelites bad
no other way of being safe and secure than by fleeing under the guardianship and
protection of their legitimate king, whom they knew to have been divinely
ordained for them. This, then, would not be sufficient to confute the Jews. I
take the passage in a simpler way, as meaning, that they would seek their God in
the person of the king, whose hand and efforts God intended to employ in the
preservation of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It further
follows</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, And they shall fear
Jehovah and his goodness in the last
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8221;.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">djp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>peched,</i> means sometimes; to dread, to be frightened as they are who are
so terrified as to lose all courage. But in this place it is to be taken in a
good sense, to fear, as it appears evident from the context. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall fear God and his
goodness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Israelites had before shaken off
the yoke of God: for it was a proof of wanton contempt in them to build a new
temple; to devise, at their own will, a new religion; and, in a word, to allow
themselves an unbridled licentiousness. Hence he says, They shall hereafter
begin to fear God, and shall continue in his service.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds, <i>and his goodness</i>; by which he
means that God would not be dreaded by them, but that he would sweetly allure
them to himself, that they might obey him spontaneously and freely, and even
joyfully: and doubtless God does then only make us really to fear him, when he
gives us a taste of his goodness. For God&#8217;s majesty strikes terror into
us; and we, in the meantime, seek hiding places; and were it possible for us to
withdraw from him, each of us would do so gladly; but it is not to worship God
with due honor, when we flee away from him. It is then a sense of his goodness
that leads us reverentially to fear him. &#8216;With thee,&#8217; says David,
&#8216;is forgiveness, that thou mayest be feared,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
130:4:) for except men know God to be ready to be at peace with them, and feel
assured that he will be propitious to them, no one will seek him, no one will
fear him, for without knowing this, we could not but wish his glory to be
abolished and extinguished, and that he should be without authority, lest he
should become our judge. But every one who has tasted of God&#8217;s goodness,
so orders himself as to obey God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet then means when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall then fear
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is this, that they shall understand that
they were miserable as long as they were alienated from him, and that true
happiness is to submit to his authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But further, this goodness is to be referred to
Christ. Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wbwf</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>thubu,</i> for glory, as in Exodus 33; but the connection of this passage
requires the word to be taken in its proper sense. And God&#8217;s goodness, we
know, is so exhibited to us in Christ, that not a particle of it is to be sought
for anywhere else: for from this fountain must we draw whatever refers to our
salvation and happiness of life. Let us then know that God cannot from the heart
be worshipped by us, except when we behold him in the person of his Son, and
know him to be a kind Father to us: hence John says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;He who honors not
the Son, honors not the
Father,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
5:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the extremity of
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the Prophet wished again to remind
the Israelites of what he had said before, &#8212; that they had need of long
affliction, by which God would by degrees reform them. He then shows that their
perverseness was such, that they would not soon be brought into a right mind;
but that this would be <i>in the extremity of days</i>. At the same time he
relieves the minds of the godly, that they might not, through weariness, grow
faint: for though they were not at first to taste of God s goodness, the Prophet
reminds them that there was no reason to despair, because the Lord would
manifest his goodness in the extremity of days. We may add, that this extremity
of days had its beginning at the return of the people. When liberty was granted
to the Jews to return to their own country, it was the extremity or fulness of
days, of which the Prophet speaks. But a continued series from the
people&#8217;s return to the coming of Christ, must at the same time be
understood; for the Lord then performed more fully what he declares here by his
Prophet. Hence everywhere in Scripture, especially in the New Testament, the
manifestation of Christ is placed in the last times. This chapter is now
explained. The fourth now follows.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This is a new discourse by the Prophet, separate from
his former discourses. We must bear in mind that the Prophets did not literally
write what they delivered to the people, nor did they treat only once of those
things which are now extant with us; but we have in their books collected
summaries and heads of those matters which they were wont to address to the
people. Hosea, no doubt, very often descanted on the exile and the restoration
of the people, forasmuch as he dwelt much on all the things which we have
hitherto noticed. Indeed, the slowness and dullness of the people were such,
that the same things were repeated daily. But it was enough for the Prophets to
make and to write down a brief summary of what they taught in their
discourses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hosea now relates how vehemently he reproved the
people, because every kind of corruption so commonly prevailed, that there was
no sound part in the whole community. We hence see what the Prophet treats of
now; and this ought to be observed, for hypocrites wish ever to be flattered;
and when the mercy of God is offered to them, they seek to be freed from every
fear. It is therefore a bitter thing to them, when threatening are mingled, when
God sharply chides them. &#8220;What! we heard yesterday a discourse on
God&#8217;s mercy, and now he fulminates against us. He is then changeable; if
he were consistent, would not his manner of teaching be alike and the same
today?&#8221; But men must be often awakened, for forgetfulness of God often
creeps over them; they indulge themselves, and nothing is more difficult than to
lead them to God; nay, when they have made some advances, they soon turn aside
to some other course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that men cannot be taught, except God
reproves their sins by his word; and then, lest they despond, gives them a hope
of mercy; and except he again returns to reproofs and threatening. This is the
mode of address which we find in all the Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to the Prophet&#8217;s words:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear</i>,</font><font face="Palatino">
he says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> <i>the word of Jehovah, ye
children of Israel, the Lord has a dispute,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">etc. The Prophet, by saying that the Lord had a
dispute with the inhabitants of the land, intimates that men in vain flatter
themselves, when they have God against them, and that they shall soon find him
to be their Judge, except they in time anticipate his vengeance. But he also
reminds the Israelites that God had a dispute with them, that they might not
have to feel the severity of justice, but reconcile themselves to God, while a
seasonable opportunity was given them. Then the Prophet&#8217;s introduction had
this object in view &#8212; to make the Israelites to know that God would be
adverse to them, except they sought, without delay, to regain his favor. The
Lord then, since he declared that he would contend with them, shows that he was
not willing to do so. for had God determined to punish the people, what need was
there of this warning? Could he not instantly execute judgment on them? Since,
then, the Prophet was sent to the children of Israel to warn them of a great and
fatal danger, God had still a regard for their safety: and doubtless this
warning prevailed with many; for those who were alarmed by this denunciation
humbled themselves before God, and hardened not themselves in wickedness: and
the reprobate, though not amended, were yet rendered twice less
excusable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same is the case among us, whenever God threatens
us with judgment: they who are not altogether intractable or unhealable, confess
their guilt, and deprecate God&#8217;s wrath; and others, though they harden
their hearts in wickedness, cannot yet quench the power of truth; for the Lord
takes from them every pretext for ignorance, and conscience wounds them more
deeply, after they have been thus warned</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet meant by
saying, that God had a dispute with the inhabitants of the land. But that the
Prophet&#8217;s intention may be more clear to us, we must bear in mind, that he
and other faithful teachers were wearied with crying, and that in the meantime
no fruit appeared. He saw that his warnings were heedlessly despised, and that
hence his last resort was to summon men to God&#8217;s tribunal. We also are
constrained, when we prevail nothing, to follow the same course: &#8220;God will
judge you; for no one will bear to be judged by his word: whatever we announce
to you in his name, is counted a matter of sport: he himself at length will show
that he has to do with you.&#8221; In a similar strain does Zechariah
speak,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;They shall look on
him whom they have
pierced,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
12:10:)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and to the same purpose does Isaiah say, that the
Spirit of the Lord was made sad.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Is it not
enough,&#8217; he says, &#8216;that ye should be vexatious to men, except ye be
so also to my God?&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
7:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet joined himself with God; for the ungodly
king Ahab, by tempting God, did at the same time trifle with his
Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then here an implied contrast between the
dispute which God announces respecting the Israelites, and the daily strifes he
had with them by his Prophets. For this reason also the Lord
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;My Spirit shall no
more strive with man, for he is
flesh,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
6:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God indeed says there, that he had waited in vain for
men to return to the right way; for they were refractory beyond any hope of
repentance: he therefore declared, that he would presently punish them. So also
in this place, &#8216;&#8220;The Lord has a trial at law&#8221;; he will now
himself plead his own cause: he has hitherto long exercised his Prophets in
contending with you; yea, he has wearied them with much and continual labour; ye
remain ever like yourselves; he will therefore begin now to plead effectually
his own cause with you: he will no more speak to you by the mouth, but by his
power, show himself a judge.&#8217; The Prophet, however, designedly laid down
the word, <i>dispute,</i> that the Israelites might know that God would severely
treat them, not without cause, nor unjustly, as though he said, &#8220;God will
so punish you as to show at the same time that he will do so for the best
reason: ye elude all threatenings; ye think that you can make yourselves safe by
your shifts: there are no evasions by which you can possibly hope to attain any
thing; for God will at length uncover all your wickedness.&#8221; In short, the
Prophet here joins punishment with God&#8217;s justice, or he points out by one
word, a real (so to speak) or an effectual contention, by which the Lord not
only reproves men in words, but also visits with judgment their
sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because there is no
truth</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"> no kindness, no knowledge of God. The
dispute, he said, was to be with the inhabitants of the land: by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants of the
land,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means the whole body of the people; as
though he said, &#8220;Not a few men have become corrupt, but all kinds of
wickedness prevail everywhere.&#8221; And for the same reason he adds, that
there was no truth&#8221;, etc.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the land;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">as though he said, &#8220;They who sin hide not
themselves now in lurking-places; they seek no recesses, like those who are
ashamed; but so much licentiousness is everywhere dominant, that the whole land
is filled with the contempt of God and with crimes.&#8221; This was a severe
reproof to proud men. How much the Israelites flattered themselves, we know; it
was therefore necessary for the Prophet to speak thus sharply to a refractory
people; for a gentle and kind warning proves effectual only to the meek and
teachable. When the world grows hardened against God, such a rigorous treatment
as the words of the Prophet disclose must be used. Let those then, to whom is
intrusted the charge of teaching, see that they do not gently warn men, when
hardened in their vices; but let them follow this vehemence of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said at the beginning, that the Prophet had a good
reason for being so warm in his indignation: he was not at the moment foolishly
carried away by the heat of zeal; but he knew that he had to do with men so
perverse, that they could not be handled in any other way. The Prophet now
reproves not only one kind of evil, but brings together every sort of crimes; as
though he said, that the Israelites were in every way corrupt and perverted. He
says first, that there was among them no faithfulness, and no kindness. He
speaks here of their contempt of the second table of the law; for by this the
impiety of men is sooner found out, that is, when an examination is made of
their life: for hypocrites vauntingly profess the name of God, and confidently
(<i>plenis buccis &#8212; </i>with full cheeks) arrogate faith to themselves;
and then they cover their vices with the external show of divine worship, and
frigid acts of devotion: nay, the very thing mentioned by Jeremiah is too
commonly the case, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;the house of God
is made a den of
thieves,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
7:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Prophets, that they might drag the ungodly
to the light, examine their conduct according to the duties of love: &#8220;Ye
are right worshipers of God, ye are most holy; but in the meantime, where is
truth, where is mutual faithfulness, where is kindness? If ye are not men, how
can ye be angels? Ye are given to avarice, ye are perfidious, ye are cruel: what
more can be said of you, except that each of you condemns all the rest before
God, and that your life is also condemned by all?&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that <i>truth</i> or <i>faithfulness
</i>was extinct, he makes them to be like foxes, who are ever deceitful: by
saying that there was <i>no kindness,</i> he accuses them of cruelty, as though
he said, that they were like lions and wild beasts. But the fountain of all
these vices he points out in the third clause, when he says, that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no knowledge of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and the knowledge of God he takes
for the fear of God which proceeds from the knowledge of him; as though he said,
&#8220;In a word, men go on as licentiously, as if they did not think that there
is a God in heaven, as if all religion was effaced from their hearts.&#8221; For
as long as any knowledge of God remains in us, it is like a bridle to restrain
us: but when men become wanton, and allow themselves every liberty, it is
certain that they have forgotten God, and that there is in them now no knowledge
of God. Hence the complaints in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;The ungodly have
said in their heart, There is no
God,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
14:1:)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8216;Impiety speaks in my heart, There is no
God.&#8217; Men cannot run headlong into brutal stupidity, while a spark of the
true knowledge of God shines or twinkles in their minds. We now then perceive
the real meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But after having said that they were full of
perfidiousness and cruelty, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By cursing, and lying, and
killing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ale, </i>means to swear: some explain it in this place as signifying to
forswear; and others read the two together,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;jkw
hla</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ale ucachesh,</i> to swear and lie, that is
to deceive by swearing. But as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;alah&#8221; means often to curse, the
Prophet here, I doubt not, condemns the practice of cursing, which was become
frequent and common among the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he enumerates particulars in order more
effectually to check the fierceness of the people; for the wicked, we know, do
not easily bend their neck: they first murmur, then they clamour against
wholesome instruction, and at last they rage with open fury, and break out into
violence, when they cannot otherwise stop the progress of sound doctrine. How
ever this may be, we see that they are not easily led to own their sins. This is
the reason why the Prophet shows here, by stating particulars, in how many ways
they provoked God&#8217;s wrath: &#8216;Lo,&#8217; he says &#8216;cursings,
lyings, murder, thefts, adulteries, abound among you.&#8217; And the Prophet
seems here to allude to the precepts of the law; as though he said, &#8220;If
any one compares your life with the law of God, he will find that you avowedly
and designedly lead such a life, as proves that you fight against God, that you
violate every part of his law.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be here observed, that he speaks not of
such thieves or murderers as are led in our day to the gallows, or are otherwise
punished. On the contrary, he calls them thieves and murderers and adulterers,
who were in high esteem, and eminent in honor and wealth, and who, in short,
were alone illustrious among the people of Israel: such did the Prophet brand
with these disgraceful names, calling them murderers and thieves. So also does
Isaiah speak of them, &#8216;Thy princes are robbers and companions of
thieves,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:23.) And we already reminded you, that the Prophet addresses not his
discourses to few men, but to the whole people; for all, from the least to the
greatest, had fallen away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have broken
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The expression no doubt is to be taken
metaphorically, as though he said, &#8220;There are now no bonds, no
barriers.&#8221; For the people so raged against God, that no modesty, no shame
on account of the law, no religion, no fear, prevailed among them, or checked
their intractable spirit. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they broke
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the word, breaking out, the Prophet
sets forth the furious wantonness seen in the reprobate; when freed from the
fear of God, they abandon themselves to what is sinful, without any moderation,
without any restraint.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to the same purpose he subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bloods are contiguous to
bloods</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By bloods he means all the worst
crimes: and he says that bloods were close to bloods, because they joined crimes
together, and as Isaiah says, that iniquity was as it were a train; so our
Prophet says here, that such was the common liberty they took to sin, that
wherever he turned his eyes, he could see no part free from wickedness. Then
bloods are contiguous to bloods, that is, everywhere is seen the horrible
spectacle of crimes. This is the meaning. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now expresses more clearly the dispute
which he mentions in the first verse; and it now evidently appears, that it was
not a judgment expressed in words, for God had in vain tried to bring the people
to the right way by threats and reproofs: he had contended enough with then;
they remained refractory; hence he adds, &#8220;Now mourn shall the whole
land&#8221;; that is, God has now resolved to execute his judgment: there is
therefore no use for you any more to contrive any evasion, as you have been
hitherto wont to do; for God stretches forth his hand for your ultimate
destruction. Mourn, therefore, shall the land, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut off shall be every one that
dwells in it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as I prefer to render it; unless
the Prophet, it may be, means, that though God should for a time suspend the
last judgment, yet the Israelites would gain nothing, seeing that they would, by
continual languor, pine away. But as he mentions mourning in the first place,
the former meaning, that God would destroy all the inhabitants, seems more
appropriate. He adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, gathered
shall they be all</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or destroyed, (for either
may suit the place,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
beast of the field, and the bird of heaven, to the fishes of the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet here enlarges on the greatness
of God&#8217;s wrath; for he includes even the innocent beasts and the birds of
heaven, yea, the fishes of the sea. When Godly vengeance extends to brute
animals, what will become of men?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some one may here object and say, that it is
unworthy of God to be angry with miserable creatures, which deserve no such
treatment: for why should God be angry with fishes and beasts? But an answer may
be easily given: As beasts, and birds, and fishes, and, in a word, all other
things, have been created for the use of men, it is no wonder that God should
extend the tokens of his curse to all creatures, above and below, when his
purpose is to punish men. We seek, indeed, for the most part, some vain comforts
to delight us, or to moderate our sorrows when God shows himself angry with us:
but when God curses innocent animals for our sake, we then dread the more,
except, indeed, we be under the influence of extreme stupor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why God here denounces
destruction on brute animals as well as on birds and fishes of the sea; it is,
that men may know themselves to be deprived of all his gifts; as when a person,
in order to expose a wicked man to shame, pulls down his house and burns his
whole furniture: so also does God do, who has adorned the world with so much and
such varied wealth for our sake, when he reduces all things to a waste: He
thereby shows how grievously offended he is with us, and thus constrains us to
become humble. This then is the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>

our continual obstinacy, to provoke thy wrath, &#8212; O grant, that being moved
at least by the warnings thou givest us, we may prostrate ourselves before thy

contrary, strive to anticipate thy judgment; and that being at the same time
surely convinced that thou art ready to be reconciled to us in Christ, we may
flee to Him as our Mediator; and that relying on his intercession, we may not
doubt but that thou art ready to give us pardon, until having at length put away
all sins, we come to that blessed state of glory which has been obtained for us
by the blood of thy Son. Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here deplores the extreme wickedness of
the people, that they would bear no admonitions, like those who, being past
hope, reject every advice, admit no physicians, and dislike all remedies: and it
is a proof of irreclaimable wickedness, when men close their ears and harden
their hearts against all salutary counsels. Hence the Prophet intimates, that,
together with their great and many corruptions, there was such waywardness, that
no one dared to reprove the public vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds this reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the people are as chiders of
the priest</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, they really contend with the
priest: for some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caph,</i> in this place, not as expressive of likeness, but as explaining and
affirming what is said, &#8216;They altogether strive with the priest.&#8217;
But I prefer the former sense, which is, that the Prophet calls all the people
the censors of their pastors: and we see that froward men become thus insolent
when they are reproved; for instantly such an objection as this is made by them,
&#8220;Am I to be treated like a child? Have I not attained sufficient knowledge
to understand how I ought to live?&#8221; We daily meet with many such men, who
proudly boast of their knowledge, as though they were superior to all Prophets
and teachers. And no doubt the ungodly make a show of wit and acuteness in
opposing sound doctrine: and then it appears that they have learnt more than
what one would have thought, &#8212; for what end? only that they may contend
with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to the Prophet&#8217;s words.
<i>But</i>, he says:
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ak</i> is not to be taken here as in many places for &#8220;verily:&#8221;
but it denotes exception, &#8220;In the meantime&#8221;. <i>But</i>, or, in the
meantime, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let no
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"> chide and reprove another. In a word, the
Prophet complains, that while all kinds of wickedness abounded among the people,
there was no liberty to teach and to admonish, but that all were so refractory,
that they would not bear to hear the word; and that as soon as any one touched
their vices, there were great doctors, as they say, ready to
reply.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he enlarges on the subject by saying, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were as chiders of the
priest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for he declares, that they who,
with impunity, conducted themselves so wantonly against God, were not yet
content in being so wayward as to repel all reproofs, but also willfully rose up
against their own teachers: and, as I have already said, common observation
sufficiently proves, that all profane despisers of God are inflated with such
confidence, that they dare to attack others. Some conjecture, in this instance,
that the priest was so base, as to become liable to universal reprobation; but
this conjecture is of no weight, and frigid: for the Prophet here did not draw
his pen against a single individual, but, on the contrary, sharply reproved, as
we have said, the perverseness of the people, that no one would hearken to a
reprover. Let us then know that their diseases were then incurable, when the
people became hardened against salutary counsels, and could not bear to be any
more reproved. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

refractory men; as though he said, &#8220;As ye pay no regard to my authority,
when by words I reprove you, I will not now deal with you in this way; but I
will visit you for this contempt of my word.&#8221; And thus God is wont to do:
he first tries men, or he makes the trial, whether they can be brought to
repentance; he severely reproves them, and expostulates with them: but having
tried all means by words, he then comes to the last remedy, by exercising his
power; for, as it has been said, he deigns no longer to contend with men. Hence
the Lord, when he saw that his Prophets were despised, and that their whole
teaching was a matter of sport, determined, as it appears from this passage,
that the people should shortly be destroyed.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wyh</font><font face="Palatino">,

the people would be destroyed together, and then that the Prophets, even those
who, in a great measure, brought such vengeance on the people, would be drawn
also into the same ruin. Fall shalt thou then in the day, and fall in the night
shall the Prophet, that is, &#8220;The same destruction shall at the same time
include all: but if ruin should not immediately take away the Prophets, they
shall not yet escape my hand; they shall follow in their turn.&#8221; Hence the
Prophet joins day and night together in a continued order; as though he said,
&#8220;I will destroy them all from the first to the last, and no one shall
rescue himself from punishment; and if they think that those shall be unpunished
who shall be later led to vengeance, they are mistaken; for as the night follows
the day, so also some will draw others after them into the same ruin.&#8221; Yet
at the same time the Prophet, I doubt not, means by this metaphor, <i>the
day</i>, that tranquil and joyous time during which the people indulged their
pride. He then means that the punishment he predicted would be sudden: for
except the ungodly see the hand of God near, they ever, as it has been observed
before, laugh to scorn all threatening. God then says that he would punish the
people <i>in the day</i>, even at mid-day, while the sun was shining; and that
when the dusk should come, the Prophets would also follow in their
turn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is evident enough that Hosea speaks not here of
God&#8217;s true and faithful ministers, but of impostors, who deceived the
people by their blandishments, as it is usually the case: for as soon as any
Prophet sincerely wished to discharge his office for God, there came forth
flatterers before the public, &#8212; &#8220;This man is too rigid, and makes a
wrong use of God&#8217;s name, by denouncing so grievous a punishment; we are
God&#8217;s people.&#8221; Such, then, were the Prophets, we must remember, who
are here referred to; for few were those who then faithfully discharged their
office; and there was a great number of those who were indulgent to the people
and to their vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will also consume thy
mother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The term, mother, is to be taken here
for the Church, on account of which the Israelites, we know, were wont to exult
against God; as the Papists do at this day, who boast of their mother church,
which, as they say, is their shield of Ajax. When any one points out their
corruptions, they instantly flee to this protection, &#8212; &#8220;What! Are we
not the Church of God?&#8221; Hence when the Prophet saw that the Israelites
made a wrong use of this falsely-assumed title, he said, &#8216;I will also
destroy your mother,&#8217; that is, &#8220;This your boasting, and the dignity
of Abraham&#8217;s race, and the sacred name of Church, will not prevent God
from taking dreadful vengeance on you all; for he will tear from the roots and
abolish the very name of your mother; he will disperse that smoke of which you
boast, inasmuch as you hide your crimes under the title of Church.&#8221; It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet distinctly touches on the idleness
of the priests, whom the Lord, as it is well known, had set over the people. For
though it could not have availed to excuse the people, or to extenuate their
fault, that the priests were idle; yet the Prophet justly inveighs against them
for not having performed the duty allotted to them by God. But what is said
applies not to the priests only; for God, at the same time, indirectly blames
the voluntary blindness of the people. For how came it, that pure instruction
prevailed not among the Israelites, except that the people especially wished
that it should not? Their ignorance, then, as they say, was gross; as is the
case with many ungodly men at this day, who not only love darkness, but also
draw it around them on every side, that they may have some excuse for their
ignorance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then does here, in the first place, attack the
priests, but he includes also the whole people; for teaching prevailed not, as
it ought to have done, among them. The Lord also reproaches the Israelites for
their ingratitude; for he had kindled among them the light of celestial wisdom;
inasmuch as the law, as it is well known, must have been sufficient to direct
men in the right way. It was then as though God himself did shine forth from
heaven, when he gave them his law. How, then, did the Israelites perish through
ignorance? Even because they closed their eyes against the celestial light,
because they deigned not to become teachable, so as to learn the wisdom of the
eternal Father. We hence see that the guilt of the people, as it has been said,
is not here extenuated, but that God, on the contrary, complains, that they had
malignantly suppressed the teaching of the law: for the law was fit to guide
them. The people perished without knowledge, because they would
perish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet denounces vengeance on the priests,
as well as on the whole people,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because knowledge hast thou
rejected</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I also will thee reject, so that
the priesthood thou shalt not discharge for me</i></font><font face="Palatino">
This is specifically addressed to the priests: the Lord accuses them of having
rejected knowledge. But knowledge, as Malachi says, was to be sought from their
lips,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7) and Moses also touches on the same point in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
33:10. It was then an extreme wickedness in the priests, as though they wished
to subvert God&#8217;s sacred order, when they sought the honor and the dignity
of the office without the office itself: and such is the case with the Papists
of the present day; they are satisfied with its dignity and its wealth. Mitred
bishops are prelates, are chief priests; they vauntingly boast that they are the
heads of the Church, and would be deemed equal with the Apostles: at the same
time, who of them attends to his office? nay, they think that it would be in a
manner a disgrace to give attention to their office and to God&#8217;s
call.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet meant by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thou hast knowledge
rejected, I also will thee reject, so that thou shalt not discharge for me the
priesthood</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In a word, he shows that the
divorce, which the priests attempted to make, was absurd, and contrary to the
nature of things, that it was monstrous, and in short impossible. Why? Because
they wished to retain the title and its wealth, they wished to be deemed
prelates of the Church, without knowledge: God allows not things joined together
by a sacred knot to be thus torn asunder. &#8220;Dost thou then,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;take to thyself the office without knowledge? Nay, as thou hast rejected
knowledge, I will also take to myself the honor of the priesthood, which I
previously conferred on thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage, and by it we can check
the furious boasting of the Papists, when they haughtily force upon us their
hierarchy and the order, as they call it, of their clergy, that is, of their
corrupt dregs: for God declares by his word, that it is impossible that there
should be any priest without knowledge. And further, he would not have priests
to be endued with knowledge only, and to be as it were mute; for he would have
the treasure deposited with them to be communicated to the whole Church. God
then, in speaking of sacerdotal knowledge, includes also preaching. Though one
indeed be a literate, as there have been some in our age among the bishops and
cardinals, &#8212; though then there be such he is not yet to be classed among
the learned; for, as it has been said, sacerdotal learning is the treasure of
the whole Church. When therefore a boast is made of the priesthood, with no
regard to the ministration of the word, it is a mere mockery; for teacher and
priest are, as they say, almost convertible terms. We now perceive the meaning
of the first clause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thou hast forgotten the
law of thy God, I will also forget thy
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some confine this latter clause to
the priests, and think that it forms a part of the same context: but when any
one weighs more fully the Prophet&#8217;s words, he will find that this refers
to the body of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Prophet is in his sentences often concise, and
so his transitions are various and obscure: now he speaks in his own person,
then he assumes the person of God; now he turns his discourse to the people,
then he speaks in the third person; now he reproves the priests, then
immediately he addresses the whole people. There seemed to be first a common
denunciation, &#8216;Thou shalt fall in the day, the Prophet in the night shall
follow, and your mother shall perish.&#8217; The Prophet now, I doubt not,
confirms the same judgment in other words: and, in the first place, he advances
this proposition, that the priests were idle, and that the people quenched the
light of celestial instruction; afterwards he denounces on the priests the
judgment they deserved, &#8216;I will cast thee away,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;from the priesthood;&#8217; now he comes to all the Israelites, and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast forgotten the law of
thy God, I will also forget thy children</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now
this fault was doubtless what belonged to the whole people; there was no one
exempt from this sin; and this forgetfulness was fitly ascribed to the whole
people. For how it happened, that the priests had carelessly shaken off from
their shoulders the burden of teaching the people? Even because the people were
unwilling to have their ears annoyed: for the ungodly complain that God&#8217;s
servants are troublesome, when they daily cry against their vices. Hence the
people gladly entered into a truce with their teachers, that they might not
perform their office: thus the oblivion of God&#8217;s law crept
in.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Prophet had denounced on the priests
their punishment, so he now assures the whole people that God would bring a
dreadful judgment on them all, that he would even blot out the whole race of
Abraham, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
forget</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why was this? The Lord had made a
covenant with Abraham, which was to continue, and to be confirmed to his
posterity: they departed from the true faith, they became spurious children;
then God rightly testifies here, that he had a just cause why he should no
longer count this degenerate people among the children of Abraham. How so?
&#8220;For ye have forgotten my law,&#8221; he says: &#8220;had you remembered
the law, I would also have kept my covenant with you: but I will no more
remember my covenant, for you have violated it. Your children, therefore,
deserve not to be under finch a covenant, inasmuch as ye are such a
people.&#8221; It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet amplifies the wickedness and impiety
of the people, by adding this circumstance, that they the more perversely
wantoned against God, the more bountiful he was to them, yea, when he poured
upon them riches in full exuberance. Such a complaint we have before noticed:
but the Prophets, we know, did not speak only once of the same thing; when they
saw that they effected nothing, that the contempt of God still prevailed, they
found it necessary to repeat often what they had previously said. Here then the
Prophet accuses the Israelites of having shamefully abused the indulgence of
God, of having allowed themselves greater liberty in sinning, when God so kindly
and liberally dealt with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some confine this to the priests, and think the
meaning to be, that they sinned more against God since he increased the
Levitical tribe and added to their wealth: but the Prophet, I doubt not, meant
to include the whole people. He, indeed, in the last verse, separated the crimes
of the priests from those of the people, though in the beginning he advanced a
general propositions: he now returns to that statement, which is, that all, from
the highest to the lowest, acted impiously and wickedly against God. Now we know
that the Israelites had increased in number as well as in wealth; for they were
prosperous, as it has been stated, under the second Jeroboam; and thought
themselves then extremely happy, because they were filled with every abundance.
Hence God shows now that they had become worse and less excusable, for they were
grown thus wanton, like a horse well-fed, when he kicks against his own master,
&#8212; a comparison which even Moses uses in his song,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:19.) We now see what the Prophet means. Hence, when he says
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;bwrk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>carubem, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to
their multiplying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> I explain this not
simply of men nor of wealth, but of every kind of blessing: for the Lord here,
in a word, accuses the people of ingratitude, because the more kind and liberal
he was to them, the more obstinately bent they were on sinning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their glory will I turn to
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He here denounces God&#8217;s judgment
on proud men, which they feared not: for men, we know, are blinded by
prosperity. And it is the worst kind of drunkenness, when we seem to ourselves
to be happy; for then we allow ourselves every thing that is contrary to God,
and are deaf to all instruction, and are, in short, wholly intractable. But the
Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will commute this
glory into shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which means, &#8220;There is
no reason for them to trust in themselves, and foolishly to impose on
themselves, by fixing their eyes on their present splendor; for it is in my
power,&#8221; the Lord says, &#8220;to change their glory.&#8221; We then see
that the Prophet meant here to shake off from the Israelites their vain
confidence; for they were wont to set up against God their riches, their glory,
their power, their horses and chariots. &#8220;This is your glorying; but in my
hand and power is adversity and prosperity; yea,&#8221; the Lord says, &#8220;on
me alone depends the changing of glory into shame.&#8221; But at the same time,
the Prophet intimates, that it could not be that God would thus prostitute his
blessings to unworthy men as to swine: for it is a kind of profanation, when men
are thus proud against God, while he bears with them, while he spares them. This
combination then applies to all who abuse God&#8217;s kindness; for the Lord
intends not that his favor should be thus profaned. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse has given occasion to many interpreters to
think that all the particulars we have noticed ought to be restricted to the
priests alone: but there is no sufficient reason for this. We have already said,
that the Prophet is wont frequently to pass from the people to the priests: but
as a heavier guilt belonged to the priests, he very often inveighs against them,
as he does in this place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
eat</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sin of my people, and lift up
to their iniquity his soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is,
&#8216;every one lifts up his own soul,&#8217; or, &#8216;they lift up the soul
of the sinner by iniquity;&#8217; for the pronoun applies to the priests as well
as to the people. The number is changed: for he
says,</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wlkay</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iacalu</i> and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wa&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">

sin,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will lift
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc., in the third person; and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it may be, their own; it is, however, a
pronoun in the singular number: hence a change of number is necessary. We are
then at liberty to choose 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,
whether the Prophet says this of the people or of the priests: and as we have
said, it may apply to both, but in a different sense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may understand him as saying, that the priests
lifted up their souls to the iniquity of the people, because they anxiously
wished the people to be given to many vices, for they hoped thereby to gain much
prey, as the case is, when any one expects a reward from robbers: he is glad to
hear that they become rich, for he considers their riches to be for his gain. So
it was with the priests, who gaped for lucre; they thought that they were going
on well, when the people brought many sacrifices. And this is usually the case,
when the doctrine of the law is adulterated, and when the ungodly think that
this alone remains for them, &#8212; to satisfy God with sacrifices, and similar
expiations. Then, if we apply the passage to the priests, the lifting up of the
soul is the lust for gain. But if we prefer to apply the words to sinners
themselves, the sense is, &#8216;Upon their iniquity they lift up their
soul,&#8217; that is, the guilty raise up themselves by false comforts, and
extenuate their vices; or, by their own flatteries, bury and entirely smother
every remnant of God&#8217;s fear. Then, according to this second sense, to lift
up the soul is to deceive, and to take away all doubts by vain comforts, or to
remove every sorrow, and to erase every guilt by a false
notion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the meaning of the whole. Though the
Prophet here accuses the priests, yet he involves, no doubt, the whole people,
and deservedly, in the same guilt: for how was it that the priests expected gain
from sacrifices? Even because the doctrine of the law was subverted. God had
instituted sacrifices for this end, that whosoever sinned, being reminded of his
guilt, might mourn for his sin, and further, that by witnessing that sad
spectacle, his conscience might be more wounded: when he saw the innocent animal
slain at the altar, he ought to have dreaded God&#8217;s judgment. Besides, God
also intended to exercise the faith of all, in order that they might flee to the
expiation which was to be made by the promised Mediator. And at the same time,
the penalty which God then laid on sinners, ought to have been as a bridle to
restrain them. In a word, the sacrifices had, in every way, this as their
object, &#8212; to keep the people from being so ready or so prone to sin. But
what did the ungodly do? They even mocked God, and thought that they had fully
done their duty, when they offered an ox or a lamb; and afterwards they freely
indulged themselves in their sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So gross a folly has been even laughed to scorn by
heathen writers. Even Plato has so spoken of such sacrifices, as to show that
those who would by such trifles make a bargain with God, are altogether ungodly:
and certainly he so speaks in his second book on the Commonwealth, as though he
meant to describe the Papacy. For he speaks of purgatory, he speaks of
satisfactions; and every thing the Papists of this day bring forward, Plato in
that book distinctly sets forth as being altogether sottish and absurd. But yet
in all ages this assurance has prevailed, that men have thought themselves
delivered from God&#8217;s hand, when they offered some sacrifice: it is, as
they imagine, a compensation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Prophet now complains of this perversion,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
eat</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, (for he speaks of a continued
act,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sins of my people, and
to iniquity they lift up the heart of each</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, When all sin, one after the other, each one is readily absolved,
because he brings a gift to the priests. It is the same thing as though the
Prophet said, &#8220;There is a collusion between them, between the priests and
the people.&#8221; How so? Because the priests were the associates of robbers,
and gladly seized on what was brought: and so they carried on no war, as they
ought to have done, with vices, but on the contrary urged only the necessity of
sacrifices: and it was enough, if men brought things plentifully to the temple.
The people also themselves showed their contempt of God; for they imagined, that
provided they made satisfaction by their ceremonial performances, they would be
exempt from punishment. Thus then there was an ungodly compact between the
priests and the people: the Lord was mocked in the midst of them. We now then
understand the real meaning of the Prophet: and thus I prefer the latter
exposition as to &#8216;the lifting up of the soul,&#8217; which is, that the
priests lifted up the soul of each, by relieving their consciences, by soothing
words of flattery, and by promising life, as Ezekiel says, to souls doomed to
die,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again denounces on both a common
punishment, as neither was free from guilt.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so shall be the
priest</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is &#8220;I will spare neither the
one nor the other; for the priest has abused the honor conferred on him; for
though divinely appointed over the Church for this purpose, to preserve the
people in piety and holy life, he has yet broken through and violated every
right principle: and then the people themselves wished to have such teachers,
that is, such as were mute. I will therefore now&#8221; the Lord says,
&#8220;inflict punishment on them all alike. As the people then, so shall the
priest be.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some go farther, and say, that it means that God
would rob the priests of their honor, that they might differ nothing from the
people; which is indeed true: but then they think that the Prophet threatens not
others as well as the priests; which is not true. For though God, when he
punishes the priests and the people for the contempt of his law, blots out the
honor of the priesthood, and so abolishes it as to produce an equality between
the great and the despised; yet the Prophet declares here, no doubt, that God
would become the vindicator of his law against other sinners as well as against
the priests. This subject expands wider than what they mean. The rest we must
defer till to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
ELEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One thing escaped me in yesterday&#8217;s lecture, on
which I shall now briefly touch. It may be asked why the Prophet says, that the
priest was to be robbed of his honour, who was not a true nor a legitimate
priest; for there was among the Israelites, we know, no temple in which God was
rightly worshipped. For though it was customary with them to profess the name of
the true God, yet we are aware that all their pretenses were vain. Since the
lord had chosen one sanctuary only at Jerusalem, it hence follows, that all the
priests among the people of Israel were false. It could not then be that God had
taken from them their honor. But it is nothing new for God to punish the
ungodly, by taking from them what they seem to possess.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The case is the same this day as to the Papacy; for
they who vaunt themselves as being clergy and priests are mere apes: (<i>merae
larvae</i>) as, however, they retain the title, what the Prophet threatened to
the false priests of his age may be justly said to them, that their shame shall
be made manifest, so that they shall cease to boast of their dignity, by which
they now deceive the simple and ignorant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning:
his meaning is the same as when he said before, &#8220;I will draw thee to the
desert, and then the ephod shall cease, and the seraphim shall cease.&#8221;
There was, we know, no ephod which the Lord approved, except that alone which
the legitimate priest did wear: but as there was emulation between the
Israelites and the Jews, and as they who had departed from the true and pure
worship of God, did yet boast that they worshipped the God of Abraham, the Lord
here declares, that he would not suffer them to lurk under such
masks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to that passage of the Prophet, in which
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall eat and shall
not be satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall play the wanton and
shall not increase; because Jehovah have they left off to attend
to</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet here again proclaims the
judgment which was nigh the Israelites. And first, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall eat and shall not be
satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino">; in which he alludes to the last
verse. For the priests gaped for gain, and their only care was to satisfy their
appetites. Since then their cupidity was insatiable, which was also the cause
why they conceded sinful liberty to the people, he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall eat and shall not be
satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet intimates further
by these words, that men are not sustained by plenty or abundance of provisions,
but rather by the blessing of God: for a person may devour much, yet the
quantity, however large, may not satisfy him; and this we find to be often the
case as to a voracious appetite; for in such an instance, the staff of bread is
broken, that is, the Lord takes away support from bread, so that much eating
does not satisfy. And this is the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall eat and shall not be
satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The priests thought it a
happy time with them, when they gathered great booty from every quarter; God on
the contrary declares, that it would be empty and useless to them; for no
satisfying effect would follow: however much they might greedily swallow up,
they would not yet be satisfied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall play the wanton and
shall not increase;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8220;However
much they might give the reins to promiscuous lusts, I will not yet suffer them
to propagate: so far shall they be from increasing or generating an offspring by
lawful marriages, that were they everywhere to indulge in illicit intercourse,
they would still continue barren.&#8221; The Prophet here, in a word, testifies
that the ungodly are deceived, when they think that they can obtain their wishes
by wicked and unlawful means; for the Lord will frustrate their desires. The
avaricious think, when they have much, that they are sufficiently defended
against all want; and when penury presses on all others, they think themselves
beyond the reach of danger. But the Lord derides this folly: &#8220;Gather,
gather great heaps; but I will blow on your riches, that they may vanish, or at
least yield you no advantage. So also strive to beget children; though one may
marry ten wives, or everywhere play the wanton, he shall still remain
childless.&#8221; Thus we see that a just punishment is inflicted on profane
men, when they indulge their own lusts: they indeed promise to themselves a
happy issue; but God, on the other hand, pronounces upon them his
curse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have left Jehovah to
attend</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is that they may not attend or
serve him. Here the Prophet points out the source and the chief cause of all
evils, and that is, because the Israelites had forsaken the true God and his
worship. Though they indeed retained the name of God, and were wont, even
boldly, to set up this plea against the Prophets, that they were the children of
Abraham, and the chosen of the supreme God, he yet says that they were
apostates. How so? Because whosoever keeps faith with God, keeps himself also
under the tuition of his word, and wanders not after his own inventions; but the
Israelites indulged themselves in any thing they pleased. Since then it is
certain that they had shaken off the yoke of the law, it is no wonder that the
Prophet says, that they had departed from the Lord. But we ought to notice the
confirmation of this truth, that no one can continue to keep faith with God,
except he observes his word and remains under its tuition. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jql</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>lakech, </i>means to take away; and this sense is also admissible that wine
and wantonness take possession of the heart; but I take its simpler meaning, to
take away. But it is not a general truth as most imagine, who regard it a
proverbial saying, that wantonness and wine deprive men of their right mind and
understanding: on the contrary, it is to be restricted, I doubt not, to the
Israelites; as though the Prophet had said, that they were without a right mind,
and like brute animals, because drunkenness and fornication had infatuated or
fascinated them. But we may take both in a metaphorical sense; as fornication
may be superstition, and so also drunkenness: yet it seems more suitable to the
context to consider, that the Prophet here reproaches the Israelites for having
petulantly cast aside every instruction through being too much given to their
pleasures and too much cloyed. Since then the Israelites had been enriched with
great plenty, God had given way to abominable indulgences, the Prophet says,
that they were without sense: and this is commonly the case with such men. I
will not therefore treat here more at large of drunkenness and
fornication.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed true, that when any one becomes addicted
to wantonness, he loses both modesty and a right mind, and also that wine is as
it were poisonous, for it is, as one has said, a mixed poison: and the earth,
when it sees its own blood drank up intemperately, takes its revenge on men.
These things are true; but let us see what the Prophet meant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as I have said, he simply directs his discourse
to the Israelites, and says, that they were sottish and senseless, because the
Lord had dealt too liberally with them. For, as I have said, the kingdom of
Israel was then very opulent, and full of all kinds of luxury. The Prophet then
touches now distinctly on this very thing: &#8220;How comes it that ye are now
so senseless, that there is not a particle of right understanding among you?
Even because ye are given to excesses, because there is among you too large an
abundance of all good things: hence it is, that all indulge their own lusts; and
these take away your heart.&#8221; In short, God means here that the Israelites
abused his blessings, and that excesses blinded them. This is the meaning. Let
us now go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

heritage. Now this people, who ought to be mine, consult their own wood, and
their staff answers them!&#8221; We hence see that it was a grievous and severe
reprobation when the Lord reminded them of the invaluable kindness with which he
had favored the children of Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So at this day our guilt will be more grievous, if we
continue not in the pure worship of God, since God has called us to himself and
designed us to be his peculiar flock. The same thing that the Prophet brought
against the Israelites may be also brought against the Papists; for as soon as
infants are born among them, the Lord signs them with the sacred symbol of
baptism; they are therefore in some sense (<i>aliqua ex parte</i>) the people of
God. We see, at the same time, how gross and abominable are the superstitions
which prevail among them: there are none more stupid than they are. Even the
Turks and the Saracenes are wise when compared with them. How great, then, and
how shameful is this baseness, that the Papists, who boast themselves to be the
people of God, should go astray after their own mad follies!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet says the Israelites
&#8220;consulted&#8221; their own wood, or inquired of wood. He no doubt accuses
them here of having transferred the glory of the only true God to their own
idols, or fictitious gods. They consult, he says, their own wood, and the
<i>staff</i> answers them. He seems, in the second clauses to allude to the
blind: as when a blind man asks his staff, so he says the Israelites asked
counsel of their wood and staff. Some think that superstitions then practiced
are here pointed out. The augurs we know used a staff; and it is probable that
diviners in the East employed also a staff, or some such thing, in performing
their incantations. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others
explain these words allegorically, as though wood was false religion, and staff
the ungodly prophets. But I am inclined to hold to simplicity. It then seems to
me more probable, that the Israelites, as I have already stated, are here
condemned for consulting wood or dead idols, instead of the only true God; and
that it was the same thing as if a blind man was to ask counsel of his staff,
though the staff be without any reason or sense. A staff is indeed useful, but
for a different purpose. And thus the Prophet not only contemptuously, but also
ironically, exposes to scorn the folly of those who consult their gods of wood
and stone; for to do so will no more avail them than if one had a staff for his
counselor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the spirit of fornication has
deceived them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here again the Prophet
aggravates their guilt, inasmuch as no common blame was to be ascribed to the
Israelites; for they were, he says, wholly given to fornication
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of fornication deceived
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">: it was the same as if one inflamed with
lust ran headlong into evil; as we see to be the case with brutal men when
carried away by a blind and shameful passion; for then every distinction between
right and wrong disappears from their eyes &#8212; no choice is made, no shame
is felt. As then such heat of lust is wont sometimes to seize men, that they
distinguish nothing, so the Prophet says with the view of shaming the people the
more, that they were like those given to fornication, who no longer exercise any
judgment, who are restrained by no shame.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of fornication has deceived
them:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but as this similitude often meets us, I
shall not dwell upon it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have played the
wanton</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may not obey the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not say simply, &#8216;from their
God,&#8217; but &#8216;from under&#8217;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>played the wanton, that they
might no more obey God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or continue
under his government. We may hence learn what is our spiritual chastity, even
when God rules us by his word, when we go not here and there and rashly follow
our own superstitions. When we abide then under the government of our God, and
with fixed eyes look on him, then we chastely preserve our faithfulness to him.
But when we follow idols, we then play the wanton and depart from God. Let us
now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here more clearly what was the
fornication for which he had before condemned the people, &#8212; that they
worshipped God under trees and on high places. This then is explanatory, for the
Prophet defines what he before understood by the word, fornication; and this
explanation was especially useful, nay, necessary. For men, we know, will not
easily give way, particularly when they can adduce some color for their sins, as
is the case with the superstitious: when the Lord condemns their perverted and
vicious modes of worship, they instantly cry out, and boldly contend and say,
&#8220;What! is this to be counted fornication, when we worship God?&#8221; For
whatever they do from inconsiderate zeal is, they think, free from every blame.
So the Papists of this day fix it as a matter beyond dispute that all their
modes of worship are approved by God: for though nothing is grounded on his
word, yet good intention (as they say) is to them more than a sufficient excuse.
Hence they dare proudly to clamour against God, whenever he condemns their
corruptions and abuses. Such presumption has doubtless prevailed from the
beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, therefore, deemed it needful openly and
distinctly to show to the Israelites, that though they thought themselves to be
worshipping God with pious zeal and good intention, they were yet committing
fornication. &#8220;It is fornication,&#8221; he says, &#8220;when ye sacrifice
under trees.&#8221; &#8220;What! has it not ever been a commendable service to
offer sacrifices and to burn incense to God?&#8221; Such being the design of the
Israelites, what was the reason that God was so angry with them? We may suppose
them to have fallen into a mistake; yet why did not God bear with this foolish
intention, when it was covered, as it has been stated, with honest and specious
zeal? But God here sharply reproves the Israelites, however much they pretended
a great zeal, and however much they covered their superstitions with the false
title of God&#8217;s worship: &#8220;It is nothing else,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;but fornication.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On tops of
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they sacrifice, and on hills they
burn incense, under the oak and the poplar and the
teil-tree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.. It seemed apparently a
laudable thing in the Israelites to build altars in many places; for frequent
attendance at the temples might have stirred them up the more in God&#8217;s
worship. Such is the plea of the Papists for filling their temples with
pictures; they say, &#8220;We are everywhere reminded of God wherever we turn
our eyes; and this is very profitable.&#8221; So also it might have seemed to
the Israelites a pious work, to set up God&#8217;s worship on hills and on tops
of mountains and under every tall tree. But God repudiated the whole; he would
not be in this manner worshipped: nay, we see that he was grievously displeased.
He says, that the faith pledged to him was thus violated; he says, that the
people basely committed fornication. Though the Prophet&#8217;s doctrine is at
this day by no means plausible in the world, so that hardly one in ten embraces
it; we shall yet contend in vain with the Spirit of God: nothing then is better
than to hear our judge; and he pronounces all fictitious modes of worship,
however much adorned by a specious guise, to be adulteries and
whoredoms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we hence learn that good intention, with which
the Papists so much please themselves, is the mother of all wantonness and of
all filthiness. How so? Because it is a high offense against heaven to depart
from the word of the Lord: for God had commanded sacrifices and incense to be
nowhere offered to him but at Jerusalem. The Israelites transgressed this
command. But obedience to God, as it is said in 1 Samuel 15, is of more value
with him than all sacrifices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet also distinctly excludes a device in
which the ungodly and hypocrites take great delight: <i>good,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was its
shade</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they pleased themselves with
such devices. So Paul says that there is a show of wisdom in the inventions and
ordinances of men,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:23.) Hence, when men undertake voluntary acts of worship, &#8212; which the
Greeks call
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eqeloqrhskei&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">
superstitions, being nothing else than will-worship, &#8212; when men undertake
this or that to do honor to God, there appears to them a show of wisdom, but
before God it is abomination only. At this practice the Prophet evidently
glances, when he says that the shade of the poplar, or of the oak, or of
teil-tree, was good; for the ungodly and the hypocrites imagined their worship
to be approved of God, and that they surpassed the Jews, who worshipped God only
in one place: &#8220;Our land is full of altars, and memorials of God present
themselves everywhere.&#8221; But when they thought that they had gained the
highest glory by their many altars, the Prophet says, that the shade indeed was
good, but that it only pleased wantons, who would not acknowledge their
baseness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore your daughters shall
play the wanton, and your daughters-in-law shall become adulteresses: I will not
visit your daughters and
daughters-in-law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some explain this
passage as though the Prophet said, &#8220;While the parents were absent, their
daughters and daughters-in-law played the wanton.&#8221; The case is the same at
this day; for there is no greater liberty in licentiousness than what prevails
during vowed pilgrimages: for when any one wishes to indulge freely in
wantonness, she makes a vow to undertake a pilgrimage: an adulterer is ready at
hand who offers himself a companion. And again, when the husband is so foolish
as to run here and there, he at the same time gives to his wife the opportunity
of being licentious. And we know further, that when many women meet at unusual
hours in churches, and have their private masses, there are there hidden
corners, where they perpetrate all kinds of licentiousness. We know, indeed,
that this is very common. But the Prophet&#8217;s meaning is another: for God
here denounces the punishment of which Paul speaks in the Romans when he says,
&#8216;As men have transferred the glory of God to dead things, so God also gave
them up to a reprobate mind,&#8217; that they might discern nothing, and abandon
themselves to every thing shameful, and even prostitute their own
bodies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know, that when just and due honor is not
rendered to God, this vengeance deservedly follows, that men become covered with
infamy. Why so? Because nothing is more equitable than that God should vindicate
his own glory, when men corrupt and adulterate it: for why should then any honor
remain to them? And why, on the contrary, should not God sink them at once in
some extreme baseness? Let us then know, that this is a just punishment, when
adulteries prevail, and when vagrant lusts promiscuously
follow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then who worships not God, shall have at home an
adulterous wife, and filthy strumpets as his daughters, boldly playing the
wanton, and he shall have also adulterous daughters-in-law: not that the Prophet
speaks only of what would take place; but he shows that such would be the
vengeance that God would take: &#8216;Your daughters therefore shall play the
wanton, and your daughters-in-law shall be adulteresses;&#8217; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not punish your daughters
and your daughters-in-law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
&#8220;I will not correct them for their scandalous conduct; for I wish them to
be exposed to infamy.&#8221; For this truth must ever stand
firm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Him who honors me,
I will honor: and him who despises my name, I will make contemptible and
ignominious,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Samuel 2:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then declares that he will not visit these
crimes, because he designed in this way to punish the ungodly, by whom his own
worship had been corrupted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they with strumpets
separate themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain this verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rdp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pered,</i> as meaning, &#8220;They divide husbands from their wives:&#8221;
but the Prophet, no doubt, means, that they separated themselves from God, in
the same manner as a wife does, when she leaves her husband and gives herself up
to an adulterer. The Prophet then uses the word allegorically, or at least
metaphorically: and a reason is given, which they do not understand who take
this passage as referring literally to adulteries; and their mistake is
sufficiently proved to be so by the next clause, &#8216;and with strumpets they
sacrifice.&#8217; The separation then of which he speaks is this, that they
sacrificed with strumpets; which they could not do without violating their faith
pledged to God. We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s real meaning:
&#8216;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not
punish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>&#8217; he says,
&#8216;wantonness and adulteries in your families.&#8217; Why? &#8220;Because I
would have you to be made infamous, for ye have first played the
wanton.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is a change of person; and this ought to be
observed: for he ought to have carried on his discourse throughout in the second
person, and to have said, &#8220;Because <i>ye</i> have separated with
strumpets, and accompany harlots;&#8221; this is the way in which he ought to
have spoken: but through excess, as it were, of indignation, he makes a change
in his address, &#8216;They,&#8217; he says, &#8216;have played the
wanton,&#8217; as though he deemed them unworthy of being spoken to. They have
then played the wanton with strumpets. By &#8220;strumpets&#8221;, he doubtless
understands the corruptions by which God&#8217;s worship had been perverted,
even through wantonness: &#8220;they sacrifice&#8221;, he says, &#8220;with
strumpets&#8221;, that is, they forsake the true God, and resort to whatever
pollutions they please; and this is to play the wanton, as when a husband,
leaving his wife, or when a wife, leaving her husband, abandon themselves to
filthy lust. But it is nothing strange or unwonted for sins to be punished by
other sins. What Paul teaches ought especially to be borne in mind, that God, as
the avenger of his own glory, gives men up to a reprobate mind, and suffers them
to be covered with many most disgraceful things; for he cannot bear with them,
when they turn his glory to shame and his truth to a lie.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the people, not
understanding, shall stumble</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They who take the
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fbl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>labeth,</i> as meaning, &#8220;to be perverted,&#8221; understand it here in
the sense of being &#8220;perplexed:&#8221; nor is this sense inappropriate.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall not understand and be
perplexed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, They shall not know
the right way. But the word means also &#8220;to stumble,&#8221; and still
oftener &#8220;to fall;&#8221; and since this is the more received sense, I am
disposed to embrace it: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not understanding, shall
stumble</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here teaches, that the pretence of
ignorance is of no weight before God, though hypocrites are wont to flee to this
at last. When they find themselves without any excuse they run to this asylum,
&#8212; &#8220;But I thought that I was doing right; I am deceived: but be it
so, it is a pardonable mistake.&#8221; The Prophet here declares these excuses
to be vain and fallacious; for the people, who understand not, shall stumble and
that deservedly: for how came this ignorance to be in the people of Israel, but
that they, as it has been before said, willfully closed their eyes against the
light? When, therefore, men thus willfully determine to be blind, it is no
wonder that the Lord delivers them up to final destruction. But if they now
flatter themselves by pretending, as I have already said, a mistake, the Lord
will shake off this false confidence, and does now shake it off by his word.
What then ought we to do? To learn knowledge from his word; for this is our
wisdom and our understanding, as Moses says, in the fourth chapter of
Deuteronomy.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here complains that Judah also was
infected with superstitions, though the Lord had hitherto wonderfully kept them
from pollutions of this kind. He compares Israel with Judah, as though he said,
&#8220;It is no wonder that Israel plays the wanton; they had for a long time
shaken off the yoke; their defection is well known: but it is not to be endured,
that Judah also should begin to fall away into the same abominations.&#8221; We
now then perceive the object of the comparison. From the time that Jeroboam led
after him the ten tribes, the worship of God, we know, was corrupted; for the
Israelites were forbidden to ascend to Jerusalem, and to offer sacrifices there
to God according to the law. Altars were at the same time built, which were
nothing but perversions of divine worship. This state of things had now
continued for many years. The Prophet therefore says, that Israel was like a
filthy strumpet, void of all shame; nor was this to be wondered at, for they had
cast away the fear of God: but that Judah also should forsake God&#8217;s pure
worship as well as Israel, &#8212; this the Prophet deplores,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If then thou Israel playest the
wanton, let not Judah at least
offend</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We here see first, how difficult it is for those to
continue untouched without any stain, who come in contact with pollutions and
defilements. This is the case with any one that is living among Papists; he can
hardly keep himself entire for the Lord; for vicinity, as we find, brings
contagion. The Israelites were separated from the Jews, and yet we see that the
Jews were corrupted by their diseases and vices. There is, indeed, nothing we
are so disposed to do as to forsake true religion; inasmuch as there is
naturally in us a perverse lust for mixing with it some false and ungodly forms
of worship; and every one in this respect is a teacher to himself: what then is
likely to take place, when Satan on the other hand stimulates us? Let all then
who are neighbors to idolaters beware, lest they contract any of their
pollutions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We further see, that the guilt of those who have been
rightly taught is not to be extenuated when they associate with the blind and
the unbelieving. Though the Israelites boasted of the name of God, they were yet
then alienated from pure doctrine, and had been long sunk in the darkness of
errors. There was no religion among them; nay, they had hardly a single pure
spark of divine light. The Prophet now brings this charge against the Jews, that
they differed not from the Israelites, and yet God had to that time carried
before them the torch of light; for he suffered not sound doctrine to be
extinguished at Jerusalem, nor throughout the whole of Judea. The Jews, by not
profiting through this singular kindness of God, were doubly guilty. This is the
reason why the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though Israel is become wanton,
yet let not Judah
offend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come ye not to
Gilgal</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and ascend not into Beth-
aven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here again he points out the
superstitions by which the Israelites had vitiated the pure worship of God; they
had built altars for themselves in Bethel and Gilgal, where they pretended to
worship God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Gilgal, we know, was a celebrated place; for after
passing through Jordan, they built there a pillar as a memorial of that miracle;
and the people no doubt ever remembered so remarkable an instance of divine
favor: and the place itself retained among the people its fame and honorable
distinction. This in itself deserved no blame: but as men commonly pervert by
abuse every good thing, so Jeroboam, or one of his successors, built a temple in
Gilgal; for the minds almost of all were already possessed with some reverence
for the place. Had there been no distinction belonging to the place, he could
not have so easily inveigled the minds of the people; but as a notion already
prevailed among them that the place was holy on account of the miraculous
passing over of the people, Jeroboam found it easier to introduce there his
perverted worship: for when one imagines that the place itself pleases God, he
is already captivated by his own deceptions. The same also must be said of
Bethel: its name was given it, we know, by the holy father Jacob, because God
appeared there to him.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Terrible,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;is this place; it is the gate of
heaven,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
28:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He hence called it Bethel, which means the house of
God. Since Jacob sacrificed there to God, posterity thought this still
allowable: for hypocrites weigh not what God enjoins, but catch only at the
Fathers&#8217; examples, and follow as their rule whatever they hear to have
been done by the Fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then foolish men are content with bare examples,
and attend not to what God requires, so the Prophet distinctly inveighs here
against both places, even Bethel and Gilgal. &#8220;<i>Come not&#8221;,</i> he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to Gilgal, and ascend not
into Beth-aven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But we must observe the
change of name made by the Prophet; for he calls not the place by its honorable
name, Bethel, but calls it the house of iniquity. It is indeed true that God
revealed himself there to his servant Jacob; but he intended not the place to be
permanently fixed for himself, he intended not that there should be a perpetual
altar there: the vision was only for a time. Had the people been confirmed in
their faith, whenever the name of the place was heard, it would have been a
commendable thing; but they departed from the true faith, for they despised the
sure command of God, and preferred what had been done by an individual, and were
indeed influenced by a foolish zeal. It is no wonder then that the Prophet turns
praise into blame, and allows not the place to be, as formerly, the House of
God, but the house of iniquity. We now see the Prophet&#8217;s real
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I return to the reproof he gives to the Jews: he
condemns them for leaving the legitimate altar and running to profane places,
and coveting those strange modes of worship which had been invented by the will
or fancy of men. &#8220;What have you to do,&#8221; he says, &#8220;with Gilgal
or Bethel? Has not God appointed a sanctuary for you at Jerusalem? Why do ye not
worship there, where he himself invites you?&#8221; We hence see that a
comparison is to be understood here between Gilgal and Bethel on the one hand,
and the temple, built by God&#8217;s command on mount Zion, in Jerusalem, on the
other. Moreover, this reproof applies to many in our day. So to those who
sagaciously consider the state of things in our age, the Papists appear to be
like the Israelites; for their apostasy is notorious enough: there is nothing
sound among them; the whole of their religion is rotten; every thing is
depraved. But as the Lord has chosen us peculiarly to himself, we must beware,
lest they should draw us to themselves, and entangle us: for, as we have said,
we must ever fear contagion; inasmuch as nothing is more easy than to become
infected with their vices, since our nature is to vices ever
inclined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are further reminded how foolish and frivolous is
the excuse of those who, being satisfied with the examples of the Fathers, pass
by the word of God, and think themselves released from every command, when they
follow the holy Fathers. Jacob was indeed, among others, worthy of imitation;
and yet we learn from this place, that the pretence that his posterity made for
worshipping God in Bethel was of no avail. Let us then know that we cannot be
certain of being right, except when we obey the Lord&#8217;s command, and
attempt nothing according to men&#8217;s fancy, but follow only what he bids. It
must also be observed, that a fault is not extenuated when things, now
perverted, have proceeded-from a good and approved origin. As for instance the
Papists, when their superstitions are condemned, ever set up this shield,
&#8220;O! this has arisen from a good source.&#8221; But what sort of thing is
it? If indeed we judge of it by what it is now, we clearly see it to be an
impious abomination, which they excuse by the plea that it had a good and holy
beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus in baptism we see how various and how many
deprivations they have mixed together. Baptism has indeed its origin in the
institution of Christ: but no permission has been given to men to deface it by
so many additions. The origin then of baptism affords the Papists no excuse, but
on the contrary renders double their sin; for they have, by a profane audacity,
contaminated what the Son of God has appointed. But there is in their mass a
much greater abomination: for the mass, as we know, is in no respect the same
with the holy supper of our Lord. There are at least some things remaining in
baptism; but the mass is in nothing like Christ&#8217;s holy supper: and yet the
Papists boast that the mass is the supper. Be it so, that it had crept in, and
that through the craft of Satan, and also through the wickedness or depravity of
men: but whatever may have been its beginning, it does not wipe away the extreme
infamy that belongs to the mass: for, as it is well known, they abolish by it
the only true sacrifice of Christ; they ascribe to their own devices the
expiation which was made by the death of the Son of God. And here we have not
only to contend with the Papists, but also with those wicked triflers, who
proudly call themselves Nicodemians. For these indeed deny that they come to the
mass, because they have any regard for the Papistic figment; but because they
say that there is set forth a commemoration of Christ&#8217;s supper and of his
death. Since Bethel was formerly turned into Beth-aven, what else at this day is
the mass? Let us then ever take heed, that whatever the Lord has instituted may
remain in its own purity, and not degenerate; otherwise we shall be guilty, as
it has been said, of the impious audacity of those who have changed the truth
into a lie. We now understand the design of what the Prophet teaches, and to
what purposes it may be applied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And swear not, Jehovah
liveth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet seems here to
condemn what in itself was right: for to swear is to profess religion, and to
testify our profession of it; particularly when men swear honestly. But as this
formula, which the Prophet mentions, was faultless, why did God forbid to swear
by his name, and even in a holy manner? Because he would reign alone, and could
not bear to be connected with idols; for</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;what
concord,&#8217; says Paul, &#8216;has Christ with Belial? How can light agree
with darkness?&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 6:15:)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so God would allow of no concord with idols. This is
expressed more fully by another Prophet, Zephaniah, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;I will destroy
those who swear by the living
God,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and swear by their
king,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zephaniah
1:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God indeed expressly commands the faithful to swear
by his name alone in Deuteronomy 6 and in other places: and further, when the
true profession of religion is referred to, this formula is laid
down,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;They shall swear,
The Lord liveth,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
4:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when men associated the name of God with their
own perverted devices, it was by no means to be endured. The Prophet then now
condemns this perfidy, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Swear not,
Jehovah liveth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said,
&#8220;How dare these men take God&#8217;s name, when they abandon themselves to
idols? for God allows his name only to his own people.&#8221; The faithful
indeed take God&#8217;s name in oaths as it were by his leave. Except the Lord
had granted this right, it would have certainly been a sacrilege. But we borrow
God&#8217;s name by his permission: and it is right to do so, when we keep faith
with him, when we continue in his service; but when we worship false gods, then
we have nothing to do with him, and he takes away the privilege which he has
given us. Then he says, &#8216;Ye shall not henceforth blend the name of the
only true God with idols.&#8217; For this he cannot endure, as he declares also
in Ezekial 20, </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Go ye, serve your idols;
I reject all your worship.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Lord was thus grievously offended, even when
sacrifices were offered to him. Why so? Because it was a kind of pollution, when
the Jews professed to worship him, and then went after their ungodly
superstitions. We now then perceive the meaning of this verse. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet compares Israel here to an untamable
heifer. Some render it, &#8220;A straying heifer&#8221;, and we may render it,
&#8220;A wanton heifer.&#8221; But to others a defection seems to have been more
especially intended, because they had receded or departed from God: but this
comparison is not so apposite. They render it, &#8220;As a backsliding,&#8221;
or &#8220;receding heifer:&#8221; but I prefer to view the word as meaning, one
that is petulant or lascivious: and the punishment which is subjoined,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will now feed them as a
tender lamb in a spacious place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> best
agrees with this view, as we shall immediately see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must, in the first place, be understood, that
Israel is compared to a heifer, and indeed to one that is wanton, which cannot
remain quiet in the stall nor be accustomed to the yoke: it is hence subjoined,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will now feed them as a
lamb in a spacious place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The meaning of
this clause may be twofold; the first is, that the Lord would leave them in
their luxuries to gorge themselves according to their lust, and to indulge
themselves in their gormandizing; and it is a dreadful punishment, when the Lord
allays not the intemperateness of men, but suffers them to wanton without any
limits or moderation. Hence some give this meaning to the passage,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will now feed them as a
lamb</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, like a sheep void of
understanding, and in a large place, even in a most fruitful field, capable of
supplying food to satiety. But it seems to me that the Prophet meant another
thing, even this, that the Lord would so scatter Israel, that they might be as a
lamb in a spacious place. It is what is peculiar to sheep, we know, that they
continue under the shepherd&#8217;s care: and a sheep, when driven into
solitude, shows itself, by its bleating, to be timid, and to be as it were
seeking its shepherd and its flock. In short, a sheep is not a solitary animal;
and it is almost a part of their food to sheep and lambs to feed together, and
also under the eye of him under whose care they are. Now there seems to be here
a most striking change of figure:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
are</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like unnamable
heifers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for they are so wanton that no field
can satisfy their wantonness, as when a heifer would occupy the whole land.
&#8220;Such then,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and so outrageous is the disobedience
of this people, that they can no longer endure, except a spacious place be given
to each of them. I will therefore give them a spacious place: but for this end,
that each of them may be like a lamb, who looks around and sees no flock to
which it may join itself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This happened when the land was stripped of its
inhabitants; for then a small number only dwelt in it. Four tribes, as stated
before, were first drawn away; and then they began to be like lambs in a
spacious place; for God terrified them with the dread of enemies. The remaining
part of the people was afterwards either dispersed or led into exile. They were,
when in exile, like lambs, and those in a wide place. For though they lived in
cottages, and their condition was in every way confined, yet they were in a
place like the desert; for one hardly dared look on another, and waste and
solitude met their eyes wherever they turned them. We see then what the Prophet
meant by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are like an
untamable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or a wanton <i>heifer:</i>
&#8220;I will tame them, and make them like lambs; and when scattered, they will
fear as in a wilderness, for there will be no flock to which they can
come.&#8221; Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As if wearied, God here bids his Prophet to rest; as
though he said, &#8220;Since I prevail nothing with this people, they must be
given up; cease from thy work.&#8221; God had set Hosea over the Israelites for
this end, to lead them to repentance, if they could by any means be reformed:
the duty of the Prophet, enjoined by God, was, to bring back miserable and
straying men from their error, and to restore them again to the obedience of
pure faith. He now saw that the Prophet&#8217;s labour was in vain, without any
success. Hence he was, as I have said, wearied, and bids the Prophet to desist:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Leave
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says; that is, &#8220;There is
no use for thee to weary thyself any more; I dismiss thee from thy labour, and
will not have thee to take any more trouble; for they are wholly
incurable.&#8221; For by saying that they had joined themselves to idols, he
means, that they could not be drawn from that perverseness in which they had
grown hardened; as though he said, &#8220;This is an alliance that cannot be
broken.&#8221; And he alludes to the marriage which he had before mentioned: for
the Israelites, we know, had been joined to God, for he had adopted them to be a
holy people to himself; they afterwards adopted impious forms of worship. But
yet there was a hope of recovery, until they became wholly attached to their
idols, and clave so fast to them, that they could not be drawn away. This
alliance the Prophet points out when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are joined to
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he mentions the tribe of Ephraim, for the kings,
(I mean, of Israel,) we know, sprang from that tribe; and at the same time he
reproaches that tribe for having abused God&#8217;s blessing. We know that
Ephraim was blessed by holy Jacob in preference to his elder brother; and yet
there was no reason why Jacob put aside the first-born and preferred the
younger, except that God in this case manifested his own good pleasure. The
ingratitude of Ephraim was therefore less excusable, when he not only fell away
from the pure worship of God, but polluted also the whole land; for it was
Jeroboam who introduced ungodly superstitions; he therefore was the source of
all the evil. This is the reason why the Prophet now expressly mentions Ephraim:
though it is a form of speaking, commonly used by all the Prophets, to designate
Israel, by taking a part for the whole, by the name of Ephraim.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage is worthy of being noticed, that we
may attend to God&#8217;s reproofs, and not remain torpid when he rouses us; for
we ought ever to fear, lest he should suddenly reject us, when he is wearied
with our perverseness, or when he conceives such a displeasure as not to deign
to speak to us any more. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, using a metaphor, says here first, that
their drink had become putrid; which means, that they had so intemperately given
themselves up to every kind of wickedness, that all things among them had become
fetid. And the Prophet alludes to shameful and beastly excess: for the drunken
are so addicted to wine, that they emit a disgusting smell, and are never
satisfied with drinking, until by spewing, they throw up the excessive draughts
they have taken. The Prophet then had this in view. He speaks not, however, of
the drinking of wine, this is certain: but by drunkenness, on the contrary, he
means that unbridled licentiousness, which then prevailed among the people.
Since then they allowed themselves every thing they pleased without shame, they
seemed like drunken men, insatiable, who, when wholly given to wine, think it
their highest delight ever to have wine on the palate, or to fill copiously the
throat, or to glut their stomach: when drunken men do these things, then they
send forth the offensive smell of wine. This then is what the Prophet means,
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Putrid has become
their drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, the people observe
no moderation in sinning; they offend not God now, in the common and usual
manner, but are wholly like beastly men, who are nothing ashamed, constantly to
belch and to spew, so that they offend by their fetid smell all who meet them.
Such are this people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By wantoning they have become
wanton</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is another comparison. The
Prophet, we know, has hitherto been speaking of wantonness in a metaphorical
sense, signifying thereby, that Israel perfidiously abandoned themselves to
idols, and thus violated their faith pledged to the true God. He now follows the
same metaphor here, &#8216;By wantoning they have become wanton.&#8217; Hence he
reproaches and represents them as infamous on two accounts, &#8212; because they
cast aside every shame, like the drunken who are so delighted with wine, that
through excess they send forth its offensive smell, &#8212; and because they
were like wantons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her princes have shamefully
loved, Bring ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here, in a peculiar
way, the Prophet shows that the great sinned with extreme licentiousness; for
they were given to bribery: and the eyes of the wise, we know, are blinded, and
the hearts of the just are perverted, by gifts. But the Prophet designedly made
this addition, that we might know that there were then none among the people who
attempted to apply a remedy to the many prevailing vices; for even the rulers
coveted gain; no one remembered for what purpose he had been called. Hence it
happened that every one indulged himself with impunity in whatever pleased him.
How so? Because there were no censors of public morals. Here we see in what a
wretched state the people are, when there are none to exercise discipline, when
even the judges gape for gain, and care for nothing but for gifts and riches;
for then what the Prophet describes here as to the people of Israel must happen.

kinds of gifts, but to such gifts as proved that there was a public sale of
justice; as though he said, &#8220;Now the judges, when they say, Bring ye, when
they love, Bring ye, make no distinction whatever between right and wrong, and
think all this lawful; for the people are become insensible to such a
disgraceful conduct: hence they basely and shamefully seek

<div><font face="Palatino">If this rendering be approved,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wind hath bound her in its
wings</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the meaning is, that a sudden storm
would sweep away the people, and thus would they be made ashamed of their
sacrifices. So the past tense is to be taken for the future. We may indeed read
the words in the past tense, as though the Prophet was speaking of what had
already taken place. The wind, then, has already swept away the people; by which
he intimates, that they seemed to have struck long and deep roots in their
superstitions, but that the Lord had already given them up to the wind, that it
might hold them tied in its wings. And wings, we know, is elsewhere ascribed to
the wind,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:3. And thus the verse will be throughout a denunciation of
vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The other similitude or metaphor is the most
appropriate, and harmonizes better with the subject; for were not men to support
their minds with vain confidence, they could never with so much audacity despise
God&#8217;s word. Hence they are said to tie the wind in their wings; being
unmindful of their own condition, they attempt as by means of the wind to fly;
but when they proudly raise up themselves, they have no support but the wind.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again preaches against the whole
people: but he mainly directs his discourse to the priests and the rulers; for
they were the source of the prevailing evils: the priests, intent on gain,
neglected the worship of God; and the chief men, as we have seen, were become in
every way corrupt. Hence the Prophet here especially inveighs against these
orders, and at the same time, records some vices which then prevailed among the
people, and that through the fault of the priests and rulers. But before I
pursue farther the subject of the Prophets something must be said of the
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To you is
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">, some explain it, &#8220;It is your
duty to do judgment,&#8221; to maintain government, that every one may discharge
his own office; for judgment is taken for rectitude; the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesgepheth,</i> means a right order of things. Hence they think that the
priests and rulers are here condemned for discharging so badly their office,
because they had no care for what was right. But this sense is too strained. The
Prophet, therefore, I doubt not, summons here the priests and the king&#8217;s
counselors to God&#8217;s tribunal, that they might give an answer there; for
the contempt of God, we know, prevailed among the great; they were secure, as
though exempt from judgment, as though released from laws and all order. <i>To
you</i>, then <i>is judgment;</i> that is, God addresses you by name, and
declares that he will be your avenger, though ye heedlessly despise his
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some again take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsephe,</i> for a beacon, and thus translate, &#8220;Ye have been a snare
instead of a beacon.&#8221; But this mistake is refuted by the second clause,
for the Prophet adds immediately,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a net expanded over
Tabor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and it is well known that Mizpah
and Tabor were high mountains, and for their height celebrated and renowned; we
also know that hunting was common on these mountains. The Prophet, then, no
doubt means here, that both the priests and the king&#8217;s counselors were
like snares and nets: &#8220;As fowlers and hunters were wont to spread their
nets and snares on mount Mizpah and on Tabor; so the people also have been
ensnared by you.&#8221; This is the plain meaning of the words. Some conjecture,
that robbers were there located by the kings of Israel to intercept the
Israelites, when they found any ascending into Jerusalem, as we now see
everywhere persons lying in wait, that no one from the Papacy may come over to
us. But this conjecture is too far fetched. I have already explained the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning: he makes use, as we have said, of a
similitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to what he teaches:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear
this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye Priests, and attend, ye house
of Israel, and give ear, ye house of the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, indeed, includes the
whole people in the second clause, but turns his discourse expressly to the
priests and the king&#8217;s counselors; which ought to be specially noticed;
for it is indeed, as we shall hereafter see, the general subject of this
chapter. He did not without reason attack the princes, because the main fault
was in them; nor the priests, because they were dumb dogs, and had also led away
the people from God&#8217;s pure worship into false superstitions; and so great
was their avidity for filthy lucre that they perverted the law and every thing
that was before pure among the people. It is no wonder then that the Prophet,
while treating a general subject, suitable to all orders indiscriminately,
should yet denounce judgment on the priests and the king&#8217;s counselors.
With regard to these counselors, they, in order to confirm the kingdom, had also
approved of false and spurious forms of worship, as it has been before stated;
and they had also followed other vices; for the Prophet, I doubt not, condemns
here other corruptions besides superstitions, and those which we know everywhere
prevailed among the people, and of which something has been already
said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to show his earnestness, he uses three sentences:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye priests, hear
this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of Israel,
attend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and in the third place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of the king, give
ear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said, &#8220;In vain
do they seek subterfuges, for the Lord will execute on them the judgment he now
declares:&#8221; and yet he gives them opportunity and time for repentance,
inasmuch as he bids them to attend to this denunciation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches, that even kings are not
exempted from the duty of learning what is commonly taught, if they wish to be
counted members of the Church; for the Lord would have all, without exception,
to be ruled by his word; and he takes this as a proof of men&#8217;s obedience,
their submission to his word. And as kings think themselves separated from the
general class of men, the Prophet here shows that he was sent to the king and
his counselors. The same reason holds good as to priests; for as the dignity of
their order is the highest, so this impiety has prevailed in all ages, that the
priests think themselves at liberty to do what they please. The Prophet
therefore shows, that they are not raised up so much on high, but that the Lord
shines eminently above their heads with his word. Let us know, lastly, that in
the Church the word of God so possesses the highest rank, that neither priests,
nor kings, nor their counselors, can claim a privilege to themselves, as though
their conduct was not to be subject to God&#8217;s word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is a remarkable passage for establishing
the word of God: and thus we see how abominable is the boast of the Papal clergy
of this day; for they spread before us the mask of the priesthood, when the word
of God is brought forward, as though they would outshine by the splendor of
their dignity the whole Law, all the Prophets, and the very Gospel. But the Lord
here upholds his word against all degrees of men, and shows that both kings and
priests must be brought down from their eminence, that they may obey the word.
Yea, we must bear in mind what I have before said, that though the whole people
had sinned, yet kings and priests are here in a special manner reproved, because
they deserved a heavier punishment, inasmuch as by their depraved examples they
had corrupted the whole people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he compares them to snares and nets, I do not
then confine this to one thing; but as the contagion among the whole people had
proceeded from the priests and the king&#8217;s counselors, and also from the
king himself, the Prophet compares them, not without reason, to snares; not only
because they were the authors of superstitions, but also because they perverted
judgment and all equity. Let us go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shecheth,</i> means, to kill, to sacrifice; and this place is usually
explained of sacrifices; and this opinion I do not reject. But though the
Prophet spake of sacrifices, he no doubt called sacrificing, in contempt,
killing: as though one should call the temple, the shambles, and the killing of
victims, slaughtering, so also the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In sacrificing and killing, they,
having turned aside, have become deeply
fixed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, By turning aside to
their own sacrificing, they have completely hardened their hearts, so that their
depravity is incurable. For by saying that they had gone deep, the meaning is,
that they were so addicted to their own superstitions, that they could not be
restored to a sound mind, however often admonished by the Prophets. Yet this
verb has another meaning in Scripture, even this, that men flatter themselves
with their own counsels, and think that by twining together reasons of their
own, they can deceive God: and this metaphor the Prophets employ with regard to
profane despisers of God, whom they call
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yxl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>latism</i>, mockers: for these, while they deceive men, think that they have
nothing to do with God. The same we see at this day: courtiers and proud men of
the same character, flatter themselves with their own deceptions, and
complacently laugh at our simplicity; because they think that wisdom was born
with them, and that it is enclosed as it were within their brains. But I know
not whether this idea is suitable to this passage. That simpler meaning which I
have already stated, I prefer, and that is, that the Israelites were so
obstinate in their superstitions, that they perversely despised all counsels,
all admonitions, yea, that they petulantly resisted every
instruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But each word must be noticed:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turning aside in
sacrificing</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, &#8220;they became
deep&#8221;. By saying, that they had turned aside in sacrificing, he no doubt
makes a distinction between false and strange forms of worship and the true
worship of God, prescribed in the law. The frequency of sacrificing could not
indeed have been condemned in itself either as to the Israelites or the Jews;
but they turned aside, that is, departed from what the law prescribes. Hence the
more zealously they engaged in sacrificing, and the more victims they offered to
God, the more they provoked God&#8217;s vengeance against themselves. We then
see that the Prophet points out here as by the finger the sin he reproved in the
people of Israel, and that was, &#8212; they sacrificed not according to
God&#8217;s command and according to the ritual of the law, but turned aside and
followed their own devices. Hence it is, that in contempt and in scorn he calls
their sacrificing, killing, or cutting the throat: &#8220;they are,&#8221; he
says &#8220;executioners,&#8221; or, &#8220;they are butchers. What is it to me,
that they bring their victims with great pomp and show? That they use so many
ceremonies? I repudiate,&#8221; the Lord says, &#8220;the whole of this; it is
profane butchering; these slaughterings have nothing in common with the worship
which I approve.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That our sacrifices then may please God, they must be
according to the rule of his word; for &#8216;obedience,&#8217; as it has been
said already, &#8216;is better than all sacrifices,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22.) But when men retake themselves to false forms of worship or such
as are invented, nothing then is holy or acceptable to God, but an abominable
filth. And further, the Prophet, as I have said, not only accuses the people of
having turned aside to perverted forms of worship, but also of having become
obstinately fixed in them. They have become deep, he says, in their
superstitions: as he said before, that they were fast joined to their idols,
that they could not be torn away from them; so also he says now, that they were
deeply rooted in their iniquity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows, <i>And I</i> have been, or will be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a correction to them
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some think that the Prophet in the
person of God threatens the Israelites, that God declares that he himself would
become the avenger, because the people had so stubbornly followed wicked
superstitions, &#8212; &#8220;I sit as a judge in heaven, nor will I suffer you
to fall away with impunity, since you are become so hardened in your
wickedness.&#8221; But they are more correct who think that their sin was more
increased by this circumstance, that God by his Prophets had not ceased to
recall the Israelites to a sound mind, since they might not have been wholly
irreclaimable: I have been to them a correction; that is, &#8220;They cannot
excuse themselves and say, that they had fallen through error and ignorance; for
there has been in them a wilful obstinacy, as I have not ceased to show them the
right way by my Prophets. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>been a correction to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> but I could not bend them, so
indomitable has been that stubbornness, or rather madness, with which they were
inflamed towards their idols.&#8221; It is now seen which of the two views I
deem the most correct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I will adduce a third: God may be thought to be
here complaining that he had been an object of dislike to the Israelites, as
though he said, &#8220;When I sent my Prophets, they could not bear to be
admonished, because my word was too bitter for them.&#8221; Reproofs are not
easily endured by men. We indeed know, that those who are ill at ease with
themselves, are yet not willing to hear any reproof: every one who deceives
himself, wishes to be deceived by others. As then the ears of men are so tender
and delicate, that they will patiently receive no reproof, this meaning seems
not inappropriate, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have been to
them all a correction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is,
&#8220;My doctrine has been by them rejected because it had in it too much
asperity.&#8221; But the other explanation, which I have mentioned as the
second, has been more approved: I was, however, unwilling to omit what seems to
me to be no less suitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now choose or receive either of these two
expositions, &#8212; either that the Lord here takes away from the Israelites
the excuse of error, because he had continued to reprove their vices by his
Prophets, &#8212; or that he expostulates with the Israelites for having
rejected his word on the ground that it was too rigid and severe: yet this main
thing will still remain the same, that the people of Israel were not only
apostates, having fallen away from the lawful worship of God into their own
superstitions but were also contumacious and refractory in their wickedness, so
that they would receive no instruction, no salutary counsels. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">God shows here that he is not pacified by the vain
excuses which hypocrites allege, and by which they think that the judgment of
God himself can be turned away. We see what great dullness there is in many,
when God reproves them, and brings to light their vices; for they defend
themselves with vain and frivolous excuses, and think that they thus put a
restraint on God, so that he dares not urge them any more. In this way
hypocrites elude every truth. But God here testifies, that men are greatly
deceived when they thus judge, by their own perception, of that celestial
tribunal to which they are summoned; <i>I</i>, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know Ephraim, and Israel is not
hid from me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is to be understood
an implied contrast, as though he said, that they were ignorant of themselves;
for they covered their vices, as I have said, with frivolous excuses. God
testifies that his eyes were not dazzled with such fine pretenses. &#8220;How
much soever, then, Ephraim and Israel may excuse themselves, they shall not
escape my judgment: vain and absurd are these shifts which they use; I indeed am
not ignorant.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn not to belie, by our own notions,
the judgment of God; and when he reproves us by his word, let us not delude
ourselves by our own fancies; for they who harden themselves in such a state of
security gain nothing. God sees more keenly than men. Let use then, beware of
spreading a veil over our sins, for God&#8217;s eyes penetrate through all such
excuses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That he names Ephraim particularly, was not done, we
know, without reason. From that tribe sprang the first Jeroboam: it was
therefore by way of honor that the name of Ephraim was given to the ten tribes.
But the Prophet names Ephraim here, who thought themselves superior to the other
tribes, by way of reproach: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
know them, and Israel is not hid from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He afterwards expresses what he knew
of the people, which was, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim was
wanton</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel was
polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said
&#8220;Contend as you please; but you will do so without profit: I have indeed
my ears stunned by your lies; but after you have adduced everything, after you
have sedulously pleaded your own cause, and have omitted nothing which may serve
for an excuse, the fact still will be, that you are wantons and polluted.&#8221;
In short, the Prophet confirms in this second clause what I have before stated,
that men, when they flatter themselves, deceive themselves; for God in the
meantime condemns them, and allows no disguise of this kind. Israel and Ephraim
gloried, then, in their superstitions, as though they held God bound to them:
&#8220;This is wantonness,&#8221; he says, &#8220;This is pollution.&#8221; The
Prophet indeed does here cut off the handle from all those self-deceptions which
men use as reasons, when they defend fictitious forms of worship; for God from
on high proclaims, that all are polluted who turn aside from his
word.</font><br></div>

them not to turn themselves;&#8221; and this meaning is probable, that is, that
they were so much given to their own superstitions, that they were not now free,
or at liberty, to return to the right way; as though the Prophet said,
&#8220;They are entirely enslaved by their own diabolical inventions, that their
inclinations will not allow them to repent.&#8221; But the former meaning (it is
also more generally approved) seems more adapted to the context.

animals, or with stones rather than with men; there is in them no reason, no
discernment; for the devil has fascinated their minds: never, then, will they
apply their endeavors to turn to their God.&#8221; If we prefer to view the
sentence as spoken in the person of God, still the doctrine will remain nearly
the same: God here declares that the people were incurable.

require of these wretched men, but to return to their God? This they ought to
have done of their own accord; but now, when they are admonished, they care not;
on the contrary, they fiercely resist wholesome instruction. Is not this a
strange and monstrous madness?&#8221; We hence see that there is an important
meaning in the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will
not apply their endeavors to return to their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for the Prophet might have simply
said, &#8220;to return to Jehovah,&#8221; or &#8220;to God;&#8221; but he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and he says so, because God had
made himself familiarly known to them, nay, brought them up in his own bosom, as
though they were his children and he their Father: they had forsaken him and had
become apostates; and when the Lord would now reprove this perfidy, was it not
strange that the people should close their ears and harden their hearts against
every instruction? We hence see how sharp this reproof is.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the spirit of wantonness
is in the midst of them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they
are so pleased with their own filthiness, that there is no shame, no fear. But
the reason of this comparison, which I have before explained, must be borne in
mind. As a wife, though not faithful to her husband, yet retains still some
modesty, as long as she continues at home, and while she is in any place classed
with faithful and chaste women; but when she once enters a brothel, and openly
prostitutes herself to all, when she knows that her baseness is universally
known, she then throws off every shame, and entirely forgets her own character:
so also the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of wantonness was in
the midst</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the people of Israel; as
though he said, &#8220;The Israelites are so imbrued with their superstitions,
that they cannot now be touched or moved by any reverence for God; they cannot
be restored to the right way, for the devil has demented them, and having cast
off every shame, they are like abominable strumpets.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah they have not
known</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By this sentence the Prophet
extenuates not the sin of the people, but, on the contrary, amplifies their
ingratitude, because they had forgotten their God, who had so indulgently
treated them. As they had been redeemed by God&#8217;s hand, as the teaching of
the law had continued among them, as they had been preserved to that day through
God&#8217;s constant kindness, it was truly an evidence of monstrous ignorance,
that they could in an instant adopt ungodly forms of worship, and embrace those
corruptions which they knew were condemned in the law. It was surely an
inexcusable wickedness in the people thus to withdraw themselves from their God.
This is the reason why the Prophet now says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they knew not
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But if they were asked the
cause, they could not have said that they had no light; for God had made known
to them the way of salvation. Hence, that they knew not Jehovah, was to be
imputed to their perverseness; for, closing their eyes, they knowingly and
willfully ran headlong after those wicked devices, which they knew, as it had
been stated before, to be condemned by God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet having condemned the Israelites on two
accounts &#8212; for having departed from the true God &#8212; and for having
obstinately refused every instruction, now adds, that God&#8217;s vengeance was
nigh at hand. &#8220;Testify then shall the pride of Israel in his face&#8221;;
that is, Israel shall find what it is thus to resist God and his Prophets. The
Prophet no doubt applies the word, pride, to their contempt of instruction,
because they were so swollen with vain confidence, as to think that wrong was
done them whenever the Prophets reproved them. It must at the same time be
observed, that they were thus refractory, because they were like persons
inebriated with their own pleasures; for we know that while men enjoy
prosperity, they are more insolent, according to that old proverb,
&#8220;Satiety begets ferocity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>one,</i> means here &#8220;to be humbled;&#8221; and this sense is not
unsuitable: &#8220;The pride of Israel shall then be humbled before his
face.&#8221; But another exposition has been most approved; I am therefore
inclined to embrace it, and that is, that God needed no other witness to convict
Israel than their own pride; and we know that when any one becomes hardened, he
thinks that there is to be no judgment, and has no thought of rendering an
account to God, for his pride takes away every fear. For this reason the Prophet
says, &#8220;God will convict you, because ye have been hitherto so proud, that
he could effect nothing by his warnings.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel and Ephraim shall fall in
their iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He pursues the same
subject, which is, that they in vain promised impunity to themselves, for the
Lord had now resolved to punish them. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah also shall fall with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet may seem to contradict
himself; for when he before threatened the people of Israel, he spoke of the
safety of Judah, &#8212; &#8216;Judah shall be saved by his God, not by the
sword, nor by the bow.&#8217; Since then the Prophet had before distinguished or
made a difference between the ten tribes and the kingdom of Judah, how is it
that he now puts them all together without any distinction? To this I answer,
that the Prophet speaks here not of those Jews who continued in true and pure
religion, but of those who had with the Israelites alienated themselves from the
only true God, and joined in their superstitions. He then refers here to the
degenerate and not to the faithful Jews; for to all who worshipped God aright,
salvation had been already promised. But as many as had abandoned themselves to
the common superstitions, he declares that a common punishment was nigh them
all. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Jews then shall fall
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, &#8220;As many of the
Jews as have followed impious forms of worship and other deprivations, shall not
escape God&#8217;s judgment.&#8221; We now then perceive the true meaning of the
Prophet. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here laughs to scorn the hypocrisy of the
people, because they thought they had ready at hand a way of dealing with God,
which was, to pacify him with their sacrifices. He therefore shows that neither
the Israelites nor the Jews would gain any thing by accumulating
burnt-offerings, for they could not in this way return into favor with God. He
thereby intimates that God requires true repentance, and that he will not be
reconciled to men, except from the heart they seek him and consecrate themselves
to his service; and not because they offer brute beasts. The faithful, no doubt,
expiated their sins at that time by sacrifices, but only typically: for they
knew for what end and purpose God had made the law concerning sacrifices, and
that was, that the sinner, being reminded by the sight of the victim, might
confess himself to be worthy of eternal death, and thus flee to God&#8217;s
mercy and look to Christ and his sacrifice; for in him, and nowhere else, is to
be found true and effectual expiation. For this end then had God instituted
sacrifices: so the faithful, while offering sacrifices, did not suppose any
satisfaction to be done by the external work, nor even imagined it to be the
price of redemption; but they exercised themselves in these rites in faith and
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now, by implication, sets oxen, and rams,
and lambs, in opposition to spiritual sacrifices; for a contrast is to be
understood in the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall come with their sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. What
bring they to God&#8217;s presence? They bring, he says, only their rams, they
bring oxen; but God commands what is far different: he commands men to
consecrate themselves to him, and that in a spiritual manner, and as to external
rites, to refer them to Christ, and to the true expiation, which was yet hid in
hope. Since then the Israelites brought only their oxen and lambs to God, they
in vain expected him to be propitious to them; for he is not pacified by such
trifles; inasmuch as every one who separates the outward sacrifice from its
design, brings nothing but what is profane. Indeed, the true and lawful
consecration is by the word; and by the word we are guided to faith in Christ,
we are guided to repentance: when these are neglected and disregarded, and men
securely trust in their sacrifices, they do nothing but mock God. We hence see
that the Prophet exposes not here without reason this folly of the Israelites,
that they sought God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with their
flocks and their herds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or shall go,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to seek
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By this sentence he intimates that
hypocrites sedulously labour to reconcile God to themselves; and we even see
with what zeal they weary themselves; and of this there is a remarkable instance
at this day in the Papists; for they spare no diligence, when they seek to
pacify God. But the Prophet says that this labour is vain and foolish.
&#8220;Let them go,&#8221; he says, that is, &#8220;Let them weary themselves;
but they shall do so without profit, for they shall not find God.&#8221; But
when he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they would
come to seek Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he is not to be
understood as saying, that they would really do so; for hypocrites turn aside
from God by circuitous courses and windings, rather than seek access to him. But
yet they propose it as their final intention, as they speak, to seek God: they
do not indeed come afterwards to him; nay, they dread his face, and shun it as
much as they can; and yet when one asks them what they intend by sacrificing and
by performing other rites, the answer is ready on their lips, &#8220;We worship
God,&#8221; that is, &#8220;We desire to worship him.&#8221; Since then
hypocrites are wont to boast of this, the Prophet speaks by way of concession,
and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall come to seek
God, but shall not find
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists of this day pursue a similar course, when
they go round their altars, when they gad away to perform vowed pilgrimages,
when they whisper their prayers, when they hear and buy masses; for to what
purpose are all these things, but by interposing these veils to escape
God&#8217;s judgment? They know themselves to be exposed to his judgment; their
conscience forces them to pacify God: but what do they in the meantime? &#8220;I
will find out a way in which God will not pursue me: let this then be the price
of redemption, let this be a compensation.&#8221; In a word, we see that the
Papists mock God with their ceremonies, that they have nothing else in view but
to seek hiding-places: and hence the Lord by his Prophet complains, that his
temple was like a den of robbers,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:11:) for men securely sin, when they publicly offer such expiations. Nay, the
Papists, when they mutter their prayers, say that the final intention is
pleasing to God, though they may wander in their thoughts: for if, when they
begin to pray, it should come to their minds, that God is prayed to, though they
may not attend to their prayers, though they may pollute themselves with many
depraved lusts yet, if with the mouth they utter prayers, they maintain that the
final intention pleases God. &#8212; Why? Because their design is to seek God.
This is, indeed, extremely sottish and puerile: but, as I have already said, the
Prophet does not press this point, but concedes to the Israelites what they
pretended, &#8220;Ye seek God; but yet ye run not in the right way; and these
circuitous courses will not lead you to God.&#8221; How so? &#8220;For ye recede
farther from him.&#8221; So Isaiah says, &#8216;She will greatly weary herself
in her ways:&#8217; but in the meantime she followed not the right way, but, on
the contrary, turned aside after various errors, and thus receded from the Lord,
and came not to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God had removed or separated
himself from them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he intimates that he
is not propitious but to the faithful, who think not so grossly of him, as to
seek to feed him with the flesh of oxen or other sacrifices, or to pacify him
with disagreeable odour; but who seek him spiritually and from the heart, who
bring true repentance. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had acted perfidiously with
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> for they had violated his covenant.
We must bear in mind what I have said before of the mutual faith which God
stipulates with us, when he binds himself to us. God then covenants with us on
this condition, that he will be our Father and Husband; but he requires from us
such obedience as a son ought to render to his father; he requires from us that
chastity which a wife owes to her husband. The Prophet now charges the people
with unfaithfulness, because they had despised the true God, and prostituted
themselves to idols.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he also aggravates this crime by saying, that
they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>begotten strange
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for he intimates, that their
condition had become so vitiated, that there remained no better hope as to their
posterity. Some explain the words, that they had begotten strange children, in
this way, &#8212; that they had taken wives from heathen nations, contrary to
the law. But this sense is very frigid. Others understand, that they had
begotten spurious children, because they brought up their children badly,
having, from their infancy, attached them to depraved superstitions. This is
indeed true, but the prophet, as I have already said, looked further; he meant
that the Israelites had not only become alienated from God, but had also taken
away every hope as to the future. It may indeed be, and it sometimes happens,
that men for a time abandon themselves to many vices, and afterwards return to
the right way; but when corruption has so prevailed that the children are
infected with the same vices, and impiety itself takes full possession of them,
then the state of things is past recovery. We now then see that the Prophet
means, that the Israelites were not only covenant-breakers with respect to God,
but that they had also led their children into the game perfidy, so that there
was no hope of repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore subjoins the punishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Devour them shall a month
together with their portions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Some restrict the word, month, to the times of the new moon, or to the new
moons; and these days, we know, were festivals among the Jews: but this seems
too far-fetched and strained. The Prophet therefore, I doubt not, takes here a
month for a short time; and so the Hebrew scholars explain it, and yet they do
not sufficiently unfold this form of speaking. Now, the Prophets are wont to use
various figures, when they intend to mark out a short time. Isaiah says,
&#8216;Yet for three years, as the time of a hireling:&#8217; for hirelings were
wont to hire themselves for three years; hence he says, This is the time fixed
by the Lord as the appointed day. Contracts, also, we know, were then monthly,
as they are at this day yearly, both with reference to the interest of money and
other exchanges. Since, then, they usually made agreements for single months,
the Prophet here, I have no doubt, takes a month metaphorically for a certain
and fixed time. I do not therefore agree with the Hebrew scholars, who say that
only a short time is expressed by the Prophet, but he expresses not only a
short, but also a fixed time; and he did this that the Israelites might not
vainly look for any deferring or respite, for hypocrites ever procrastinate and
extend time by vain delusions. The Prophet therefore says here<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A month shall devour
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which means, &#8220;Vengeance is
now suspended over their heads, and this they shall not
escape.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, &#8220;with their portions&#8221;. He
intimates here, no doubt, that though they then overflowed with abundance, yet
nothing would be a help to them to keep them from being destroyed, for the hand
of God was against them. We indeed know, that as long as men are well furnished
with provisions and protection, they are not very solicitous about their state,
but heedlessly despise whatever dangers there may be in the world: therefore the
Prophet says, that though they were opulent and well supplied, though they
possessed every kind of defense, yet nothing would avail for their safety, but a
month should devour them, together with all their wealth. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet speaks here more emphatically, and there
is in these words a certain lively representation; for the Prophet assumes here
the character of a herald, or he introduces heralds who declare and proclaim
war. The truth itself ought indeed to storm not only our ears, but also our
hearts, and be more powerful than any trumpet: but we yet see how unconcerned we
are. Hence the Lord is constrained here to clothe his servant with the character
of a herald, or at least he bids his servant to send forth heralds to proclaim
war everywhere throughout the whole kingdom of Israel. This was not, properly
speaking, the office of a Prophet; but we see that Ezekiel was ordered by the
Lord to besiege Jerusalem for a time, &#8212; and why? Because his whole
teaching, after the Jews had been a thousand times threatened, became frigid:
God then added visions, which more effectually roused torpid men. So also does
Hosea in this place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shout with
the trumpet in Gibeah, blow the cornet in Ramah, and sound the horn in
Beth-aven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for God, as we have said, is
pursuing Israel, and will not suffer them to rest; so that the Israelites might
know that God threatens not in vain, that his reproofs are not bugbears, but
that he deals in earnest when he reproves the ungodly, and that execution, as
they say, will follow what he teaches. In the same manner does Paul also
say,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Vengeance is prepared by us, and
is in readiness against all those who extol themselves against the greatness of
Christ, how great soever they may be,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 10:5,6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the ungodly are wont to make this
objection, that the Prophets preach nothing but words, Hosea here testifies that
he did not in vain terrify men, but that the effect, as they say, would
immediately follow, unless they reconciled themselves to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as we perceive the Prophet&#8217;s purpose, let
us take care to receive by faith that peace which the Lord daily proclaims to us
by his messengers. For what is the Gospel but what Paul declares it to
be?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;We discharge the office of
ambassadors,&#8217; he says, &#8216;for Christ, that ye may be reconciled to
God, and in Christ&#8217;s name we exhort you to return into favor with
God,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 5:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that all the ministers of the Gospel are
God&#8217;s heralds, who invite us to peace, and promise that God is ready to
grant us pardon, if with the heart we seek him. But if we receive not this
message and this embassy, there will remain for us the dreadful judgment, of
which the Prophet now speaks, and our impiety will procure for us this awful
doom. As though God then were now declaring war against all the ungodly and the
despisers of his grace, the Prophet says that they shall find that God is armed
for vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the Prophet doubtless has here mentioned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gibeah,
Ramah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and &#8220;Beth-aven&#8221;,
because in these places great assemblies usually met; and it may be also that
they were strong fortresses. Since then the Israelites thought themselves
unconquerable, because they had invincible strongholds against their enemies,
the Prophet here expressly declares war against them. Everywhere then sound ye

figure of speech, for the whole of Israel, because he was a brother of Joseph by
the same mother: the tribe of Benjamin is therefore everywhere joined with
Ephraim. It is at the same time certain, that the Prophet confines not here his
address to one tribe, but includes, under one tribe or one part, the whole
kingdom of Israel. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet asserts, without any figure, that
their chastisement would not be slight or paternal, but that God would punish
the Israelites as they deserved, that he would reduce them to nothing. God, we
know, sometimes spares the ungodly, while he chastises them: signs of his wrath
daily appear through the whole world; but at the same time they are moderate
punishments which God inflicts on men; and he in a manner invites them to
repentance, when he thus mercifully chastises their sins. But the Prophet says
here, that God would no longer act in this manner; for he would destroy and
wholly blot out the whole kingdom of Israel. They had been already often warned,
not only in words, but also in deeds and had often felt the wrath of God; but
they still persisted in their course. And now, as God saw that they were wholly
stupid, he says, <i>No</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>w, in
the day of correction, Ephraim shall be for
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said, &#8220;I
will not correct Israel as heretofore, for they have been before in various ways
chastised, but have not repented; I will therefore now lay aside those paternal
corrections which I have hitherto used, for I have in vain applied such
remedies: I will then henceforth so correct Israel, that they shall be entirely
destroyed.&#8221; We now comprehend the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is a remarkable passage; for men are always
slow and dilatory; even when God pricks them, as it were, with goads, they
remain slothful in their sins. God adds corrections, one after the other; and
when he sees men continuing as it were out of their senses, he then testifies
that it is no time for reproof, but that final destruction is at hand. We hence
see that every hope is here cut off from the Israelites, that they might not
think that they would be punished in the usual way for their sins; for as soon
as the Lord would begin to reprehend them, he would destroy and blot out their
names:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be for desolation
in the day of
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the tribes of Israel I
have made known the truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some regard this
sentence as spoken in the person of God, and refer it to the first covenant
which God made with the whole people; and so consider this to be the sense,
&#8220;I do not now of a sudden proceed to take vengeance on the Israelites; for
I have begotten this people, nourished them, brought them up to manhood. Since
this is the case, there is now no reason for them to complain, that I am too
precipitant in taking vengeance.&#8221; This is one meaning: but I rather
incline to their opinion, who regard this as spoken in the person of the
Prophet; I do not yet follow altogether their opinion, for they suppose that the
fault of the people in being unteachable is alone set forth:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have made known the truth
through the tribes of Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as though
the Prophet had said, &#8220;This people is unworthy that God should chastise
them in a paternal manner, for they have hardened themselves in their
wickedness; and though they have been more than sufficiently taught their duty,
they have yet openly despised God, and have done this, not through ignorance,
but through perverseness: since then the people of Israel have blinded and
demented themselves, as it were, willfully, what now remains, but that God will
bring them to desolation?&#8221; So they expound this place. But it seems to me
that a protestation is what suits this passage:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have made known the truth
through the tribes of Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as though
he said, &#8220;This is fixed and ratified, which I now declare, and it shall
certainly be; let then no one seek any escape for himself, for God threatens not
now, as often before, for the purpose of recalling men to repentance, but
declares what he will do.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That this may be better understood, the mode of
speaking in familiar use among all the Prophets is to be noticed: they often
threaten, and then give hope of pardon, and promise salvation, so that they seem
to exhibit some sort of contradiction: for after having fulminated against the
people, they come at once to preach grace, they offer salvation, they testify
that God will be propitious. At first sight the Prophets seem not to be
consistent with themselves. But the solution is easy, for they threatened
vengeance to men under condition; afterwards, when they saw some fruit, they
then set forth the mercy of God, and began to be heralds of peace, to reconcile
men to God, and make an agreement between them. Thus our Prophet often
threatened the Israelites; and had they repented, the hope of salvation would
not have been cut off from them. But after he had found them to be so obstinate
that they would not receive any instruction, he then said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have announced the truth
through the tribes of Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is,
God does not now say, &#8220;Except ye repent, you are lost;&#8221; but he
speaks positively; because he sees that the well known doctrine has been
despised: this then is the truth. It is the same as if he said, &#8220;This is
the last denunciation, which shall be fixed and
unalterable.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Jeremiah also speaks in the same manner: his book
is full of various threatenings; and yet they are conditional threatening. But
after God had taken the matter in hand, he began to act in a different way:
&#8220;I now call you no more to repentance, I contend not with you, I do not
now set forth God as a judge, that ye may flee to him for mercy; all these
things are come to an end; what remains now&#8221;, he says, &#8220;is the last
command, to show that you are now past hope.&#8221; This is the true and real
meaning of the Prophet here; and whosoever will consider the whole context, will
easily perceive that this was the Prophet&#8217;s intention. He had said before,
&#8220;Ephraim shall be for desolation in the day of correction,&#8221; that is,
&#8220;The Lord will no longer reprove Ephraim as heretofore, but will entirely
destroy him:&#8221; then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have promulgated or published
the truth through the tribes of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;know ye that vengeance will come shortly,
and that it is ratified before God; know also that I speak authoritatively, as
if the hand of God were now stretched forth before your eyes.&#8221; Now follows
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet transfers the blame of all the evils
which then reigned in the tribe of Judah to their princes. He says, that the
people had fallen away and departed from God through their fault, and he uses a
most fit similitude. We know that there is nothing certain in the possessions of
men, except the boundaries of fields be fixed; for no one can otherwise keep his
own. But by the metaphor of boundaries in fields, the Prophet refers to the
whole political order. The meaning is, that all things were now in a state of
disorder and confusion among the Jews; because their leaders who ought to have
ruled the people and kept them in obedience, had destroyed the whole order of
things. We now then understand what the Prophet had really in
view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be observed that the tribe of Judah had
been hitherto kept separate, as it were by limits, as God&#8217;s heritage; for
Israel had become alienated. The possession of God had been diminished by the
defection of Jeroboam; and he retained only one tribe and a half in his service.
The Prophet says now, that the Jews had mixed with the Israelites, and had thus
become themselves alienated from the Lord; for the princes themselves had taken
away the boundaries, that is, they had, through indolence and other vices,
destroyed all reverence for God, all care for religion, and also every concern
for what was just and right: he therefore severely threatens them, &#8220;I will
pour out&#8221;, he says, &#8220;my wrath upon them like
waters&#8221;.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By this metaphor, he means that God would deal much
more severely with them than with the common people: &#8220;I,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;will with full force pour forth upon them my fury, as if it were the
deluge of antiquity.&#8221; The meaning is, &#8220;I will overwhelm them in my
vengeance, because they have done more evil by their bad examples, than if they
had been private individuals.&#8221; We hence see that the corruption of the
people is imputed to the princes, and therefore God&#8217;s more dreadful
vengeance is denounced on them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must bear in mind what I have before said,
that the Prophet gives here metaphorically the name of boundaries to the lawful
worship of God, and to whatever he had enjoined on the people, that they might
be his certain possession, as fields among men are usually separated by bounds
that every one may keep his own. It follows. &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the Prophet shows that the vengeance of
God would be just against Israel, because they willingly followed the impious
edicts of their king. The people might indeed have appeared to be excusable,
since religion had not been changed by their voice, or by public consent, or by
any contrivance of the many, but by the tyrannical will of the king alone:
Jeroboam was not induced by superstition, but by subtile wickedness, to erect
altars elsewhere, and not at Jerusalem. The people then might have appeared to
be without blame; for the king alone devised this artifices to secure himself
from danger. But the Prophet shows that all were implicated in the same guilt
before God, because the people adopted with alacrity the impious forms of
worship which the king had commanded. He therefore says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim is exposed to plunder,
that he is broken by judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> (or,
&#8220;shall be broken,&#8221; for the words may be rendered in the future
tense.) That the people then were thus torn, and were also to bear in future far
more grievous things, was not, as he says, because they had to suffer all these
things undeservedly, for they were not innocent. &#8212; How so? Because they
willingly followed the commands of their king; for the king did not force them
to forsake the doctrine of the law, but every one went voluntarily after impious
superstitions. Since then they willingly obeyed their king, they could not now
excuse themselves, they could not object that this was done by one man, and that
they were not admitted to consult with him. Their promptitude proved them to be
perfidious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyawh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>evail,</i> to begin,&#8221; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lay</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ial,</i> is often taken in this sense: but as it oftener signifies, &#8220;to
be willing,&#8221; the Prophet no doubt means here, that the Israelites had not
been compelled by force and fear to go astray after superstitions; but that they
were prompt and ready to obey, for there was in them no fear of God, no
religion. If any one should now ask, whether they are excusable, who are
tyrannically drawn away into superstitions, as we see to be done under the
Papacy, the answer is ready, that those are not here absolved who regarded men
more than God: nor is terror, as we know, a sufficient excuse, when we prefer
our own life to the glory of God, and when, anxious to provide for ourselves and
to avoid the cross, we deny God, or turn aside from making a confession of the
right and pure faith: but the fault is rendered double, when men easily comply
with any thing commanded by tyrants; for they show, that they were already fully
inclined to despise God and to deny true religion. Hence the impiety of Jeroboam
discovered the common ungodliness and wickedness of the whole people; for as
soon as he raised his finger and bid them to worship God corruptly, all joyfully
followed the impious edict. There was an occasion then offered to them; but the
evil dwelt before in their hearts; for they were not so inclined and prompt to
obey God. We now then see what the Prophet had in view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that God would justly punish all the
Israelites, yea, even all the common people; for though Jeroboam alone had
commanded them to worship God corruptly, yet all of them willingly embraced what
he wished to be done: and thus it became manifest that they had in them no fear
of God. We now see how vain is the excuse of those who say that they ought to
obey kings, and at the same time forsake the word of God: for what does the
Prophet reprove here, but that the Israelites had been too submissive to their
king? &#8220;But this in itself was worthy of praise.&#8221; True, when the king
commanded nothing contrary to God&#8217;s word; but when he perverted
God&#8217;s worship, when he set up corrupt superstitions, then the people ought
to have firmly resisted him: but as they were too pliant, nay, willingly allowed
themselves to be drawn away from the true worship of God, the Prophet says here,
that they had no reason to complain, that they were too sharply and too severely
chastised by the Lord. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God now denounces punishment in common on the two
kingdoms; but he speaks not as before, he says not that his fury would be like a
deluge, to overwhelm and drown the people. What then? He compares himself to
little worms which gnaw wood and consume cloths; or he compares himself to
rottenness; for, as we have said, the second word is to be so taken, as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bqr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rekob,</i> is properly rottenness, and is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bqr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rekab,</i> to rot;&#8221; it is then rottenness or putrescence. But as I have
said, some would render it, &#8220;a grub;&#8221; and there is a probable reason
for this, because he first mentioned moth; and these two, moth and grub 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, would
be more suitable to each other, than moth and rottenness. However, the meaning
of the Prophet is by no means obscure, and that is, that the Lord would by a
slow corrosion consume both the people; that though he would not by one onset
destroy them, yet they would pine away until they became wholly rotten. This is
the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe why the Prophet used this
metaphor. It was, that the Israelites and the Jews might understand, that though
the Lord would in some measure withhold his hand from resting heavily upon them,
and that though he would spare them, yet they would not be safe, because they
would by little and little feel a slow decay, that would consume them. And the
Lord meant in this way to turn the people to repentance; but he effected
nothing: for such was their hardness, that they felt not this slow decay; as
those who are stupid are not moved, except they feel a most grievous pain; they
think that they are doing well, and they struggle against their own disease:
many such we see. Hence the Prophet here reminds them, that though the Lord
should not openly fulminate against the Israelites and the Jews, they yet in
vain flattered themselves, because the Lord would be to them a moth and a worm;
that is, that however gradually he might consume them, they would yet be greatly
deceived, if they did not perceive that they had to do with
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The chief instruction is, that God does not always
punish men in the same way; for he deals with them differently, either to
promote their salvation, or to render them in this way more inexcusable. Hence
God sometimes pours forth his severity, and at another time he slowly chastises
us. But whatever may be the way, we are reminded that we ought not to sleep,
whenever the Lord awakens us; nor should we wait until he appears as a lion or a
bear, until he devours us, until he rages against us in dreadful fury. We are
then reminded that there is no reason why we should wait for this; but that when
God consumes us by degrees, it ought instantly to occur to us, that though the
moth and the worm are but very small insects, hardly seen by the eyes, yet a
hard and firm tree is consumed by these little worms, or by its own cariousness;
and that cloths are consumed with putridity, when once the moth enters into
them; we see valuable furniture perishing. Since it is so, there is no reason
for men to be secure when God shows any sign of his wrath, though he pours not
forth his horrible vengeance, but is as a hidden putrefaction. We now perceive
what Hosea means in this verse. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

most men; for when the Lord deals mildly with us, we perceive not his hand, but
think that what evils happen to us come by chance. Then, as if we had nothing to

disease, neither do they inquire how they procured these pains for themselves,
that they might seek fit remedies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim knew his
disease</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but at the same time overlooked the
cause of his disease, and was only affected by his present pain. So also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah knew his
wound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> but he understood not that he was
struck and wounded by the hand of God; but was only affected with his pain, like
brute beasts who feel the stroke and sigh, while they have, in the meantime,
neither reason nor judgment to understand whence, or for what cause the evil has
come to them. In a word, the Prophet here condemns this brutish stupidity in
both people; for they did not so far profit under God&#8217;s rod as to return
to him, but, on the contrary, they sought other remedies; because stupor had
taken such hold on their minds, that they did not consider that they were
chastised by God, and that this was done for just reasons. As then no such thing
came to their mind, but they only felt themselves ill and grieved as brutes do,
they went to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems here to inveigh only against the
ten tribes; but though he expressly speaks of the kingdom of Israel, there is no
doubt but that he accused also the Jews in common with them. Why then does he
name only Ephraim? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Even
because the beginning of this evil commenced in the kingdom of Israel: for they
were the first who went to the king of Assur, that they might, by his help,
resist their neighbors, the Syrians: the Jews afterwards followed their example.
Since then the Israelites afforded a precedent to the Jews to send for aids of
this kind, the Prophet expressly confines his discourse to them. But there is no
doubt, as I have already said, but that the accusation was
common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the Prophet meant:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw his disease, and
Judah his wound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;Though
I have, like a moth and a worm, consumed the kingdom of Israel as well as the
kingdom of Judah, and they have felt themselves to be, as it were, decaying, and
though their disease ought to have led them to repentance, they have yet turned
their thoughts elsewhere; they have even supposed that they could be made whole
by seeking a remedy either from the Assyrians or some others: thus it happened
that they hastened to Assyria, and sought help from king Jareb.&#8221; We then
see, in short, that the stupidity and hardness of the people are here reproved,
because they were not turned by these evils to repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think Jareb to have been a city in Assyria; but
there is no ground for this conjecture. Others suppose that Jareb was a
neighboring king to the Assyrian, and was sent to when the Assyrian, from a
friend and a confederate, became an enemy, and invaded the kingdom of Israel;
but this conjecture also has no solid grounds. It may have been the proper name
of a man, and I prefer so to take it. For it seemed not necessary for the
Prophet to speak here of many auxiliaries; but after the manner of the Hebrews,
he repeats the same thing twice. Some render it, &#8220;to revenge;&#8221;
because they sent for that king, even the Assyrian, as a revenger. But this
exposition also is forced. More simple appears to me what I have already said,
that they sent for the Assyrian, that is, for king Jareb.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet could he not heal you, nor
will he cure you of your wound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here God
declares that whatever the Israelites might seek would be in vain. &#8220;Ye
think,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that you can escape my hand by these remedies; but
your folly will at length betray itself, for he will avail you nothing; that is,
king Jareb will not heal you.&#8221; In this clause the Prophet shows, that
unless we immediately return to God, when he warns us by his scourges, it will
be in vain for us to look here and there for remedies: for in this world many
allurements come in our way; but when we hope for any relief, the Lord will at
length show that we have been deluded. There is, then, but one remedy, &#8212;
to go directly to God; and this is what the Prophet means, and this is the
application of the present doctrine. He had said before that Ephraim had felt
his disease and Judah his wounds; that is, &#8220;I have led them thus far, that
they have acknowledged themselves to be ill; but they have not gone on as they
ought to have done, so as to return to me: on the contrary, they have turned
aside to king Jareb and to other delusions.&#8221; Then it follows, &#8220;But
these remedies have turned ant rather for harm to you; they certainly have not
profited you.&#8221; A confirmation of this sentence follows

<div><font face="Palatino">As I have said, the Prophet confirms this truth, that
Israel had recourse in vain to false physicians, when they left God. How so?
Because the whole world, were it to favor us, could not yet help us, against the
will of God and his opposing power. But God here declares that he would be
adverse to the Israelites; as though he said, &#8220;Provide human aids as much
as you please; but will the Assyrian be superior to me in power? Can he hinder
me from pursuing you as I have determined?&#8221; Thus God shows that he would
deal in a new and different manner with the Israelites and the Jews: &#8220;I
will not,&#8221; he says, &#8220;be any longer like a moth and a worm; I shall
come like a lion to you, with an open mouth to devour you: now let the Assyrian
king come forth, when I shall thus go armed against you; can he put any
hindrance in my way, that I should not execute my vengeance, as it shall seem
good to me?&#8221; We now then perceive the design of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had said, that God would punish the Israelites and
the Jews, by consuming them by degrees, that there might be more time for
repentance: but he says that this would be useless, for they would not think
that it was done seriously. They would therefore deceive themselves with vain
fallacies. What would then at last remain? Even this, &#8220;I will,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;put on a new form and go to battle: I will be to you
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a lion and a young
lion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> I will rage against you as a
fierce wild beast: your grievance shall not now be from moths and worms; but you
shall have an open and dreadful contest with the lion and the young lion. What
then will the Assyrian king avail you?&#8221; And this place teaches, that men,
when they attempt to oppose vain helps to the wrath of God, gain only this, that
they more and more provoke and inflame his wrath against themselves. After God
has first gnawed, he will at length devour; after he has pricked, he will deeply
wound; after he has struck, he will wholly destroy. All this we bring on
ourselves by our perverse attempts, when we try to seek escapes for ourselves.
Except, then, we would willingly kindle God&#8217;s displeasure, that he may
appear as a lion and rage against us with the whole force of his wrath, let us
take heed, that we deceive not ourselves by vain reliefs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I, I will take
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, &#8220;tear,&#8221; or,
&#8220;tear in pieces;&#8221; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;r&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shereph,</i> properly means this, and it agrees better with the rest of the
context. &#8220;I will then, as lions and young lions are wont to do, tear in
pieces, limb from limb, the whole people.&#8221; Then he says, I will <i>go
away</i> as a lion, who, after he has enjoyed his prey, departs a conqueror with
more courage being not put to flight, for he is moved by no fear. So also the
Prophet says, &#8220;Let the Assyrian king come, he will not constrain me to
retreat, nor will he rescue the spoil from me: and when I shall be satiated with
your destruction, I shall not then have any fear on account of the Assyrian
king, that I should stealthily flee away, as foxes are wont to do; I will not
craftily contend; but I will go forth openly, my violence will be sufficient to
put him to flight: I will thus depart of my own accord; for your subsidies will
occasion me no fear.<i> I will take away,</i> he says, and none shall
rescue.&#8221; We now comprehend the whole meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shicker,</i> signifies the morning: hence the verb means, &#8220;to seek
early,&#8221; or, &#8220;to rise early,&#8221; as men do when they apply
themselves diligently to anything: but in many places of Scripture it is taken
simply in the sense of seeking; and this simple meaning seems most suitable to
this place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will seek me in
their tribulation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God here declares,
that after having been dreadfully fierce against both the kingdoms of Judah and
Israel, he would for a time rest quietly and wait from heaven what they would
do. He then adds, &#8220;They will at length return to a sane mind: when they
shall perceive the finishing part, they will then, having lost their
perverseness, acknowledge their sins and be truly humbled.&#8221; This is the
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The mode of speaking seems apparently strange, when
God says, that he will go away; for he neither so hides himself in heaven, that
he neglects human affairs, nor withdraws his hand, but that he sustains the
world by the continued exercise of his power, nor even takes away his Spirit
from men, especially when he would lead them to repentance; for men never of
their own accord turn themselves to God, but by his hidden influence. What then
does he mean by this, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will go
and return to my place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> Why, indeed, he
speaks here of the external state of the people: then the meaning is,
&#8220;After the two kingdoms shall be cut off, I will then for a time hide my
face from both the people; and they will think that I care not for their
salvation; they will think that they are far removed from me.&#8221; We hence
see that the Prophet here only refers to what would be the external condition of
the people; and then we also see, that these forms of speech are accommodated to
the perceptions of men. So God also himself speaks in Isaiah 18, though for a
different purpose; yet the Prophet expresses there in reality the same thing;
&#8216;I will rest,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and I will wait in my
tabernacle.&#8217; What was that rest of God, and what was his tabernacle? Why,
when God exercised his judgments, we are then constrained to feel his presence,
and when he kindly favors us and exhibits the kindness of a Father, he then
really shows himself propitious to us: but when he neither visits us for our
sins, nor gives us tokens of his favor, he seems to withdraw himself from us,
and to show no regard for our life. We now then understand that the Prophet
speaks of the time of exile; as though he said, &#8220;After God shall execute
against you his extreme judgment, and ye shall be liken away into exile, God
will then forsake you, as if he in no way regarded you, but were unmindful of
you; for he will leave you there to rest, even in Chaldea and Assyria; and then
he will not send forth any light of salvation. God therefore will be as it were
idle in heaven.&#8221; This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet shows at the same time the final
issue, that is, that they will afterwards return to the Lord; and that this is
also the purpose of God he affirms,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till they
acknowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they have
sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For it is the beginning of
healing, when men consider the cause of their disease. He had said before that
Israel saw his disease, but not in a right way; for the origin of the disease
was hid from him, and continued as yet hid. But now the Prophet distinctly shows
that it is to seek God, when people acknowledge and confess their sins. This
word continually occurs in Scripture when sacrifices are spoken of. Hence men
are said then to sin, when they go forth before God, making a true confession,
when they acknowledge their guilt and pray for pardon. So also in this place he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until they confess that
they have sinned I will for a time hide
myself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he adds, &#8220;They will
seek my face&#8221;. This is the second thing in attaining salvation &#8212; to
seek the face of God: for we are reconciled to God, we know, by repentance and
faith; not that repentance procures pardon for us, but because it is necessarily
required; it is a cause, as they say, which is indispensable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first step then towards healing, as we have
already said, is to be touched with grief, when we perceive that we have
provoked the wrath of God, and when thus our sins displease us. But he who is
thus become in himself a sinner, that is, who begins to be his own judge, ought
afterwards to add this second thing &#8212; to seek the face of God, that is, to
present himself a suppliant before God, and to ask for pardon; and this arises
from faith. It is then to repentance that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ahsim,</i> belongs, which is to &#8220;acknowledge sin:&#8221; and to
&#8220;seek the face of God,&#8221; properly belongs to faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now let us see what is the application of this
doctrine as to both people. When the Israelites and the Jews lived in exile, it
was of great benefit for them to have this testified, that God was hiding his
face for a time, that he might afford them time to repent; this is one thing.
Now when men considerately attend to this, that they are to seek God, that they
may repent, they are encouraged; and this is the sharpest goad to rouse men,
that they may no longer be torpid in their vices: and this is what the Prophet
meant. When the Lord shall banish into exile both the Jews and the Israelites,
let them not think that though for a time he will seem to cast them away they
are wholly deserted; for as yet a convenient time for repentance will be given
them. He afterwards describes the way of reconciliations that is, that they
shall </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acknowledge that they have
sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and then that they shall seek
the face of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And at the same time he makes known the fruit of
affliction, and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When
affliction shall be to them, then they will seek
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet here shows, that exile,
though very bitter to Israel, would yet be useful; as when a physician gives a
bitter draughts or is compelled to use strong medicine to cure an inveterate
disease; so the Prophet shows that this punishment would be useful to the
people, and even pleasant, however bitter it might be for a time. How so? For
they will return to the Lord; and he says distinctly, &#8220;They will seek
me&#8221;. He includes in this expression both faith and repentance; for he
separates not the two clauses as before, but shows generally that the end of
affliction would be, that the people would turn themselves to God. With respect
to the expression, &#8220;to seek early,&#8221; I have said already that I do
not approve of that meaning; for neither the Israelites nor the Jews, sought God
early, but were with difficulty at lasts after a long period, and a long series
of seventy years, led to repentance. What sort of seeking early was this? I do
not then approve of rendering the word, &#8216;They shall seek me early;&#8217;
but, as I have said the simple idea of &#8220;seeking&#8221; is more
suitable.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we continue

be pliant, and without delay attend to the scourges of thy hand, and not wait
for extreme severity, but timely repent; and that we may truly and from the
heart seek thee, let us not put on false repentance, but strive to devote
ourselves wholly to thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last chapter the Prophet said, that the
Israelites, after having been subdued by chastisements and judgments, would
again turn back from following error to seek God. But as terror drives men away
from approaching God, he now adds, that the measure of afflictions would not be
such as would discourage their minds and produce despair; but rather inspire
them with the assurance, that God would be propitious to them: and that he might
set this forth the better, he introduces them as saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come, let us go to the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and this mode of speaking is very
emphatical.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must know that the reason here given, why the
Israelites could return safely and with sure confidence to God, is, that they
would acknowledge it as his office to heal after he has smitten, and to bring a
remedy for the wounds which he has inflicted. The Prophet means by these words,
that God does not so punish men as to pour forth his wrath upon them for their
destruction; but that he intends, on the contrary, to promote their salvation,
when he is severe in punishing their sins. We must then remember, as we have
before observed, that the beginning of repentance is a sense of God&#8217;s
mercy; that is, when men are persuaded that God is ready to give pardon, they
then begin to gather courage to repent; otherwise perverseness will ever
increase in them; how much soever their sin may frighten them, they will yet
never return to the Lord. And for this purpose I have elsewhere quoted that
remarkable passage in Psalm 130, &#8216;With thee is mercy, that thou mayest be
feared;&#8217; for it cannot be, that men will obey God with true and sincere
heart, except a taste of his goodness allures them, and they can certainly
determine, that they shall not return to him in vain, but that he will be ready,
as we have said, to pardon them. This is the meaning of the words, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come, and let us turn to the
Lord; for he has torn and he will heal us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, God has not inflicted on us deadly wounds; but he has smitten, that
he might heal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, something more is expressed in the
Prophet&#8217;s words, and it is this, that God never so rigidly deals with men,
but that he ever leaves room for his grace. For by the word, <i>torn,</i> the
Prophet alludes to that heavy judgment of which he had before spoken in the
person of God: the Lord then made himself to be like a cruel wild beast,
&#8220;I will be as a lion, I will devour, I will tear, and no one shall take
away the prey which I have once seized.&#8221; God wished then to show that his
vengeance would be dreadful against the Israelites. Now, though God should deal
very sharply with them, they were not yet to despair of pardon. However, then,
we may find God to be for a time like a lion or a bear, yet, as his proper
office is to heal after he has torn, to bind the wounds he has inflicted, there
is no reason why we should shun his presence. We see that the design of the
Prophet&#8217;s words was to show, that no chastisement is so severe that it
ought to break down our spirits, but that we ought, by entertaining hope, to
stir up ourselves to repentance. This is the drift of the
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is further needful to observe, that the faithful
do here, in the first place, encourage themselves, that they may afterwards lead
others with them; for so the words mean. He does not say, &#8220;Go, return to
Jehovah;&#8221; but</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, Come, let us
return unto Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We then see that
each one begins with himself; and then that they mutually exhort one another;
and this is what ought to be done by us: when any one sends his brethren to God,
he does not consult his own good, since he ought rather to show the way. Let
every one, then, learn to stimulate himself; and then, let him stretch out his
hand to others, that they may follow. We are at the same time reminded that we
ought to undertake the care of our brethren; for it would be a shame for any one
to be content with his own salvation, and so to neglect his brethren. It is then
necessary to join together these two things, &#8212; To stir up ourselves to
repentance, &#8212; and then to try to lead others with us. Let us now proceed

resurrection. But these are frivolous notions. Not withstanding, this place is
usually referred to Christ, as declaring, that God would, after two days, and on
the third, raise up his Church; for Christ, we know, did not rise privately for
himself, but for his members, inasmuch as he is the first-fruits of them who
shall rise. This sense does not seem then unsuitable, that is, that the Prophet
here encourages the faithful to entertain hope of salvation, because God would
raise up his only-begotten Son, whose resurrection would be the common life of
the whole Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet this sense seems to me rather too refined. We
must always mind this, that we fly not in the air. Subtle speculations please at
first sight, but afterwards vanish. Let every one, then, who desires to make
proficiency in the Scriptures always keep to this rule &#8212; to gather from
the Prophets and apostles only what is solid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see what the Prophet meant. He here adds,
I doubt not, a second source of consolation, that is, that if God should not
immediately revive his people, there would be no reason for delay to cause
weariness, as it is wont to do; for we see that when God suffers us to languish
long, our spirits fail; and those who at first seem cheerful and courageous
enough, in process of time become faint. As, then, patience is a rare virtue,
Hosea here exhorts us patiently to bear delay, when the Lord does not
immediately revive us. Thus then did the Israelites say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After two days will God revive
us; on the third day he will raise us up to
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What did they understand by two days? Even their long
affliction; as though they said, &#8220;Though the Lord may not deliver us from
our miseries the first day, but defer longer our redemption, our hope ought not
yet to fail; for God can raise up dead bodies from their graves no less than
restore life in a moment.&#8221; When Daniel meant to show that the affliction
of the people would be long, he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;After a time,
times, and half time,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270725&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Daniel
7:25.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That mode of speaking is different, but then as to
sense it is the same. He says, &#8216;after a time,&#8217; that is, after a
year; that would be tolerable: but it follows, &#8216;and times,&#8217; that is,
many years: God afterwards shortens that period, and brings redemption at a time
when least expected. Hosea mentions here two years, because God would not
afflict his people for one day, but, as we have before seen, subdue them by
degrees; for the perverseness of the people had so prevailed, that they could
not be soon healed. As when diseases have been striking roots for a long time,
they cannot be immediately cured, but there is need of slow and various
remedies; and were a physician to attempt immediately to remove a disease which
had taken full possession of a man, he certainly would not cure him, but take
away his life: so also, when the Israelites, through their long obstinacy, had
become nearly incurable, it was necessary to lead them to repentance by slow
punishments. They therefore said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After two days God will revive
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and thus they confirmed themselves
in the hope of salvation, though it did not immediately appear: though they long
remained in darkness, and the exile was long which they had to endure, they yet
did not cease to hope: &#8220;Well, let the two days pass, and the Lord will
revive us.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that a consolation is here opposed to the
temptations, which take from us the hope of salvation, when God suspends his
favor longer than our flesh desires. Martha said to Christ, &#8216;He is now
putrid, it is the fourth day.&#8217; She thought it absurd to remove the stone
from the sepulchre, because now the body of Lazarus was putrified. But Christ in
this instance designed to show his own incredible power by restoring a putrid
body to life. So the faithful say here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will raise us up after
two days:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Though exile seems to be like
the sepulchre, where putridity awaits us, yet the Lord will, by his ineffable
power, overcome whatever may seem to obstruct our restoration.&#8221; We now
perceive, as I think, the simple and genuine sense of this
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But at the same time I do not deny but that God has
exhibited a remarkable and a memorable instance of what is here said in his
only-begotten Son. As often then as delay begets weariness in us, and when God
seems to have thrown aside every care of us, let us flee to Christ; for, as it
has been said, His resurrection is a mirror of our life; for we see in that how
God is wont to deal with his own people: the Father did not restore life to
Christ as soon as he was taken down from the cross; he was deposited in the
sepulchre, and he lay there to the third day. When God then intends that we
should languish for a time, let us know that we are thus represented in Christ
our head, and hence let us gather materials of confidence. We have then in
Christ an illustrious proof of this prophecy. But in the first place, let us lay
hold on what we have said, that the faithful here obtain hope for themselves,
though God extends not immediately his hand to them, but defers for a time his
grace of redemption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall live in his
sight,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or before him. Here again the faithful
strengthen themselves, for God would favor them with his paternal countenance,
after he had long turned his back on them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall live before his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For as long as God cares not for
us, a sure destruction awaits us; but as soon as he turns his eyes to us, he
inspires life by his look alone. Then the faithful promise this good to
themselves that God&#8217;s face will shine again after long darkness: hence
also they gather the hope of life, and at the same time withdraw themselves from
all those obstacles which obscure the light of life; for while we run and wander
here and there, we cannot lay hold on the life which God promises to us, as the
charms of this world are so many veils, which prevent our eyes to see the
paternal face of God. We must then remember that this sentence is added, that
the faithful, when it pleases God to turn his back on them, may not doubt but
that he will again look on them. Let us now go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the faithful pursue what we have before
considered, making the hope of salvation sure to themselves: nor is it a matter
of wonder that the Prophet dwells more fully on this subject; for we know how
prone we are to entertain doubt. There is nothing more difficult, especially
when God shows to us signs of his wrath, than to recover us, so that we may be
really persuaded that he is our physician, when he seems to visit us for our
sins. We must then, in this case, earnestly strive, for it cannot be done
without labour. Hence the faithful now say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall know, and we shall
pursue to know Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They show then by these
words that they distrust not, but that light would arise after darkness; for
this is the meaning of the words:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
they say; that is, &#8220;Though there is now on every side horrible darkness,
yet the Lord will manifest his goodness to us, even though it may not
immediately appear.&#8221; They therefore add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we shall pursue after the
knowledge of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We now perceive the
purport of the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us, that when God hides his
face, we act foolishly if we cherish our unbelief; for we ought, on the
contrary, as I have already said, to contend with this destructive disease,
inasmuch as Satan seeks nothing else but to sink us in despair. This his device
then ought to be understood by us, as Paul reminds us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:11;) and the Holy Spirit supplies us here with weapons, by which
we may repel this temptation of Satan, &#8220;What? Thou seest that God is angry
with thee; nor is it of any use to thee to attempt to come to him, for every
access is shut up.&#8221; This is what Satan suggests to us, when we are
sensible of our sins. What is to be done? The Prophet here propounds a remedy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> &#8220;Though now we are sunk in
thick darkness, though there never shines on us, no, not even a spark of light,
yet we shall know (as Isaiah says, &#8216;I will hope in the Lord, who hides his
face from Jacob&#8217;) that this is the true exercise of our faith, when we
lift up our eyes to the light which seems to be extinguished, and when in the
darkness of death we yet continue to promise to ourselves life, as we are here
taught: We shall then <i>know;</i> further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall pursue after the
knowledge of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> though God
withdraws his face, and, as it were designedly, doubles the darkness, and all
knowledge of his grace be, as it were, extinct, we shall yet<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pursue after this
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, no obstacle shall
keep us from striving, and our efforts will at length make their way to that
grace which seems to be wholly excluded from us.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some give this rendering,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall know, and shall pursue
on to know Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and explain the
passage thus, &#8212; that the Israelites had derived no such benefit from the
law of Moses, but that they still expected the fuller doctrine, which Christ
brought at his coming. They then think that this is a prophecy respecting that
doctrine, which is now by the Gospel set forth to us in its full brightness,
because God has manifested himself in his Son as in a living image. But this is
too refined an exposition; and it is enough for us to keep close to the design
of the Prophet. He indeed introduces the godly thus speaking for this reason
&#8212; because there was need of great and strong effort, that they might rise
up to the hope of salvation; for it was not to be the exile of one day, but of
seventy years. When therefore so heavy a trial awaited the godly, the Prophet
here wished to prepare them for the laborious warfare:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall then know, and follow on
to know Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, As the morning shall come
to us his going forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8212; a
similitude the most appropriate; for here the faithful call to mind the
continued succession of days and nights. No wonder that God bids us to hope for
his grace, the sight of which is yet hid from us; for except we had learnt by
long experience, who could hope for sudden light when the darkness of night
prevails? Should we not think that the earth is wholly deprived of light? But
seeing that the dawn suddenly shines, and puts an end to the darkness of night,
and dispels it, what wonder is it that the Lord should shine forth beyond our
expectation? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His going forth then
shall be like the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He here calls a new manifestation the going forth of
God, that is, when God shows that he regards his people with favor, when he
shows that he is mindful of the covenant which he made with Abraham; for as long
as the people were exiled from their country, God seemed not, as we have said,
to look on them any more; nay, the judgment of the flesh only suggested this,
that God was far distant from his people. He then calls it the going forth of
God, when God should show himself propitious to the captives, and should wholly
restore them; then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the going
forth of God shall come, and shall be like the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We now then see that he
confirms them by the order of nature, as Paul does, when he chides the unbelief
of those to whom a future resurrection seemed incredible, because it surpasses
the thoughts of the flesh; &#8220;O fool!&#8221; he says, &#8220;does thou not
see that what thou sowest first decays and then germinates? God now sets before
thee in a decaying seed an emblem of the future resurrection.&#8221; So also in
this place, since light daily rises to us, and the morning shines after the
darkness of night, what then will not the Lord effect by himself, who works so
powerfully by material things? When he will put forth his full power, what,
think we, will he do? Will he not much more surpass all the thoughts of our
flesh? We now then see why this similitude was added.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards describes to us the effect of this
manifestation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the rain to us, as the late
rain, a rain to the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
comparison shows, that as soon as God will deign to look on his people, his
countenance will be like the rain, which irrigates the earth. When the earth is
dry after long heat and long drought, it seems to be incapable of producing
fruit; but rain restores to it its moisture and vigor. Thus then the Prophet, in
the person of the faithful, does here strengthen the hope of a full restoration.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall come to us as the rain,
as the late rain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Hebrews call the late rain
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wqlm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melakush</i>, by which the corn was ripened. And it seems that the Prophet
meant the vernal rain by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>geshem,</i> But the sense is clearly this, that though the Israelites had
become so dry that they had no longer any vigor, there would yet be no less
virtue in God&#8217;s grace than in the rain, which fructifies the earth when it
seems to be barren. But when at the end he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a rain to the
earth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I doubt not but that he meant seasonable
rain, which is pleasant and acceptable to the earth, or which the earth really
wants; for a violent shower cannot be called properly a rain to the earth,
because it is destructive and hurtful. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some so expound this passage as that God would not
once irrigate his people, but would continue this favor; as though he said,
&#8220;He is deceived, who thinks that the redemption, which I bid you to hope
from me, will be momentary, for I will, by a continued progress, lead my people
to a full fruition of salvation.&#8221; But this sense is altogether foreign.
The Prophet then, no doubts introduces God here as speaking thus, &#8220;What
shall I do to you? because ye cannot receive my favor, so great is your
depravity.&#8221; The context seems indeed to be in this way broken off; but we
must remember this canon, that whenever the Prophets make known the grace of
God, they at the same time add an exception, lest hypocrites falsely apply to
themselves what is offered to the faithful alone. The Prophets, we know, never
threatened ruin to the people, but that they added some promise, lest the
faithful should despair, which must have been the case, except some mitigation
had been made known to them. Hence the Prophets do this in common, &#8212; they
moderate their threatening and severity by adding a hope of God&#8217;s favor.
But at the same time, as hypocrites ever draw to themselves what belongs only to
the faithful, and thus heedlessly deride God, the Prophets add another
exception, by which they signify, that God&#8217;s promise of being gracious and
merciful to his people is not to be deemed universal, and as appertaining to all
indiscriminately.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will more fully repeat this again: The Prophets had
to do with the whole people; they had to do with the few faithful, for there was
a small number of godly people among the Israelites as well as among the Jews.
When therefore the Prophets reproved the people, they addressed the whole body:
but at the same time, as there was some remnant seed, they mingled, as I have
said, consolations, and mingled them, that the elect of God might ever recumb on
his mercy, and thus patiently submit to his rod, and continue in his fear,
knowing that there is in him a sure salvation. Hence the promises which we see
inserted by the Prophets among threats and chidings, ought not to be referred in
common to all, or indiscriminately to the people, but only, as we have said, to
the faithful, who were then but few in number. This then is the reason why the
prophets shook off self-complacencies from the wicked despisers of God, when
they added, &#8220;Ye ought not to hope any salvation from the promise I set
forth to God&#8217;s children; for God throws not to dogs the bread which he has
destined for his children alone.&#8221; In the same strain we find another
Prophet speaking,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;To what end is the
day of the Lord to you? It is a day of darkness, and not of light, a day of
death, and not of life,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
5:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For as often as they heard of the covenant which God
made with Abraham, that it would not be void, they thus vaunted, &#8220;We are
now indeed severely treated, but in a little while God will rescue us from our
evils; for he is our Father, he has not in vain adopted us, he has not in vain
redeemed and chosen our race, we are his peculiar possession and
heritage.&#8221; Thus then the presumptuous flatter themselves; and this indeed
they seem to have in common with the faithful; for the faithful also, though in
the deepest abyss of death, yet behold the light of life; for by faith, as we
have said, they penetrate beyond this world. But at the same time they approach
God in real penitence, while the ungodly remain in their perverseness, and
vainly flatter themselves, thinking that whatever God promises belongs to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now then return to our Prophet. He had said,
&#8220;In their tribulation they will seek me:&#8221; he had afterwards, in the
words used by the people, explained how the faithful would turn themselves to
God, and what true repentance would bring with it. It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What shall I do to thee, Ephraim?
what shall I do to thee, Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>that is,
&#8220;What shall I do to all of you?&#8221; The people was now divided into two
kingdoms: the kingdom of Judah had its own name; the ten tribes had, as it has
been said, the common name of Israel. Then after the Prophet gave hope of pardon
to the children of God, he turns himself to the whole body of the people, which
was corrupt, and says, &#8220;What shall I do now to you, both Jews and
Israelites?&#8221; Now God, by these words, intimates that he had tried all
remedies, and found them useless: &#8220;What more then,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;shall I do to you? Ye are wholly incurable, ye are inexcusable, and
altogether past hope; for no means have been omitted by me, by which I could
promote your salvation; but I have lost all my labour; as I have effected
nothing by punishments and chastisements, as my favor also has had no account
among you, what now remains, but that I must wholly cast you
away?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how varied is the mode of speaking
adopted by the Prophets; for they had to do, not with one class of men, but with
the children of God, and also with the wicked, who continued obstinately in
their vices. Hence then it was, that they changed their language, and so
necessarily. Alike is the complaint we read in Isaiah chapter 1, except that
there mention is only made of punishments, &#8216;Why should I strike you more?
for I have hitherto effected nothing: from the sole of the foot to the top of
the head there is no soundness; and yet ye remain like yourselves.&#8217; In
chapter 5</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he speaks of God&#8217;s favors, &#8216;What
could have been done more to my vineyard than what I have done?&#8217; In these
two places the Prophet shows that the people were so lost, that they could not
be brought into a sane mind; for God had in various ways tried to heal them, and
their diseases remained incurable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to the words of Hosea,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What shall I do to thee, Ephraim?
What shall I do to thee Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> &#8220;I
indeed offer pardon to all, but ye still continue obstinately in your sins; nay,
my favor is by you scorned: I do not therefore now contend with you; but declare
to you that the door of salvation is closed.&#8221; Why? &#8220;Because I have
hitherto in various ways tried in vain to heal you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says that their goodness was like the
morning dew, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
goodness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says, is as the dew of the
morning.&#8221; Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesad,</i> for the kindness which God had exercised towards both the
Israelites and the Jews. Then it is, &#8220;Your kindness,&#8221; that is, the
mercy which I have hitherto exhibited to you,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is as the morning dew, as the
cloud which passes away early in the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, &#8220;Ye immediately
dry up my favor;&#8221; and this seems not unsuitable, for we see that the
unbelieving by their wickedness absorb the mercy of God, so that it produces no
good, as when rain flows over a rock or a stone, while the stone within, on
account of its hardness, remains dry. As then the moisture of rain does not
penetrate into stones, so also the grace of God is spent in vain and without
advantage on the unbelieving.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet speaks rather of their goodness, that
they made a show of feigned excellency, which vanished like the morning dew; for
as soon as the sun rises, it draws the dew upwards, so that it appears no more;
the clouds also pass away. The Prophet says that the Jews and the Israelites
were like the morning clouds and the dew, because there was in them no solid or
inward goodness, but it was only of an evanescent kind; they had, as they say,
only the appearance of goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet, that
God here complains that he had to do with hypocrites. Faith, we know, is
regarded by him; there is nothing that pleases God more than sincerity of heart.
We know further, that doctrine is spread in vain, except it be received in a
serious manner. Then, as hypocrites transform themselves in various ways, and
make a display of some guises of goodness, while they have nothing solid in
them, God complains that he loses all his labour: and he says at length that he
will no longer spend labour in vain on hypocritical men, who have nothing but
falsehood and dissimulation; and this is what he means, when he intimates that

<div><font face="Palatino">God shows here, by his Prophet, that he was
constrained by urgent necessity to deal sharply and roughly with the people.
Nothing, we know, is more pleasing to God than to treat us kindly; for there is
not found a father in the world who cherishes his children as tenderly: but we,
being perverse, suffer him not to follow the inclination of his nature. He is
therefore constrained to put on, as it were, a new characters and to chide us
severely, according to the way in which he here says, he had treated the
Israelites; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have cut them, he
says, by my prophets, and killed them by the words of my
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the words otherwise, as though God had
killed the Prophets, meaning thereby the impostors, who corrupted the pure
worship of God by their errors. But this view seems not to me in any way
suitable; and we know that it was a common mode of speaking among the Hebrews,
to express the same thing in two ways. So the Prophet speaks here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
cut</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or hewed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them by my Prophets, I have
killed them by the cords of my mouth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the
second clause he repeats, I doubt note what we have already briefly explained,
namely, that God had cut or hewed them by his Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must see for what purpose God declares here
that he had commanded his Prophets to treat the people roughly. Hypocrites we
indeed know, however much in various ways they mock God, are yet tender, and
cannot bear any rebuke. Their sine are gross, except when they disguise
themselves; but at the same time, when God begins to reprove, they expostulate
and say, &#8220;What does this mean? God everywhere declares that he is kind and
merciful; but he fulminates now against us: this seems not consistent with his
nature.&#8221; Thus then hypocrites would have God to be their batterer. He now
answers, that he had been constrained, not only for a just cause, but also
necessarily, to kill them, and to make his word by the Prophets like a hammer or
an ax. This is the reason, he says, why my Prophets have not endeavored mildly
and gently to allure the people. For God kindly and sweetly draws or invites to
himself those whom he sees to be teachable; but when he sees so great a
perverseness in men, that he cannot bend them by his goodness, he then begins,
as we have said, to put on a new character. We now then under stand God&#8217;s
design: that hypocrites might not complain that they had been otherwise treated
than what is consistent with God&#8217;s nature, the Prophet here answers in
God&#8217;s name, &#8220;Ye have forced me to this severity; for there was need
of a hard wedge, as they say, for a hard knot:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have</i></font><font face="Palatino"> therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hewed you by my Prophets, I have
hewed you by the words of my mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that
is, I have used my word as an ax: for ye were like knotty and tough wood; it was
therefore necessary that my word should be to you like an ax: and I have killed
you by the words of my mouth; that is my word has not been sweet food to you, as
it is wont to be to meek men; but it has been like a two-edged sword; it was
therefore necessary to slay you, as ye would not bear me to be a Father to
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy judgments are light that goes
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some understand by
&#8220;judgments&#8221; prosperity as if God were here reproaching the
Israelites, that it was not his fault that he did not win them: &#8220;I have
not neglected to treat you kindly, and under my protection to defend you; but ye
are ungrateful.&#8221; But this is a strained exposition. The greater part of
interpreters explain the passage thus, &#8220;That thy judgments might be a
light going forth.&#8221; But I do not see why we should change any thing in the
Prophet&#8217;s words. God then simply intimates here, that he had made known to
the Israelites the rule of a religious and holy life, so that they could not
pretend ignorance; for the Hebrews often understand &#8220;judgments&#8221; in
the sense of rectitude. I refer this to the instruction given them:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then, that is, the way of living
religiously, was like light; which means this, &#8220;I have so warned you, that
you have sinned knowingly and willfully. Hence, that you have been so
disobedient to me, must be imputed to your perverseness; for when ye were
pliant, I certainly did not conceal from you what was right: for as the sun
daily shines on the earth, so my teaching, has been to you as the light, to show
to you the way of salvation; but it has been with no profit.&#8221; We now then
understand what the Prophet meant by these words. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">God in this place declares that he desires mercy, and
not sacrifices; and he does so to prevent an objections and to anticipate all
frivolous pretenses. There is never wanting to hypocrites, we well know, a cover
for themselves; and so great is their assurance, that they hesitate not
sometimes to contend with God. It is indeed their common practice to maintain
that they worship God, provided they offer sacrifices to him, provided they toil
in ceremonies, and accumulate many rites. They think then that God is made bound
to them, and that they have fully performed their duty. This evil has been
common in all ages. The Prophet therefore anticipates this evasion, and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mercy I desire, and not
sacrifice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said, &#8220;I
know what you are ready to allege, and that you will say, that you offer
sacrifices to me, that you perform all the ceremonies; but this excuse is deemed
by me frivolous and of no moment.&#8221; Why? &#8220;Because I desire not
sacrifices, but mercy and faith.&#8221; We now understand the main object of
this verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a remarkable passage; the Son of God has twice
quoted it. The Pharisees reproached him for his intercourse with men of bad and
abandoned life, and he said to them in Matthew &#8216;Mercy I desire, and not
sacrifice:&#8217; he shows, by this defense, that God is not worshipped by
external ceremonies, but when men forgive and bear with one another, and are not
above measure rigid. Again, in the Matthew 12, when the Pharisees blamed the
disciples for gathering ears of corn, he said &#8216;But rather go and learn
what this is, Mercy I desire, and not sacrifice.&#8217; Inasmuch as they were so
severe against his disciples, Christ shows that those who make holiness to
consist in ceremonies are foolish worshipers of God; and that they also blamed
their brethren without a cause, and made a crime of what was not in itself
sinful, and what could be easily defended by any wise and calm
expounder.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that we may more fully understand this sentence
of the Prophet, it must be observed, firsts that the outward worship of God, and
all legal ceremonies, are included under the name of sacrifice and
burnt-offerings. These words then comprise a part for the whole. The same may be
said of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesad</i>, which means, mercy or kindness; for the Prophet here, no doubt,
sets faith or piety towards God, and love towards neighbors, in opposition to
all external ceremonies. &#8220;I desire,&#8221; he says, &#8220;mercy;&#8221;
or, &#8220;mercy pleases me more than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God
pleases me more than burnt-offerings.&#8221; The knowledge of God here is
doubtless to be taken for faith or piety, because hypocrites suppose that God is
rightly worshipped when they use many ceremonies. The Prophet derides all such
pomp and empty show, and says, that the worshipping of God is far different; it
being only done when he is known. The chief point is, that God desires to be
worshipped otherwise than sensual men dream; for they only display their rites,
and neglect the spiritual worship of God, which stands in faith and
love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These two clauses ought then to be read conjointly
&#8212; that kindness pleases God &#8212; and that faith pleases God. Faith by
itself cannot please God, since it cannot even exist without love to our
neighbor; and then, human kindness is not sufficient; for were any one to
abstain from doing any injury, and from hurting his brethren in any thing, he
might be still a profane man, and a despiser of God; and certainly his kindness
would be then of no avail to him. We hence see that these two sentences cannot
be separated, and that what the Prophet says is equally the same as if he had
connected piety with love. The meaning is, that God values faith and kindness
much more than sacrifices and all ceremonies. But when the Prophet says that
sacrifice does not please God, he speaks, no doubt, comparatively; for God does
not positively repudiate sacrifices enjoined in his own law; but he prefers
faith and love to them; as we more clearly learn from the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem</i>, when he says,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twlw[m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
meoulut</i>, than burnt-offerings.&#8221; It then appears that God is not
inconsistent with himself, as though he rejected sacrifices which he himself had
appointed; but that he condemns the preposterous abuse of them, in which
hypocrites gloried.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here two things are to be noticed: God requires
not external ceremonies, as if they availed any thing of themselves, but for a
different end. Faith of itself pleases God, as also does love; for they are, as
they say, of the class of good works: but sacrifices are to be regarded
differently; for to kill an ox, or a calf, or a lamb, what is it but to do what
the butcher does in his shambles? God then cannot be delighted with the
slaughter of beasts; hence sacrifices, as we have said, are of themselves of no
account. Faith and love are different. Hence the Lord says, in Jeremiah
7,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Have I commanded
your fathers, when I brought them out of Egypt, to offer sacrifices to
me?&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">no such thing; &#8216;I never commanded them,&#8217;
he says, &#8216;but only to hear my voice.&#8217; But what does the law in great
measure contain except commands about ceremonies? The answer to this is easy,
and that is, that sacrifices never pleased God through their own or intrinsic
value, as if they had any worth in them. What then? Even this, that faith and
piety are approved, and have ever been the legitimate spiritual worship of God.
This is one thing. It is further to be noticed, that when the Prophets reprove
hypocrites, they regard what is suitable to them, and do not specifically
explain the matters which they handle. Isaiah says in one place, &#8216;He who
kills an ox does the same as if he had killed a dog,&#8217; and a dog was the
highest abomination;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;nay, they who
offer sacrifices do the same</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">as if
they had killed men,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
66:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What! to compare sacrifices with murders! This seems
very strange; but the Prophet directed his discourse to the ungodly, who then
abused the whole outward worship prescribed by the law: no wonder then that he
thus spake of sacrifices. In the same manner also ought many other passages to
be explained, which frequently occur in the Prophets. We now then see that God
does not simply reject sacrifices, as far as he has enjoined them, but only
condemns the abuse of them. And hence what I have already said ought to be
remembered, that the Prophet here sets external rites in opposition to piety and
faith, because hypocrites tear asunder things which are, as it were,
inseparable: it is an impious divorce, when any one only obtrudes ceremonies on
God, while he himself is void of piety. But as this disease commonly prevails
among men, the Prophet adds a contrast between this fictitious worship and true
religion. It is also worthy of being observed, that he calls faith the knowledge
of God. We then see that faith is not some cold and empty imagination, but that
it extends much farther; for it is then that we have faith, when the will of God
is made known to us, and we embrace it, so that we worship him as our Father.
Hence the knowledge of God is required as necessary to faith. The Papists then
talk very childishly about implicit faith: when a man understands nothing, and
has not even the least acquaintance with God, they yet say that he is endued
with implicit faith. This is a romance more than foolish; for where there is no
knowledge of God, there is no religion, piety is extinct and faith is destroyed,
as it appears evident from this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then subjoins a complaint, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they like men have
transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here God shows that the Israelites boasted
in vain of their sacrifices and of all the pomps of their external worship, for
God did not regard these external things, but only wished to exercise the
faithful in spiritual worship. Then the import of the whole is this, &#8220;My
design was, when I appointed the sacrifices and the whole legal worship, to lead
you so to myself, that there might be nothing carnal or earthly in your
sacrificing; but ye have corrupted the whole law; you have been perverse
interpreters; for sacrifices have been nothing else among you but mockery as if
it were a satisfaction to me to have an ox or a ram killed. You have then
transgressed my covenant; and it is nothing that the people say to me, that they
have diligently performed the outward ceremonies, for such a worship is not in
the least valued by me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he proceeds still farther and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There have they dealt
treacherously against me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had said before,
&#8216;They have transgressed the covenant;&#8217; as though he said, &#8220;If
they wished to keep my covenant, this was the first thing, &#8212; to worship me
spiritually, even in faith and love; but they, having despised true worship,
laid hold only on what was frivolous: they have therefore violated my
covenant.&#8221; But now he adds, that &#8220;there&#8221; appeared their
perfidy; yea, that they were convicted of violating their faith, and shown to be
covenant-breakers, by this, &#8212; that they abused the sacred marks by which
God had sanctioned his covenant, to cover their own perfidy. There is then great
importance in the adverb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shim</i>, as if he had said, &#8220;In <i>that</i> particular you have acted
perfidiously:&#8221; for the Prophet means, that when hypocrites especially
raise their crests, they are convicted of falsehood and perjury. But how?
Because they set forth their own ceremonies, as we see them introduced as
speaking thus in Isaiah 58, &#8216;Wherefore have we fasted, and thou hast not
regarded?&#8217; In this passage they accuse God of too much rigor, because they
lost all their toil when they worshipped so laboriously, &#8220;We have then in
vain spent labour and so diligently worshipped him.&#8221; God answers:
&#8216;Who has required this at your hands?&#8217; So also in this place the
Prophet says, and more sharply,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There have they dealt
treacherously against me</i></font><font face="Palatino">: that is, &#8220;They
think that my mouth would be stopped by this defense only, when they brought
forward their sacrifices, and, after their manner, made a great display, as if
they were the best observers of religion; but I will show that in this very
thing they are covenant-breakers.&#8221; How? &#8220;Because there is no
falsehood worse than to turn the truth of God into a lie, and to adulterate his
pure doctrine.&#8221; And this is what all hypocrites do, when they thus turn
sacraments into gross abuses and false worship, when they build temples, when
they imagine that God is rightly worshipped whenever an ox or a ram is offered.
Since then hypocrites so grossly mock God and turn away sacrifices from Christ,
they turn away from the doctrine of repentance and faith; in a word, they regard
God only as a dead idol. When then they thus deprave the whole worship of God
and adulterate it, when they so impiously corrupt the word of God and pervert
his institutions, are they not covenant-breakers?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There then they perfidiously
acted against me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This ought to be carefully
observed, because it has not been noticed by interpreters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some thus render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;da</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>adam</i>, &#8212; &#8220;As the covenant of man have they transgressed
it,&#8221; transferring it to the genitive case, &#8220;And they have
transgressed the covenants as if it was that of man;&#8221; that is, as if they
had to do with a mortal man, so have they despised and violated my holy
covenant; and this exposition is not very unsuitable, except that it somewhat
changes the construction; for in this case the Prophet ought to have said,
&#8220;They have transgressed the covenant as that of a man;&#8221; but he says,
&#8216;They as a man,&#8217; etc. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
this rendering is far from being that of the words as they are, &#8216;They as
men have transgressed the covenant.&#8217; I therefore interpret the words more
simply, as meaning, that they showed themselves to be men in violating the
covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And there is here an implied contrast or comparison
between God and the Israelites; as though he said, &#8220;I have in good faith
made a covenant with them, when I instituted a fixed worship; but they have been
men towards me; there has been in them nothing but levity and
inconstancy.&#8221; God then shows that there had not been a mutual concord
between him and the Israelites, as men never respond to God; for he sincerely
calls them to himself, but they act unfaithfully, or when they have given some
proof of obedience, they soon turn back again, or despise and openly reject the
offered instruction. We then see in what sense the Prophet says that they had
transgressed the covenant of God as men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others explain the words thus, &#8220;They have
transgressed as Adam the covenant.&#8221; But the word, Adam, we know, is taken
indefinitely for men. This exposition is frigid and diluted, &#8220;They have
transgressed as Adam the covenant;&#8221; that is, they have followed or
imitated the example of their father Adam, who had immediately at the beginning
transgressed God&#8217;s commandment. I do not stop to refute this comment; for
we see that it is in itself vapid. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I shall first speak of the subject, and then
something shall be added in its place of the words. The Prophet here notices, no
doubt, something special against Gilead, which through the imperfection of
history is now to us obscure. But in the first place, we must remember, that
Gilead was one of the cities of refuge; and the Levites possessed these cities,
which were destined for fugitives. If any one killed a man by chance, that the
relatives might not take revenge, the Lord provided that he should flee to one
of these cities appointed for his safety. He was there safe among the Levites:
and the Levites received him under their protection, the matter being previously
tried; for a legal hearing of the cause must have preceded as to whether he who
had killed a man was innocent. We must then first remember that this city was
occupied by the Levites and the priests; and they ought to have been examples to
all others; for as Christ calls his disciples the light of the world, so the
Lord had chosen the priests for this purpose, that they might carry a torch
before all the people. Since then the highest sanctity ought to have shone forth
in the priests, it was quite monstrous that they were like robbers, and that the
holy city, which was as it were the sanctuary of God, became a den of
thieves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was then for this reason that the Prophet
especially inveighs against the city Gilead, and says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gilead is a city of the workers
of iniquity, and is covered with blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
But if Gilead was so corrupt, what must have been the case with the other
cities? It is then the same as if the Prophet had said, &#8220;Where shall I
begin? If I reprove the people indiscriminately, the priests will then think
that they are spared, because they are innocent; yea, that they are wholly
without blame: nay,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the priests are the most abandoned,
they are even the ringleaders of robbers. Since then so great corruptions
prevail among the order of priests, in whom the highest sanctity ought to have
shone forth, how great must be the licentiousness of the people in all kinds of
wickedness? And then what must be said of other cities, since Gilead is so bad,
which God has consecrated for a peculiar purpose, that it might be a sort of
sanctuary? Since then Gilead is a den of robbers, what must be the other

hbwq[</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>okube, medan</i>; some say,
&#8220;deceptive in blood,&#8221; because they did not openly kill men, but by
lying in wait for them; and hence they elicit this sense. But I approve more of
what they hold who say, that the city was &#8220;full of blood;&#8221; not that
such is the strict sense of the Hebrew word; but we may properly render it,
&#8220;occupied by blood.&#8221; Why so? Because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bq[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>okob</i>, as I have said, means sometimes to hold, to stay, and to hinder. We
may then properly and fitly say, that Gilead was &#8220;occupied&#8221; or
&#8220;possessed by blood.&#8221; But here follows a clearer and a fuller
explanation of this sentence &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues more at large what he had briefly
touched; for he does, not now confine himself to the common people, but directs
his accusation against the sacerdotal order. &#8220;See,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;the priests conspire among themselves like robbers, that they may slay
wretched men, who may meet them in the way.&#8221; It is indeed certain that the
Prophet speaks not here of open murders; for it is not credible that the priests
had proceeded into so great a licentiousness, that Gilead had become a
slaughter-house. But the Prophets, we know, are thus wont to speak, whenever
they upbraid men with being sanguinary and cruel; they compare them to robbers,
and that justly. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The faction of the priests kill
men in the way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as if they were robbers
conspiring together. And then he shows that the priests were so void of every
thing like the fear of God, that they perpetrated every kind of cruelty as if
they were wholly given to robberies. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word

<div><font face="Palatino">Now in the last clause of the verse it is made
evident why the Prophet had said that the priests were like robbers,
&#8216;because,&#8217; he says, &#8216;they do the thought,&#8217; or
&#8216;wickedness.&#8217; The verb to

were not open robbers, and publicly infamous in the sight of men, but that they
were robbers before God, because the city was full of wicked devices, which were
there concocted; and since they executed their schemes, it is justly said of
them by the Prophet, that they imitated the licentiousness of robbers. Let us

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God declares that he is the fit judge to take
cognizance of the vices of Israel; and this he does, that he might cut off the
handle of vain excuses, which hypocrites often adduce when they are reproved.
Who indeed can at this day persuade the Papists that all their worship is a
filthy abomination, a mere profanation? We see how furiously they rise up as
soon as any one by a whisper dares to touch their superstitions. Whence this?
Because they wish their own will to stand for reason. Why? Good intention, they
say, is the judge; as if this good intention were, forsooth, the queen, who
ought to rule in heaven and earth, and God were now excluded from all his
rights. This fury and this madness, even at this day, possess the Papists; and
no wonder, for Satan dementates men, when he leads them to corrupt and
degenerated forms of worship, and all hypocrites have been thus inebriated from
the beginning. This then is the reason why the Prophet now says in the person of
God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
seen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or do see,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>infamy in the kingdom of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God does here by one word lay prostrate
whatever men may set up for themselves, and shows that there remains no more
defense for what he declares he does not approve, however much men may value and
applaud it. &#8220;What! you think this to be my worship; and in your
imagination, this is most holy religion, this is the way of salvation, this is
extraordinary sanctity; but I on the contrary declare, that it is profanation,
that it is turpitude, that it is infamy. Go now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;pass
elsewhere your fopperies, with me they are of no value.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the meaning of the Prophet, when he
says<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the house of
Israel have I seen infamy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and by the
house of Israel the Prophet means the whole kingdom of the ten tribes. How so?
&#8220;Because there is the fornication of Ephraim&#8221;; that is, there
idolatry reigns, which Jeroboam introduced, and which the other kings of Israel
followed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we see that the Prophet spared neither the king,
nor his counselors, nor the princes of the kingdom; and he did not spare before
the priests. And this magnanimity becomes all God&#8217;s servants, so that they
cast down every height that rises up against the word of the Lord; as it was
said to Ezekiel, </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Chide mountains and
reprove hills,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;260602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
6:2, 36:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">An example of this the Prophet sets before us, when
he compares priests to robbers, and then compares royal temples to a brothel.
Jeroboam had built a temple in which he thought that God would be in the best
manner worshipped; but this, says the Prophet, is a brothel, this is filthy
fornication.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah also has set a plantation
for thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> That I may finish the chapter,
I will briefly notice this verse. Interpreters render it thus, &#8220;Also
Judah, thou hast set for thyself an harvest:&#8221; but the verb, as it is
evident, is in the third person; it cannot then be rendered otherwise than,
&#8216;Also Judah has set.&#8217; They who render it in the second person,
&#8220;Thou hast set for thyself an harvest,&#8221; elicit this sense,
&#8220;Thou also Judah, whom I have chosen for myself, hast set for thyself an
harvest, that is, thou hast prepared a miserable harvest for thyself; for thou
sowest ungodliness, whose fruit thou shalt hereafter gather:&#8221; but this is
strained. Now since the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryxq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kotsir,</i> signifies in Hebrew not only &#8220;harvest,&#8221; but also
&#8220;a plant,&#8221; it may properly be so taken in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Also Judah, while I was returning
the captivity of my people, did set for himself a
plant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, he propagated his own
impieties. God indeed addresses here the Israelites, and complains of Judah; for
the Jews, we know, were retained by the Lord, when the ten tribes separated.
This defection of the ten tribes did not cause religion to fail wholly among the
whole people. There remained the pure worship of God, at least as to the outward
form, at Jerusalem. The Lord then complains not here of Judah without a cause.
He had said before, &#8216;Judah shall be saved by his God;&#8217; but now he
says, &#8216;Judah also has set for himself a plant;&#8217; that is,
&#8220;superstitions have been long and widely enough springing up among all
Israel, they have spread through all the corners of the land: and now Judah
also,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is planting his own shoots, for he draws the
Israelites to himself;&#8221; there is therefore a new propagation, and this is
done, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While I am returning the
captivity of my people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
&#8220;while I am seeking to restore the scattering of my
people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, God shows here that there was no part any
longer whole. When one undertakes the cure of a diseased body, and when he sees
at least some parts whole, he has some hope of applying a remedy; but when not
even a finger remains sound, what can the physician do? So also the Lord says in
this place, &#8220;There was at least some hope of Judah, for some form of my
worship remained there, and the purer teaching of the law continued; out now
Judah propagates superstitions for Israel; observing that the whole land of
Israel is full of superstitions, he takes from thence shoots and slips, and
corrupts the remaining portion of the land, which has hitherto remained sacred
to me.&#8221; We now perceive, as I think, the genuine meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>

a sincere heart, and never turn aside after the corruptions of the world, nor
think that we can deceive thee; but may we so devote our souls and bodies to
thee, that our life may in every part of it testify, that we are a pure and holy

<div><font face="Palatino">God, that he might show how corrupt was the state of
all the people of Israel, compares himself here to a physician, who, while he
wishes to try remedies, acknowledges that there are hid more grievous diseases;
which is often the case. When a sick person sends for a physician, his disease
will be soon discovered; but it may be that he has for many years labored under
other hidden complaints, which do not immediately come to the knowledge of the
physician. He may indeed think that the symptoms of the disease are those which
proceed from a source more hidden; but on the third or fourth days after having
tried some remedies he then knows that there is some hidden malady. God then
says, that by applying remedies he had found out how corrupt Israel was,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While I was healing my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then I knew what was the iniquity
of Samaria and of all Ephraim.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By Samaria he means the principal part of the
kingdom; for that city, as it is well known, was the capital and the chief seat
of government. The Prophet therefore says, that the iniquities of Samaria were
then discovered to be, not common, but inveterate diseases. This is the meaning.
We now see what God had in view; for the people might deceive themselves, as it
often happens, and say, &#8220;We are not indeed wholly free from every vice;
but God ought not however to punish us so severely, for what nation is there
under the sun which does not labour under the common diseases?&#8221; But the
Prophet here answers, that the people of Israel were so corrupt, that light
remedies would not do for them. God then here undertakes the office of a
physician, and says, &#8220;I have hitherto wished to heal Israel, and this was
my design, when I hewed them by my Prophets, and employed my word as a sword;
and afterwards when I added chastisements; but now I have found that their
wickedness is greater than can be corrected by such remedies.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The iniquity of Ephraim then has
been discovered, he says, and then I perceived the vices of
Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this place teaches, that though the vices of men
do not immediately appear, yet they who deceive themselves, and disguise
themselves to others, gain nothing, nor are they made free before God, and their
fault is not lessened, nor are they absolved from guilt; for at last their
hidden vices will come to light: and this especially happens, when the Lord
performs the office of a physician towards them; for we see that men then cast
out their bitterness, when the Lord seeks to heal their corruptions. Under the
papacy, even those who are the worst conceal their own vices. How so? Because
God does not try them; there is no teaching that cauterizes or that draws blood.
As then the Papists rest quietly in their own dregs, their perverseness does not
appear. But in other places, where God puts forth the power of his word, and
where he speaks effectually by his servants, there men show what great impiety
was before hid in them; for in full rage they rise up against God, and they
cannot bear any admonition. As soon then as God begins to do the office of a
physician, men then discover their diseases. And this is the reason why the
world so much shun the light of heavenly doctrine; for he who does evil hates
the light,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:20.) We may also observe the same as to chastisements. When God indulges the
wicked, they then with the mouth at least bless him; but when he begins to
punish their sins they clamour against him and are angry, and at length show how
much fury was before hid in their hearts. We now see what the Prophet here lays
to the charge of the people of Israel. It may also be observed at this day
through the whole world, that the curing of diseases discovers evils which were
before unknown.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we have said, and this ought to be borne in mind,
that Ephraim is here expressly named by the Prophet, and also the city, Samaria,
because he wished to intimate that their diseases were inveterate, existing not
only in the extreme members, but deeply fixed in the head and bowels, and
occupying the vital parts. It then
follows,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Because they have acted
mendaciously</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, done falsely. The
Prophet signifies by this expression, that there was nothing sound in the whole
people, because they were addicted to their own depravities. By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rq&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shikor</i>, he means every kind of falseness, that is, that men were
thoroughly imbued with depraved lusts, and that there was now remaining in them
nothing sound or whole. This then is the main point, that the wickedness of the
people was discovered, and that it could not be cured by moderate severity,
because it had penetrated into the very bowels and spread over the whole
body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows interpreters are wont to regard as the
punishment which God had already inflicted. The Prophet says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The thief has entered in, and the
robber has plundered without.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They therefore
think that this is to be referred to the manner in which God had already begun
by punishment to recall the people to a sound mind; as though he said,
&#8220;You have been pillaged by thieves as well as harassed by robbers.&#8221;
But I rather think that the Prophet here pursues the same subject, and shows
that the people were inwardly and outwardly so infected with vices, that there
was now no whole part; and that by mentioning a part for the whole, he here
designates every kind of evil, for he specifies two kinds which may stand for
all things in general. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The thief has entered
in</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, stealthily, and does
mischief insidiously, or even openly like robbers, who use open violence; which
means, that impiety so prevailed, either by frauds or by open war, that they
were in every way corrupt. But when he says, that the thief had entered in, he
means, that many of the people were like foxes, who craftily do mischief; and
when he says, that the robber had plundered abroad, he means that others, like
lions, seized openly and without shame on what belonged to others, and thus by
open force stripped and plundered the miserable and the poor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the meaning of the Prophet. Having
said that the Israelites and the citizens of Samaria had conducted themselves so
deceitfully, he now, by specifying two things, shows how they had departed from
all uprightness, and prostituted themselves to every kind of wickedness; because
where violence reigned, there also frauds and all kinds of evil reigned. The
thief then had entered in, and the robber plundered abroad; that is, they
secretly circumvented their neighbors, and also went forth like robbers openly
and without any shame. It then follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here that the Israelites had
advanced to the highest summit of all wickedness; for they thought that no
account was ever to be given by them to God. Hence arises the contempt of God;
that is, when men imagine that he is, as it were, sleeping in heaven, and that
he rests from every work. They dare not indeed to deny God, and yet they take
from him what especially belongs to his divinity, for they exclude him from the
office of being a judge. Hence then it is that men allow themselves so much
liberty, because they imagine that they have made a truce with God; yea, they
think that they can do any thing with impurity, as if they had made a covenant
with death and hell, as Isaiah says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now their wicked deeds have
surrounded them, for they are in my sight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, &#8220;Though they promise impunity to themselves, and flatter
themselves in their hypocrisy, all their works are yet before me; and thus they
surround them;&#8221; that is, &#8220;They shall at last perceive that they are
infolded in their own sins, and that no escape will be open to them.&#8221; We
now understand the object of the Prophet; for after having complained of the
stupidity of the people, he now says that they thus flattered themselves with no
advantage, because God is not in the meantime blind. Though then they think that
a veil is drawn over their sins, they are yet mistaken; for all their sins are
in my sight, and this they themselves shall at last find out by experience,
because their sins will surround or besiege them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this place, that nothing ought to
be more feared than that Satan should so fascinate us as to make us to think
that God rests idly in heaven. There is nothing that can stir us up more to
repentance, than when we adorn God with his own power, and be persuaded that he
is the judge of the world, and also when we walk as in his sight, and know that
our sins cannot come to oblivion, except when he buries them by pardon. This
then is what the Prophet teaches in the first part of the verse. Now when we
imagine that we have peace with God, and with death and hell, as Isaiah says in
the place we have quoted, the prophet teaches that God is yet awake, and that
his office cannot be taken from him, for he knows whatever is carried on in this
world; and that this will at length be made openly known, when our sins shall
surround us, as it is also said in Genesis chapter 4, &#8216;Sin will lie down
at thy door.&#8217; For we may for a time imagine that we have many escapes or
at least hiding-places; but God will at length show that all this is in vain,
for he will come upon us, and has no need of forces, procured from this or that
quarter; we shall have enemies enough in our own vices, for we shall be besieged
by them no otherwise than if God were to arm the whole world against us. Let us
go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now arraigns all the citizens of Samaria,
and in their persons the whole people, because they rendered obedience to the
king by flattery, and to the princes in wicked things, respecting which their
own conscience convicted them. He had already in the fifth chapter mentioned the
defection of the people in this respect, that they had obeyed the royal edict.
It might indeed have appeared a matter worthy of praise, that the people had
quietly embraced what the king commanded. This is the case with many at this
day, who bring forward a pretext of this kind. Under the papacy they dare not
withdraw themselves from their impious superstitions, and they adduce this
excuse, that they ought to obey their princes. But, as I have already said, the
Prophet has before condemned this sort of obedience, and now he shows that the
defection which then reigned through all Israel, ought not to be ascribed to the
king or to few men, but that it was a common evil, which involved all in one and
the same guilt, without exception. How so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By their
wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have exhilarated the king,
and by their lies the princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
If they wish to cast the blame on their governors, it will be done in vain; for
whence came then such a promptitude? As soon as Jeroboam formed the calves, as
soon as he built temples, religion instantly collapsed, and whatever was before
pure, degenerated; how was the change so sudden? Even because the people had
inwardly concocted their wickedness, which, when an occasion was offered, showed
itself; for hypocrisy did lie hid in all, and was then discovered. We now
perceive what the Prophet had in view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this place ought to be carefully noticed: for it
often happens that some vice creeps in, which proceeds from one man or from a
few; but when all readily embrace what a few introduce, it is quite evident that
they have no living root of piety or of the fear of God. They then who are so
prone to adopt vices were before hypocrites; and we daily find this to be the
case. When pious men have the government of a city, and act prudently, then the
whole people will give some hope that they will fear the Lord; and when any
king, influenced by a desire of advancing the glory of God, endeavors to
preserve all his subjects in the pure worship of God, then the same feeling of
piety will be seen in all: but when an ungodly king succeeds him, the greater
part will immediately fall back again; and when a magistrate neglects his duty,
the greater portion of the people will break out into open impiety. I wish there
were no proofs of these things; but throughout the world the Lord has designed
that there should exist examples of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This purpose of God ought therefore to be noticed;
for he accuses the people of having made themselves too obsequious and pliant.
When king Jeroboam set up vicious worship, the people immediately offered
themselves as ready to obey: hence impiety became quite open.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delighted the king by their
wickedness, and the princes by their lies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>as though he said, &#8220;They cannot transfer the blame to the king and
princes. Why? Because they delighted them by their wickedness; that is, they
haltered the king by their wickedness and delighted the princes by their
lies.&#8221; It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues the same subject in this verse:
he says that they were all adulterers. This similitude has already been often
explained. He speaks not here of common fornication, but calls them adulterers,
because they had violated their faith pledged to God, because they gave
themselves up to filthy superstitions, and also, because they had wholly
corrupted themselves, for faith and sincerity of heart constitute spiritual
chastity before God. When men become corrupt in their whole life, and degenerate
from the pure worship of God, they are justly deemed adulterers. In this sense
does the Prophet now say, that they were all adulterers, and thus he confirms
what I have said before, that as to the corruptions which then prevailed, it was
not few men who had been drawn into them, but that the whole people were
implicated in guilt; for they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
adulterers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> To say that they had been
deceived by the king, that they had been forced by authority, that they had been
compelled by the tyranny of their princes, would have been vain and frivolous,
for <i>all</i> of them were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adulterers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards compares them to a furnace or an oven,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
are</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a furnace or an oven, heated
by the baker, who ceases from stirring up until the meal kneaded is well
fermented</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet by this
similitude shows more clearly, that the people were not corrupted by some
outward impulse, but by their own inclination and propensity of mind; yea, by a
mad and furious desire of acting wickedly. He had previously said that they had
willfully sinned, when they readily embraced the edict of the king; but now he
goes still farther and says that they had been set on fire by an inward sinful
instinct, and were like a hot oven. Then he adds that this had not been a sudden
impulse, as it sometimes happens; but that it had so continued, that they were
confirmed in their wickedness. When he says, that adulterers are like a burning
oven, he means, that their defection had not only been voluntary, so that the
blame was in themselves; but that they had also ardently seized on the occasion
of sinning, and had been heated, as an hot oven. The ungodly often restrain
their desires, and suppress them when no occasion is presented, but give vent to
them when they have the opportunity of sinning with impunity. So God now
declares that the people of Israel had not only been prone to defection, but had
also greedily desired it, so that their madness was like a burning flame. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa24</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a third thing follows, and that is, that this
fire had not been suddenly lighted up, but had been for a long time gathering
strength. Hence he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As an
oven heated by the baker, who ceases</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from stirring up after the
shaking or mixing of the meal, until it be
fermented</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lush,</i> means &#8220;to besprinkle,&#8221; <i>empaster</i> is what they say
here. Some foolishly hold that they were like those who sleep and afterwards
awake early in the morning. But the Prophet had a different thing in view, and
that was, that by length of time their wickedness had increased, and, as it
were, by degrees. He means, in short, that they had not been under a sudden
impulse, like men who often break out through want of thought, and immediately
repent; and their lust, which had been in a moment set on fire, in a short time
abates. The Prophet says, that the frenzy of the people of Israel had been
different; for they had been like an oven, which the baker, after having lighted
up, allows to grow quite hot even to the highest degree; for he waits while the
dough is becoming well fermented. It was not then the intemperance and lust of a
few days; but they made their hearts quite hot, as when a baker heats his oven,
and puts in a great quantity of fuel, that after a time it may become heated,
while the dough is fermenting.</font><br></div>

to manage public affairs, is frigid. Others render it thus, &#8220;He rests from
the city,&#8221; so as not to be a citizen, &#8212; to what purpose? There is
then no doubt but that the Prophet here pursues his own similitudes which he
will again shortly repeat. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here reproves especially the king and his
courtiers. He had spoken of the whole people, and showed that the filth of evils
was every where diffused: but he now relates how strangely the king and his
courtiers ruled. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The day of our king! the princes
have made him sick</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, so great
has been the intemperance of excess, that the king himself became sick through
too much drinking, and extended his hand to mockers. In short, the Prophet
means, that the members of government in the kingdom of Israel had become so
corrupt, that in the hall or palace of the king there was no regard for decency,
and no shame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By &#8220;the day of the king,&#8221; some understand
his birth-day; and we know that it has been a very old custom even for the
common people to celebrate their birth-day. Others refer it to the day of
coronation, which is more probable. Some take it for the very beginning of his
reign, which seems strained. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
day of our king!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is &#8220;Our king
is now seated on his throne, he has now undertaken the government of the
kingdom; let us then feast plentifully, and glut ourselves with eating and
drinking.&#8221; This sense suits well; but I do not know whether it can bear
the name of day; he calls it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
day of the king.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I would then rather adopt
their opinion, who explain it as the annual day of coronation:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then of our king. There are yet
interpreters, who render the sentence thus, &#8220;In the day the princes have
made the king sick;&#8221; but I make this separation in it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The day of the king! the princes
have made him sick.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was not indeed sinful or blamable to celebrate
yearly the memory of the coronation; but then the king ought to have stirred up
himself and others to give thanks to God; the goodness of the Lord, in
preserving the kingdom safe, ought to have been acknowledged at the end of the
year; the king ought also to have asked of God the spirit of wisdom and strength
for the future, that he might discharge rightly his office. But the Prophet
shows here that there was nothing then in a sound state; for they had turned
into gross abuse what was in itself, as I have said, useful. The day then of our
king &#8212; how is it spent? Does the king humbly supplicate pardon before God,
if he has done any thing unworthy of his station, if in any thing he has
offended? Does he give thanks that God has hitherto sustained him by his
support? Does he prepare himself for the future discharge of his duty? No such
thing; but the princes indulge excess, and stimulate their king; yea, they so
overcome him with immoderate drinking, that they make him sick. This then, he
says, is their way of proceeding; nothing royal now appears in the king&#8217;s
palace, or even worthy of men; for they abandon themselves like beasts to
drunkenness, and so great intemperance prevails among them, that they ruin the
king himself with a bottle of wine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render this, &#8220;a flagon;&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chemet,</i> means properly a bottle; and we know that wine was then preserved
in bottles, as the Orientals do to this day. Then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with a bottle of
wine,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> with immoderate drinking, they made the
king sick.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that the king
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stretched forth his hand to
scorners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, forgetting himself,
he retained no gravity, but became like a buffoon, and indecently mixed with
worthless men. For the Prophet, I doubt not, calls those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scorners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
who, having cast away all shame, indulge in buffoonery and wantonness. He
therefore says, that the king held forth his hand to scorners, as a proof of
friendship. As he was then the companion of buffoons and worthless men, he had
cast away from him everything royal which he ought to have had. This is the
meaning. The Prophet, therefore, deplores this corruption, that there was no
longer any dignity or decency in the king and his princes, being wholly given,
as they were, to excess and drunkenness; yea, they turned sacred days into this
abuse, when the king ought to have conducted himself in a manner worthy of the
rank of the highest honor: he prostituted himself to every kind of wantonness,
and his princes were his leaders and encouragers.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet says, that the Israelites did
secretly, and by hidden means, prepare their hearts for deeds of evil; and he
takes up nearly the same similitude as he did a little while before, though for
a different purpose; for he says that they had prepared their hearts secretly,
as the baker puts fire in the night in his oven, and then rests, and in the
morning the oven is well heated, having attained heat sufficient to bake the
bread. The oven becomes hot in the morning, though the baker sleeps. How so?
Because an abundance of fuel had been put together, so that it is heated by the
morning. Hence nocturnal rest does not prevent the fire from making hot the
oven, when it has a sufficient quantity of fuel, when the baker has so filled
his oven, that the fire cannot be extinguished, nor be gradually smothered. When
the baker has thus set in order an heap of wood, he then securely rests, for the
fire can continue until the morning. We now then see the design of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
prepared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their hearts
insidiously</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, though they have
not at first made evident their wickedness, they have yet previously prepared
their hearts, as the oven is lighted up, or as the furnace is heated before the
bread is prepared; nay, there is no need of much bustle, &#8212; there is no
need of much noise when the baker lights up his oven, for he prepares the wood,
and then he goes to rest; and, in the meantime, while he sleeps all the night,
the fire is burning. So also they, though all do not perceive their wickedness,
they have yet, in the meantime, heated their hearts like an oven; that is, evil
deeds have, by degrees and during a long period of time, been conceived by them,
before they came forth into open acts of wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the similitude of an oven is set
forth here by the Prophet in a sense different from what it had been before; and
this ought to be noticed, because interpreters heedlessly pass over this wholly,
as if the Prophet meant in both places the same thing. But the meaning, as it is
evident, is far different. For he intended only, in the first instance, to
reprove the mad lust with which they were burning; but he now speaks of their
plots and concealed frauds; that is, that the Israelites before openly showed
themselves to be ungodly and wicked, but that they were now wicked before God.
How so? Because they were now like an oven lighted up in the night; for as the
baker, having closed the door of his house, puts in fire, while none perceive
that the furnace or the oven is being heated; so also the people fed and
nourished their wickedness before God; and afterwards, in course of time, it
broke forth openly, whenever an opportunity was offered.</font><br></div>

Israelites were carried away by a mad zeal into their own superstitions and
wicked practices, and could not be allayed or quieted by any remedies; and he
shows at the same time that this malady or intemperance raged in the whole
people, lest the vulgar should accuse a few men, as if they were the authors of
all the wickedness. He gives proof of their frenzy, because they could not have
been hitherto amended by any corrections.

to good kings, or to those who were able to uphold an ordinary government among
the people. He says that judges as well as kings had fallen; by which words he
means, that the Israelites had been deprived of good and wise governors; and
this was a sad and miserable disorder to the people; it was the same as if the
head were taken from the body. He says, in short, that the body was mangled and
mutilated, because the Lord had taken away the kings and judges. We indeed know
that kings in continual succession reigned among the Israelites; but we must
consider of what kings the Prophet here speaks.</font><br></div>

from all laws, had by main force upset all order; but this seems to me strained.
The Prophet, I doubt not, means that the judges had been devoured, because the
people had through their own fault made, as it were, entirely void the favor of
God, as it often happens daily. God indeed so begins to do good, that he intends
to continue his benefits to us to the end; but we devour his benefits; for we
dry up, as it were, the fountain of his goodness, which would otherwise be
exhaustless and perpetually flow to us. As then the goodness of God, which is
otherwise inexhaustible, is in a manner dried up to us, when we allow it not to
approach us; it is in this sense that the Prophet now complains that judges had
been devoured by the Israelites; for through their impiety they had been
deprived of this singular kindness of God; and they had consumed it, as rust or
some other fault in brass destroys good fruit. We now comprehend the meaning of
this verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God first shows that the Israelites were so ardent,
that their frenzy could not be corrected or quieted. How so? &#8220;I have
tried,&#8221; he says, &#8220;whether their disease was healable; for I have
taken away their kings and governors, which was no obscure sign of my
displeasure: but I have effected nothing.&#8221; Then it follows,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yla &#181;hb arq
&#710;ya</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ain kora beem ali,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no

me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He had said that all were burning
with the lust of committing sin; now, accusing their stupidity, he excepts none.
We hence see that the whole people were so seized with frenzy, that when
chastised by God&#8217;s hand, they did not yet cry to him. It is indeed certain
that the Israelites did cry, but without repentance; and it is usual with
hypocrites to howl when God punishes them; but they yet direct not to him their
supplications and their groans, for their heart is locked up by obstinacy. Thus
then ought this clause to be expounded, that they repented not, nor fled to God
for mercy. Then it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God now complains, that Ephraim, whom he had chosen
to be a peculiar possession to himself, differed nothing from other nations. The
children of Abraham, we know, had been adopted by God for this end, that they
might not be like the heathens: for the calling of God brings holiness with it.
And we ought to remember that memorable sentence, which often occurs, &#8216;Be
ye holy, for I am holy.&#8217; The Israelites then ought to have been mindful of
their calling, and to resolve to worship God purely, and not to pollute
themselves with the defilements and filth of the Gentiles. But God says here
that Ephraim differed now nothing from the uncircumcised nations.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He mingles
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the
peoples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And there is an emphasis to be
noticed in the pronoun demonstrative,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eva,</i> <i>Ephraim himself,</i> he says: for surely this was unworthy and by
no means to be endured, that Ephraim, on whom God had engraven the mark of his
election, was now entangled in the superstitions of the Gentiles. We now then
see the drift of the Prophet&#8217;s words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He, even Ephraim, mingles himself
with the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> If the condition of
Israel and of all the nations had been alike and equal, the Prophet would not
have thus spoken; but as God had designed Ephraim to be holy to himself; the
Prophet here amplifies his sin, when he says that even Ephraim had mingled
himself with the nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim is like bread baked under
the ashes, which is not turned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This
metaphor most fitly suits the meaning of the Prophet and the circumstances of
this passage, provided it be rightly understood. And I think the Prophet simply
meant this, that Ephraim was in nothing fixed, but was inconstant and
changeable; as, when we in vulgar language notify their changeableness who are
not consistent with themselves, and in whom there is no sincerity, we say, <i>Il
n&#8217;est ne chair ne poisson,</i> (It is neither flesh nor fish.) So also in
this place the Prophet says, that Ephraim was like a cake burnt on one side, and
was on the other doughy, or a crude and unbaked lump of paste. For Ephraim, we
know, boasted themselves to be a people sacred to God; and since circumcision
distinguished that people from other nations, there seemed to be some
difference; but in the meantime the worship of God was corrupted; all the
sacrifices were adulterated, as we have already seen and the whole of their
religion was a confused mixture; yea, a chaos composed of Gentile superstitions
and of something that resembled true and legitimate worship. When, therefore,
the Israelites were thus perfidiously mocking God, they had nothing fixed: hence
the Prophet compares them to a cake, which, being placed on the hearth, is not
turned; for on one side it must be burnt, while on the other it remains unbaked.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here anticipates what the Israelites
might object; for hypocrites, we know, never want pretenses. The Israelites
might then bring forward this defense, &#8220;Thou sayest that we are now
entangled in the pollutions of the heathens; but the heathens have no
circumcision; among them the God of Israel is despised, there is no altar on
which the people can sacrifice to the true God; we, on the contrary, are the
children of Abraham, we have the God who stretched forth his hand to deliver us
from Egypt, and the priesthood ever abides with us.&#8221; As then the
Israelites might have introduced these pretenses for their superstitions, the
Prophet says, by anticipation, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like bread baked under the
ashes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> which, being thrown on the
hearth, is not turned, so that the baking might be equal; for then on the one
side it would receive heat, and on the other there would be no proportionate
temperature. &#8220;Ye are,&#8221; he says, &#8220;on one side burnt, but on the
other crude; so that with you there is nothing but mere perfidiousness.&#8221;
We now understand what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this similitude might also be referred to their
punishment; for God had shown before in many places, that the Israelites were so
perverse, that they could not be subdued nor brought to a sound mind by any
distresses: and he again repeats this complaint. The meaning of the words may
then be this, That Ephraim was like a cake, which was not turned on the hearth,
because he had been sharply and severely chastised, but without any benefit;
being like reprobates, who, though the Lord may bruise them, yet continue
obstinate in their hardness. They are then on one side burnt, because they are
nearly wasted away under their evils; but on the other side they are wholly
unbaked, because the Lord had not softened their perverseness. But what I have
adduced in the first place is more suitable to the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet says: in the
first clause God accuses Ephraim, because he had made himself profane by
receiving the rites and superstitions of heathens, so that there was, as I have
said before, a confused mixture. In the second place, he answers the Israelites,
in case they pleaded in their favor the name of God, for it was usual for them
to make false pretenses. He therefore says, that they were in some things
different from the uncircumcised nations, but that this difference was nothing
before God, for they were like bread baked under the ashes, which is neither
baked nor unbaked on either side; for on one side it is burnt, and on the other
it remains unbaked.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet follows the same subject, that is, that
Israel had not repented, though the Lord had in various ways invited them to
repentance; yea, and constrained them by his scourges. It is indeed a proof of
desperate and incurable wickedness, when God prevails nothing with us either by
his word or by his stripes. When we are deaf to his teaching and admonitions, it
is quite evident that we are wholly perverse: but when the Lord also raises up
his hand and inflicts punishment, if then we bend not, what can be said, but
that our sins have taken such deep roots, that they cannot be torn away from us?
Hence God in these words shows that the Israelites were now past all remedy; for
after having been so often and in so many ways warned, they did not return to
the right way; nay, they did not think of their sins, but remained insensible.
And Paul says of such that they are
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aphlghkotav</font><font face="Palatino">,
(&#8220;past feeling,&#8221;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:19,) that is void of feeling. When men are touched by no grief in their
distresses, it is certain that they are smitten by the spirit of giddiness.
Notwithstanding, the Israelites no doubt felt their evils; but the Prophet
means, that they were so stupefied, that they did not consider the cause and
source of them. And what can it avail, when one knows himself to be ill, and yet
looks not to God, nor thinks that he is justly visited? Hence when any one cries
only on account of the strokes, and regards not the hand of the striker, as
another Prophet says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:13,) there is certainly in him complete stupidity. We hence see what the
Prophet had in view when he said, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel did not understand while
he was devoured by strangers, while hoariness was spreading over
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for he attended not to the cause of
evils, but remained stupid; nor did he raise up his mind to God, so as to impute
to his sins all the evils which he suffered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his strength was eaten by
strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God had promised that the
people would be under his protection; and when they were exposed to the plunder
of strangers, why did they not perceive that they were deprived of God&#8217;s
protection? And this could not have happened, except their own sin had deprived
them of this privilege. Hence the Israelites must have been extremely blind and
alienated in mind, when they did not perceive that they were thus spoiled by
strangers, because God did not now defend them, nor was their patron, as he was
wont to be formerly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that hoariness was upon
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some understand by this, that the
Israelites were not improved by long succession of years. Age, as we know,
through long experience, brings to men some prudence. Young people, even when
the Lord invites them to himself, are carried away by some impulse or another;
but in the aged there is greater prudence and moderation. Many hence think that
the Israelites are here condemned because they had profited nothing &#8212; no,
not even by the advance of age. But the Prophet, I doubt not, expresses the
greatness of their calamities by this mode of speaking, when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hoariness was sprinkled over
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for we know, that when any one is
grievously pained and afflicted, he becomes hoary through the very pressure of
evils; inasmuch as hoariness proceeds not only from years, but also from
troubles and heavy cares, which not only waste men, but consume them. We indeed
know that men grow old through the suffering of evils. And here, in my judgment,
the Prophet means, that &#8220;hoariness had come upon Israel,&#8221; &#8212;
that is, that he had been visited with so many evils, that he was worn out, as
it were, with old age; and that, after all, he had derived no benefit. We now
perceive the truth of what I have said before, that it was the constant teaching
of the Prophet, that the diseases which prevailed among the people of Israel
were incurable, for they could by no remedies be brought to repentance. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now confirms his previous doctrine, and
speaks generally, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the pride

face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or shall humble him to his face.
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>one,</i> means, in Hebrew, &#8220;to testify,&#8221; and often, also,
&#8220;to humble,&#8221; or &#8220;to afflict,&#8221; as it was stated in the
fifth chapter; and the words of the Prophet are now the same, and both senses
are appropriate. I do not, however, make much of this, for the design of the
Prophet is clear; what he means is, that God had so openly chastised the
Israelites, that they must have perceived his hand, except they were blind
indeed, and that, being at the same time warned, they ought to have suppliantly
humbled themselves. Whether then we read, &#8220;to testify&#8221; or &#8220;to
humble,&#8221; the sense will be the same, and the design of the Prophet will
appear to be the same. &#8220;The pride, then, of Israel will humble him to his
face,&#8221; or, &#8220;the pride of Israel will testify to his face:&#8221; for
the Prophet means, that however fiercely the Israelites might rise up against
God, and be uncourteous to his Prophets and however perversely they might reject
all teaching, and also excuse their own sins, yet all this would avail them
nothing, since they were so cast down by their pride, that the Lord regarded
them as convicted as much so as if their crime had been proved by many
witnesses, and their mask now taken away; in short, there was no longer any
doubt: this is what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>

appeared hitherto inflexible against all admonitions, against all punishments,
they were yet held as convicted; and, at the same time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they return
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to their God, and seek him not
for all these things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We now perceive
what I have said, that the previous complaint respecting the diabolical
perverseness which so reigned in the people is here confirmed, so that their
salvation was now past hope. And he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they returned not to Jehovah
their God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for they were running
constantly after their idols, as we have before seen; yea, they were possessed
with that inordinate zeal of which the Prophet speaks in the beginning of the
chapter; but they returned not to Jehovah; they were wholly taken up with the
multitude of their deities, and at the same time had no regard for
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And when he says, <i>their God,</i> he conveys a
strong reprobation; for God had manifested himself to them; yea, he had made
himself plainly known to them by his law. That they then did not return to him,
was not simply through ignorance or error; but through a diabolical madness, as
if they wished of their own accord and deliberately to perish. God then calls
himself here the God of Israel, not for honour&#8217;s sake, but that he might
the more expose their ingratitude, and enhance their perfidiousness, because
they had fallen away from him, and would not seek him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he means, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> is, that every kind of remedy
had been tried, and hence that their disease was wholly incurable. When we can
do nothing in one way, we often try another. Now God had not tried in one way
only to bring Israel back to himself, but he had tried all remedies. When no
good followed, what was to be said, but the people were lost, and past all hope?

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here first blames Israel for foolish
credulity, and compares them to a dove; for they had invited the Egyptians and
sent to Assyria for help. Simplicity is indeed a commendable virtue, when joined
to prudence. But as everything reasonable and judicious in men is turned into
wickedness when there is no integrity; so when men are too credulous and void of
all judgment and reason, it is then mere folly. But when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel is like a
dove</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he does not mean that the
Israelites had sinned through mere ignorance, but that they were destitute of
all judgment; and this folly is opposed to the knowledge which God had offered
to them in his law: for God had never ceased to guide Israel by sound doctrine;
he had ever exhibited before them the torch of his word; but when God thus gave
them light, Israel was so credulous as to give heed to the delusions of Satan
and of the world. We now then perceive the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render

<i>pite,</i> no doubt, means &#8220;to turn aside;&#8221; and it means also
sometimes &#8220;to persuade:&#8221; hence some give this rendering, &#8220;a
persuasible,&#8221; or, &#8220;a credulous dove.&#8221; But the Prophet, I doubt
not, means, that they were enticed by flatteries, or deceived by allurements,
which is the same thing. Israel then was like a dove, deceived by various
lures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they ran to the
Assyrians, they invited the Egyptians</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
If Israel had attended to the law of God, they might have felt assured that they
were not in danger of going astray; for the Lord keeps us not in suspense or
doubt, that we may fluctuate, but makes our minds fixed and tranquil by his
word, as it is also said in another place, &#8216;This is rest.&#8217; It was
then determined by the Israelites not to fix their feet as it were on solid
ground; and they preferred to fly here and there like doves; and their credulity
led them to many errors. How? Because they chose rather to give themselves up to
be deceived by the Egyptians as well as by the Assyrians, when yet God was
willing to guide them by sound knowledge. We now understand the design of this
accusation of the Prophet to be, that Israel wilfully refused the way of safety
offered to them, which they might have followed with confidence, and with a
tranquil and composed mind; but in the meantime they flew up and down, and
became wilfully erratic; for they suffered themselves to be deceived by various
lures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this place teaches us that men are not to be
excused by the pretext of simplicity; for the Prophet here condemns this very
weakness in the Israelites. We ought then to attend to the rule of Christ,
&#8216;To be innocent as doves, and yet to be prudent as serpents.&#8217; But if
we inconsiderately abandon ourselves, the excuse of ignorance will be frivolous;
for the Lord shines upon us by his word and shows us the right way; and he has
also in his power the spirit of prudence and judgment, which he never denies to
those who ask. But when we despise the word, and neglect the Spirit of God, and
follow our own vagrant imaginations, our sin is twofold; for we thus despise and
quench the light of the word, and we also wilfully perish, when the Lord would
save us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a denunciation of punishment afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wheresoever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall go, I will
expand over them my net, and will draw them down as the birds of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God shows that though the
Israelites might turn about here and there, yet their end would be unhappy; for
he would have his expanded net: and he follows up the simile he used in the last
verse. He had said that they were like doves, which are carried by a sudden
instinct to the bait, and consider not the expanded net. If then the dove sees
only the lure, and at the same time shuns not the danger, it is a proof of
foolish simplicity. Hence God says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will expand my
net</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, I will cause all your
endeavors and purposes to be disappointed, and all your hopes to be vain; for<i>

expanded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage; for we hence learn,
that the issue will always be unfortunate, if we attempt any thing contrary to
the word of the Lord, and it we hold consultations over which his Spirit does
not preside; as it is said by Isaiah 30, 31,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Woe to them who
weave a web, and draw not from my mouth! Woe to them who take counsel, and
invoke not my Spirit!&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage wholly agrees with the words of Isaiah,
though the form of speaking is different. It belongs then to God to bless our
counsels, that they may have a prosperous and the desired success. But when God
is not favorable, but even opposed to our designs, what end shall at last await
us, but that whatever we may have attained shall at length be turned to our
ruin? Let us then know, that whatever men do in this world is ruled by the
hidden providence of God; and as God leads by his extended hand his own people,
and gives his angels charge to guide them; so also he has his expanded net to
catch all those who wander after their own erratic imaginations. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wheresoever they shall go, I will
expand over them my net</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and farther,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will draw them down as the
birds of heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems to allude to the vain confidence,
which he mentioned, when he said that Israel had bound wind in his wings. For
when men presumptuously undertake any thing, they at the same time promise to
themselves, that there will be nothing to prevent them from gaining their
object. Inasmuch then as men, elated with this foolish confidence, gather more
boldness, yea, at length furiously assail God, and seem as though they would
break through the very clouds, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will draw them down as the
birds of heaven;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8220;I will allow
them to be carried up for a time; but when they shall penetrate to the clouds, I
will draw them down, I will make them to know that their flying will avail them
nothing.&#8221; And we must notice from whence the Israelites had been drawn
down. For who would not have thought that so much protection must have been
found in the Assyrians or in the Egyptians, that they could not in vain expect
deliverance? But the Lord laughs to scorn this vain power of the world; for
whatever hope men may conceive when they alienate themselves from God, it will
entirely vanish like smoke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will chastise
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, &#8216;I will bind
them:&#8217; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rsy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>isar,</i> means both &#8220;to chastise&#8221; as well as &#8220;to
bind;&#8221; so that either sense may be taken. If the word, &#8220;to
bind,&#8221; be approved, it will well agree with the metaphor, as though he
said, &#8220;I will hold you fast in my nets.&#8221; For as long as birds are
allowed to fly, they think the whole heaven to be theirs; but when they fall
into nets, they remain confined; they are then unable to fly, and cannot move
their wings. So then this sense, &#8220;I will bind them&#8221;, is very
suitable; which means, &#8220;They will not be able to break my net, but I will
hold them there bound to the end.&#8221; But if one prefers the other sense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will chastise
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not object; and as far as the
meaning is concerned, we see that there is not much difference which sense we
take, except that the word, &#8220;to bind,&#8221; as I have said, harmonizes
better with the metaphor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the hearing of their
assembly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Nearly all so render this, as
if God had said that he would punish them as he had threatened by Moses, and as
if it was also an indirect accusation of their carelessness, because they did
not become wise after having been long admonished, but even despised those
denunciations, which constantly resounded in their ears. For God had not only
prescribed in his law the rule of a religious life, but also added heavy and
severe threatening, by which he gave a sanction to the doctrine at the law. We
know how dreadful are those curses of the law. Since then God had even from the
beginning thus threatened the Israelites, ought they not to have walked more
carefully before him? But they were not terrified by these denunciations. Hence
God here indirectly reproves this great madness, that the Israelites did not
sufficiently attend to his threatening, by which they might have been recalled
to the right way; for Moses did by these put a restraint even on the furious
passions of men, if only there remained in them a particle of sound
understanding. Still further, the same admonitions had been often pressed on
them by the Prophets; nor had God ever ceased to arouse them, until the ears of
them all had become deaf to his voice. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>&#8216;I will hold them fast
bound,&#8217;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, &#8216;I will chastise them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the hearing of their
assembly;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8217;</i> that is, &#8220;The
punishment which I shall inflict must have been long ago known to them, for I
have openly commanded my law to be promulgated, that I might thus testify my
people by severe threatening; I will now then execute the judgment, which they
have not believed, because I have hitherto spared them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As I have already said, interpreters nearly all agree
in this view, except that they do not consider the design of the Prophet; they
do not perceive that the Israelites were upbraided for their hardness; but they
only speak of punishment, without any intimation of the end or object for which
God had promulgated maledictions in his law, and renewed the recollection of
them by his Prophets. Jerome brings forward another meaning, even this, that God
would punish the people according to the report of their assembly; that is, that
as they had with one consent violated the worship of God, and transgressed his
laws, so he would punish them all. I will at the same time add this view, that
God would chastise them according to the clamour of their assembly, so that the
Prophet points out, not only a conspiracy among the people of Israel, but also
their violence in eliciting one another to sin. As, then, they had thus
tumultuously risen up against God, so the Prophet in his turn declares, that God
would punish them; as though he said, &#8220;Your tumult will not prevent me
from quelling your fury. Ye do indeed with great noise oppose me, and think that
you will be safe, though addicted to your sins; but this your violence will be
no hindrance, for I have in my power the means of chastising
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
sees us to be so prone to all the allurements of Satan and the world, and at the
same time so void of judgment, and carried away by mere levity, &#8212; O grant,
that by thy Spirit leading us, we may proceed in the right course, on which we
have already entered under thy guidance and directing hand, so that we may never
go astray from thy word, nor by any means turn aside from pursuing towards the
mark which thou hast set before us; and though Satan may attempt to draw us
aside, may we yet continue steadfast in thy service, and thus proceed, until we
arrive at that blessed rest which, after the warfare of the present life, thou
hast promised to us in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet takes away from the Israelites the
hope of pardon, and declares that it was all over with them, for God had now
resolved to destroy them. For as God everywhere declares himself to be ready and
inclined to pardon, hypocrites hope that God will be propitious to them; and
entertaining this vain confidence, they despise his threatening and boldly rise
up against him. Hence the Prophet here shows, that God would hereafter be
inexorable to them, because they had too long pertinaciously abused his
patience. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for they have withdrawn from me:
desolation to them! for they have acted perfidiously towards
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is then no reason, says the
Prophet, for them to delude themselves in future with vain confidence, as they
have hitherto done; for this has been once for all determined by God &#8212; to
indict on them his extreme vengeance, for their defection deserves
this.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will redeem them, and
they have spoken lies against me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They who
render the first word in the future tense, think that the Prophet asks a
question, &#8220;Shall I redeem them? for they have spoken lies against
me:&#8221; and they think it to be an indefinite mode of speaking &#8212;
&#8220;Should I redeem them, men of no faith; for what good should I do by such
kindness?&#8221; Others give this expositions &#8212; &#8220;Though I wished to
redeem them, yet I found that this would not be beneficial nor just, because
they speak lies against me;&#8221; as though God did not express here what he
had done, but what he had wished to do. But the past tense is not unsuitable to
this place; and we know how common and familiar to the Hebrews was the change of
tenses. The meaning, then, will be, &#8220;I have redeemed them, and they have
spoken lies against me;&#8221; that is, &#8220;I have often delivered them from
death, when they were in extreme peril; but they have not changed their
disposition; nay, they have deprived me of the praise due for their deliverance,
and they have lived in no way better after their deliverance. Since, then, I
have hitherto conferred my benefits to no good purpose, nothing now remains but
that I must destroy them.&#8221; And this seems to me to be the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then declares, in the first clause, that they
hoped for mercy in vain from God, because their ultimate destruction was
decreed. Then follows the reason for this, because they had foolishly and
impiously abused the favor of God, inasmuch as, having been redeemed by him,
they yet went on in their own wickedness, and even acted perfidiously towards
God, while yet they pretended to act differently. Since, then, there was no
change for the better, God now shows that he would spend his favor no longer on
men so impious. Now this place teaches how intolerable is our ingratitude, when,
after having been redeemed by the Lord, we keep not the faith pledged to him,
and which he requires from us; for God is our deliverer on this condition, that
we be wholly devoted to him. For he who has been redeemed ought not so to live,
as if he had a right to himself and to his own will; but he ought to be wholly
dependent on his Redeemer. If, then, we thus act perfidiously towards God, after
having been delivered by his grace, we shall be guilty of such impiety and
perfidiousness as deserve a twofold vengeance: and this is what the Prophet here
teaches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed know how mercifully God had spared the
people of Israel: after they had fallen away into superstitious worship, and had
also violated their faith to the posterity of David, the Lord did not yet cease
to show to that people many favors, notwithstanding their unworthiness. We know
also, that under Jeroboam prosperity had attended them beyond all human
expectation. But they yet hardened themselves more and more in their wickedness,
so far were they from returning to the right way. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again reproves the Israelites for
having not repented, after having been so often admonished; for, as it was said
yesterday, all the chastisements which God by his own hand inflicts on us, have
this as the object &#8212; to heal us of our vices. Now the Prophet says here
that the Israelites had not cried to God, which is yet the chief thing in
repentance. But this expression is to be noticed.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have not cried to me with
their heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is sincerely. We
indeed know that some worship of God had ever remained among them; though the
Israelites devised for themselves many gods, yet the name of the true God had
never been wholly obliterated among them; but they blended the worship of God
with their own inventions; God, at the same time, could not endure these
fictitious invocations. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they cried not from the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He accuses them, not that they
performed no outward act, but that they did not bring a real desire of heart;
nay, they only cried to God dissemblingly. We now perceive what the Prophet
meant by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have not
cried to me with their heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As calling
on God is the chief exercise of religion, and especially manifests our
repentance, the Prophet expressly notices this defect in the Israelites &#8212;
that they cried not to the Lord. But as they might object and say, that they had
formally prayed, he adds, that they did not do so from the heart; for the
outward act (ceremonia) without the exercise of the heart, is nothing else but a
profanation of God&#8217;s name. In short, the Prophet shows here to the
Israelites their hardness; for when they were smitten by God&#8217;s hand, they
did not flee to him and supplicate pardon, at least they did not do this from
the heart or sincerely.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they howled on their
beds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some explain the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki,</i> adversatively; as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;Though they
howl on their beds, they do not yet direct their petitions to me.&#8221; But we
may take it in its proper sense, and the sentence would thus run better: They
howl then on their beds, that is, &#8220;They bring not their concerns to me;
for like brute animals they utter their howlings:&#8221; and this we see to be
the case with the unbelieving; for they fear the presence of God, and the very
mention of him is dreaded by them; hence they howl, that is, they pour forth
their impetuous feelings, but at the same time they shun every access to God as
much as they can. The sense then is, &#8220;They cry not to me from the heart,
for they only howl; but it is only by an animal effort without any
reason.&#8221; If, however, any one prefers to take the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki,</i> adversatively, the sense would not be unsuitable, &#8220;Though they
howl on their beds, they do not yet cry to me;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Though
grief urges them to make great noises, they are yet mute as to any cry of
prayer.&#8221; If any one more approves of this meaning, I say nothing against
it: but as the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki,</i> is commonly taken as a causative, I prefer thus to explain it,
&#8220;As they cry on their beds, they raise not up their voice to
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
assemble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, will assemble
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>themselves for corn and
wine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This place is explained in two
ways. Some think that the Israelites are here in an indirect way reproved,
inasmuch as when they found wine and corn in the market, having obtained their
wishes, they went on heedlessly in their sins, and despised God, as if they had
no more need of his help. They then ran together for wine and corn; that is, as
soon as they heard of wine or corn, they provided themselves with provisions,
and afterwards neglected God. But this sense seems too frigid and strained. The
Prophet then, I doubt not, opposes the running together of which he speaks, to
true and sincere attention to prayer; as though he said, &#8220;They are not
touched with grief for having offended me, though they see by evident proofs
that I am displeased with them; they regard not my favor or my displeasure,
provided they enjoy plenty of wine and corn: this satisfies them, and it is all
the same with them whether I am adverse or propitious to them.&#8221; This seems
to be the genuine meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that this reproof may be more evident, we must
observe what Christ teaches, that we ought first to seek the kingdom of God. For
men act strangely when they anxiously labour only for this life, and strive only
to procure for themselves food, and what is needful for the wants of the flesh:
we ever make a beginning here; and yet it is a most thoughtless anxiety, when we
are so attentive to a frail life, and in the meantime neglect the kingdom of
God. Inasmuch then as men by this perverted feeling derange the whole order of
religion, the Prophet here shows that the Israelites did not truly and from the
heart cry unto God, because they were only solicitous about wine and corn; for
except when they were hungry, they despised God, and allowed him to rest quietly
in heaven: hence penury and want constrained them. As brute beasts, when they
are hungry, go to the stall, and seek not to be fed by the Lord; so also did the
Israelites, when they were touched by some feeling of need; but at the same time
they were contented with their wine and corn; nor had they any other God. Hence
they so cried, that their voice did not come to God, as they did not indeed go
really and directly to him. The Prophet then does here, by a particular
instance, convict the Israelites of impious dissimulation, inasmuch as they did
not seek God, but were only intent on food; and provided the stomach was well
supplied, they neglected God, and desired not his favor, and only wished to have
full barns and full cellars; for plenty of provisions, without the paternal
favor of God, was their only desire. It is hence sufficiently evident that they
did not cry to the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This place is worthy of being observed; for we here
see that our prayers are faulty before God, if we begin with wine and bread, and
seek not first the kingdom of God, that is, his glory; and if we apply not our
minds to this &#8212; to live, so to have God propitious to us. When we go to
Him, the fountain of divine blessing, God only desire to glut ourselves with the
abundance of the good things which he has to bestow, then all our prayers are
deservedly rejected by him. We see this to be the case with the Papists; when
they present their supplications, they are wholly like animals. They indeed
implore God for rain and for dry weather; but have they any desire of
reconciling themselves to God? By no means; for they wish, as much as possible,
to be at the farthest distance from him: but when want and famine constrain
them, they then ask for rain, &#8212; for what purpose? only that they may
abound in bread and wine. We ought then to preserve a legitimate order in our
prayers. If the Lord shows to us proofs of his wrath, we must strive first to
return into favor with him, and then his glory must be regarded by us, and he is
to be sought with the real feeling of piety, that he may be a Father to us: and
then may be added in their place the things which belong to the condition and
preservation of the present life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have revolted from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rws</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sur,</i> means, &#8220;to recede,&#8221; and also &#8220;to revolt;&#8221;
and this second sense is the most suitable; for the Prophet said before that
they had receded or departed from God; but now he seems to signify something
more grievous, and that is, that they had revolted from God. Thus hypocrites,
when they pretend to seek God in a circuitous course, betray their own revolt;
for they are unwilling to be reconciled to him on the condition that they are to
change for the better their life, to cast away the affections of the flesh, to
renounce themselves and their depraved desires. These things they by no means
seek. Hence then it becomes evident that they are witnesses to their own revolt,
and also to dissimulation in their prayers, even when there is some appearance
of piety. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God again reproaches the Israelites for having in a
base manner abused his goodness and forbearance. Some consider the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rsy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>isar,</i> as meaning, &#8220;to chastise,&#8221; because God had disciplined
the Israelites; and, as I have said yesterday, it is often taken in this sense.
But as it signifies sometimes &#8220;to bind,&#8221; it seems a fitter metaphor
for this place. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have bound and
strengthened their arms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though God
had said, that he had caused their arms not to be enervated. For we know that
the strength of the arm depends on the structure of the nerves. Except the bones
were bound together by the nerves, a dissolution would immediately follow. Hence
God says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have bound and
strengthened their arms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which two
things combine for the same end, and the notion of chastising seems not to me to
be in any way suitable to the context. The meaning is, that the Israelites had
hitherto continued, because God had sustained them by his power. As when one
binds up and strengthens a weak or a loosened arm, so God here reminds Israel
that he had preserved them in their position. And the Prophet, I have no doubt,
alludes here to the many calamities by which the strength of Israel might have
been broken, had not a timely remedy been applied by the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then compares himself here to a physician or a
surgeon, when he says that he had bound the arm of Israel and strengthened it,
when it might have been otherwise broken: for they had been often as it were
enervated, but the Lord restored them. We now understand the meaning of the
Prophet to be, that God had not only by his power sustained the Israelites, but
had also performed the office of a surgeon or a physician, when he saw their
arms broken, when they were wasted by slaughters in wars, and by other
adversities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Israelites were so far from being grateful to
God and mindful of him, that they were even devising evil against him. For after
having obtained victories, after having been restored and even replenished with
fulness of all blessings, they the more boldly conspired against him; for under
this pretence were superstitions established, and then followed the indulgence
of all vices; for pride, and cruelty, and ambition, and frauds, prevailed more
and more. Since then the Israelites had thus perverted the blessings of God, was
not the hope of pardon and salvation justly cut off from them? Now we are
reminded in this place, that whenever God heals our evils, and raises us up in
adversity and succors us, we ought devoutly to acknowledge his favor, and not to
meditate evil against him, when he so kindly extends his hand to us. Let us now
proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again assails the perverse wickedness of
Israel, and also their fraud and perfidiousness. Hence he says that they feigned
some sort of repentance, but it was nothing else than false; for they returned
not to God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but not to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some however think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol,</i> is a preposition, and that something is understood, as if it were an
elliptical phrase: &#8220;They return, but not for anything;&#8221; that is,
when they return, were any one to inquire what is in their minds, or what is
their purpose, he would find it to be mere form and nothing real. But this
exposition, as we see, is strained. Besides, the context requires that we should
consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol,</i> to be for God, as it is also in other places; for this is nothing
new. Then it is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They return not
to God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then declares here that the Israelites
were wholly perverse, so that God could force out of them no repentance; that
when they pretended something it was mere deceit, for they did not come in a
direct way to God. For hypocrites, as it has been said before, when God&#8217;s
hand presses hard on them, seem indeed to be different from what they were
previously, but they always shun God. The Lord does not in vain exhort the
people by Jeremiah to return to him,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;If thou wilt
return, O Israel,&#8217; he says, &#8216;return unto
me,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
4:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For he knew that by devious windings men always go
astray and keep not to the straight course. This is the
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they there like a deceitful
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is an explanation of the last
sentence; and hence we conclude that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol, </i>cannot be otherwise taken than for God. The Prophet shows how the
Israelites withdrew themselves from God, while they seemed to repent, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
were</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like a deceitful
bow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some expound it, the bow of darting or
shooting; and no doubt
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>reme,</i> means to dart and to shoot; but this sense cannot be taken here,
for we see that what the Prophet had in view was to show, that the Israelites
put on a guise, and did nothing but deceive, when they made a show of
repentance. To confirm this, he says, that they were like an oblique bow. For
the archer, when he intends to shoot an arrow, first levels at a certain mark;
then the arrow seems to be directed to that place which the archer fixes on by
his eyes. Now if the bow is oblique, the arrow will fly elsewhere; or the bow
may slip, so as to throw back the arrow to the archer himself. The like
comparison is found in Psalm 78, where it is said, that the Jews were turned
back &#8216;like a deceitful bow;&#8217; and in that passage this very word
occurs. But there is here no ambiguity; for God accuses the people that they had
turned back; that is, that they had turned backward their course, even like a
deceitful bow. If one reads &#8220;the bow of darting,&#8221; or, &#8220;of
shooting,&#8221; there will be no sense; nay, it will be vapid and absurd. It is
then better to render the expression here, &#8216;a deceitful
bow.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we must notice the import of the similitude, to
which I have already referred, that is, that as archers aim the arrow to the
mark, as they direct its flight by winking and leveling, and shoot; so
hypocrites seem to strive with great effort, but, at the same time, they are
deceitful bows; that is, their mind is driven back, and they fly away from God,
and, by tortuous windings, go astray, so that they never come to God, but rather
turn their backs on him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their princes shall fall by the
sword for the pride of their tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet again denounces vengeance on the Israelites, that they might feel
assured that the heavenly decree respecting their destruction could not be
changed. For though hypocrites always dread, and cannot hope anything from God,
yet they never cease to flatter themselves, and always to contrive some new
hope. Inasmuch then as they are so bountiful in vain promising, the Prophet says
that there was no reason for the Israelites to hope for any remedy in their
distresses. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their princes then
shall fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and in saying
&#8216;princes,&#8217; he takes a part for the whole; for God does not thus
threaten princes, or denounces ruin on them, as though he intended to except the
common people; but he implies, that destruction would be common to all, which
not even the princes themselves would escape. And we know that in battles, when
a great slaughter is made, the common soldiers lie dead in great numbers, and
but few of the chiefs. But God says here, &#8220;I will take away the whole
flower of the people. And if none of the princes shall remain, what will become
of the ignoble vulgar, who are deemed of no account?&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall fall by the
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the pride of their
tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some expound this phrase
actively, as though the Prophet had said, that they had provoked God&#8217;s
wrath by their blasphemies and profane speeches; but I rather take it for their
high vaunting: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the pride of
their tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, because they haughtily
boasted of their strength, and held in contempt all the prophecies, because they
dared to vomit forth their blasphemies against God, and dared, also, no less
obstinately than proudly, to defend their own impious and depraved forms of
worship, I will revenge, he says, &#8220;this pride.&#8221; We hence see that
&#8220;pride,&#8221; here, is to be taken for that disdain which the impious
show by their high vaunting, as it is said elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;They raise to
heaven their tongues,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
73:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This will be their derision in the
land of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As the Israelites, then
relying on the cursed treaty which they had made with the Egyptians, continued
perverse against God, he says, &#8220;I will expose them to derision among their
confederates: they boast of the power of Egypt: they think themselves beyond the
reach of harm, as they can instantly call the Egyptians, to their aid, were any
one to oppose them, or were any enemy to invade them. Since, then, their
confidence so rests on Egypt, I will make,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the Egyptians
to regard them with scorn; and they shall not only be counted ignominious by
those who rival or envy them, but also by the friends in whom they glory. I will
give them up to every kind of dishonor among their lovers.&#8221; He indeed
compares, as we have before seen, the Egyptians as well as the Assyrians, to
lovers, and compares his people to an unfaithful wife, who, having deserted her
husband, prostitutes her own chastity. &#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;sellest thyself to thy lovers, and strives to please them, and faintest
and adornest thyself to allure them: I will cover thee all over with everything
disgraceful and ignominious, that thy lovers shall abhor thy very sight.&#8221;
So also in this place, he says that the Israelites shall be for derision in the
land of Egypt; that is, not enemies, whom they fear, shall have them in
derision; but they shall be a laughing-stock to those who they think will be
their defenders, and through whose arms they imagine that they shall be free
from every disgrace. The eighth chapter follows.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters nearly all agree in this, that the
Prophet threatens not the kingdom of Israel, but the kingdom of Judah, at the
beginning of this chapter, because he names the house of God, which they take to
be the temple. I indeed allow, that the Prophet has spoken already, in two
places, of the kingdom of Judah, but as it were in passing. He has, it is true,
introduced some reproofs and threatening, but so that the distinction was quite
clear; and we see that he now goes to the kingdom of Judah, but in the second
verse, he names Israel, and yet continues hid discourse.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To thy
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
trumpet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.; and afterwards he adds,
<i>To me</i> shall they cry, My God; we know thee, Israel. Here, certainly, the
discourse is addressed to the ten tribes. I am therefore by no means induced to
explain the beginning of the chapter by applying it to the kingdom of Judah: and
I certainly do wonder that interpreters have mistaken in a matter so trifling;
for the house of God means not only the temple, but also the whole people. As
Israel retained this boast, that they were a people holy to God, and that they
were his family, he says, &#8220;Put or set the trumpet to thy mouth, and
proclaim the war, which is now nigh at hand; for the enemy hastens, who is to
attack the house of God, that is, this holy people, who cover themselves with
the name of God, and who, trusting in their election and adoption, think that
they shall be free from all evils; war
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall come as an
eagle</i></font><font face="Palatino"> against this house of
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Had the Prophet added any thing which could be
referred peculiarly to the kingdom of Judah, I should willingly accede to their
opinion, who think that the house of God is the sanctuary. But let the whole
context be read, and any one may easily perceive, that the Prophet speaks of
Israel no less in the first verse than in the second and third. For, as it has
been said, he lays down no difference, but pursues throughout his teaching or
discourse in the same strain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A trumpet to thy
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, &#8220;Set to thy mouth the
trumpet.&#8221; It is an exhibition, (hypotyposis;) for we know that God, in
order to affect more powerfully the people, clothes his Prophets with various
characters. The Prophet then is introduced here as a herald who proclaims war,
or a messenger, or by whatever name you may be pleased to call him. Here then
the Prophet is commanded, not to speak with his mouth, but to show by the
trumpet that war was nigh, as though God himself by his trumpet declared war
against Israel, which was to be carried on soon after by earthly enemies. The
enemies were soon after to come, and the herald was to come in the usual manner
to declare war. The Greeks call them
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">khrrukev</font><font face="Palatino">,
proclaimers, we says &#8220;Les heraux&#8221;. As these earthly kings have their
proclaimers, or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">khrukev</font><font face="Palatino">,
or heralds, or messengers, who proclaim war; so the Lord sends his Prophet with
the usual charge to declare war: &#8220;Go then, and let the Israelites know,
not now by thy mouth, but even by thy throat, by the sound of the trumpet, that
I am an enemy to them, and that I am present with a strong army to destroy
them.&#8221; It is indeed certain that the Prophet did not use a trumpet; but
the Lord by this representations as I have already said increased the reality of
what was taught that the Israelites might perceive, that it was not in sport or
in play that the Prophet threatened them, but that it was done seriously, as
though they now saw the heralds who was to proclaim war; for this was not
usually done except when the army is already prepared for
battle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As an eagle against the house of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We have already said what the
Prophet means by the house of Jehovah, even that people who thought that they
would be exempt from every evil, because they had been adopted by the Lord.
Hence the Israelites called themselves God&#8217;s household; and though under
this cover, they impiously and profanely abandoned themselves to every kind of
turpitude, yet they thought that they were on the best of terms with God
himself. &#8220;There shall come,&#8221; he says, &#8220;a common ruin to you
all; this boasting shall not prevent me from taking vengeance at last on your
sins.&#8221; But he adds </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As an
eagle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that the Israelites might not
think that there was to be a long delay; for the impious procrastinate, when
they see any danger at hand. Hence, that the Israelites might not continue
torpid in their vices, the Prophet says, that the destruction of which he spoke
would be like the eagle; for in a moment the eagle goes over an immense
distance, and we wonder when we see it over our heads, though a little before it
did not appear. So also the Prophet says, that destruction, though not yet seen,
was however nigh at hand, that being smitten with terror, though now late, yet
as the Lord was thus urging them, they might return to him.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
continues daily to restore us to thyself, both by scourges and by thy word,
though we cease not to go astray after sinful desires, &#8212; O grant, that by
the direction of thy Spirit, we may at length so return to thee, that we may
never afterwards fall away, but be preserved in pure and true obedience, and
thus constantly continue in the pure worship of thy majesty and in true,
obedience, that after this life past, we may at last reach that blessed rest,
which is reserved for us in heaven, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
TWENTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We were not able yesterday to complete the first
verse of the eighth chapter. It then remains for us to consider the latter
clause, in which the Prophet expresses the cause of the war which he had
previously proclaimed by God&#8217;s command. He says, that the Israelites had
transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and conducted themselves perfidiously
against his law. He repeats the same thing twice, for the covenant and the law
are synonymous; only the word, law, in my view, is added as explanatory, as
though he had said, that they had violated the covenant of the Lord, which had
been sanctioned or sealed by the law. God then had made a covenant with Israel,
which he designed to be comprehended in the tables. Since then it was not
unknown to the Israelites what they owed to God, they were covenant-breakers. It
was then the doubling of their crime, as the Prophet shows, that they had not
fallen through mistake when they transgressed the covenant of the Lord, for they
had been more than sufficiently taught by the law what faith and what purity the
Lord required of them: at the same time, the covenant which the Lord so openly
made with them was yet neglected. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">By the Prophet saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To me shall they
cry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> some understand that the Israelites
are blamed for not fleeing to God; and they thus explain the Prophet&#8217;s
words, &#8220;They ought to have cried to me.&#8221; It seems to others to be an
exhortation, &#8220;Let the Israelites now cry to me.&#8221; But I take the
words simply as they are, that is that God here again touches the dissimulation
of the Israelites, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will cry
to me, We know thee&#8221;; and to this the ready answer is &#8220;Israel has
cast away good far from himself; the enemy shall pursue
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I thus join together the two
verses; for in the former the Lord relates what they would do, and what the
Israelites had already begun to do; and in the latter verse he shows that their
labour would be in vain, because they ever cherished wickedness in their hearts,
and falsely pretended the name of God, as it has been previously observed, even
in their prayers.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

confidently profess the name of God, and with a lofty air affirm that they are
God&#8217;s people; but God laughs to scorn all this boasting, as it is vain,
and worthy of derision. They will then cry to me; and then he imitates their
cries, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My God, we know
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When hypocrites, as if they were
the friends of God, cover themselves with his shadow, and profess to act under
his guardianship, and also boast at the same time of their knowledge of true
doctrine, and boast of faith and of the worship of God; be it so, he says, that
these cries are uttered by their mouths, yet facts speak differently, and
reprove and expose their hypocrisy. We now then see how these two verses are
connected together, and what is the Prophet&#8217;s object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jnz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zanech,</i> means &#8220;to remove far off,&#8221; and &#8220;to throw to a
distance;&#8221; and sometimes, as some think, &#8220;to detest.&#8221; There is
here, I doubt not, an implied contrast between the rejection of good and the
pursuing of which the Prophet speaks afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel has driven good far from
himsel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>f;</i> some expound
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thub, </i>of God himself, as if it was of the masculine gender: but the
Prophet, I have no doubt, simply accuses the Israelites of having receded from
all justice and uprightness; yea, of having driven far off every thing right and
just.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israeli</i></font><font face="Palatino">

repelling and pursuing, as though the prophet said, that the Israelites had by
their defection obtained this, that the enemy would now seize them. There is
then no better defense for us against all harms than attention to piety and
justice; but when integrity is banished from us, then we are exposed to all
evils, for we are deprived of the aid of God. We then see how beautifully the
Prophet compares these two things &#8212; the rejection of good by Israel
&#8212; and their pursuit by their enemies. He then adds

which he reprobates the perfidy and impious perverseness of the people, &#8212;
they had, against the will of God, framed a religion for themselves, &#8212; and
they had instituted a new kingdom. The salvation of that people, we know, was,
as it were, founded on a certain kingdom and priesthood; and by these two things
God testified that he was allied to the children of Abraham. We know where the
happiness of the godly is deposited, even in Christ; for Christ is to us the
fulness of a blessed life, because he is a king and a priest. Hence I have said,
that through a certain kingdom and priesthood did the favor of God towards the
people then shine forth. Now when the Israelites overturned the kingdom, which
God by his own authority instituted, and when they corrupted and adulterated the
priesthood, did they not, as it were, designedly extinguish the favor of God,
and strive to annihilate whatever was needful for their salvation? This then is
what the Prophet now speaks of, that is, that the Israelites in changing the
kingdom and priesthood had undermined the whole appointment of God, and openly
showed that they were unwilling to be ruled by God&#8217;s hand; for they would
have never dared to turn asides even in the least degree, from the kingdom of
David, nor would they have dared to set up a new and spurious priesthood, if any
particle of the fear of God had prevailed in their hearts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the design of the Prophet, which
interpreters have not sufficiently considered; for some refer this to the
covenants, as it seemed strange to them, that the Israelites should be so
severely reproved for setting up Jeroboam as their king, since Ahijah the
Shilonite had already declared by God&#8217;s command, that it would be so. But
they attend not sufficiently to what the Prophet had in view; for, as I have
already said, when God instituted the priesthood, there shone forth in it the
image of Christ the Mediator, whose office it is, to intercede with God that he
might reconcile him to men; and then in the person of David shone forth also the
kingdom of Christ. Now when the people tumultuously chose a new king for
themselves without any command from God, and when they built for themselves a
new temple and altar contrary to what the law prescribed, and when they divided
the priesthood, was not all this a manifest corruption, a denial of religion? It
is hence evident that the Israelites were in both these respects apostates; for
they forsook God in two ways, &#8212; first, by separating from the house of
David, &#8212; and then by forming for themselves a strange worship, which God
had not commanded in his law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the first, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have caused to reign, but
not through me; they have instituted a government, and I knew it
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, without my consent; for
God is said not to know what he does not approve, or that concerning which he is
not consulted. But some one may object and say, that God knew of the new kingdom
since he was the founder of it. To this the answer is, that God so works, that
this pretext does not yet excuse the ungodly, since they aim at something else,
rather than to execute his purpose. As for instance, God designed to prove the
patience of his servant Job: the robbers who took away his property, were they
excusable? By no means. For what was their object, but to enrich themselves by
injustice and plunder? Since then they purchased their advantage at the expense
of another, and unjustly robbed a man who had never injured them, they were
destitute of every excuse. The Lord, however, did in the meantime execute by
them what he had appointed, and what he had already permitted Satan to do. He
intended, as it has been said, that his servant should be plundered; and Satan,
who influenced the robbers, could not himself move a finger except by the
permission of God; nay, except it was commanded him. At the same time, the Lord
had nothing in common or in connection with the wicked, because his purpose was
far apart from their depraved lust. So also it must be said of what is said here
by the Prophet. As God intended to punish Solomon, so he took away the ten
tribes. He indeed suffered Solomon to reign to the end of his days, and to
retain the government of the kingdom; but Rehoboam, who succeeded him, lost the
ten tribes. This did not happen by chance; for God had so decreed; yea, he had
declared that it would be so. He sent Ahijah the Shilonite to offer the kingdom
to Jeroboam, who had dreamt of nothing of the kind. God then ruled the whole by
his own secret counsel, that the ten tribes should desert their allegiance to
Rehoboam, and that Jeroboam, being made king, should possess the greater part of
the kingdom. This, I say, was done by God&#8217;s decree: but yet the people did
not think that they were obeying God in revolting from Rehoboam, for they
desired some relaxation, when they saw that the young king wished tyrannically
to oppress them; hence they chose to themselves a new king. But they ought to
have endured every wrong rather than to deprive themselves of that inestimable
blessing, of which God gave them a symbol and pledge in the kingdom of David;
for David, as it has been said, did not reign as a common king, but was a type
of Christ, and God had promised his favor to the people as long as his kingdom
flourished, as though Christ did then dwell in the midst of the people. When
therefore the people shook off the yoke of David, it was the same as if they had
rejected Christ himself because Christ in his type was
despised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how base was the conduct of the people
in joining themselves to Jeroboam. For that sedition was not merely a proof of
levity, as some people do often rashly upset the state of things; it was not
merely a rash levity, but an impious denial of God&#8217;s favor, the same as if
they had rejected Christ himself. They had also, in this way, torn themselves
from the body of the Church; and though the kingdom of Israel surpassed the
kingdom of Judah in wealth and power, it yet became like a putrid member, for
the whole soundness depended on the head, from which the ten tribes had cut
themselves off. We now then see why the Prophet so sharply expostulates with the
Israelites for setting up a kingdom, but not through God; and solved also is the
question, how God here declares that was not through him, which yet he had
determined and testified by the mouth of his prophet, Ahijah the Shilonite; that
is, that God, as it has been said, had not given a command to the people, nor
permitted the people to withdraw themselves from their allegiance to Rehoboam.
God then denies that kingdom, with respect to the people, was set up by his
decree; and he says that what was done was this, &#8212; that the people made a
king without consulting him; for the people ought to have attended to what
pleased him, to what the Lord himself conceded; this they did not, but suddenly
followed their own blind impulse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this place is worthy of being observed; for we
hence learn that the same thing is done and not done by the Lord. Foolish men at
this day, not versed in the Scripture, excite great commotions among us about
the providence of God; yea, there are many rabid dogs who bark at us, because we
say, (what even Scripture teaches everywhere,) that nothing is done except by
the ordination and secret counsel of God, and that whatever is carried on in
this world is governed by his hand. &#8220;How so? Is God, then a murderer? Is
God, then a thief? Or, in other words, are slaughters, thefts, and all kinds of
wickedness, to be imputed to him?&#8221; These men show, while they would be
deemed acute, how stupid they are, and also how absurd; nay, rather what mad
wild beasts they are. For the Prophet here shows that the same thing was done
and not done by the Lord, but in a different way. God here expressly denies that
Jeroboam was created king by him; on the other hand, by referring to sacred
history, it appears that Jeroboam was created king, not by the suffrages of the
people, but by the command of God; for no such thing had yet entered the mind of
the people, when Ahijah was bidden to go to Jeroboam; and he himself did not
aspire to the kingdom, no ambition impelled him; he remained quiet as a private
man, and the Lord stirred him up and said, &#8220;I will have thee to
reign.&#8221; The people knew nothing of these things. After it was done, who
could have denied but that Jeroboam was set on the throne, as it were, by the
hand of God? All this is true; but with are regard to the people, he was not
created by God a king. Why? Because the Lord had commanded David and his
posterity to reign perpetually. We hence see that all things done in the world
are so disposed by the secret counsel of God, that he regulates whatever the
ungodly attempts and whatever even Satan tries to do, and yet he remains just;
and it avails nothing to lessen the fault of evils when they say, that all
things are governed by the secret counsel of God. With regard to themselves,
they know what the Lord enjoins in his law; let them follow that rule: when they
deviate from it, there is no ground for them to excuse themselves and say that
they have obeyed God; for their design is ever to be regarded. We hence see how
the Israelites appointed a king, but not by God; for it was sedition that
impelled them, when, at the same time, the law enjoined that they should choose
no one as a king except him who had been elected by God; and he had marked out
the posterity of David, and designed that they should occupy the royal throne
till the coming of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows the other charge, &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they made to themselves idols
from their gold and from their silver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>God here complains that his worship was not only fallen into decay, but that
it was also wholly corrupted by superstitions. It was an impiety not to be
borne, that the people had desired a new king for themselves; but it was the
summit of all evils, when the Israelites converted their gold and their silver
into idols. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
made,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their gold and silver
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;I destined the
gold and the silver, with which they have been enriched, for very different
purposes. When, therefore, I was liberal to them, they abused my kindness, and
from their gold and their silver they made to themselves idols or gods.&#8221;
Here, then, the Prophet, by implication, sharply reproves the blind madness of
the people, that they made to themselves gods of corruptible things, which
ought, in the meantime, to be serviceable to them; for to what purpose is money
given us by the Lord, but for our daily use? Since, then, the Lord has destined
gold and silver for our service, what frenzy it is when men work them into gods
for themselves! But this main point must be ever remembered, that the
Israelites, in all things, betrayed their own defection; for they hesitated not
to overthrow the kingdom which God had instituted for their salvation, and they
dared to pervert the whole worship of God, together with the priesthood, by
introducing new superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a denunciation of punishment &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore Israel shall be cut
off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Were any, indeed, to object and say that
God was too rigid, there would be no reason for such an objection; for they had
betrayed and violated their pledged faith, and by condemning and treading under
foot both the kingdom and priesthood, they had rejected his favor. We hence see
that the Prophet threatens them now with deserved destruction. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on with the same subject; for he
shows that Israel perished through their own fault, and that the crime, or the
cause of destruction, could not be transferred to any other. There is some
ambiguity in the words, which does note however, obscure the sense; for whether
we read <i>calf</i> in the objective case, or say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy calf has removed thee far
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it will be the same. Some say,
&#8220;has forsaken thee,&#8221; as they do above, &#8220;Israel has forsaken
good;&#8221; but the sense of throwing away is to be preferred. Thy calf, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Samaria, has cast thee
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, &#8220;The Lord has cast far
off thy calf.&#8221; If we read <i>thy calf</i> in the &#8220;objective&#8221;
case, then the Prophet denounces destruction not only on the Israelites, but
also on the calf in which they hoped. But the probable exposition is, that the
calf had removed far off&#8221;, or driven far Samaria or the people of Samaria;
and this, I have no doubt, is the meaning of the words; for the Prophet, to
confirm his previous doctrine, seems to remind the Israelites again, that the
cause of their destruction was not anywhere to be sought but in their
wickedness, and especially because they, having forsaken the true God, had made
an idol for themselves, and formed the calf to be in the place of God. Now, it
was a stupidity extremely gross and perverse, that having experienced, through
so many miracles, the infinite power and goodness of God, they should yet have
betaken themselves to a dead thing. They forged for themselves a calf! Must they
not have been moved, as it were, by a prodigious madness, when they did thus
fall away from the true God, who had so often and so wonderfully made himself
known to them?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence God says now
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy calf O
Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is &#8220;The captivity

land, that it might be to thee a quiet heritage to the end; but thy calf has not
suffered thee to rest here. The land of Canaan was indeed thy heritage, as it
was also the Lord&#8217;s heritage; but after God has been banished, and the
calf has been introduced in his place, by what right can you now remain in the
possession of it? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy

the mouth of the ungodly, that they could not object that the severity which he
so rigidly exercised towards them was immoderate. He refutes their calumnies by
saying, that he had patiently borne with them, and was still bearing with them.

<div><font face="Palatino">The beginning of this verse is not rightly explained,
as I thinks by those who so connect the pronoun demonstrative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eva,</i> as if it had an interposed copulative; and this ought to be noticed,
for it gives a great emphasis to the Prophet&#8217;s words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even this is from
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But what does the Prophet mean?
He means this, that the calf was from Israel, as they had long before, at the
beginning, formed to themselves a calf in the desert. But we do not yet clearly
apprehend the mind of the Prophet, unless we perceive that there is here an
implied comparison. For he accuses the Israelites of being the first founders of
this superstition, and that they had not been, as it were, deceived by others;
for they had not borrowed this corruption from the Gentiles, as it had been at
times the case; but it was, so to speak, an intrinsic invention.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says, <i>it is;</i> that is,
&#8220;I find that you are now the second time the fabricators of this impious
superstition. Could your fathers, when they forged a calf for themselves in the
desert, make excuse (as they did) and say, that they were led by the faith of
others? Could they plead that this cause of offence was presented to them by the
Gentiles, and that they were ensnared, as it often happens, when some draw
others into error? By no means. As then your fathers, when no one tempted them
to superstition, became the founders of this new superstition through their own
inclination, and, as it were through the instigation of the devil, so this calf
is the second time from Israel, for ye cannot otherwise account for its origin,
ye cannot transfer the fault to other nations; within, within,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;has this evil been generated.&#8221; We now perceive the meaning of the
Prophet, which is, that this superstition was not derived from others, but that
Israel, under the influence of no evil persuader, had devised for themselves, of
their own accord, this corruption, through which they had departed from the true
and pure worship of God. It ia indeed true, that oxen and calves were worshipped
in Egypt, and the same also might be said of other nations; but rivalship did
not influence the people of Israel. What then? It cannot certainly be denied,
but that they had stimulated themselves to this impious denial of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same thing may be brought against the Papists of
this day; that is, that the filthy mass of superstitions, by which the whole
worship of God ia corrupted by them, has been produced by themselves. If they
object and say, that they have borrowed many rites from the heathens: this is
indeed true; but was it the imitation of heathens which led them to these wicked
inventions? By no means, but their own lust has led them astray; for being not
content with the simple word of God, they have devised for themselves strange
and spurious modes of worship; and afterwards additions were made according to
the caprices of individuals: thus it has happened, that they are sunk in the
deepest gulf. Whence then have the Papists so many patrons, on whom relying,
then despise Christ the Mediator? Even because they have adopted them for
themselves. Whence also have they so many ungodly ceremonies, by which they
pervert the worship of God? Even because they have fabricated them for
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how grievous was the accusation, that
the calf was even from Israel. &#8220;There ia no reason then&#8221;, the Lord
says, &#8220;for you to say that you have been deceived by bad examples, like
those who are mixed with profane heathens and contract their vices, as contagion
creeps in easily among men, for they are by nature prone to vice; there is no
reason,&#8221; he says, &#8220;for any one to make an objection of this
kind.&#8221; Why? &#8220;Because the calf your fathers made for themselves in
the desert was from Israel; and this calf also is from Israel, for it was not
thrust upon you by others, but Jeroboam, your king, made it for you, and you
willingly and applaudingly received it.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
workman</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made it, and it is not
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet derides the
stupidity o&uacute; the people; and there are many other like places, which
occur everywhere, especially in the Prophets, in which God reprobates this
madness of having recourse to modes of worship so absurd. For what is more
contrary to reason than for man to prostrate himself before a dead piece of wood
or before a atone, and to seek salvation from it? The unbelieving indeed put on
their guises and say that they seek God in heaven, and, because idols and images
are types of God, that they come to him through them; but yet what they do
appears evident. These pretencea are then altogether vain, for their stupidity
is openly seen, when they thus bend their knees before a wood or stone. Hence
the Prophet here inveighs against this senseless stupidity, because man had made
the idol. &#8220;Can a mortal man make a god? Ye do certainly ascribe divinity
to the calf; is this in the power of the workman? Man has not bestowed life on
himself, and cannot for one moment preserve that life which he has obtained at
the pleasure of another; how then can he make a god from wood or stone? What
sort of madness is this?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is not God, for in fragments
shall be the calf of Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet shows here from the event, how there was no power or no divinity in the
calf, because it was to be reduced<i> to fragments.</i> The event then would at
length show how madly the Israelites played the fool, when they formed to
themselves a calf, to be as it were the symbol of the divine presence. We now
see what the Prophet means: for he enhances the sin of Israel, because they had
not been enticed by others to depart from the pure and genuine worship of God,
but they had been their own deceivers. This is the meaning. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here shows by another figure how
unprofitably the Israelites exercised themselves in their perverted worship, and
then how vainly they excused their superstitions. And this reproof is very
necessary also in the present day. For we see that hypocrites, a hundred times
convicted, will not yet cease to clamour something: in short, they cannot bear
to be conquered; even when their conscience reproves them, they will still dare
to vomit forth their virulence against God. They will also dare to bring forward
vain pretences: hence the Prophet says, that they have sown the wind, and that
they shall reap the whirlwind. It is an appropriate metaphor; for they shall
receive a harvest suitable to the sowing. The seed is cast on the earth, and
afterwards the harvest is gathered:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
sown</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wind, they shall then gather

the wind is nothing else than to put on some appearance to dazzle the eyes of
the simple, and by craft and guise of words to cover their own impiety. When one
then casts his hand, he seems to throw seed on the earth, but yet he sows the
wind. So also hypocrites have their displays, and set themselves in order, that
they may appear wholly like the pious worshipers of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the design of the Prophet&#8217;s
metaphor, when he says that they sow the wind, is to show this, that though they
differ nothing from the true worshippers of God in outward appearance, they yet
sow nothing but wind; for when the Israelites offered their sacrifices in the
temple, they no doubt conformed to the rule of the law, but at the same time
came short of obedience to God. There was no faith in their services: it was
then wind; that is, they had nothing but a windy and an empty show, though the
outward aspect of their service differed nothing from the true and legitimate
worship of God. They then sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. But we cannot
finish to-day.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since the rule
of thy true and lawful worship is sufficiently known to us, and thou continues
to exhort us to persevere in our course, and to abide in that pure and simple
worship which thou hast fully approved, &#8212; O grant, that we may, in true
obedience of faith, respond to thee: and though we now see the whole world
carried here and there, and all places full of the awful examples of apostacy,
and so much madness everywhere prevailing, that men become more and more
hardened daily, &#8212; O grant, that, being fortified by invincible faith
against these so many temptations, we may persevere in true religion, and never
at any time turn aside from the teaching of thy word, until we be at length
gathered to Christ our King, under whom, as our head, thou hast promised that we
shall ever be safe, and until we attain that happy life which is laid up for us
in heaven, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
TWENTY-SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We were not able in the last lecture to finish what
the Prophet has said in the seventh verse; that is, that whatever hope the
Israelites entertained would be deceptive and fruitless; for they imagined many
deliverances as arising from nothing. He had before condemned their wandering
and perverse circuitous courses, now flying to Egypt, then to Assyria, in order
to seek assistance, and at the same time overlooking and neglecting God. He
therefore says now, that they would have to gather fruit corresponding with what
was sown: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They had sown the wind,
they shall reap</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
whirlwind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And by this figure he
signifies that their confidence was vain, that their counsels were
frivolous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that there would be no stalk; and
pursuing the same similitude, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The bud shall yield no meal; if
so be it yields, strangers shall swallow it
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning is, that the Israelites
went astray in their counsels, and had nothing real; it was the same as if one
had sown the wind. Then follows the harvest of the whirlwind; for their seed
would not spring up, no corn would grow which would yield meal; but if their
counsels attained any fruit, or if they reaped any thing, strangers would devour
it; for the Lord would at length cause that their enemies would scatter whatever
they thought that they had attained. It further follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He uses the same word as before when he spake of the
meal, and says, that not only the provision of Israel shall be devoured, but
also the people themselves; and he upbraids the Israelites with their miseries,
that they might at length acknowledge God to be adverse to them. For the
Prophet&#8217;s object was this &#8212; to make them feel their evils, that they
might at length humble themselves and learn suppliantly to pray for pardon. For
it is a great wisdom, when we so far profit under God&#8217;s scourges, that our
sins come before our eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel is devoured and is like a
cast off vessel, even among the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> when yet that people excelled
the rest of the world, as the Lord had chosen them for himself. As they were a
peculiar people, they were superior to other nations; and then they were set
apart for this end, that they might have nothing in common with the Gentiles.
But he says now that this people is dispersed, and everywhere despised and cast
off. This could not have been, except God had taken away his protection. We
hence see that the Prophet had this one thing in view &#8212; to make the
Israelites feel that God was angry with them. It now follows</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the Prophet derides all the labour the
people had undertaken to exempt themselves from punishment. For though
hypocrites dare not openly and avowedly to fight against God, yet they seek vain
subterfuges, by which they may elude him. So the Israelites ceased not to weary
themselves to escape the judgment of God; and this folly, or rather madness, the
Prophet exposes to scorn. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
have gone up to Assyria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a wild ass alone; Ephraim had
hired lovers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In the first clause he
indirectly reprobates the brutish wildness of the people, as though he said,
&#8220;They are like the wild animals of the wood, which can by no means be
tamed.&#8221; And Jeremiah uses this very same similitude, when he complains of
the people as being led away by their own indomitable lust, being like the wild
ass, who, snuffing the wind, betakes himself, in his usual manner, to a
precipitant course,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:24.) Probably he touches also, in an indirect way, on the unbelief of the
people in having despised the protection of God; for the people ought not to
have thus hastened to Assyria, as if they were destitute of every help, because
they knew that they were protected by the hand of God. And the Prophet here
reproves them for regarding as nothing that help which the Lord had promised,
and which he was really prepared to afford, had not the Israelites betaken
themselves elsewhere. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim, as a wild ass, has gone
up to Assyria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> he perceived not that he
would be secure and safe, provided he sheltered himself under the shadow of the
hand of his God; but as if God could do nothing, he retook himself to the
Assyrians: this was ingratitude. And then he again takes up the similitude which
we have before noticed, that the people of Israel had shamefully and wickedly
departed from the marriage-covenant which God had made with them: for God, we
know, was to the Israelites in the place of a husband, and had pledged his faith
to them; but when they transferred themselves to another, they were like
unchaste women, who prostitute themselves to adulterers, and desert their own
husbands. Hence the Prophet again reproves the Israelites for having violated
their faith pledged to God, and for being like adulterous women. He indeed goes
farther, and says, that they hired adulterers for wages. Unchaste women are
usually enticed by the charms of gain; for when adulterers wish to corrupt a
woman, they offer gifts, they offer money. He says that this practice was
inverted; and the same thing is expressed by the Prophet Ezekiel; who, after
having stated that women are usually corrupted by having some gain or some
advantage proposed to them, adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;But thou wastest
thine own property, and settest not thyself to hire, but on the contrary thou
hirest
wantons,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261631&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
16:31-33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So the Prophet speaks here, though more briefly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has hired
lovers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though they have hired among the
nations, now will I gather them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This
place may be variously expounded. The commonly received explanation is, that God
would gather the hired nations against Israel; but I would rather refer it to
the people themselves. But it admits of a twofold sense: the first is, that the
great forces which the people has on every side acquired for themselves, would
not prevent God from destroying them; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;bq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kobets,</i> which they render, &#8220;to gather,&#8221; often means in Hebrew
to throw by a slaughter into an heap, as we say in French, <i>Trousser,</i> (to
bundle.) And this meaning would be very suitable &#8212; that though they
extended themselves far and wide, by gathering forces on every side, they would
yet be collected in another way, for they would be brought together into a heap.
The second sense is this &#8212; that when Israel should be drawn away to the
Gentiles, the Lord would gather him; as though he said, &#8220;Israel burns with
mad lusts, and runs here and there among the Gentiles; this heat is nothing else
than dispersion; it is the same as if he designedly wished to destroy the unity
in which his safety consists; but I will yet gather him against his will; that
is, preserve him for a time.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall grieve a little for
the burden of the king and princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
word which the Prophet uses interpreters expound in two ways. Some derive
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wljy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ichelu, </i>from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chel</i>, and others from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chelal</i>, which means, &#8220;to begin;&#8221; and therefore give this
rendering, &#8220;They shall begin with the burden of the king and
princes;&#8221; that is, They shall begin to be burdened by the king and
princes. Others offer this version, &#8220;They shall grieve a little for the
burden of the king and princes;&#8221; that is, They shall be tributaries before
the enemies shall bring them into exile; and this will be a moderate
grief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the first interpretation which I have mentioned be
approved, then there is here a comparison between the scourges with which God at
first gently chastised the people, and the last punishment which he was at
length constrained to inflict on them; as though he said, &#8220;They complain
of being burdened by tributes; it is nothing, or at least it is nothing so
grievous, in comparison with the dire future grief which their last destruction
will bring with it.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this clause may well be joined with that
mitigation which I have briefly explained, and that is, that when the people had
willingly dispersed themselves, they had been preserved beyond expectation, so
that they did not immediately perish; for they would have run headlong into
destruction, had not God interposed an hindrance. Thus the two verses are to be
read conjointly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They ascended
into Assyria as a wild ass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
&#8220;They showed their unnameable and wild disposition, when thus
unrestrainedly carried away; and then they offer me a grievous insult; for as if
they were destitute of my help, they run to the profane Gentiles, and esteem as
nothing my power, which would have been ready to help them, had they depended on
me, and placed their salvation in my hand.&#8221; He then reproaches their
perfidy, that they were like unchaste women, who leave their husbands, and
abandon themselves to lewdness. Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though they do
this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, &#8220;Though having
despised my aid, they seek deliverance from the profane Gentiles, and though
they despise me, and choose to submit themselves to adulterers rather than to
keep their conjugal faith with me,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will yet gather
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> when thus dispersed.&#8221; The
Lord here enhances the sin of the people; for he did not immediately punish
their ingratitude and wickedness, but deferred doing so for a time; and in his
kindness he would have led them to repentance, had not their madness been wholly
incurable:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they thus hire among
the Gentiles, I will yet gather them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
that is, &#8220;preserve them;&#8221; and for what purpose? That they may grieve
a little, and that is, that they may not wholly perish, as persons running
headlong into utter ruin; for they seemed designedly to seek their last
destruction, when they were thus wilfully and violently carried away to profane
nations. That is indeed a most dreadful tearing of the body, which cannot be
otherwise than fatal.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> They
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> however,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grieve a
little</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;I will so act,
that they may by degrees return to me, even by the means of moderate
grief.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see more clearly why the Prophet said, that
this grief would be small, which was to be from the burden of the king and
princes. It was designed by the Israelites to excite the Assyrians immediately
to war; and this would have turned out to their destruction, as it did at last;
but the Lord suspended his vengeance, and at the same time mitigated their
grief, when they were made tributaries. The king and his counsellors were
constrained to exact great tributes; the people then grieved: but they had no
other than a moderate grief, that they might consider their sins and return to
the Lord; yet all this was without any fruit. Hence the less excusable was the
obstinacy of the people. We now perceive what the Prophet meant. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again inveighs against the idolatry
of the people, which was, however, counted then the best religion; for the
Israelites, as it has been said were become hardened in their superstitions, and
had long before fallen away from the pure and lawful worship of God. And we
know, that where error has once prevailed, it attains firmness by length of
time: hence the Israelites had become hardened in their perverted and fictitious
worship. They thought that they did the most meritorious deed whenever they
sacrificed, while at the same time, they provoked in this way the wrath of God
more and more against themselves. And as they had become thus hardened, the
Prophet says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
multiplied for themselves altars for the purpose of
sinning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that there would be altars for
them to sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It was (as I have already
said) most difficult to persuade theme that their altars were for the purpose of
sinnings and that the more attentive they were in worshipping God, the more
grievously they sinned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see how Papists of this day glory in their
abominations. It is certain that they do nothing but what is accursed before
God; for there reigns among them every kind of filthiness, and there is no
purity whatever: they therefore continue to offend God as it were designedly.
Put at the same time it is their highest holiness to multiply altars: the same
also was the prevailing error in the Prophet&#8217;s time. This was the reason
why he said, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>altars were
multiplied in order to sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Who at this
day can persuade the Papists, that many chapels as they build, are so many sins
by which they provoke the wrath of God? But the faithful ought to be content,
not with one altar, (for there is now no need of an altar,) but they ought to be
content with a common table. The Papists, on the contrary, build altars to
themselves without end, where they sacrifice; and they think that God is thus
bound to them as by so many chains: as many chapels as are under the papacy are,
they think, so many holds for God, (<i>dei carceres,</i>) and that God is there
held inclosed. But if any one should say, that so many fiends (<i>Diabolos</i>)
dwell in such places, we know how furiously angry they would
be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then no superfluous repetition, when the
Prophet says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>altars were
multiplied in order to sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that altars would be for
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for in the second clause, he speaks
of the punishment which God would inflict on superstitious men. In the first
clause, he shows that their good intentions were frivolous, and that they were
greatly deceived, when at their pleasure they devised for themselves various
forms of worship. This is one thing. Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall then be to them
altars to sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as they would not
willingly repent, nor embrace salutary admonitions, God would at last really
show how much he valued what they called their good intentions; for now a
dreadful vengeance was at hand, which would prove to them, that in increasing
altars, they did nothing else but increase sins. It then follows
&#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here briefly, how we ought to judge
of divine worship, and thus intends to cut off the handle from all devices, by
which men usually deceive themselves, and form disguises, when at any time they
are reproved. For he sets the law of God, and the rule it prescribes, in
opposition to all the inventions of men. Men think God unjust, except he
receives as good and legitimate whatever they imagine to be so; but God, as it
is said in another place, prefers obedience to all sacrifices. Hence the Prophet
now declares, that all the superstitions, which then prevailed among the people
of Israel, were condemned before God; for they obeyed not the law, but had
spurious and perverted modes of worship, which they had invented for themselves.
We then see the connection of what the Prophet says: he had said in the last
verse, that they had multiplied altars for the purpose of sinning; but so great,
as I have said, was the obstinacy of the people, that they would by no means
bear this to be told to them; he then adds in the person of God, that his law
had been given them, and that they had departed from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see, that there is no need of using many
words in contending with the superstitious, who daringly devise various kinds of
worship, and wholly different from what God commands; for they are to be
distinctly pressed with this one thing, that obedience is of more account with
God than sacrifices, and further, that there is a certain rule contained in the
law, and that God not only bids us to worship him, but also teaches us the way,
from which it is not lawful to depart. Since, then, the will of God is known and
made plain, why should we now dispute with men, who close their eyes and
wilfully turn aside, and deign not to pay any regard to God?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
written</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then, the Lord says: and to give this
truth more weight, he introduces God as the speaker. It would have indeed been
enough to say, &#8220;God has delivered to you his law, why should you not seek
knowledge from this law, rather than from your own carnal judgment? Why do you
wish thus licentiously to wander, as if no restraint has been put upon
you?&#8221; But it is a more emphatical way of speaking, when God himself says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have written my law, but they
have counted it as something foreign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
that is, as if it did not belong to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had
written</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to Israel. He does not simply mention
writing, but says, that the treasure had been deposited among the people of
Israel; and the worse the people were, because they acknowledged not that so
great an honor had been conferred on them, for this was their peculiar
inheritance. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have written then
my law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8220;and I have not written it
indiscriminately for all, but have written it for my elect people; but they have
counted it as something extraneous.&#8221; For the word may be rendered in

written to you my law,&#8221; the legislator himself was doubtless worthy, to
whom all ought to submit with the greatest reverence, and to form their whole
life according to his will; but the Lord here extols his own law by a splendid
eulogy, and this he does to repress the wickedness of men, who obscure its
dignity and excellency: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have

them for having counted it as something extraneous. It then follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters think that the Israelites are here
derided because they trusted in their own ceremonies, and that their sacrifices
are reproachfully called flesh. But we must see whether the words of the Prophet
contain something deeper. For the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bhbh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ebeb,</i> some rightly expound, in my judgment, as meaning
&#8220;sacrifices,&#8221; either burnt or roasted; it is a word of four letters.
Others derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bhy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ieb,</i> which signifies &#8220;to give gifts;&#8221; and hence they render
thus, &#8220;sacrifices of my gifts;&#8221; and this is the more received
opinion. I view the Prophet here as not only blaming the Israelites for putting
vain trust in their own ceremonies, which were perverted and vicious; but also
as adducing something more gross, and by which it could be proved, that their
folly was even ridiculous, yea, to profane men and children. When we only read,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sacrifices of my
gifts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which they ought to have offered
to me, the sense seems frigid; but when we read, &#8220;The sacrifices of my
burnt-offerings! they offer flesh&#8221;, the meaning is, So palpable is their
contempt, that they cannot but be condemned even by children. How so? Because
for burnt-offerings they offer flesh to me; that is they fear lest any portion
of the sacrifices should be lost: and when they ought, when offering
burnt-sacrifices, to burn the flesh, they keep it entire, that they may stuff
themselves. Hence they make a great display in sacrificing: and yet it appears
to be palpable mockery, for they turn burnt-offerings into peace-offerings, that
the flesh may remain entire for them to eat it. And no doubt, it has ever been a
vice dominant in hypocrites to connect gain with superstitions. How much soever,
then, idolaters may show themselves to be wholly devoted to God, they yet will
take care that nothing be lost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then seems now to reprove this vice; I
yet allow that the Israelites are blamed for thinking that God is pacified by
sacrifices which were of themselves of no value, as we have had before a similar
declaration. But I join both views together &#8212; that they offered to God
vain sacrifices without piety, and then, that they offered flesh for
burnt-offerings, and thus fed themselves and cared not for the worship of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sacrifices</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of my burnt-offerings they
offer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but what do they offer?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Nor does he seem to have mentioned in vain the word flesh. Some say that all
sacrifices are here called flesh by way of contempt; but there seems rather to
me to be a contrast made between burnt sacrifices and flesh; because the people
of Israel wished to take care of themselves and to have a rich repast, when the
Lord required a burnt-offering to be presented to him: and he afterwards adds,
<i>and they eat.</i> By the word eating, he confirms what I have already said,
that is, that he here reproves in the Israelites the vice of being intent only
on cramming themselves, and of only putting forth the name of God as a vain
pretence, while they were only anxious to feed themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is the same with the Papists of our day, when they
celebrate their festivals; they indulge themselves, and think that the more they
drink and eat, the more God is bound to them. This is their zeal; they eat
flesh, and yet think that they offer sacrifices to God. They offer, then, their
stomach to God, when it is thus well filled. Such are the oblations of the
Papists. So also the Prophet now says, &#8220;They eat the flesh which they
ought to have burned.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will not accept
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here again he briefly shows, that
while hypocrites thus make pretences, they are self-deceived, and will at last
find out how vainly they have lied to God and men: &#8220;God will not accept
them.&#8221; He here repudiates, in the name of God, their sacrifices; for
whatever they might promise to themselves, it was enough that they devised for
themselves these modes of worship; for God had never commanded a word respecting
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now will he remember their
iniquity, and visit their sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet denounces a future punishment, lest hypocrites should flatter
themselves, when God&#8217;s fury is not immediately kindled against them, for
it is usual with them to abuse the patience of God. Hence Hosea now forewarns
them, and says, &#8220;Though God may connive for a time, there is yet no reason
for the Israelites to think that they shall be free from punishment: God will at
length,&#8221; he says, &#8220;remember their iniquity.&#8221; He uses a common
form of speaking, which everywhere occurs in Scripture: God is said to remember
when he really, and as with a stretched-out hand, shows himself to be an
avenger. &#8220;The Lord now spares you; but he will, in a short time, show how
much he abominates these your impure sacrifices:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
remember</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Visitation follows this
remembering, as the effect the cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
flee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, I doubt not,
intimates here, that vain would be all the escapes which the Israelites would
seek; and though God might allow them to flee to Egypt, yet it would be, he
says, without any advantage: &#8220;Go, flee to Egypt, but your flight will be
useless.&#8221; The Prophet expressed this distinctly, that the people might
know that they had to do with God, against whom they could make no defense, and
that they might no longer deceive themselves by foolish imaginations. And though
the people were blinded by so great an obstinacy, that this admonition had no
effect; yet they were thus rendered the more inexcusable. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet concludes his foregoing
observations. It is indeed probable that he preached them at various times; but,
as I have already said, the heads of the sermons which the Prophet delivered are
collected in this book, so that we may know what his teaching was. He then
discoursed daily on idolatry, on superstitions, and on the other corruptions
which then prevailed among the people; he often repeated the same threatenings,
but afterwards collected into certain chapters the things which he had spoken.
The conclusion, then, of his former teaching was this, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel had forgotten his
Maker</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> whilst for himself he had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>building
temples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He says, that he forgot his
Maker by building temples because he followed not the directions of the law. We
hence see that God will have himself to be known by his word. Israel might have
objected and said, that no such thing was intended, when he built temples in Dan
and Bethel, but that he wished by these to retain the remembrance of God. But
the Prophet here shows that God is not truly known, and that men do not really
remember him, except when they worship him according to what the law prescribes,
except when they submit themselves wholly to his word, and undertake nothing,and
attempt nothing, but what he has commanded. What then the superstitious say is
remembrance, the Prophet here plainly testifies is forgetfullness. The case is
the same at this day, when we blame the Papists for their idols; their excuse is
this, that what they set forth is in pictures and statues the image of God, and
that images, as they say, are the books of the illiterate. But what does the
Prophet answer here? That </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel
forgot his Maker</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There was an altar in
Bethel, and there Israel was wont to offer sacrifices, and they called this the
worship of God; but the Prophet shows that each worship was accursed before God,
and that it had no other effect than wholly to obliterate the holy name of God
from the minds of men, so that the whole of religion perished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Remarkable then is this passage; for the Prophet
says, that<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the people
forgot God their Maker, when they built temples for
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But what was in the temples
so vicious, as to take away the remembrance of God from the world? Even because
God would have but one temple and altar. If a reason was asked, a reason might
indeed have been given; but the people ought to have acquiesced in the command
of God. Though God may not show why he commands this or that, it is enough that
we ought to obey his word. Now, then, it appears, that when Israel built for
himself various temples, he departed from God, and for this reason, because he
followed not the rule of the law, and kept not himself within the limits of the
divine command. Hence it was to forget God. We now apprehend the object of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though then they were wont to glory in their temples,
and there to display their pomp and splendor, and proudly to delight in their
superstitions, yet the Prophet says, that they had forgotten their Creator, and
for this reason only, because they had not continued in his law. He says, that
they had forgotten God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
Maker</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Maker</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
the Prophet alludes not to God as the framer of the world and the creator of
men, but he applies it to the condition of the people. For, as we well know, the
favor of God had been peculiar towards that people; he had not only made them,
as a part of the human race, but also formed them a people to himself. Since
then God had thus intended them to be devoted to him, the Prophet here increases
and enhances their sin, when he says, that they obeyed not his word, but
followed their own devices and depraved imaginations.</font><br></div>

seasonably repent, and that we may not be drawn away after the inventions of our
flesh, nor seek ways to flee away from thee, but come straight forward to thy
presence, and make a humble, sincere, and honest confession of our sins, that
thou mayest receive us into favor, and that being reconciled to us, thou mayest

TWENTY-THIRD</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains for us to consider the second part of the
last verse of the eighth chapter, in which the Prophet blames the tribe of Judah
for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>multiplying fenced
cities.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">This was not in itself condemnable
before God; but the Prophet saw that the confidence of the people was
transferred to these cities as it usually happens. Rare indeed is the example,
when any people are well fortified, that they become not implicated in this
charge of misplaced confidence. But as this vice in the tribe of Judah was well
known, the Prophet does not here complain without reason, that they reposed
their hope on their fortified cities, and thus deprived God of his just praise.
And then he denounces a punishment.<i> I will send fire upon his cities, and it
shall devour his palaces.</i> The meaning is, that when men turn away their
minds from God, and rely on perishable things, a fatal destruction will at last
follow; for the Lord will frustrate the hope of those who thus deprive him of
his honor. This then is the meaning. Now follows the ninth
chapter.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not known at what time the Prophet delivered
this discourse, but it is enough to know that it is directed against the
obstinate wickedness of the people, because they could by no means be turned to
repentance, though their defection was, at the same time, manifest. He now
declares that God was so angry, that no success could be hoped for. And this
warning ought to be carefully noticed; for we see that hypocrites as long as God
spares or indulges them, take occasion to be secure: they think that they have
sure peace with God, when he bears with them even for a short time; and further,
except the drawn sword appears, they are never afraid. Since, then, men sleep so
securely in their vices, especially when the Lord treats them with forbearance
and kindness, the Prophet here declares, that the Israelites had no reason to
rejoice for their prosperity, or to flatter themselves under this cover, that
the Lord had not immediately taken vengeance on them; for he says, that though
all people under heaven were prosperous, yet Israel would be miserable, because
he had committed fornication against his God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoice not thou with
exultations like the people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
&#8220;Whatever prosperity may happen to thee, though God may seem propitious by
not afflicting thee, but kindly bearing with thee, &#8212; nay, though he may
bountifully nourish thee, and may seem to give thee many proofs of paternal
favor, yet there is no reason for thee to felicitate thyself, for vain will be
this joy, because an unhappy end awaits thee.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast committed fornication
he says, against thy God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This warning
was very necessary. This vice, we know, has ever prevailed among men, that they
are blind to their sins as long as the Lord spares them; and experience, at the
present day, most fully proves, that the same disease still cleaves to our
marrow. As it is so, let this passage of the Prophet awaken us, so that we may
not rejoice, though great prosperity may smile on us; but let us rather inquire,
whether God has a just cause of anger against us. Though he may not openly put
forth his hand, though he may not pursue us, we ought yet to anticipate his
wrath; for it is the proper office of faith, not only to find out from present
punishment that God is angry, but also to fear, on account of any prevailing
vices, the punishment that is far distant. Let us then learn to examine
ourselves, and to make a severe scrutiny, even when the Lord conceals his
displeasure, and visits us not for our sins. If, then, we have committed
fornication against God, all our prosperity ought to be suspected by us; for
this contempt, in abusing God&#8217;s blessings, will have to be dearly bought
by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The comparison here made is also of great weight.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As other
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> says the Prophet. He means, that
though God might pardon heathen nations, yet he would punish Israel, for less
excusable was his apostasy and rebellion in having committed fornication against
his God. That other nations wandered in their errors, was no wonder; but that
Israel should have thus cast off the yoke, and then denied his God, that he
should have broken and violated the fidelity of sacred marriage, &#8212; all
this was quite monstrous. It is then no wonder that God here declares, by the
mouth of his Prophet, that though he spared other people, he would yet inflict
just punishment on Israel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast loved a reward upon
every cornfloor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He pursues the same
metaphor, that Israel had committed fornication like an unchaste and perfidious
woman. Hence he says, that they were like harlots, who are so enticed by gain,
that they are not ashamed of their lewdness. He said yesterday, that the people
had hired lovers; but now he says, that they were led astray by the hope of
reward. These things are apparently contradictory; but their different aspect is
to be noticed. Israel hired for himself lovers, when he purchased, with a large
sum of money, a confederacy with the Assyrians; but, at the same time, when he
worshipped false gods with the hope of gain, he was like strumpets, who
prostitute their body to all kinds of filthiness, when any rewards entice
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question may be here moved, Why does the
Prophet say that the reward is meretricious, when a plenty of corn is sought
for? for he reproaches the Israelites for no other thing, but that they wished
their floors to be filled with wheat. This seems not indeed to be in itself
worthy of reproof, for who of us does not desire a fruitful increase of corn and
wine? Nay, since the Lord, among other blessings, promises to give abundance of
provision, it is certainly lawful to ask by supplications and prayers what he
promises. But the Prophet calls it a wicked reward, when what God has promised
to give is sought from idols. When therefore we depart from the one true God,
and devise for ourselves new gods to nourish us and supply our food and raiment,
we are like strumpets, who choose by lewdness to gain support, rather than to
receive it from their own husbands. This is then to be like a woman whom her
husband treats bountifully, and she casts her eyes on others, and seeks a filthy
reward from adulterers. Such are idolaters. For God offers himself freely to us,
and testifies that he will perform the part of a father and preserver; but the
greater part, despising the blessing of God, flee elsewhere, and invent for
themselves false gods, as we see to be done under the Papacy: for who are the
patrons (<i>nutricios</i> &#8212; nourishers) they implore, when either drought
or any other adverse season threatens sterility and want? They have an
innumerable multitude of gods to whom they flee. They are then strumpets who
hunt for gain from adulterers; while, at the same time, God freely promises to
be a husband to them, and to take care that nothing should be wanting. Since,
then, they are not satisfied with the blessing of God alone, it is a
meretricious lust, which is insatiable, and in itself filthy and
disgraceful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet repudiates in the
people of Israel, and that is, They hoped for a larger abundance of corn from
their idols than from the true God, as was the case with the idolaters mentioned
by Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;when we
served,&#8217; they said, &#8216;the queen of
heaven,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we abounded in wine and
corn,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
44:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They compared God with idols, and denied that they
were so well and so sumptuously provided for when they worshipped God alone.
Since, then, idolaters give honour to fictitious gods, so as to think them to be
more liberal to them than the true God, this is the reason that the Prophet now
so severely blames Israel, when he says that they loved a meretricious reward on
all the floors of wheat. It then follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God now denounces such a punishment as the Israelites
deserved. They had been drawn away, as we have said, from the pure worship of
God by allurements; they hoped for more profit from superstitions. Hence God
shows, that he would on this account punish them by taking away from them their
wine and corn, as we have already noticed in Hosea 2: for it is the only way by
which the Lord restores men to a sane mind, or at least renders them
inexcusable, to deprive them of his blessings. The harlot, as long as gain is to
be had, as long as she surpasses all honest and chaste matrons in her dress and
mode of living, is pleased with herself and blinded by her own splendour; but
when she is reduced to extreme want, when she sees herself to be the
laughing-stock of all, and when she drags a miserable life in poverty, she then
sighs and owns how infatuated she had been in leaving her husband. So the Lord
now declares by his Prophet, that he would thus deal with the Israelites, that
they might no longer please themselves with such delusions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The floor and the wine-press
shall not feed them, and the new wine shall disappoint
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> (<i>mentietur illis</i> &#8212;
shall lie to them;) &#8212; that is, the vineyards shall not answer their
expectation. It is the same as though he said, &#8220;As these men regard only
their stomach, as they deem nothing of any moment but provision, therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the floor and the wine-press
shall not feed them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>I will deprive them
of their support, that they may understand that they in vain worship false
gods.&#8221; Let us take a common similitude: We see some boys so disingenuous
as not to be moved either by disgrace or even by stripes; but as they are
subject to the cravings of appetite, when the father deprives them of bread,
they nearly lose all hope. Stripes do no good, all warnings are slighted; but
when the boy who loves excess sees that bread is denied him, he finds out that
his father&#8217;s displeasure ought to be feared. Thus God corrects men
addicted to excessive indulgence; for they are so insensible, that no other
remedy can do them any good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, apprehend the meaning of the Prophet.
He first reproaches the Israelites for loving a reward, for hastening after
fictitious gods, that they might glut themselves with great abundance of things:
but when the Lord saw that they had become stupefied in their fatness, he said,
&#8220;I will deprive them of all their provisions; neither wine nor wheat shall
be given them; this want will at length drive them to repentance.&#8221; We
hence see how the Lord deals with men according to their disposition. And his
manner of speaking ought to be noticed; he says, that neither the floor nor the
wine-press shall feed them. He does not say, that the fields shall be barren; he
does not say, that he would send hail or storm; but he says, that neither the
floor nor the wine-press shall feed them; and further, that the new wine shall
disappoint them; that is, when they shall think themselves to be blessed with
all plenty, when the harvest shall appear abundant, and when they shall have
already, by anticipation, swallowed up the large produce of their vineyards, all
this shall come to nothing; for neither the floor nor the wine-press shall feed
them; nay, the very wine which they thought to have been prepared shall
disappoint them. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proclaims here a heavier punishment
&#8212; that the Lord would drive them into exile. It was indeed a dreadful
repudiation, when they were deprived of the land of Canaan, which was the
Lord&#8217;s rest, as it is called in the Psalms,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14.) While they dwelt in the land of Canaan, they lived as it were in the
habitations of God, and could have a sure hope that he would be a father to
them: but when they were thence expelled, the Lord testified that he regarded
them as aliens; it was the same as when a father disinherits his son. The
Prophet now threatens them not only with the want of food, but also with
repudiation, which was far more grievous &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not

dreadful</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. In Assyria they shall
eat what is unclean</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for it was the same
as if the Lord intended to blend that holy people with the profane Gentiles, so
that there should be afterwards no difference; for the uncleanness of which the
Prophet speaks would have the effect of destroying the distinction which the
adoption of God made between that people and the profane nations. It was indeed
by badges that the Lord retained the people of Israel, when he ordered them to
abstain from unclean meats: but when they differed nothing, as to common food,
from the Gentiles, it was evident that they were rejected by God, and that the
holiness which belonged to them through the free covenant of God was
obliterated. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
eat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what is unclean in
Assyria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;They shall not
now be under my care and protection; they shall live according to their own
will, as the other nations. I have hitherto preserved them under some restraint;
but now, as they will not bear to live under my law, they shall have their own
liberty, and shall be profane like the rest of the world, so that they shall
become involved in all the defilements and pollutions of the Gentiles.&#8221;
This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And now we ought to consider, whether it be right,
when we are among idolaters, to conform to the rites approved by them. This
place, no doubt, as other places, most clearly shows, that nothing more grievous
can happen to us than the doing away of all difference between us and the
profane despisers of God, even in the outward manner of living. Had the Prophet
said, &#8220;The Israelites shall now be hungry in a far country; &#8212; the
Lord has hitherto fed them with plenty, for he has performed what he had
formerly promised by Moses; this land has in every way been blessed, and has
supplied us with great abundance of wine, wheat, and oil; yea, honey has flowed
like water; but they shall now be constrained to pine away with want among their
enemies:&#8221; &#8212; Had the Prophet said this, it would have been a grievous
and severe denunciation; but now he fills them, as it has been already said,
with much greater horror, for he says,
<i>&#8216;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall eat what
is unclean</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8217;</i> There seemed to be
some great importance belonging to the external rite: but the outward profession
was the badge of divine adoption. When therefore the people loosened the reins
and ate indiscriminately any meat, and made no choice according to the
directions of the law, then the distinction was removed, so that they ceased to
be the people of God. It is the same also, at this day, with those who turn
aside from a sincere profession of their faith and associate with the Papists;
they renounce, as far as they can, the favour of God, and abandon themselves to
the will of Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know that it is a dreadful judgement of
God, when we are not allowed to profess our faith by outward worship; and when
the ungodly so rule, as to put us under the necessity of which the Prophet here
speaks, even of eating unclean things, that is, of being implicated in their
profane superstitions. It is then a favour, to be highly valued, when we are
permitted to abstain from all defilements and to worship God purely, so that no
one may contaminate himself by dissimulation: but when we are compelled, under
the tyranny of the ungodly, to conform to impure superstitions, it is a sign of
the dreadful judgement of God; and there is nothing by which any one can excuse
himself in this respect or extenuate his fault, as many do, whom yet conscience
bites within, though they deem it sufficient to spread forth their own excuses
before the eyes of men. But there is nothing by which such men can either
flatter themselves, or dazzle the eyes of the simple; for it is an extreme
reproach, when people, who ought to be sacred to God and to profess outwardly
his pure worship, suffer themselves to be polluted with unclean food. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain whether the Prophet testifies here,
that they should lose their labour and their oil (as they say) when they
sacrificed to God; or whether he declares what would be the case when they had
been driven into exile. Both views seem probable. Now, if we refer the words of
the Prophet to the time of exile, they seem not unsuitable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not then pour out
wine</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to Jehovah, and their sacrifices shall not
be acceptable to him; no oblation shall come any more to the temple of
Jehovah.&#8221; And thus many understand the passage; yet the former sense is
the most appropriate, as it may be easily gathered from the context. The Prophet
says, that they shall not pour out wine to Jehovah, and that their sacrifices
shall not be acceptable to him; and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All that eat shall be
polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It seems not by any means
applicable to exiles, that they should vainly endeavour to pour out wine to God;
for their religion forbade them to do such a thing. Further, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their sacrifices shall be to them
as the bread of mourners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8212; this
must also be understood of sacrifices, which they were wont daily to offer to
God; for in exile (as it has been said) it was not lawful for them to make any
offering, nor had they there an altar or a sanctuary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is the meaning of the Prophet, when he
says, &#8220;All that eat of their sacrifices shall be polluted&#8221;? We must
know that the Prophet speaks here of the intermediate time, as though he said,
&#8220;What the Israelites now sacrifice is without any advantage, and God is
not pacified with these trifles for they bring polluted hands, they change not
their minds, they obtrude their sacrifices on God, but they themselves first
pollute them.&#8221; Of this same doctrine we have already often treated; I
shall not then dwell on it now; but it is enough to point out the design of the
Prophet, which was to show that the Israelites were seeking in vain to pacify
God by their ceremonies, for they were vain expiations which God did not regard,
but deemed as worthless.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They shall not then pour out wine to God. There is an
important meaning in this sentence; for it is certain that as long as the
Israelites lived in their country, they were sedulous enough in the performance
of outward worship, and that drink-offerings were not neglected by them. Since,
then, this custom prevailed among them, the Prophet must be speaking here only
of the effect, and says, that they exercised themselves in vain in their
frivolous worship, for they poured not out wine to Jehovah, that is, their
libation did not come to Jehovah; and he explains himself afterwards, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their drink-offerings shall
not be pleasant to him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> However much,
then, the Israelites might labour, the Prophet says that their labour would be
fruitless, for the Lord would reject whatever they did. He then adds what is to
the same purpose, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their
sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat shall be
polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, all their sacrifices
are polluted. The Prophet now shows more clearly, not that there would be no
sacrifices, but that they would be in vain, because the Lord would abominate
them, and would repudiate all the masks which they would put on in his presence,
and under the cover of which they withdrew themselves from their allegiance to
him. The reason is, because when any one unclean touches pure flesh, he pollutes
it by his uncleanness. God then must necessarily abominate whatever impure men
offer, unless they seek to purify their minds. And this principle has ever
prevailed among the very blind, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>An impious right
hand does not rightly worship the
celestials.</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>(Non bene
coelestes impia dextra colit.)</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words, which spread everywhere, have been
witnesses of the common feeling; for the Lord intended to draw out men, as it
were, from their converts, when he forced them to make such a confession. It is
no wonder that the Prophet now says (as this truth is also often taught in
Scripture) that the sacrifices of the people, who continued in their own
perfidy, would be like the bread of mourners; as Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;When one kills an
ox, it is the same as if he slew a man; when one sacrifices a lamb, it is the
same as if he killed a
dog,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
66:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He compares sacrifices to murders; nor is it to be
wondered at, for it is a more atrocious crime to abuse the sacred name of God
than to kill a man, and this is what ungodly men do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, &#8220;If any one eats, he will be
polluted.&#8221; He enlarges on what he said before, and says that if any one
clean should come, he would be polluted by being only in company with them. We
now see how sharply the Prophet here arouses hypocrites, that they might now
cease to promise to themselves what they were wont to do, and that is, that God
would be propitious to them while they pacified him with their vain things.
&#8220;By no means,&#8221; he says; &#8220;nay, there is so much defilement in
your sacrifices, that they even contaminate others who come, being themselves
clean.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, Can the impiety of others
pollute us, when we afford no proof of companionship, nor by dissimulation
manifest any consent? when we then abstain from all superstition, does society
alone contaminate us? The answer is easy: The Prophet does not avowedly discuss
here how another&#8217;s impiety may contaminate men who are clean; but his
object was to show in strong language how much God abhors the ungodly, and that
not only he is not pacified with their sacrifices, but also holds them as the
greatest abominations. But with regard to this question, it is certain that we
become polluted as soon as we content to profane superstitions: yet when ungodly
men administer either holy baptism or the holy supper, we are not polluted by
fellowship with them, for the deed itself has nothing vicious in it. Then the
act only does not pollute us, nor the hidden and inward impiety of men. This is
true: but we are to understand for what purpose the Prophet said, that all who
eat of their sacrifices shall be polluted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He proceeds with the same subject,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their bread for their
souls</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc. This clause, &#8220;for their
soul,&#8221; may be explained in two ways. In saying, Bread for their soul, the
Prophet spake by way of contempt; as though he said, &#8220;Let them serve
themselves and their stomach with bread, and no more offer it to God; let them
then satiate themselves with bread, for they cannot consecrate to God their
bread, when they themselves are unclean.&#8221; But I am inclined to follow what
has been more approved, that bread for their soul shall not come to the house of
the Lord; for men, we know, are then wont to offer their sacrifices to God to
reconcile themselves to him, or at least to present emblems of their expiation:
hence the Prophet says, that bread is offered for the soul according to the
directions of the law; but that the ungodly could not bring bread into the house
of Jehovah, because the Lord excludes them, as it were, by an interdict. Not
that hypocrites keep away, for we see how boldly they thrust themselves into the
temple; nay, they would occupy the first place; but the Lord yet forbids them to
come to his presence. This is the reason why he says, that the bread of the
ungodly shall not come before God, though in appearance their oblations glitter
before men. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here alludes again to their exile, and
shows how deplorable the condition of the people would be, when deprived of all
their sacrifices. It is indeed true that the Israelites, when they changed the
place of the temple, and when new and spurious rites were introduced by
Jeroboam, became wholly rejected, so that from that time no sacrifice pleased
God, for they sacrificed to idols and demons and not to God, as it is elsewhere
stated,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:17;) but yet, as they had some kind of divine worship, as circumcision
remained, and sacrifices were offered, as it were, by Moses&#8217; command, and
they boasted themselves to be the children of Abraham and lived in the holy
land, they were satisfied with their condition. But when in exile they saw no
sign of God&#8217;s favour, when they were deprived of the temple and altar and
all sacrifices, when on every side mere solitude and waste met their eyes, when
God thus manifested that he was far removed from them, great sorrow must have
entered their hearts. Hence the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What will ye do in the solemn
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he expressly mentions solemn and festal-days.
&#8220;If the morning and the evening oblation, which is wont to be made, will
not be remembered, and if the other sacrifices will not occur to your minds,
what will you do when the festal days will come? for the Lord will then show
that he has nothing to do with you.&#8221; For the trumpets sounded on the
festivals, that the people might come from the whole land into the temple; and
it was, as it were, the voice of God, sounding from heaven: but when the
feast-days were forgotten, when there were no holy assemblies, it was the same
as if the Lord, by commanding silence, had proved that he no longer cared for
the people. That the Israelites then might not think that exile only was
threatened to them, the Prophet here shows that something worse was connected
with it, and that was, that the Lord would wholly forsake them, and that there
would exist no token of his presence, as though they were cut off from the
Church. What then will ye do on the solemn day, on the day of Jehovah&#8217;s
festivity? That is, &#8220;Do you think that something of an ordinary kind is
denounced on you when I speak of exile? The Lord will indeed take away the whole
of your worship, and will deprive you of all the evidences of his presence. What
then will you do? But if a brutish stupor should so occupy your minds, that this
should not recur to your thoughts daily, the solemn and festal-days will at
least constrain you to think how dreadful it is, that you have nothing remaining
among you, which may afford a hope of God&#8217;s favour.&#8221; We now
apprehend the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn what I have said before, that nothing
worse can happen to us in this world, than to be scattered without any order,
when no outward evidence appears by which the Lord collects us to himself. It
would therefore be better for us to be deprived of meat and drink, and to go
naked, and to perish at last through want, than that the exercises of religion,
(<i>exercita pietatis</i> &#8212; exercises of religion) by which the Lord holds
us, as it were, in his own bosom, should be taken away from us. When therefore
we are deprived of these aids, and God thus hides his face from us, and mournful
waste discovers to us dread on every side, it is an extreme calamity, an
evidence of the dreadful judgement of God. Let us then learn, when our flesh is
touched, when sterility or some other evil impends over us &#8212; let us learn
to dread this deprivation still more, and to fear lest the Lord should deprive
us of our festal-days; that is, take away all the aids of religion by which he
holds us together in his house, and shows us to be a part of his Church. This
then, in the last place, ought to be noticed: what remains we shall consider in
our next lecture.</font><br></div>

we, being at length awakened, may feel our evils, and be not merely affected by
outward punishments, but rouse ourselves, and feel how grievously we have in

away. But he sets forth the certainty of the prediction by this manner of
speaking, that profane men might cease to promise themselves impunity when God
summons them to his tribunal: yea, he shows that he was already armed to take
vengeance: &#8220;They have gone away,&#8221; he says, &#8220;on account of
desolation.&#8221; Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Egypt shall gather
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>To gather here is to be taken in a
bad sense; for it means the same as <i>trousser</i> (to pack up, to bundle) in
our language; and it is often taken in this sense by the Prophets, when mention
is made of destruction: and this appears still clearer from the word, burying,
which the Prophet immediately subjoins.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Egypt shall gather
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> He certainly speaks not of a kind
retreat, but declares that Egypt would be a sepulchre to them, in which they
should remain shut up: and thus he takes away from them any hope of deliverance.
The Israelites expected that they should find shelter for a season in Egypt,
when they bent their course there for fear of their enemies. The Prophet now
shows that they would be disappointed in dreaming of a return, for they would
remain there gathered up; that is, a free return, as they imagined, would not be
allowed them, but a perpetual habitation, yea, a grave.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8216;Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury
them.&#8217; There is a striking correspondence between the words here used,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kober,</i> and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;bq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kobets,</i>. By the first the Prophet signifies that they should be shut up,
so as to be, as it were, bound and fixed to a place; and then he adds that they
should be buried.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The desirable place of their
silver the nettle shall possess, as by hereditary right, and the
thorn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.; some render it paliurus;
but I follow what is more received,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the thorn then shall be in their
tabernacles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The meaning is, that the
Israelites would be exiles and sojourners, not for a short time, but that their
exile would be so long that their land would become waste and uncultivated; for
neither nettles nor thorns grow in an inhabited place. Hosea then declares that
their land would be deserted and without inhabitants, for nettles and thorns
would occupy it instead of men. Now it tended greatly to increase the sorrow of
exile, that the hope of return was cut off from them; and God had also declared
that Egypt, where they had promised a refuge for themselves, would be to them
like a grave. And thus it happens for the most part to the ungodly, who retake
themselves to vain solaces, that they may escape the vengeance of God; for they
throw themselves into deep labyrinths; where they think to find a harbour of
rest for a time, and a commodious habitation; but there they find either a gulf
or a grave. This is the meaning. Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, by saying that the days of visitation
had come, intended to shake off from hypocrites that supine torpor of which we
have often spoken; for as they were agitated by their own lusts, and were in a
state of continual fervour, so they hardened themselves against God&#8217;s
judgement, and, as it were, covered themselves over with hardness. It was then
necessary to deal roughly with them in order to break down such stubbornness.
This is the reason that the Prophet repeats so often and in so many forms what
might be expressed in this one sentence &#8212; That God would be a just
avenger. Hence he cries out here, that the days of visitation had come. For when
the Lord spared them, as sacred history relates, and as we said at the
beginning, (and under the king Jeroboam the second, the son of Joash, their
affairs were prosperous,) their pride and contempt of God the more increased.
Since then they thought themselves to be now beyond the reach of harm, the
Prophet declares that the days had come. And there is here an implied contrast
in reference to the time during which the Lord had borne with them; for as the
Lord had not immediately visited their sins, they thought that they had escaped.
But the Prophet here distinguishes between time and time: &#8220;You have
hitherto thought,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that you are at peace with God; as if
he, by conniving at the sins of men, denied himself, so as not to discharge any
more the office of a judge: nay, there is another thing to be here considered,
and that is, that God has certain days of visitation, which he has fixed for
himself; and these days are now come.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he again teaches the same thing,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The days of retribution have
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He uses another word, that they
might know that they could not go unpunished for having in so many ways provoked
God. For as the Lord disappoints not the hope of his people, who honour him; so
also there is a reward laid up for the ungodly, who regard as nothing his
judgement. &#8220;God will then repay you what you have deserved, though for a
time it may please him to suspend his judgement.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is the wisdom of fools, as it
is said even in an old proverb; and Homer has also said,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paqwn de te nh&gt;piov
egnw</font><font face="Palatino">, (Even the foolish knows when he suffers.) The
foolish is not wise, except when he suffers. Hence the Prophet says, that
Israel, when afflicted, would then perceive that instruction had been despised,
and that all warnings had been trifled with, at least had not been regarded.
<i>Israel</i> then <i>shall know;</i> that is, he shall at length, when too
late, understand that he had to do with God, even when the time of repentance
shall be no more. The meaning then is that as the ungodly reject the word of
God, and obey not wise admonitions and counsels, they shall at length be taken
to another school, where God teaches not by the mouth but by the hand. Whosoever
then does not now willingly submit to his teaching, shall find God to be a
judge, and shall not escape his hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who join what follows elicit this meaning,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel shall know the Prophet to
be foolish, the man of the spirit to be mad</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, Israel shall then understand that he was deluded by flatteries,
when the false Prophets promised that all things would be prosperous. We indeed
know that they catched at those prophecies which pleased their ears; for which
Micah also reproves them; hence he calls those who gave hope of a better state
of things, the Prophets of wine and oil and wheat,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
2:11.) The world wishes to be ever thus deceived. Since then there were many in
Israel, who by their impositions deceived the miserable, he says, Israel shall
at last know that he has been deluded by his own teachers. If we receive this
sense, there is then here a reproof to Israel for thinking that the vengeance of
God was in some way restrained, when the false Prophets said that he was
pacified, and that there was no danger to be feared. For do not men in this way
stultify themselves? And how gross is their stupidity, when they think that
God&#8217;s hands are tied, when men are silent, or when they perfidiously turn
the truth into a lie? And yet even at this day this disease prevails in the
world, as it has prevailed almost in all ages. For what do the ungodly seek, but
to be let alone in their sins? When mouths are closed, they think that they have
gained much. This madness the Prophet derides, intimating that those profane
men, who have such delicate ears, that they can bear no words of reproof, shall
at last know what they had gained by hiring prophets to flatter them. We hence
see, in short, that the adulations, by which the ungodly harden themselves
against God, will be to them the occasion of a twofold destruction; for such
fallacies dementate them, so that they much more boldly provoke against
themselves the wrath of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if we read the two clauses apart, the rendering
will be this, &#8220;The Prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad.&#8221;
And as to the matter itself, there is not much difference. I will not then dwell
on the subject; for when we are agreed as to the design of the Prophet and the
truth remains the same, it is vain, at least it is of no benefit, to labour very
anxiously about the form of the sentence. If then we begin a sentence with these
words, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aybnh
lywa</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>avil enebia</i>, the sense will be this,
&#8220;I know that the Prophets promise impunity to you; but they who thus hide
your sins, and cover them over as with plasters, are insane men, yea, they are
wholly infatuated. There is then no reason why their flatteries should delight
you; for the event will show that they are mere absurdities and idle
ravings.&#8221; We now see that there is no great difference in the sense: for
this remains still unaltered, that there were many flatterers among the people,
who made it their business to lie, that they might thus procure the favour of
the people; and this ambition has prevailed in all ages: and sometimes also
cupidity or avarice takes such hold on men, that they use a meretricious tongue,
and excuse all vices however grievous, and elude all threatening. This is what
the Prophet shows in the first place; and then he shows, that men without any
advantage indulge their vices, when there is no one severely to reprove them, or
boldly to exhort them to repent; and that though all the Prophets should give
them hope of safety they should yet perish: for men cannot by their silence
restrain God from executing at last his judgement. Nay, we must remember this,
that God spares men when he does not spare them; that is, when he chastises
them, when he reproves their sins, and when he constrains them by terror, he
then would spare them. And again, when God spares, he does not spare; that is,
when he connives at their sins, and leaves men to their own will, to grow wanton
at their pleasure, without any yoke or bridle, he then by no means spares them,
for he destines them for destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The man of the spirit,&#8221; some render
&#8220;the man of the wind;&#8221; and some &#8220;the fanatical man;&#8221; but
they are in my judgement mistaken; for the Prophet, I doubt not, uses a
respectful term, but yet by way of concession. He then calls those the men of
the spirit who were by their office prophets, but who abused that title, as
those who at this day call themselves pastors when they are really rapacious
wolves. The Prophets, as we know, always declared that they did not speak from
their own minds but what the Spirit of God dictated to them. Hence they were men
of the Spirit, that is, spiritual men: for the genitive case, we know, was used
by the Hebrews to express what we designate by an adjective. The Prophets then
were the men of the Spirit. He concedes this name, in itself illustrious and
honourable, to impostors; but in the same sense as when I speak generally of
teachers; I then include the false as well as the true. This then is the real
meaning of the expression, as we may gather from the context: for he says the
same thing twice, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aybnh
lywa</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>avil enebia</i>,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fool is the
Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwrh &ccedil;ya
[g&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>moshigo aish eruch,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mad is the man of the
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As he spoke of a Prophet, so he
now mentions the same by calling him a man of the spirit, or a spiritual
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the end of the verse he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the multitude of thine
iniquity, for great hatred</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>much
hatred</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for it may be rendered in these
two ways. Here the Prophet shows, that though the false Prophets stultified by
their fallacies the people, yet this could by no means avail for an excuse or
for extenuating the fault of the people. How so? Because they suffered the
punishment of their own impiety. For whence comes it, that the Lord takes away
his light from us, that after having once shown to us the way of salvation, he
turns suddenly his back on us, and suffers us to go astray to our perdition? How
does this happen? Doubtless, because we are unworthy of that light, which was a
witness to us of God&#8217;s favour. For as much then as men through their own
fault procure such a judgement to themselves, the Lord neither blinds them nor
gives to Satan the power of deluding them, except when they deserve such a
treatment. Hence the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the multitude of thine
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and for thy crimes, by which
thou hast excited against thyself the wrath and hatred of God. We hence see how
frivolous are the pretences by which men clear themselves, when they object and
say that they have been deceived and that if their teachers had been faithful
and honest, they would have willingly obeyed God. When therefore men make these
objections, the ready answer is this, that they had been deprived of true and
faithful teachers, because they had refused the favour offered to them, and
extinguished the light, and as Paul says, preferred a lie to the truth; and that
they had been deceived by false Prophets, because they willingly hastened to
ruin when the Lord called them to salvation. We now then understand the import
of what is here taught.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says, in the first place, that the day of
vengeance was now at hand, because the Lord by forbearance could prevail nothing
with the obstinate. He then adds, that as all threatenings were despised by the
people, and as they were deaf to every instruction, they would at length know
that God had not spoken in vain but would perceive that their were justly
treated; for the Lord would not now teach them by his word, but by scourges. He
adds, in the third place, that the Prophet was foolish and delirious, and also,
that they who boasted themselves to be the men of the spirit were mad: by which
expressions he meant that the flatteries, by which the people were lulled asleep
were foolish; for God would not fail at last, when the time came, to execute his
office. And, lastly he reminds them that this would happen through the fault of
the people, that there was no reason for them to trace or to ascribe the cause
of the evil to any thing else; for this blindness was their just punishment. The
Lord would have never permitted Satan thus to prevail in his own inheritance,
had not the people, by the immense filth of their sins, provoked God for a long
time, and as it were with a determined purpose. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters obscure this verse by their various
opinions. Almost all suppose a verb to be understood that Ephraim &#8220;had
set&#8221; a watchman. But I see no need to make any change in the words of the
Prophet: I therefore take them simply as they are. Now some think that there is
here a comparison between the old Prophets who had not turned aside from
God&#8217;s command, and those flatterers who pretended the name of God, while
they were the ministers of Satan to deceive. They therefore thus distinguish
them, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The watchman of Ephraim was
with my God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, there was a time
formerly when the watchmen of Ephraim were connected with God, and declared no
strange doctrine, when they drew from the true fountain all that they taught;
there was then a connection between God and the Prophets, for they depended on
the mouth of God, and the Prophets delivered to the people, as from hand to
hand, whatever God commanded; there was then nothing corrupt, or impure, or
adventitious in their words. But now the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophet is a snare of a
fowler</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, the dice is turned, a
deplorable change has taken place; for now the Prophets lay snares to draw
people by their disciples into destruction; and this abomination bears rule,
that is, this monstrous wickedness prevails in the temple of God: these Prophets
live not in caves nor traverse public roads, but they occupy a place in the
temple of God; so that of the sacred temple of God they make a brothel for the
impostures of Satan. Such is their view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I read the verse as connected together,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The watchman of
Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> who ought to have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with God, even the Prophet, is a
snare of a fowler on all his ways</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
former view would have indeed met my approbations did not the words appear to be
forced; and I do not love strained meanings. This is the reason which prevents
me from subscribing to an exposition which in itself I approve, as it embraces a
useful doctrine. But this simple view is more correct, that the watchman of
Ephraim, a Prophet, is a snare of a fowler: and he adds, with God; for it is the
duty of teachers to have nothing unconnected with God. Hosea then shows what
Prophets ought to do, not what they may do. A Prophet then is he who is a
watchman of Israel; for this command, we know, is given in common to all
Prophets &#8212; to be as it were on their watch-tower, and to be vigilant over
the people of God. It is therefore no wonder that the Prophet dignifies with his
own title all those who were then teachers among God&#8217;s people. But he thus
doubles their crime, by saying that they were only keen and sharp-sighted to
snare the people. Then the watchmen of Israel, the Prophet, who was placed on
the watch-tower to watch or to exercise vigilance over the safety of the whole
people &#8212; this Prophet was a snare of a fowler! But he triplicates the
crime when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for as we have already observed,
teachers could not faithfully discharge their office, except they were connected
with God, and were able truly to testify that they brought forth nothing that
was invented, but what the Lord himself had spoken, and that they were his
organs. We now then apprehend the real meaning of the Prophet; and according to
this view there is nothing strained in the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet also thus confirms what he had said
before, that the Prophets were fools, that is, that their prophecies would at
length appear empty and vain; for they could not prevent God from inflicting
punishment on the wicked by their fallacious flatteries; he confirms this truth
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The watchmen of
Ephraim is a snare of a fowler on all his
ways</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> that is, he ought to have guided
the people, and to have kept them safe from intrigues. But now the people could
not move a foot without meeting with a snare; and whence came this snare but
from false doctrine and impostures? What then was to be at last? Could the
snares avail to make them cautious? By no means; but Satan thus hunts his prey,
when he soothes the people by his false teachers, and keeps them, as it were,
asleep, that they may not regard the hand of God. There was then no reason for
the Israelites to think well of the fowlers by whom they were drawn into
ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This indignity is more emphatically expressed, when
he says, that there was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
detestable thing in the temple of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There was not, indeed, a temple of God in Bethel, as we have often said; but
as the people were wont to pretend the name of God, the Prophet, conceding this
point, says, that these abominations were covered over by this pretence. There
is then no need anxiously to inquire here, whether it was the temple at Samaria
or at Bethel, or the house and sanctuary of God; for a concession proves not a
thing to be so, but it is to speak according to the general opinion. So then the
Prophet does not without reason complain, that the place, on which was inscribed
the name of God, was profaned, and that, instead of the teaching of salvation,
there was fowling everywhere, which drew the people into apostasy, and finally
into utter ruin. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Hosea declares here, that the people were so sunk in
their vices, that they could not be drawn out of them. He who has fallen can
raise up himself when one extends a hand to him; and he who strives to emerge
from the mire, finding a helper to assist him, can plant his foot again on solid
ground: but when he is cast into a gulf, he has no hope of a recovery. I extend
my hand in vain, when one sinks in a shipwreck, and is fallen into the deep. So
now the Prophet says, that the people were unhealable, because they were deeply
fixed; and further, because they were infected with corruptions. He therefore
intimates that their diseases were incurable, that they had struck roots so
deeply, that they could by no means be cleansed.

city differed nothing from Sodom; for unbridled licentiousness in all kinds of
vices prevailed there, and lusts so monstrous reigned among them, that there was
no distinction between good and evil, no shame whatever. Hence it was, that they
ravished the Levite&#8217;s wife, and killed her by their filthy obscenities:
and this was the cause of that memorable slaughter which nearly demolished the
whole tribe of Benjamin. The history is related in the Book of Judges 19, 20
,21; and it deserved to be recorded, that people might know what it is not to
walk with care and fear in obedience to the Lord. Who could indeed have believed
that a people taught in the law of God could have fallen into such a state of
madness as this city did, which was nigh to Jerusalem, the destined place of the
temple, though not yet built? and, not to mention the temple, who could have
thought that this city, which was in the midst of the people, could have been so
demented, that, like brute beasts, they should abandon themselves to the
filthiest lusts? nay, that they should have been more filthy than the beasts?
For monstrous lusts, as I have said, were there left unpunished, as at Sodom and
in the neighbouring cities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says now, that the whole of Israel had
become as corrupt as formerly the citizens of Gibeah. Deeply sunk, then, were
the Israelites in their vices, and were as addicted as the inhabitants of Gibeah
to their corruptions. What, then, is to follow?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will remember their
iniquities, and will visit their sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
The Prophet means two things first, that as the Israelites were wholly
disobedient, and would receive no instruction, God would in no other way deal
with them, as though he said, &#8220;The Lord will no longer spend labour in
vain in teaching you, but he will seize the sword and execute his vengeance; for
ye are not worthy of being taught by him any longer; for his teaching is counted
a mockery by you.&#8221; This is one thing; and the other is, that though God
had hitherto spared the people of Israel, he had not yet forgotten the filth of
sins which prevailed among them. Hence God, he says, will at length remember
and, as he had said before, will visit your sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the simple meaning of the
Prophet. But let us hence also learn to rouse ourselves; and let us, in the
first place, notice what the Prophet says of the Israelites, that they were
deeply fixed; for men must be filled with contempt to God, when they thus
descend, as Solomon says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;201804&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
18:4,) to the deep. Lets then each of us stir up himself to repentance and
carefully beware lest he should descend into this deep gulf. But since he says,
&#8220;the Lord will remember and will visit&#8221;, let us know that they are
greatly deceived who indulge themselves as long as the Lord mercifully bears
with their sins; for though he may for a time conceal his displeasure yet an
oblivion will never possess him: but at a fit time he will remember, and prove
that he does so by executing a just punishment.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse God reproves the Israelites for having
preferred to prostitute themselves to idols, rather than to continue under his
protection, though he had from the beginning showed his favour to them; as
though he had said that they having been previously favoured with his free love,
had transferred their affections to others; for he says, that he had found them
as grapes in the wilderness. The word wilderness, ought to be joined with
grapes, as if he had said, that they had been as sweet and acceptable to him as
a grape when found in a desert. When a traveller finds, by chance, a grape in a
barren and desolate place, he not only admires it, but takes great delight in a
fruit so unlooked for. And thus the Lord, by this comparison, shows his great
love towards the Israelites. He adds, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the first fruit of the
figtree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for the fig-tree, we know,
produces fruit twice every year. Therefore, God says, <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As figs at the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(or, as they say, the first
fruits) are delightful, so have I taken delight in this people. The Prophet does
not however mean, that the people were worthy of being so much loved. But the
Hebrews use the word, to find, in the same sense as we do, when we say in
French, &#8212; <i>Je treuve cela a mon gout,</i> (I find this to my taste.) I
have therefore regarded Israel </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as
grapes in the wilderness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And this
remark is needful, lest some one should subtilely infer, that the Israelites
were loved by God, because they had something savoury in them. For the Prophet
relates not here what God found in the people, but he only reproves their
ingratitude, as we shall presently see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first part then shows that God had great delight
in this people. It is the same or similar sentence to that in Hosea 11, where he
says, &#8216;When Ephraim was yet a child, I loved him,&#8217; except that there
is not there so much fervour and warmth of love expressed; but the same argument
is there handled, and the object is the same, and it is to prove, that God
anticipated his people by his love. There remained, in this case, less excuse,
when men rejected God calling them, and responded not to his love. A
perverseness like this would be hardly endured among men. Were any one to love
me freely, and I to slight him, it would be an evidence of pride and rudeness:
but when God himself gratuitously treats us with kindness, and when, not content
with common love, he regards us as delectable fruit, does not the rejection of
this love, does not the contempt of this favour, betray, on our part, the basest
depravity? We now then understand the design of the Prophet. In the first
clause, he says, in the person of God, &#8220;I have loved Israel, as a
traveller does grapes, when he finds them in the desert, and as the first ripe
figs are wont to be loved: since then, I so much delighted in them, ought they
not to have honoured me in return? Ought not my gratuitous love to have inflamed
their hearts, so as to induce them to devote themselves wholly to
me?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they went in unto
Baal-peor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. So I interpret the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wab</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bau</i>; and it is taken in this sense in many other places. For the Hebrews
say, &#8220;they went in,&#8221; to express in a delicate way the intercourse
between husbands and wives. And the Prophet does not, without reason, compare
the sacrifices which the people offered to Baal-peor to adultery, as being like
the intercourse which an adulterer has with an harlot. They then went in unto
Baal-peor; and he adds, that they &#8220;separated themselves&#8221;. Some
interpret the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rzn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nesar,</i> as referring to worship, and as meaning that they consecrated
themselves to Baal-peor; and others derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sare</i>, which they think is here in a passive sense, and means, &#8220;to
be alienated.&#8221; But I take it in the same sense as when Ezekiel says,
&#8220;They have separated themselves from after me,&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrjam</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>macheri</i>, Ezekiel 14; that is, that they may not follow me. God here
expostulates with the people for following their fornication, and for thus
repudiating that sacred marriage which God contracts with all his people. I
therefore read the two sentences as forming one context,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Israelites went in unto
Baal-peor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as an adulterer goes in unto
a harlot; and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they separated
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for they denied God, and
violated the faith pledged to him; they discarded the spiritual marriage which
God made with them.&#8221; For the Prophet, we know, whenever he refers to
idolatries speaks allegorically or metaphorically, and mentions
adultery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have separated
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, though their
filthiness was shameful, they were yet wholly insensible: as when a wife
disregards her character, or as when a husband cares not that he is pointed at
by the finger, and that his baseness is to all a laughing-stock; so the
Israelites, he says, had separated themselves to reproach, having cast away all
shame, they abandoned themselves to wickedness. Some render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t&ccedil;b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beshet</i>, obscenity, and others refer it to Baal-peor, and render the
sentence thus, &#8220;They have separated themselves to that filthy idol.&#8221;
For some think Priapus to have been Baal-peor; and this opinion has gained the
consent of almost all. But I extend wider the meaning of the word
&#8220;reproach,&#8221; as signifying that the people observed no difference
between what was decent and what was shameful, but that they were senseless in
their impiety. They were therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abominable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abominations according to
their lovers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, I doubt not,
connects here the Israelites with idols and with Baal-peor itself, that he might
strip them of all that holiness which they had obtained through God&#8217;s
favour. We now apprehend the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, what is here taught is worthy of being noticed
and is useful. For, as we have said, inexcusable is our wickedness, if we
despise the gratuitous love of God, bestowed unasked. When God then comes to us
of his own accord, when he invites us, when he offers to us the privilege of
children, an inestimable benefit, and when we reject his favour, is not this
more than savage ferocity? It was to reprobate such conduct as this that the
Prophet says, that God had loved Israel, as when one finds grapes in the desert,
or as when one eats the first ripe figs. But it must, at the same time, be
noticed why the Prophet so much extols the dealings of God with the people of
Israel; it was for this reason, because their adoption, as it is well known, was
not an ordinary privilege, nor what they enjoyed in common with other nations.
Since, then, the people had been chosen to be God&#8217;s special possession,
the Prophet here justly extols this love with peculiar commendation. And the
like is our case at this day; for God vouchsafes not to all the favour which has
been presented to us through the shining light of the gospel. Other people
wander in darkness, the light of life dwells only among us: does not God thus
show that he delights especially in us? But if we continue the same as we were,
and if we reject him and transfer our love to others, or rather if lust leads us
astray from him, is not this detestable wickedness and
obstinacy?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what the Prophet says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>separated themselves to
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> is also worthy of being
noticed; for he exaggerates their crime by this consideration, that the
Israelites were so blinded, that they perceived not their own turpitude, though
it was quite manifest. The superstitions which then prevailed in the land of
Moab were no doubt very gross; but Satan had so fascinated their minds that they
gave themselves up to a conduct which was worse than shameful. Let us then know
that our sin is worthy of a heavier punishment in such a case as this, that is,
when every distinction is done away among us, and when we are hurried away by
the spirit of giddiness into every impiety and when we no longer distinguish
between light and darkness, between white and black; for it is a token of final
reprobation. When, therefore, shame ought to have restrained them, he says, that
the Israelites had yet &#8220;separated themselves to reproach, and became
abominable like their lovers&#8221;; that is, As Baal-peor is the highest
abomination to me, so the people became to me equally abominable. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Hebrews, we know, have often abrupt sentences as
in this place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim! their
glory has fled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Ephraim is to be placed
by itself; and the speech seems striking, when the Lord thus breaks off the
sentence, Ephraim! he does not continue the sense, but immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Like a bird their glory has
fled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he speaks of Ephraim, he no doubt
refers especially to his offspring; and by mentioning a part for the whole, he
includes whatever was then deemed to be wealth, or glory, or power. The Prophet,
I say, speaks of offspring, for he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the birth, and the womb, and
the conception</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But they are mistaken
who confine this sentence to offspring only; for it is, as I have said, a mode
of speaking, by which a part is taken for the whole. According to the letter, he
mentions children or offspring; but yet he includes generally the whole
condition of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a bird the glory of Ephraim
fled away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In what respect? From the
birth, from the womb, from the conception. The Prophet, no doubt, sets forth
here the gradations of God&#8217;s vengeance, which was yet in part near at hand
to the Israelites, and which was in part already evident by clear proofs. He
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
birth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
womb,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and, lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
conception</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> If, then, the glory of
Ephraim had vanished at the beginning, the Prophet would not have thus spoken;
but as the Lord showed signs of his wrath by degrees, that vengeance at length
might reach the highest point, the Prophets in the first place, mentions birth,
then the womb; as though he said, &#8220;The glory of Israel shall vanish from
the birth, but if they still continue proud, and seem not subdued by this
punishment, I will slay them in the womb itself; nay, in the conception, if they
repent not; they shall be suffocated as in the very
womb.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though they shall bring up
children, I will yet exterminate them, so that they shall not be
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, before<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they grow
up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as some expound the words. The meaning is,
that though Ephraim then flattered himself, yet a dreadful ruin was at hand,
which would extinguish the whole seed, so that there would be nothing remaining.
But lest they should think that all was over, when the Lord had inflicted on
them one punishment, he lays down three gradations; that God would slay them
first in the birth, then extinguish them in the womb, and, lastly, before
conception; but if he spared them, so that they would raise up children, it
would yet be without advantage, inasmuch as God would take away the youths in
the flower of their age. Thus, then he threatens entire destruction to the
kingdom of Israel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, lastly, he closes the verse in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And surely woe will be to them
when I shall depart from them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet means by these words, that men become miserable and accursed, when they
alienate themselves from God, and when God takes away from them his favour.
After having mentioned especially the vengeance of Godwhich was at hand, he says
here that the cause and occasion of all evils would be, that God would depart
from them, inasmuch as they had previously renounced their faith in him. But we
must bear in mind the reason why the Prophet added this clause, and that is,
because wicked men dream, that though God be displeased, things will yet go on
prosperously with them: for they neither ascribe adversities to the wrath of
God, nor acknowledge the fountain of all blessings to be God&#8217;s free and
paternal favour. As then profane men do not understand this truth, however much
God may proclaim that he is an enemy to them, that he is armed to destroy them,
they care nothing, but promise to themselves a prosperous fortune: until they
feel the hand of God and the signs of destruction appear, they continue still
secure. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that there is woe to men when
God departs from them. Forasmuch, then, as Scripture teaches everywhere that
every desirable thing comes and flows to us from the mere grace of God and his
paternal favour, so the Prophet declares in this place, that men are miserable
and accursed when God is angry with them. But it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Hosea here confirms his previous statements that the
Israelites in vain trusted in their present condition, for the Lord could
reverse their prosperity whenever it pleased him. Men, we know, harden
themselves in their vices, when they enjoy their wishes and when they are sunk
in pleasures; for prosperity is not without reason often compared to wine,
because it inebriates men; nay, rather it dementates them. We see what happened
to the Sodomites and to others; yea, the abuse of God&#8217;s forbearance has
ever been the cause of destruction to almost all the reprobate, as Paul also
says. Such pride reigned in the people of Israel, that they heedlessly despised
all threatening, as it has been already often stated. To this then the Prophet
refers when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim is
like a tree planted in Tyrus: yet he shall bring forth his children to the
slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet then points out
here the indulgences of Israel, and then adds, that in a short time the Lord
would draw them forth to judgement, though he had treated them as a precious
tree, by fostering them gently and tenderly for a time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render this place thus, &#8220;I have seen
Ephraim planted like Tyrus;&#8221; and they render the next word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwnb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>benue</i>, &#8220;in pleasantness.&#8221; But since it means a house or a
habitation, I am disposed to retain its proper sense. Interpreters, however,
vary in their opinion; for some say, &#8220;I have seen Ephraim like
Tyrus;&#8221; because an event awaits this people similar to that which happened
to Tyrus; for, as punishment was inflicted on Tyrus, so Ephraim shall not escape
unpunished. This is the exposition of some, but in my view it is too refined.
As, however, there is here a preposition,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;lamed&#8221;, I am inclined to consider
&#8220;a tree&#8221; or &#8220;plant,&#8221; or some such word, understood.
Ephraim then was, as if one beheld a tree in Tyrus, literally to Tyrus, or in
Tyrus. This letter, as a preposition, I allow, is redundant in many places; and
yet it preserves some propriety, except when necessity interferes: and in this
place what I have already stated is the most suitable rendering, &#8220;Ephraim
is like a tree planted in Tyrus, in a dwelling&#8221; or shed. Tyrus, we know,
was built on an island in the sea; it had gardens the most pleasant, but not
formed without much expense and labour. It was washed on every side by the sea;
and unless mounds were set up, the dwellings were confined. Since, then, it was
difficult to raise trees there, much work and labour was doubtless necessary, as
it is usually the case; for men often struggle with nature. And if we say that
Ephraim was planted like Tyrus in a dwelling, what can it mean? We therefore
say, that he was like a tree preserved as in a dwelling: for we see that there
are some trees which cannot bear the cold air, and are kept during winter in a
house that they may be preserved; and it is probable that the Syrians, who were
rich and had a lucrative trade, employed much care in rearing their
trees.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that Ephraim was like tender trees,
preserved by men with great care and with much expense; but that they should
hereafter bring forth their children for the slaughter. This bringing forth is
set in opposition to the house or dwelling. They had been kept without danger
from the cold and heat, like a tender tree under cover; but they would be
constrained to draw forth their children to the slaughter; that is, there would
be no longer any dwelling for them to protect them from the violence of their
enemies, but that they would be drawn forth to the light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the words harmonise well with the
view, that the people of Israel in vain flattered themselves because they had
hitherto been subject to no evils, and that God had preserved them free from
calamity. There is no reason, the Prophet says, for the people to be proud,
because they had been hitherto so indulgently treated; for though they had been
like tender trees, they would yet be forced to draw forth their children to be
killed. And this comparison, which he amplifies, is what often occurs in
Scripture. &#8216;If Jehoiakim were as a ring on my right hand, saith the Lord,
I would pluck him thence.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Men are
wont to abuse even the promises of God. As king Jehoiakim was of the posterity
of David, he thought it impossible that hid enemies could ever deprive him of

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters translate these words in a different
way: &#8220;Give them what thou art about to give,&#8221; then they repeats
&#8220;Give them;&#8221; but, as I think, they do not comprehend the design of
the Prophet, and are wholly mistaken; for the Prophet appears here as one
anxious and perplexed. He therefore presents himself here before God as a
suppliant, as though he said, &#8220;Lord, I would gladly intercede for this
people: what then is it that I should chiefly desire for them? Doubtless my
chief wish for them in their miserable dispersion is, that thou wouldest give
them a killing womb and dry breasts;&#8221; that is, that none may be born of
them. Christ says, that when the last destruction of Jerusalem should come, the
barren would be blessed
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:29;) and this he took from the common doctrine of Scripture, for many such
passages may be observed in the Prophets. Among the blessings of God, this, we
know, is not the least, the birth of a numerous offspring. It is, therefore, a
token of dreadful judgement, when barrenness, which in itself is deemed a curse,
is desired as an especial blessing. For what can be more miserable than for
infants to be snatched from their mothers&#8217; bosom? and for children to be
killed before their eyes, or for pregnant women to be slain? or for cities and
fields to be consumed by fire, so that children, not yet born, should perish
together with their mothers? But all these things happen when there is an utter
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see what the prophet chiefly meant: the
state of the people would be so deplorable that nothing could be more desirable
than the barrenness of the women, that no offspring might be afterwards born,
but that the name and memory of the people might by degrees be blotted
out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He has, indeed, already denounced punishments
sufficiently grievous and dreadful; but we know that the contumacy and hardness
of those are very great on whom religion has no hold. Hence all threatening were
derided by that obstinate people. This is the reason why the Prophet now takes
the part of an intercessor. &#8220;O Lord,&#8221;, he adds &#8220;give
them;&#8221; that is, &#8220;O Lord, forgive them at least in some measure, and
grant them yet something.&#8221; And &#8220;what wilt thou give?&#8221; Here he
reasons with himself, being as it were in suspense and perplexity; and he also
reasons with God as to what would be the most desirable thing. &#8220;I am
indeed a suppliant for my own nation, whom I pity; but what shall I ask? I would
wish thee, Lord, to pardon this people; but what shall be the way, what can give
me comfort, or what sort of remedy yet remains? Certainly I see nothing better
than that they should be barren, that none hereafter should be born of them; but
that thou shouldest suffer them to consume and die away; for this will be their
chief happiness in a condition so deplorable.&#8221; It was then the
Prophet&#8217;s design here, to strike hypocrites and profane men with terror,
that they might understand that God&#8217;s vengeance, which was at hand, could
by no means be fully expressed; for it would be the best thing for them to be
deprived of the blessing of an offspring, that their infants might not perish
with them, that they might not see women with child cruelly slain by their
enemies, or their children led away as a spoil. That such things as these might
not take place, the Prophet says, that barrenness ought to be desired by them as
the chief blessing. The Prophet, I doubt not, meant this. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all their evil was in
Gilgal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> though they thought that they
had the best pretence for offering there their sacrifices to God&#8217;s honour,
because it had been from old times a sacred place. He had said before that they
had multiplied to themselves altars to sin, and by these to give way to sins; he
now repeats the same in other words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All their
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is in
Gilgal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said, &#8220;They
indeed obtrude on me their sacrifices, which they offer in Gilgal, and think
that they avail to excuse all their wickedness. I might, perhaps, forgive them,
if they were given to plunder and cruelty, and were perfidious and fraudulent,
provided pure worship had continued among them, and religion had not been so
entirely adulterated; but as they have changed whatever I commanded in my law,
and turned this celebrated place to be the seat of the basest impiety, so that
it is become, as it were, a brothel, where religion is prostituted, it is hence
evident, that the whole of their wickedness is in
Gilgal.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is certain that the people were also addicted to
other crimes; but the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cal,</i> all, is to be taken for what is chief or principal. The Prophet
speaks comparatively, not simply; as though he had said, that this corruption of
offering sacrifices at Gilgal was more abominable in the sight of God than
adulteries, or plunder, or frauds, or unjust violence, or any crime that
prevailed among them. Their whole evil then was at Gilgal. But why the Prophet
speaks thus, I have lately explained; and that is because superstitious men put
forth their own devices, when God reproves them, &#8220;O! we have still many
exercises of religion.&#8221; They bring forward these by way of compensation.
But the Lord shows that he is far more grievously offended with these
superstitions, with which hypocrites cover themselves as with a shield, than
with a life void of every appearance of religion: for &#8220;these,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;I conceived a hatred against them, on account of the wickedness of
their works.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the Prophet condemns what men think to be
their special holiness. Who indeed can persuade hypocrites that their fictitious
modes of worship are the greatest abominations? Nay, they even extol and imagine
themselves to be like angels, and, as it were, cover all their wickedness with
these disguises; as we see to be the case with the Papists who think, that when
they obtrude on God their many masses and other devised forms, every sort of
wickedness is redeemed. Since then hypocrites are thus wont to put on a disguise
before God, and at the same time flatter themselves, the Prophet here declares
that they are the more hated by God for this very wickedness, of daring to
corrupt and adulterate his pure worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will eject them from my
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When God threatens to eject
Israel from his house, it is the same as though he said, &#8220;I will wholly
cast you away;&#8221; as when one cuts off a withered branch from a tree, or a
diseased member from the body. It is indeed certain that the Israelites were
then like bastards; for they were not worthy of any account or station in the
Church, inasmuch as they had a strange temple and profane sacrifices; but as
circumcision, and the priesthood in name, still remained among them, they
boasted themselves to be the children of Abraham, and a holy people; hence the
Prophet denounces here such a destruction, that it might appear that they in
vain gloried in these superior distinctions, for God would expunge them from his
catalogue. We now understand the design of the Prophet: but we shall, to-morrow,
notice the remaining portion.</font><br></div>

grant, that we may hereafter so return to a sound mind, as to cleave faithfully
and with sincere affection of heart to thy Son, and so retain by this bond thy
love, and be also retained in the grace of adoption, that thy name may be

TWENTY-SIXTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We stated yesterday how God expels from his house
those who ought to have been deemed to be already among such as are without: for
hypocrites always invent coverings for themselves until the Lord himself openly
shows to them their baseness. It is therefore necessary that what they seem to
have, as Christ also declares respecting hypocrites, should be taken away from
them,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not proceed on to love
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> A question may be moved here
&#8212; why does God speak thus of his love? for he had already ceased to love
that people, as it maybe fully gathered from facts. &#8212; Though this saying
may not be strictly correct, yet it is not unsuitable. Profane men, and those
who are in love with worldly things estimate the love of God by present
appearances. When the Lord feeds them well and plentifully, when they enjoy
their pleasures, when they have no troubles to bear, they think themselves to be
most acceptable to God. Such was the case with this people, as it has been
already often stated, as long as the Lord suspended his vengeance; and this was
especially the case under king Jeroboam the second, far we know that the Lord
then spared and greatly favoured them. It was then a certain kind of love, when
the Lord thus cherished them, God allured them to repentance by the sweetness of
his goodness. But now, as he sees them to be growing harder and harder, he says,
&#8220;I will not continue my love towards them; for I will now really show that
I am angry with them, as I see that I have done nothing by my forbearance, which
they do in a manner laugh to scorn.&#8221; Thus we see that men are rejected by
God nearly in the same way, when he exterminates them from his Church, as when
he withdraws his blessing, which is, as it were, the pledge and symbol of his
love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because heir princes are
perfidious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and this is expressly
mentioned, for it was needful that the origin of the evil should be stated. The
Prophet then shows here that corruptions originated not with the common people,
but with the princes. Now we know for what end God would have rank and dignity
to exist among men, and that is, that there might be something like a bridle to
restrain the waywardness of the multitude. When, therefore, princes become
leaders to every wickedness, all things must then go on in the worst manner; for
what ought to be a remedy becomes the cause of ruin. This, then, is what the
Prophet meant in the first place. But by accusing the princes he does not
absolve the people; but, as it has been said in another place, he insinuates
that they must have been very blind, when they suffered themselves to be drawn
into the ditch by the blind: for the people doubtless went astray of their own
accord and willingly, though they had erring leaders; and though, as it has
appeared elsewhere, they anxiously sought excuses for their errors. But we may
hence learn how frivolous is the excuse of those who at this day exculpate
themselves by the pretext of obeying princes and bishops; for the Lord here
denounces punishment on the whole people, because the princes were perfidious.
If it be so, we see that the whole body is involved, when wicked leaders rule
and draw the people from the right way; yea, when they precipitate them into the
same transgressions, and carry them along with them. When, therefore, there is
such a confusion, universal punishment, which consumes all together, must
follow. Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again threatens extreme vengeance to the
Israelites. It is no wonder that the same sentence is so often repeated; for
hypocrites, we know, too much flatter themselves, and are not frightened even by
the most grievous threatening. As then hypocrites are so stupid, they must be
often, nay, frequently pricked, and most sharply, that they may at length be
awakened out of their torpor. Hence the Prophet repeats the threatening which he
had often before announced, and says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel had been so smitten, that
their root had dried up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The comparison
is taken from a tree, which not only has had its branches cut off, but has also
been torn from the roots. The meaning is, that God would take such vengeance on
this miserable people, as wholly to destroy them, without any hope of recovery.
The root then is dried up, they will produce fruit no more.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then leaves this similitude or metaphor, and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they generate, I will slay the

though some seed be begotten, I will yet destroy it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then apprehend the design of the Prophet,
which was to show, that the Lord would no more be content with some moderate
punishment, for he had often found that this abandoned people were in vain
chastised by paternal love; but that extreme vengeance awaited them, which would
consume not only the men, but also their children so that no residue should
remain. The reason is afterwards added &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, as I have lately hinted, assigns a
reason why God had resolved to deal so severely with this people, namely because
he saw their unnameable perverseness. For the Prophets always defend the justice
of God against the impious complaints of those men who murmur whenever God
severely punishes them, and cry out that he is cruel, and exceeds moderation.
The Prophets do therefore shut up the mouth of the ungodly, that they may not
vomit out their blasphemies against God; and the Prophet is now on this subject.
Hence he says, that destruction was nigh the Israelites, because God had
rejected them; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sam</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mas,</i> means to reject, to cast away, to despise. As long then as the Lord
vouchsafed to care for this people, they possessed at least some eminence; but
the Prophet says that now they were wholly cast away. What then remained for
them but entire ruin?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My God will cast them
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By this expression he claims
authority to himself, and thunders against the whole people; for though the
whole worship of God was shamefully corrupted in the kingdom of Israel, they yet
boasted that they were the holy seed at Abraham, and the name of God was as yet
ready in every mouth, as we know that the ungodly take to themselves the liberty
of profaning the name of God without any hesitation or shame. Since then this
false glorying prevailed as yet among the Israelites, the Prophet says,
&#8220;He is no more your God, mine he is.&#8221; Thus he placed himself on one
side, and set himself alone in opposition to the whole people. But at the same
time he proves that he has more authority than they all; for he brings forward
God as the supporter and defender of his doctrine. &#8216;My God,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;will cast them away.&#8217; So also Isaiah says, when reproving
Ahab,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Is it not enough
that ye be troublesome to men, except ye be also troublesome to my God?&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
7:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet Isaiah was not the only one who worshipped
God purely. This is true; but he had respect to the king and his company; and
therefore he connected himself with God, and separated them all from himself,
inasmuch as they had already by their perfidy separated themselves from
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, &#8216;My God will cast them
away.&#8217; So at this day we may safely take the name of God in opposition to
the Papists; for they have nothing in common with the true God, since they have
polluted themselves with so many abominations: and though they may be proud
against us, trusting in their vast multitude, and because we are few; yet we may
boldly oppose them, since God, we know, can never be separated nor drawn away
from his word, and his word, we know, stands on our side. We may then lawfully
reprove the Papists, and say that God is opposed to them, for we fight under his
banner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have not obeyed
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We see that the cause of extreme
vengeance is perverseness; that is, when men designedly harden their hearts
against God. The Gentiles also perish, indeed, without any instruction; but
vengeance is doubled, when the Lord extends his hand to the erring, and seeks to
recall them to the way of salvation, and when they obstinately refuse to obey;
yea, when they show their heart to be perverse in their wickedness. When, then,
such perverseness is added to errors and vicious affections, God must
necessarily come forth with his extreme vengeance, as he threatens here by his
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, they obeyed not, the Lord will cast them
away, and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall be fugitives
among the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This seems to be a
lighter punishment than what he had previously stated respecting their seed
being destroyed. But we must remember the contrast between the rest given them
by God, and this vagrant wandering, of which the Prophet now speaks. The land of
Canaan was to them a quiet habitation, where they rested as though God cherished
them under his wings; and hence it is even called the rest of God in Psalm 95.
But now, when the Israelites wandered as fugitives, and sought rest here and
there, and could not find it, it was more evidently a rejection of them; for the
Lord proved, every day and every moment, that they were repudiated by him,
inasmuch as they were deprived of that rest which he had promised them. Let us

&#8220;to lay up.&#8221; This verb means also sometimes &#8220;to lie;&#8221; at
least some thus render the clause, &#8220;Fruit will lie to him:&#8221; and
though, in the sense of lying, it has a different final letter,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shue</i>, it is yet said to be derived from this root, so that there is a
change of </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;alef&#8221; into
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;he&#8221;, as grammarians think: and yet it
does not seem probable that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shua</i> means to lie. But they elicit this sense, &#8220;Israel is a
plundered vine; therefore fruit will lie to him;&#8221; that is, it will bring
no produce, for that will happen to it which is wont to be, when robbers have
laid waste fields and vineyards. But as I have said already, some more correctly
render it, &#8220;to lay up;&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will lay up fruit for
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some, however, read the
sentence as a question, &#8212; &#8220;Will Israel lay up fruit for
himself?&#8221; Then the sense is, that Israel was so plundered, that no
restitution could be hoped for. But these interpreters do not seem to understand
the mind of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I collect a different meaning from the words, and
that is, that Israel would lay up fruit for himself after the robbing, and
sacred history confirms this view: for this people, we know, had been in various
ways chastised; so, however, that they gathered new strength. For the Lord
intended only to admonish them gently, that they might be healed; but nothing,
as it has before appeared, was effected by God&#8217;s moderation. The case,
however, was so, that Israel produced new fruit, as a vine, after having been
robbed one year, brings forth a new vintage; for one ingathering does not kill
the vine. Thus also Israel did lay up fruit for himself; that is, after the Lord
had collected there his vintage, he again favoured the people with his blessing,
and, as it were, restored them anew; as vines in the spring throw out their
branches, and then produce fruit. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa41</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what did happen?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the abundance of his
fruit, he says, he multiplied his altars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here God complains, that Israel, after having been once gathered, went on in
his own wickedness. Chastisements ought at least to have availed so much as to
induce Israel to retake himself to the pure worship of God. But God not only
reproves the people here for having been always obstinate but also for having,
as it were designedly increased their vices. For it was like a horrible
conspiracy against God for the people, as soon as they acquired new strength, to
multiply altars to themselves, when yet the Lord had already shown, by clear
evidences, that fictitious modes. of worship did not please him; nay, that they
were to him the greatest abominations. We now apprehend the meaning of the
Prophet. Then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel, a robbed
vines multiplied altars for himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
that is, Israel has indeed been gathered but the Lord restored to him wealth and
abundance of provisions, and whatever appertains to a safe and happy condition;
has Israel become better through correction? Has he repented after the Lord has
so mercifully withdrawn his hand? By no means, he says; but he has multiplied
altars for himself, he has become worse than he was wont to be; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the goodness of his
land, he has been doing good in
statues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this is a very useful doctrine; for we see how
the Lord forbears in inflicting punishments &#8212; he does not execute them
with the utmost rigour; for as soon as he lays on a few stripes, he withholds
his hand. But how do they act who are thus moderately chastised? As soon as they
can recruit their spirits, they are carried away by a more headstrong
inclination, and grow insolent against God. We see this evil prevalent in the
world even in our day, as it has been in all ages. We need not wonder, then,
that the Prophet here expostulates with the people of Israel: but it is, at the
same time, right for us to apply the doctrine for our own instruction. Though,
then, the Lord should spare us, and, after having begun to chastise us, should
soon show indulgence, and restore us as it were anew, let us beware lest a
forgetfulness of our former sins should creep over us; but let his chastisements
exert over us an influence, even after God has put a limit and an end to them.
For the import of what the Prophet teaches is this, that men are not to forget
the wrath of God, though he may not always, or continually, lay on stripes, but
to consider that the Lord deals thus gently that they may have more time to
repents and that a truce is granted them that they may more quietly reflect on
their sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the goodness of
their land, they have been doing good in
statues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I have before stated, that some
take this as meaning, that they made good statues, and consider
&#8220;good&#8221; to be elegant. But I repeat the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;lamed&#8221; before altars. When the Prophet
said that Israel multiplied altars to himself, the literal reading is, that he
multiplied in altars, or as to altars; that is, he did much, or very liberally
spent money on altars. So also here, it is proper to repeat, that they did good
as to statues. But a concession is made in the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wbymyh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eithibu;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">; for it
is certain that they grievously sinned; they would not have provoked the wrath
of God had they not dealt wickedly in altars and statues. But the Prophet speaks
ironically of the perverted worship of God, as when we say at this day, that the
Papists are mad in their good intentions: when I call intentions good, I concede
to them a character which does not rightly belong to them. It is therefore
according to their sense that the Prophet speaks here; but he says, ironically,
that they did good in statues; that is, that they seemed to themselves to be the
most holy worshipers of God; for they made a show of great zeal. It was, as they
say, insane devotion. But there appeared here something more than blind
hardness, inasmuch as they had so soon forgotten the Lord&#8217;s displeasure,
of which they had been reminded by evident tokens. We now then perceive the
object of the Prophet, and what is the application of his doctrine. Let us go on

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their heart was
divided</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, from God; for this, we
know, is principally required, that people should faithfully cleave to their
God. &#8220;And now Israel, what does thy God require of thee, but to cleave to
him with the whole heart?&#8221; Since God then binds us to himself by a holy
union, it is the summit of all wickedness, when our heart is divided from him,
as it is when an unchaste and perfidious wife alienates her affection from her
husband. For as long as the husband keeps the heart of his wife, as it were,
tied to himself, conjugal fidelity and chastity continue; but when her heart is
divided from her husband, it is all over, and she abandons herself to lewdness.
So also the Prophet says here that the heart of the people was divided from God;
for they did not devote themselves to God with a pure and sincere affection, as
they ought to have done. &#8220;This people then have withdrawn their heart from
me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,

<i>ahsem,</i> is not to be referred to the deeds but rather, as, they say, to
its manifestation. Then he says that they shall be guilty, for they shall be
convicted: as, to be justified means to be absolved, so also to be guilty means
to be condemned. The meaning is, that as this people could not perceive the
Lord&#8217;s wrath as long as their condition was easy to be borne, he would
inflict such dreadful punishment as would convince them, so that they might no
longer deceive and flatter themselves. They shall then be now condemned. How?
For the Lord </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will overturn their
altars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This may be referred to the
minister of vengeance; but as no name is expressed, I prefer to understand God

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
or reduce to nothing, their statues.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This was added, because ungodly men, we know, trust
in their own devices, and can never be brought to serious fear, except when they
understand that they have been deceived by the crafts of Satan, while they gave
themselves up to superstitions and idolatry. Hence the Prophet declares that
their altars shall be overturned, and their statues reduced to nothing, that
hypocrites might lay aside the confidence by which they had hitherto grown proud
against God. But a confirmation of this view follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He explains more at large what he had briefly
referred to, when he said, that the condemnation, which would discover their
wickedness, was now near at hand. He now adds, that even they themselves would,
of their own accord, say, that they were deservedly punished in being deprived
of a king; nay, that a king would avail them nothing, because they had not
feared Jehovah. There is always to be understood a contrast between the perverse
boasting of the people and the feeling of God&#8217;s wrath, of which the
Prophet now speaks. For as long as God spared the Israelites, they abused his
forbearance and his kindness. They did not then think that there was any thing
to be reprehended in their life; nay, we know how petulantly they contended with
the Prophets: as soon as a severe word came out of the mouth of any Prophet,
great contentions arose. &#8220;What! dost thou treat thus the people of God,
and the elect race of Abraham?&#8221; Since, then, they so obstinately spurned
every instruction, the Prophet says here, &#8220;The time shall come, when they
shall say that they have no king, because they did not fear the Lord.&#8221; The
meaning is, that as they did not profit by the word of the Lord, another kind of
teaching was soon to be adopted; for the Lord would really show his wrath, and
even force them to confess against their will what they now excused: for this
confession of sin would have never been expressed, had not the Lord dealt
severely with them. They shall therefore say, &#8212; when? even when they shall
be taken to another school; for the Lord will not henceforth remonstrate with
them in words, but will so strike them with his hand, that they will understand
that they have to do with him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be observed, that the Prophet speaks not
here of the repentance of the people, nor relates their words, but rather
mentions the thing itself. Hypocrites either clamour against God when he visits
their sins, or feignedly own that they are worthy of such punishments, and all
the while the same perverseness remains within. But when the Prophet introduces
them as speaking, he does not mean that they will say what he relates; but, as I
have said already, he rather speaks of the thing itself. Hence <i>They will
say,</i> that is, the event itself will declare, that they are deprived of a
king, because they feared not Jehovah; yea, that though a king ruled over them,
he would be useless. Though, then, the Israelites had never ceased to clamour
against God, nor given over openly to vomit forth their blasphemies against him,
yet this, which the Prophet says, would have been still true. How so? Because it
was sufficient that they were in reality convicted, though God had not extorted
from them this confession; yea, they were themselves made to feel that they were
justly smitten by the hand of God, however they might obstinately deny this
before men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here also, that profane men, while
any hope on earth is set before them, proudly despise the hand of God, and grow
torpid in their own security, as in their own dregs. While Israel saw their king
in the midst of them, they thought themselves safe from every harm, and boldly
despised all threatening. This, then, is what the Prophet meant. Still further,
when the Lord takes away every thing that dazzles the eyes of profane and wicked
men, they then begin to own how foolishly they had flattered themselves, and how
much they had been deceived by Satan. This is what is meant by Hosea, when he
says, that the Israelites shall be constrained to know that they had no king,
because they feared not God: but this repentance would be too late, for it would
be without advantage. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

give this explanation, that they daringly followed their own counsels, as the
despisers of God are wont to settle and determine what comes to their minds
according to their own will; for they deign not to inquire of God what is right.
Thus they take the meaning to be; but I view it to be different, that is, that
they spoke words, or very freely testified, that they would be the best and the
most faithful worshipers of God. Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By swearing

<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they swore

because there was in them much levity and changeableness. And, indeed, I confess
it to be true, that they procured for themselves grievous punishments by their
perjuries; but the Prophet rather means those who swore falsely to the Lord. It
then follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By cutting a
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> by making a covenant. Here
again the Prophet no doubt reproves them for renewing their covenant with God
perfidiously; for it was a mere dissimulation. But it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judgement will germinate as
wormwood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8221;.</i> Some render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ark</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>carash</i> as gall; but the similitude is not suitable, since the Prophet
speaks here of fields; for he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the furrows of the
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, judgement will germinate
in the furrows as wormwood or some other bitter plant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have thus briefly explained how some understand
this verse, namely, that Israel was daring and haughty in their counsels, boldly
determining whatever pleased them, as if it were not in the power of God to
change what men resolve to do, &#8212; and then, that they implicated themselves
in many compacts, that without any faith they violated them with this and that
nation, and that at last they had nothing but bitterness. This is their
exposition: but I rather think that the cause of God is here pleaded by the
Prophet; that is, that the Israelites, as often as they promised some
repentance, and gave some sign of it, only dissembled and lied to God. Hence he
says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have spoken
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> but they were only words; for
they were never from a heart touched with any feeling as to God&#8217;s wrath,
so as to abhor themselves for their vices. They therefore uttered words
only.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards expresses the same deceitfulness in
other words: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have sworn
falsely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says, and made a covenant;
which means, that though they seemed to wish to return to God, it was yet a
fallacious pretence; yea, a perjury. When they wished to prove themselves to be
especially faithful, they then sinned more grievously by renewing their
covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judgement
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>germinate as wormwood in the
furrows of the field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Judgement is here
to be taken as rectitude, as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;When they
exhibit some appearance of religion, and give a colour to their impieties, it
seems indeed to be judgement, there seems to be some justice; but it will be at
last wormwood, and will germinate in the furrows of the
field.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters seem not to me to have understood the
design of the Prophet. For why does he say, &#8220;in the furrows of the
field,&#8221; rather than in the field? Even for this reason, because there is
some preparation made, when the field is sloughed, for the good seed to grow.
When therefore, noxious herbs grow on the furrows of the land, it is less to be
endured than when they grow in dry and desert places; for this is what is wont
naturally to happen. But when wormwood grows up instead of wheat in the furrows,
that is, on lands well cultivated, it is a thing more strange and less to be
endured. We now then apprehend what the Prophet meant. They indeed seemed at
times to be touched with some feeling of piety, and promised much, and were very
liberal in good words; they even swore, and seemed prepared to renew their
covenant with God, &#8212; but what was all this? It was the same as if a
husband man had prepared his field, and noxious herbs had grown up where he had
bestowed much labour and toil. Such was their rectitude, &#8212; a disguised
form or shadow of religion; it was nothing else, but like wormwood growing in
well-cultivated land.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I shall first briefly touch on what I have mentioned

<i>gur,</i> signifies to be banished: and it means also to fear; but the

in thinking that the whole hope of safety was included in them. How so?
&#8220;They are constrained&#8221; he says, &#8220;to weep for the exile of
their calf; so far is it from being able to bring them any aid, that the
citizens of Samaria in vain deplore its captivity.&#8221; By way of contempt, he
calls the calves, heifers. He might have used the masculine gender; but the
whole of the verse glances at the madness of the people of Israel, because they
were so grossly delirious in their superstitions, and yet were wholly
insensible. Then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants
of Samaria shall fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for the calves of
Bethaven, because idolaters, when they see some danger to their idols, tremble,
and would gladly bring aid; and this very fear betrays their stupidity and
madness. For why do not the gods help themselves, instead of expecting help from
mortals? We now understand the design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will mourn over
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The number is here changed. He had
said, &#8220;because of the heifers;&#8221; and now he expresses the kind by
putting down a relative of the masculine gender
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. He
therefore returns to &#8220;calves,&#8221; and afterwards uses the singular
number; for there was one only at Bethaven, the other was at Dan. But we have
already shown why the Prophet called them heifers.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrmk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>camerim</i>, priests were called by this terms because they put on black
vestments in celebrating their rites; for the word &#8220;kemer&#8221; means
black; but this is a vain conjecture: and the Rabbis, as it often appears, are
very bold in their figments; for they regard not what is true, but only make
conjectures, and wish that whatever comes to their minds to be counted as
oracular; nor do they regard history, but advance without reason what pleases
them. Another explanation of the word may be adduced, and one in my judgement
more probable; for the word signifies also to ring again or to resound; and the
priests, we know, made, in performing their services, great noises and howling;
as Elijah says</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Cry aloud, for

<div><font face="Palatino">If their conjecture is allowable, I would rather say
that they were called by this word on account of the noise they made. But I
leave the thing undecided. It was, however, a name commonly in use, as it
appears from other places. For by this name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrmk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>camerim</i> were those new priests called, whom Josiah took away, as it is
related in 2 Kings 23. But whether they had this name from their noises, or the
black colour of their vestments, it is still certain that they were the priests
of false gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now says, that the priests also shall
mourn, for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lba</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>abel,</i> is to be repeated. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wdwbkAl[

who exult for it. But why should they mourn? They shall mourn for its glory,
because it had departed: they shall now begin to mourn, because the glory of the
calf had passed away from it. Here the Prophet teaches that the glorying, by
which hypocrites deceive themselves, will not be permanent; for the Lord will
surely lead them, as we shall see, to sudden and unexpected shame. He then says
that there would be mourning for the calves among the citizens of Samaria. They
indeed thought that the kingdom was well fortified, for they had erected temples
in their borders, to be, as it were, their fortresses. They hence imagined
themselves to be safe from every incursion of enemies. The Prophet says,
&#8220;Nay, they shall mourn for their calf.&#8221; How so? Truly its own people
shall mourn for it. He goes farther, and calls all its worshipers, the people of
the calf: and we know that the whole kingdom of Israel was implicated in that
superstition. Yea, he says, even the priests, who exult for it, shall mourn.
Why? Because its glory shall depart from it. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet expresses more clearly the cause of
mourning to the priests and to the whole
people,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> The
calf</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be carried

to king Jareb&#8221;. It is probable, that when extreme danger came, the king of
Israel was constrained either to cast the calf into a new form, or to break it
in pieces, to redeem peace from the Assyrian king. As then the whole kingdom was
reduced to great want, we may infer from this place that the calf or calved were
carried into Assyria for pacifying the king. Since then the Israelites saw that
they were stripped of their protection, (for they were now without any hope of
safety, as there was no God among them,) the Prophet mentioned above their
grief: but he now shows that exile was nigh at hand, not only to the Israelites,
but also to the calves which they worshipped and by whose aid they thought
themselves to be secure and safe in their country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a particular emphasis in the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam</i>, as though the Prophet said, &#8220;Not only the Israelites shall
migrate, but the very calf shall also be carried into Assyria.&#8221; Of the
word &#8220;Jareb,&#8221; we have spoken in the Hosea 5, it seems to have been
the proper name of a man. Some conjecture it to be a city in Assyria, though not
noticed by writers. Others think it to be the name of a neighbouring king to the
Assyrian, but without reason, and they are refuted by this very passage; for the
Prophet doubtless points out here the Assyrian king. He yet calls him Jareb; it
may be that he was as yet a private man, or he may have so called him by way of
reproach. This is however uncertain. Jerome renders the word,
&#8220;avenger.&#8221; But it is sufficiently evident that it was a proper name,
not of a city or place, but, as it has been said, of a man. And I am disposed to
think, that he calls him king Jareb by way of contempt, for this contempt
prevailed among the Israelites as long as they thought themselves strong enough
to resist. But the Lord afterwards checked this pride: hence the Prophet says
now in a cutting manner, &#8220;The calf shall be carried into Assyria to pacify
king Jareb.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim shall receive
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or reproach;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel shall be made ashamed of
his counsel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He says the same thing in
different ways and not without reason; for it was difficult at first to persuade
the Israelites that what they thought to have been wisely contrived would turn
out to their shame. The king Jeroboam the first, when he erected temples did
indeed think it the best device to prevent the people, were they to repent, from
submitting themselves again to the posterity of David. Hence he thought that the
ten tribes were wholly torn away, when he set up that peculiar worship, which
had nothing in common with that of the tribe of Judah. And doubtless had the ten
tribes worshipped the true God at Jerusalem, this union might have been the
means of again reuniting them into one body under one head. Hence the king
Jeroboam thought that he had provided well for his kingdom, to render it
permanent, by cutting off all communication between the two people: and there
was none in Israel who did not approve of this counsel; for they took delight in
their wealth, in the number of their men, and in other advantages. Since then
the kingdom of Judah was much inferior, the Israelites were vastly pleased with
themselves. This is the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim shall receive shame;
Israel shall be made ashamed of his counsel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But this, as I have said, could not appear credible at first. For men
promise to themselves the success they wish in their own craftiness: and hence
it comes also, that they dare to attempt any thing they please without the aid
of God. This is the reason why the Prophet repeats the same sentence,
&#8220;Ephraim,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall receive shame; Israel shall be made
ashamed,&#8221; &#8212; for what? for their counsel. They think that their own
counsel will be most useful to them; yea, they place their safety in their own
craftiness. But the Lord will overrule for their shame whatever they have
devised. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, nor ought
it to be deemed a useless prolixity. It would have indeed been sufficient by one
word to threaten the Israelites, had they been pliable and obedient; but as they
were stupid in their perverseness, it was necessary to stun their ears with
continual threatening, that they might be at least less excusable before God.
Hence the Prophet says now, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king of Samaria shall be cut
off like the foam</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and he thus speaks of
the king, because the Israelites thought their king, next to their idols, to be
to them an invincible fortress. For thus ungodly men, as it has been mentioned
before, always imagine their stronghold to be in the world and earthly things.
Hence, the Lord denounces a just punishment, by saying that he would cut off the
king; for the impious confidence, of which I have spoken, could not be otherwise
corrected. Therefore &#8220;the king of Samaria shall be cut off&#8221; &#8212;
in what manner? &#8220;Like a foam&#8221;. It is a most apt comparison; for the
Prophet shows that the condition of the kingdom, which they imagined to be firm
and perpetual, had nothing in it but an empty appearance, like the foam, which
has nothing substantial. And further, he seems to me to point out another thing,
that is, that the kingdom, though it showed itself to be above other kingdoms,
was yet but an excrement. The foam floats above the waters of the sea, and by
its height seems eminent; but what is the foam but the excrement of the water?
for whatever is decayed in the waters passes into foam. So Israel thought, that
as they were endued with power, and in every way excelled the tribe of Judah,
they could ride, as it were, over their heads. The Prophet, on the contrary,
says that they were foam, and also their king. &#8220;Your king,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;though the king of Judah cannot be compared with him, is yet a foam. By
his height he seems indeed wonderful, and hence has arisen your pride, for you
are now become hardened against God; but the Lord will cut him off like a
foam.&#8221; The Prophet then not only compares the king of Israel to a bubble
or to foaming waters; but he says, that with respect to the king of Judah, he is
an excrement. We now then understand the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We see how much the Prophet dwells on one thing: but,
as I have already said, there was need of a strong hammer to beat this iron; for
the hearts of the people were iron, or even steel. This hardness could not then
be broken except with violence. This is the reason why the Prophet goes on with
his threatening and places before their eyes in so many forms the vengeance of
God; of which it would have been enough for him briefly to remind them, had they
not been so perverse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And first he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The high places of Aven have
perished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or shall perish. He now calls
Bethel Aven, as he called it before Bethaven. We have stated the reason for
changing the name. Jeroboam might indeed have disguised the worship, which he
had profanely introduced by this pretext, that God had appeared in that place to
holy Jacob, and we know its name was given to it by God: but in the meantime, as
the people had made a wrong use of the Patriarch&#8217;s example, the place was
called Bethaven. Bethaven, we know, is the house of iniquity; as though the
Prophet had said, &#8220;God dwells not in this place, as superstitious men
imagine; but it has been corrupted by ungodly worshipers.&#8221; He therefore
says, &#8220;The high places of Aven;&#8221; that is, of impiety. But it may be
expedient to repeat here what we have before said, namely, that when men
degenerate from the pure teaching of God, they in vain cover their profanations
with empty names, as we see the Papists doing at this day; for they adorn that
profanation, the Mass, with the title of Sacrament, as if it was something
allied to it. They wish even their own Mass to be regarded as the Holy Supper,
as if it were in their power to abolish what has been prescribed by the Son of
God, and to substitute in its place their own inventions. Hence, how much soever
the Papists may dignify their profanations with honourable names they effect
nothing. How so? Because God loudly proclaims respecting Bethel that it is
Bethaven; and the reason is well known, because Jeroboam erected temples, and
appointed new sacrifices, without God&#8217;s command. Whenever, then, men
depart from the word of the Lord, it will avail them nothing to disguise their
own dreams; for the Lord approves of nothing but what he himself commands. Hence
the high places of Aven have perished, or &#8220;shall
perish.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sin of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This sentence, placed in
apposition, belongs to the former. What is meant is, The sin of Israel shall
perish. But, as it was said yesterday, the Israelites thought that they
performed a service acceptable to God; and hence it was that they were so
sedulously attentive to their holy rites; but God, on the contrary, pronounced
them to be sin. How so? Because it is profanation and idolatry in men to leave
off following God&#8217;s command, and to give way to their own fancies and
inventions. We must then understand, that it is not in the power of men to form
any modes of worship they please; nor is it in their power to decide on this or
that worship, whether it be lawful or spurious; but nothing remains for us but
to attend to what the Lord says. When, therefore, the Lord pronounces that to be
profane which pleases us, we ought to acquiesce in his judgement; for it does
not become us to dispute with him, and it would be vain to do
so.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The thorn and the
thistle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall come up on their
altars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It may be asked, Ought the
Prophet simply, by these tokens, to have reproved the superstition of the
people, seeing that the same thing happened to the temple a short time after,
though not built by the counsel of men, but by that of God? Since, then, the
grass grew where the temple was, was not that worship, which we know was founded
by God, exposed to ridicule? It is only the same that can be said of the calves.
We grant that the calves were carried into Assyria, as a price from the wretched
Israelites to pacify the king, who was angry with them. Was not the ark of the
covenant taken also into captivity by enemies? Did not king Nebuchadnezzar take
away the vessels of the temple? And was not pious Hezekiah constrained to strip
the doors of the temple of their ornaments? Then this seems not to have been
fitly spoken by the Prophet. The answer to all this may be readily given: The
Israelites promised to themselves what they saw, and found afterwards to be vain
as is the case with hypocrites, who securely despise all judgements and all
punishments. How so? Because they thought their own perverted worship to be
sufficient for their safety; though they were in their whole life abominable yet
as some form of religion was observed by them, they thought that God was bound
to be with them: such and so supine was the security of that people. Very
different was the case with the tribe of Judah. For God, by his Prophets,
proclaimed aloud, &#8220;Trust not in words of falsehood; for ye boast
continually, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4,) but I no longer dwell in that temple:&#8221; and Ezekiel saw the glory of
the Lord departing elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
10:4.) What is said here could not then apply to the temple, nor to the true and
lawful altar, nor to the true worshipers of God; but the Prophet justly
reproaches the Israelites for expecting safety from their own altars, while yet
they were provoking God&#8217;s wrath against themselves by such inventions. We
ought, then to remember this difference between the tribe of Judah and the ten
tribes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall say to the mountains,
Cover us: end to the hills, Fall on us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this
form of speaking, the Prophet intended to express the dreadful vengeance of God;
as if he had said, that the destruction, which was at hand, would be so grievous
that it would be better to perish a hundred times than to remain in that state
alive. For when men say to hills, Fall on us, and to mountains, Cover us, they
doubtless desire a death too dreadful to be spoken of; but it is the same as if
the Prophet had said, that life and light, and the sight of the sun and the
common air, would become a horror to them, for they would perceive the hand of
God to be against them. And further, it is a sign of extreme despair, when men
willingly seek the abyss, where they may sink to avoid the presence of God and
present destruction. And hence Christ has also transferred this passage to set
forth the last judgement, of which he speaks, &#8212; &#8216;They shall say to
the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us;&#8217; that is, what was
once said by the Prophet shall then be again fulfilled; that the wicked will
prefer a hundred deaths to one life; for both light and the vital air will be
hated and detested by them; because they will perceive themselves to be
oppressed by the dreadful hand of God. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He here reproaches Israel for having been long inured
in their sins, and not for being lately corrupted. This is the substance. He had
said in the last chapter that they were deep in their sins, as in the days of
Gibeah: we then explained why the Prophet adduced the example of Gibeah, and
that was, because the Gibeonites had fallen away from all fear of God, as if not
a word about the law had ever been heard among them. We indeed know that they
abandoned themselves to filthy and monstrous lusts, like the inhabitants of
Sodom and Gomorra. Seeing, then, that so great obscenity prevailed openly and
with impunity in Gibeah, rightly did the Prophet say that the Israelites were
then lost and past hope, as the case was at that time. But now he regards
another thing, even this, &#8212; that from that time they had not ceased to
accumulate evils on evils, and thus to spin, as it were, a continuous rope of
iniquity, as it is said in another place, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of Gibeah hast thou, Israeli
sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this seems an unjust charge; for we know that the
whole people united together against the tribe of Benjamin. Since, then, the
Israelites revenged that wickedness which was committed in the city of Gibeah,
why does the Prophet bring against them the crime of which they had been the
avengers? But we know that it often happens, that they who execute the vengeance
of God are in no respect better; and we had a remarkable example of this at the
beginning in Jehu; for he had been God&#8217;s minister in punishing
superstitions; yet God calls him a robber, and compares the vengeance he
executed to robbery; &#8216;I will avenge,&#8217; he says, &#8216;on the head of
Jehu the blood of the house of Ahab, which he has shed.&#8217; And yet we know
that he was armed with the sword of God. This is indeed true; but he acted not
with a sincere and upright heart, for he afterwards followed the same example.
So now the Prophet says, that the Israelites had sinned even from that time; as
though he said, &#8220;The Lord by the hand of your fathers took vengeance on
the Gibeonites and on the whole tribe of Benjamin: but they were wholly like
them. This corruption has from that time overwhelmed, like a deluge, the whole
land of Israel. There is then no reason for you to boast that you have been
better, inasmuch as it afterwards fully appeared what you were, for you imitated
the Gibeonites.&#8221; We now then understand the design of the Prophet, and how
justly he brings this charge against the Israelites, that they had sinned from
the days of Gibeah. They indeed thought that crime was confined to a small
corner of the land; but the Prophet says that the whole land was covered with
it, and that they all exposed themselves to God&#8217;s judgement, and deserved
the same punishment with the Gibeonites and their brethren, the whole tribe of
Benjamin. &#8216;Thou, Israel, hast then sinned from the days of Gibeah:&#8217;
the Israelites said, that the Benjamites alone sinned; but that sin, he says was
common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There they
stood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This clause is variously
explained. Some think that the people are reproved for wishing to retreat after
having twice fought without success. We hence see that their minds were soft and
cowardly, since they so soon succumbed to their trial. They therefore think that
this want of confidence is pointed out by the Prophet; &#8216;There they
stood,&#8217; he says, that is, retreated from the battle; for as they did not
succeed as they wished, they thought that they had been deceived. Hence it is
concluded, that they did not ascribe his just honour to God, and were on this
account reprehensible. But others say, that God had then testified by a clear
proof that the Israelites were equal in guilt to the Gibeonites; for how came
it, they say, that when they engaged in battle, they were compelled twice to
retreat? All Israel were armed against one tribe; how then was it that they did
not immediately overcome? But the Benjamites, we know, were not at last
conquered without a great loss. It is then certain that God plainly showed that
the Israelites were unworthy of so honourable an office; for the Israelites
wished to execute God&#8217;s judgement, when they were themselves equally
wicked. The Lord then openly reminded them, that it was not for them to turn
their zeal against others, when they were no less guilty themselves. It seems to
others that their obstinacy is here pointed out: &#8216;There they stood;&#8217;
that is, from that time they have been perverse in their wickedness, and
&#8216;the battle against the children of iniquity did not lay hold on
them.&#8217; This third exposition is what I mostly approve; that is, that the
Israelites, when they became ungodly and wicked, though they professed great
zeal and ardour against the tribe of Benjamin, did not yet cease from that time
to conduct themselves perversely against God, so that they at last arrived at
the highest pitch of impiety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The battle in Gibea against the
children of iniquity did not lay hold on
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> may also be variously explained.
Some say, that the Israelites ought not to have defended themselves with this
shield, that God had so severely punished the Gibeonites and their kindred.
&#8220;The Lord spared you once, but what then? He has deferred his vengeance
for a long time; but will he on that account deal more mildly with you now? Nay,
a heavier vengeance awaits you; for from that time he has not forced repentance
out of you.&#8221; But others read the sentence as a question, &#8220;Has the
battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity laid hold on you?&#8221; But
the simple sense of the words seems to me to be this, that the battle had not
laid hold on the Israelites, because they had not been touched by that example.
The judgements of God, we know, are set forth before our eyes, that each of us
may apply them for our own benefit. The Prophet now reproves the neglect of the
Israelites in this matter, because they disregarded the event as a thing of no
moment. Hence the battle did not lay hold on them; that is, they did not
perceive that they were warned at the expense of others to repent, and to live
afterwards a holier and purer life in subjection to God. And this view is
confirmed by the last clause, &#8220;against the children of iniquity;&#8221;
for why is this expressly added by the Prophet, except that the Lord testified
that they should not be unpunished, who were like the Gibeonites, with whom he
dealt so rigidly and severely. Since, then, the Israelites had not been touched,
their stupidity was hence proved. And for the same reason Paul says, that the
wrath of God shall come on the children of disobedience or of unbelief,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:6:) for when God takes vengeance on one people or on one man, he doubtless
shows himself in that particular judgement to be the judge of the world. This
seems to me to be the genuine meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought further to bear in mind, that when men go on
in their wickedness, whatever sins their fathers have done are justly imputed to
them. When we return to the right way, the Lord instantly buries all our sins,
and reconciles us to himself on this condition, that he will pardon whatever
fault there may be in us: though we may, through our whole life, have provoked
his wrath against us, he will yet as I have said, instantly bury the whole. But
if we repent not, the Lord will remember, not only our own sins, but also those
of our fathers, as it is evident from what is here said by the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When God says that he desires to chastise the people,
he intimates that this was his purpose, as when one greatly wishes for anything;
and it may be an allowable change in the sentence, if the copulative was
omitted, and it be rendered thus, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is in my desire to chastise
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But to depart from the words seems
not to me necessary; I therefore take them apart as they stand, in this sense,
&#8212; that God would follow his desire in chastising the people. The sentence
seems indeed to be repugnant to many others, in which God declares his sorrow,
when constrained to deal severely with his people, but the two statements are
not discordant. Passions, we know, belong not to God; but in condescension to
men&#8217;s capacities, he puts on this or that character. When he seems
unwilling to indict punishment, he shows with how much love he regards his own
people, or with what kind and tender affection he loves them. But yet, as he has
to do with perverse and irreclaimable men, he says that he will take pleasure in
their destruction; and for this reason also, it is said that God will take
revenge. We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet: he intimates, that
the purpose which God had formed of destroying the people of Israel could not
now be revoked; for this punishment was to him his highest
delight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will chastise them, and
assembled shall peoples be against them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
By these words God shows that all people are in his hand, that he can arm them
whenever he pleases; and this truth is everywhere taught in the Scriptures. God
then so holds all people under his command, that by a hiss or a nod he can,
whenever it pleases him, stir them up to war. Hence, as heedless Israel laughed
at God&#8217;s judgement, he now shows how effectual will be his revenge, for he
will assemble all people for their destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And for the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they shall have bound
themselves in two furrows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By this
clause the Prophet warns the Israelites, that nothing would avail them, though
they fortified themselves against every danger, and though they gathered
strength on every side; for all their efforts would not prevent God from
executing his vengeance. When therefore they shall be bound in their two
furrows, I will not on that account give over to assemble the people who shall
dissipate all their fortresses. We now apprehend the design of the Prophet. He
no doubt mentions two furrows, with reference to sloughing; for we shall see
that the Prophet dwells on this metaphor. However much then the Israelites might
join together and gather strength, it would yet be easy for God to gather people
to destroy them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some refer this sentence to the whole body of the
people; for they think that the compact between the kingdom of Judah and Israel
is here pointed out: but this is a mere conjecture, for history gives it no
countenance. Others have found out another comment, that the Lord would punish
them all together, since Judah had joined the people of Israel in worshipping
the calves: so they think that the common superstition was the bond of alliance
between the two kingdoms. There are others who think that the Prophet alludes to
the two calves, one of which, as it is well known, was worshipped in Dan, and
the other at Bethel. But all these interpretations are too refined and strained.
The Prophet, I doubt not, does here simply mention the two furrows, because the
people, (as godless men are wont to do,) relying on their own power, boldly and
proudly despised all threatening. &#8220;Howsoever,&#8221; he says, &#8220;they
may join themselves together in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two
furrows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>they shall yet effect nothing
by their pride to prevent me from executing my vengeance.&#8221; Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">Some read the two words, &#8220;taught,&#8221; and

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdmlm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melamde,</i> and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytbha</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aebti</i>; for they think that at the beginning of the verse a reproach is
conveyed, as though the Prophet had said, that Ephraim was wholly unteachable:
though God had from childhood brought him up under his discipline, he yet now
showed so great stubbornness, that he even ceased not to rebel against God, and
went on obstinately in his own wickedness. &#8220;Ephraim then is like a trained
heifer.&#8221; But this meaning seems too far fetched: I therefore connect the
whole together in one context, and follow what has been more approved,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim is a heifer trained to
love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, that she may love,
<i>threshing;</i> that is, Ephraim has been accustomed to love
threshing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is here an implied comparison between ploughing
and threshing. There is more labour and toil, we know, in ploughing than in
threshing; for the oxen are coupled together, and then they are compelled to
obey, and in vain do they draw here and there, when they are joined together.
But when oxen thresh, they are loose, and the labour is less toilsome and heavy.
The Prophet then means this, &#8212; that Ephraim pretended some obedience, and
yet would not take the yoke, so as to be really and in everything submissive to
God. Other nations did not understand what it was to obey God; but there was
some appearance of religion in Israel; they indeed professed to worship the God
of Israel, they had temples among them; but the Lord derides this hypocrisy, and
says, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim is like a
heifer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> which will not submit her neck
to the yoke, but will only, for recreation&#8217;s sake, pass through the
threshing-floor and tread the corn, as hypocrites are wont to do; for they do
not wholly repudiate every truth, but in part receive it; yet, when the Lord
presses on them too much, they then fiercely resist, and show that they wish to
do according to their own will. Almost the whole world exhibit, indeed, some
appearance of obedience, I know not what; but they wish to make a compact with
God, that he should not require more then what their pleasure may allow. When
one is a slave to many vices, he desires a liberty for these to be allowed him;
in other things, he will yield some obedience. We now understand the meaning of
the Prophet, and see what he had in view. He then derides the hypocritical
service which the Israelites rendered to God; for they were at the same time
unwilling to bear the yoke, and were untameable. To the threshing they were not
unwilling to come; for when God commanded anything that was easy, they either
willingly performed it, or at least discharged their duty somehow in that
particular; but they would not accustom themselves to slough.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since it was so,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have passed
over</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon her beautiful
neck</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God shows why he treated Ephraim
with severity; for he was made to submit, because he was so obstinate. &#8216;I
have passed over upon the goodness of her neck;&#8217; that is, &#8220;When I
saw that she had a fat neck, and that she refused the yoke, I tried, by
afflictions, whether such stubbornness could be subdued.&#8221; Some refer this
to the teaching of the law, and say, that God had passed over upon the beautiful
neck of Israel, because he had delivered his law in common to all the posterity
of Abraham. But this is foreign to the context. I therefore doubt not but that
the mind of the Prophet was this, &#8212; that God here declares, that it was
not without reason that he had been so severe in endeavouring to tame Israel,
for he saw that he could not be otherwise brought to obedience. &#8220;Since,
then, Ephraim only loved the treading, I wished to correct this delusion, and
ought not to have spared him. If he had been a wearied ox, or an old one broken
down and emaciated, and of no strength, some consideration for him ought to have
been had: but as Israel had a thick and fat neck, as he was strong enough to
bear the yoke, and as he yet loved his own pleasures and refused the yoke, it
was needful that he should be tamed by afflictions.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passed over upon the
goodness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or the beauty,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
neck</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of Ephraim.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as God effected nothing in mildly chastising
Israel, he now subjoins, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make him to
ride</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some render it, &#8220;I will
ride:&#8221; but as the verb is in Hiphel, (the causative mood,) it is necessary
to explain it thus, that God will make Israel to ride. But what does this mean?
They who render it, &#8220;I will ride,&#8221; saw that they departed from what
grammar requires; but necessity forced them to this strained interpretation.
Others will have
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol</i>, one to be understood, &#8220;I will make to ride on Ephraim,&#8221;
and they put in another word, &#8220;I will make the nations to ride on
Ephraim.&#8221; But the sentence will accord best with the context, if we make
no change in the words of the Prophet. Nay, they who adduce the comments I have
mentioned, destroy the elegance of the expression and pervert the meaning. Thus,
then, does God speak, &#8212; &#8220;Since Ephraim loves treading, and the
moderate punishments by which I meant to subdue him avail nothing, I will
hereafter deal with him in another way:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,&#8221;</i> he says, <i>&#8220;to
ride:&#8221;</i> that is, &#8220;I will take him away, as it were, through the
clouds.&#8221; The Prophet alludes to the lasciviousness and intemperance of
Israel; for lust had so carried away that people, that they could not walk
straight, or with a steady step, but staggered here and there; as also Jeremiah
says, that they were unnameable bullocks,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:18.) What does God declare? &#8216;I will make them to ride;&#8217; that is,
I will deal with this people according to their disposition. There is a similar
passage in Job 30; where the holy man complains that he was forcibly snatched
away, that God made him to ride on the clouds. &#8216;God,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;made me to ride,&#8217; (he uses there the same word.) What does it mean?
Even that the Lord had forcibly carried him here and there. So also the Prophet
says here, &#8212; &#8220;Israel is delicate, and, at the same time, I see so
much voluptuousness in his nature, that he cannot take the yoke; nothing then
remains for him but to ride on the clouds. But what sort of riding will this be?
Such as that, when the people shall be carried away into exile; since they
cannot rest quietly in the land of Canaan, since they cannot enjoy the blessings
of God, they shall ride, that is, they shall quickly be taken away into a far
country.&#8221; We now then see how God dealt with Israel, when he saw what his
disposition required; for he could not be constrained to obedience in his own
land; it was then necessary to remove him elsewhere, as it was
done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah shall plough, Jacob shall
harrow for himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, the
remaining portion of the people shall remain in their afflictions. These
punishments were indeed grievous, when considered in themselves; but it was far
easier and more tolerable for Judah to plough and to harrow among his people,
than if he had to ride. Judah then suffered grievous losses, and the Lord
chastised him also with afflictions; but this punishment, as I have said, was
much less than the other. It was the same as when an ox, drawn out of the stall,
is led into the field, and is forced to endure his daily labour; his toil is
indeed heavy and grievous; but the ox at least lives after his work, and
refreshes himself by his rest during the night. He also undergoes some toil by
harrowing, and grows weary; but he returns to the stall; and then his master is
not so cruel, but that he grants his ox some indulgence. We hence see the
purport of this comparison, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah shall
plough</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
that is, the remaining part of the people,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
harrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which means, that the rest of
the people shall break the clods, &#8212; for to harrow among the Latins is to
break the clods &#8212; but that the Lord will make Ephraim to ride. This, I
doubt not, is the genuine sense of the passage; but I leave to others their own
free judgement. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The reason is here found, why I thought that the
Prophet did not simply exhort the people, but rather charged them with obduracy
for not growing better, though often admonished. He then relates how much God
had previously done to restore the people to a sound mind; for it had been his
constant teaching, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sow for
yourselves righteousness, reap, in proportion,
kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or according to the proportion
of kindness; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plough a ploughing
for yourselves; it is the time to seek the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Though then the people heard these
words daily, and had their ears almost stunned by them, they did not yet change
for the better, nor made themselves pliable; nay, as it were with a fixed
purpose, they ploughed, he says, ungodliness, they reaped iniquity; they
therefore did eat the fruit of falsehood, for they sustained just punishments,
or satiated themselves with falsehood and treachery. We now apprehend the
meaning of the Prophet: I will come to particulars.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sow for yourselves
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He shows that the
salvation of this people had not been neglected by God; for he had tried whether
they were healable. The remedy was, that the people were to know that God would
be pacified towards them, if they devoted themselves to righteousness. The Lord
offered his favour: &#8220;Return only to me; for as soon as the seed of
righteousness shall be sown by you, the harvest shall be prepared, a reward
shall be laid up for you; ye shall then reap fruit according to your
kindness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if any one asks, whether it be in the power of
men to sow righteousness, the answer is ready, and that is that the Prophet
explains not here how far the ability of men extends, but requires what they
ought to do. For whence is it that so many of God&#8217;s curses often overwhelm
us, except that we sow seed similar to the produce? that is, God repays us what
we have deserved. This then is what the Prophet shows, when he says, &#8220;Sow
for yourselves righteousness:&#8221; he shows that it was their fault, if the
Lord did not cherish them kindly and bountifully, and in a paternal manner; it
was because their impiety suffered him not.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet only speaks of the duties of the
second table, as also the Prophets do, when they exhort men to repentance: they
often begin with the second table of the law, because the perverseness of men
with regard to this is more palpable, and they can thereby be more easily
convicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what he afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryn
wryn</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>niru nir,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plough the
ploughing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> is not, I confess, in its
proper place; but there is in this nothing inconsistent: for after having
exhorted them to plough, he now adds, that they were like uncultivated and
desert fields, so that it was not right to sow the seed until they had been
prepared. The Prophet then ought, according to the order of nature, to have
begun with ploughing; but he simply said what he wished to convey, that the
Israelites received not the fruit they desired, because they had only sown
unrighteousness. If they now wished to be dealt with more kindly, he shows the
remedy, which is to sow righteousness. If it was so, that they were already
filled with wickedness, he shows that they were like a field overgrown with
briers and thorns. When therefore a field has long remained uncultivated, thorns
and thistles and other noxious herbs grow there, and a double ploughing will be
necessary, and this double labour is called Novation; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
Jeremiah speaks of the same thing, when he shows that the people had grown
hardened in their wickedness, and that they could not bear any fruit until the
thorns were torn up by the roots, and until they had been well cleansed from the
vices in which they had become fixed; and hence he says,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Plough again your
fallow-ground,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
4:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it is the time for seeking
Jehovah, until he come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet
offers a hope of pardon to the people, to encourage them to repent: for we know
that when men are called back to God, they are torpid and even faint in their
minds, until they are assured that God will be propitious to them; and this is
what we have treated of more fully in another place. The Prophet now handles the
same truth, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it is the time
for seeking the Lord.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">He indeed uses the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ot</i>, which means a seasonable time. <i>It is</i> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the time for seeking the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said, &#8220;The way
of salvation is not yet closed against you; for the Lord invites you to himself,
and he is of his own self inclined to mercy.&#8221; This is one thing. We are,
however, at the same time, taught that there ought to be no delay; for such
tardiness will cost them dear, if they despise so kind an invitation of God, and
go on in their own obstinacy. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It
is then the time for seeking Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as
Isaiah also says</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Seek the Lord while he may be
found, call on him while he is nigh: Behold, now is the time of good-pleasure;
behold, now is the day of salvation,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
55:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also in this place, the Prophet testifies that God
will be easily entreated, if Israel returned to the right way; but that, if they
continued obstinately in their sins, this time would not be perpetual; for the
door would be shut, and the people would cry in vain, after having neglected
this seasonable invitation, and abused the patience of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It
is</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for seeking the Lord, until he
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This last clause is a confirmation
of the former; for the Prophet here expressly declares that it would not be
useless labour for Israel to begin to seek God &#8212; &#8216;He will come to
you.&#8217; He at the same time warns them not to be too hasty in their
expectations; for though God may receive us into favour, he does not yet
immediately deliver us from all punishments or evils. We must, then, patiently
wait until the fruit of reconciliation appears. We hence see that both points
are here wisely handled by the Prophet; for he would have Israel to hasten with
deep concern, and not to delay long the time of repentance, and also to remain
quiet, if God did not immediately show himself propitious, and show tokens of
his favour; the Prophet wished, in this case, the people to be
patient.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And rain righteousness upon
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hry</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ire,</i> means indeed &#8220;to teach,&#8221; and also &#8220;to
throw;&#8221; but as the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mure</i>, derived from this verbs as it is well known, means the rain, I
could not explain it here otherwise than &#8220;he will rain righteousness upon
you.&#8221; What, indeed, could the teaching of righteousness mean? For the
Prophet alludes to the harvest; and the people might say, &#8220;Are we sure of
provision, if we seek God?&#8221; &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he says; &#8220;he
will come &#8212; he will come to you, and will rain righteousness, or the fruit
of righteousness, upon you.&#8221; In short, the Prophet here shows, that
whenever God is sought sincerely and from the heart by sinners, he comes forth
to meet them, and shows himself kind and merciful. But as he had spoken of
ploughing and sowing, the fruit or the harvest was now to be mentioned; that he
might therefore hold forth a promise that they who had sown righteousness would
not lose their expense and toil, he says, the Lord will rain upon you the fruit
of righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the other verse, which, as I have said,
completes the passage, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
ploughed ungodliness, iniquity have ye reaped: ye have eaten the fruit of
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet shows that the
people had in vain been daily admonished, and so kindly and sweetly allured by
the Lord; for they had not only slighted wholesome warnings, but had, in their
perverse wickedness, abandoned themselves to a contrary course:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have
ploughed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>impiety</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
God has exhorted you to sow righteousness, &#8212; what have ye sown? Impiety;
and then ye have reaped iniquity. Some think that the punishments which the
people had to bear are pointed out here; as though the Prophet had said,
&#8220;God has returned to you such a produce as was suitable to your sowing; ye
are therefore satiated with falsehood &#8212; that is, with your own false
confidence.&#8221; But he seems rather to pursue the same strain of thought, and
to say, that they had ploughed impiety &#8212; that is, that they had been from
the beginning ungodly; and then, that they had reaped iniquity &#8212; that is,
that they had continued their wickedness to the very harvest, and laid up their
fruit as it were in a storehouse, that they might satiate themselves with
treachery. The Prophet, I think, speaks in this sense; but let there be a free
choice. I only show what seems to me most suitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it follows then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast trusted in thine
own way, in the multitude of thy valiant
ones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet points out the
chief spring-head of all sins; for the Israelites, trusting in their own
counsels, gave no ear to the word of God: and then, being fortified by their own
strength, they dreaded not his judgements, nor fled to his pledged protection to
defend them. This pride is not then named here by the Prophet without reason as
the chief source of all sins. For when one distrusts his own wisdom, or is
afraid, being conscious of his weakness, he can be easily subdued; but when
pride possesses man&#8217;s minds so that he thinks himself wise, nothing will
then prevail with him, neither counsel nor instruction. It is the same when any
one greatly extols his own strength, and is inflated with pride, he cannot be
made tractable, were he admonished a hundred times. The Prophet then defines
here the falsehood, the impiety, and the iniquity of which he had been speaking.
For though the people sinned in various ways, the fountain and root was in this
lie or falsehood, that they were wont to set up their own strength in opposition
to God, and thought themselves so endued with wisdom, that they had no need of
teachers. Since, then, the people were so blinded with their own pride, the
Prophet shows here that it was this lie with which they had satiated themselves.
It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here denounces punishment, having before

intimates that its progress would not be slow, but that the tumult would be each

shows that whatever strength the people had would be weak and wholly useless,
when the Lord had begun to raise a tumult; for this tumult would reduce to ruin
all their fortified cities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds an instance, which some refer to
Shalmanezar. He only mentions Shaman; and Shalmanezar is indeed a compound name;
but it is not known whether the Prophet had put down here his name in its simple
form, Shaman: and then he mentions Betharbel, a city, referred to in some parts
of Scripture, which was, with respect to Judea, beyond Jordan. If we receive
this opinion, it seems that the Prophet wished to revive the memory of a recent
slaughter, &#8220;Ye know what lately happened to you when Shalmanezar marched
with so much cruelty through your country, when he laid waste your villages and
towns and cities, and ye especially know how fierce the battle was in Betharbel,
when a carnage was made, when mothers were violently thrown on their children,
when the enemy spared neither sex nor age, which in the worst wars is a most
cruel thing.&#8221; Such, then, may have been the meaning of the Prophet. But
others think that he relates a history, which is nowhere else to be told.
However this may be, it appears that the Prophet spake of some slaughter which
was in his day well known. Then the report of it was common enough, whether it
was a slaughter made by Shalmanezar, or any other, of which there is no express
mention found. We no see the meaning of the Prophet; but we cannot finish
to-day.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We explained yesterday
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;281014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
10:14, in which the Prophet denounced the vengeance of God on his people, such
as they had experienced either when the country was laid waste by the army of
Shalmanezar, or when some other slaughter was made. From the words, we certainly
learn that a battle had been fought in Arbel, which was a town, as we have said,
beyond Jordan. But the Prophet shows also how much had been the atrocity of that
battle, and how grievous and dreadful would be that slaughter which he now
threatens to the people, by saying that even the mother had been violently
thrown upon her children. And the Prophet also shows that God&#8217;s vengeance
would be just, because the Israelites had provoked God by their
superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then points out in the last verse the cause why
the Lord would deal so severely with his people; and his manner of speaking
ought to be observed. <i>So,</i> he says,

you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He might have said, &#8216;So will

he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall do this unto

arise from Bethel; but as they had corrupted the worship of God by worshipping
the calf, the Prophet says, that the Assyrian was not, properly speaking, the
author of this slaughter, but that it was to be imputed to that corruption which
had arisen in Bethel.

&#8220;Because of the wickedness of wickedness,&#8221; by which is expressed
something extreme, as the genitive case is often used by the Hebrews in the
place of the superlative degree; but it may be viewed as a simple repetition,
&#8220;This shall be for wickedness &#8212; your wickedness, and it shall be so,
that ye may not be able to transfer the blame to any other cause; for ye are
yourselves the authors of all the evils.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In a morning shall the king of
Israel be utterly cut off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, by
perishing shall perish. The Prophet means by these words, that the Lord would so
punish the people of Israel, that it would appear plain enough, that it was not
done by man or by chance; for the Lord would suddenly overturn that kingdom
which had been so well fortified, which flourished so much in wealth and power.

is the more correct reading, as it has also been more commonly received, that
is, &#8220;In a morning, or in one morning, shall the king of Israel
perish;&#8221; as we say in French, <i>Cela n&#8217;est que pour un

them for many years, as they had a blind confidence in their own strength. The
Prophet derides this madness, and says, that the slaughter would be sudden, that
the king would in a moment be destroyed, though he thought himself well supplied
with soldiers and all other defences. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God here expostulates with the people of Israel for
their ingratitude. The obligation of the people was twofold; for God had
embraced them from the very first beginning, and when there was no merit or
worthiness in them. What else, indeed, was the condition of the people when
emancipated from their servile works in Egypt? They doubtless seemed then like a
man half-dead or a putrid carcass; for they had no vigour remaining in them. The
Lord then stretched forth his hand to the people when in so hopeless a state,
drew them out, as it were, from the grave, and restored them from death into
life. But the people did not acknowledge this so wonderful a favour of God, but
soon after petulantly turned their back on him. What baseness was this, and how
shameful the wickedness, to make such a return to the author of their life and
salvation? The Prophet therefore enhances the sin and baseness of the people by
this circumstance, that the Lord had loved them even from childhood;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when
yet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel was a child, I loved
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The nativity of the people was
their coming out of Egypt. The Lord had indeed made his covenant with Abraham
four hundred years before; and, as we know, the patriarchs were also regarded by
him as his children: but God wished his Church to be, as it were, extinguished,
when he redeemed it. Hence the Scripture, when it speaks of the liberation of
the people, often refers to that favour of God in the same way as of one born
into the world. It is not therefore without reason that the Prophet here reminds
the people that they had been loved when in childhood. The proof of this love
was, that they had been brought out of Egypt. Love had preceded, as the cause is
always before the effect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet enlarges on the subject:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I loved Israel, even while he was
yet a child; I called him out of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
that is, &#8220;I not only loved him when a child, but before he was born I
began to love him; for the liberation from Egypt was the nativity, and my love
preceded that. It then appears, that the people had been loved by me, before
they came forth to the light; for Egypt was like a grave without any spark of
life; and the condition this miserable people was in was worse than thousand
deaths. Then by calling my people from Egypt, I sufficiently proved that my love
was gratuitous before they were born.&#8221; The people were hence less
excusable when they returned such an unworthy recompense to God, since he had
previously bestowed his free favour upon them. We now understand the meaning of
the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here arises a difficult question; for Matthew 2,
accommodates this passage to the person of Christ. They who have not been well
versed in Scripture have confidently applied to Christ this place; yet the
context is opposed to this. Hence it has happened, that scoffers have attempted
to disturb the whole religion of Christ, as though the Evangelist had misapplied
the declaration of the Prophet. They give a more suitable answer, who say that
there is in this case only a comparison: as when a passage from Jeremiah is
quoted in another place, when the cruelty of Herod is mentioned, who raged
against all the infants of his dominion, who were under two years of
age,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Rachel, bewailing
her children, would not receive consolation, because they were not,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Evangelist says that this prophecy was fulfilled,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
2:18.) But it is certain that the object of Jeremiah was another; but nothing
prevents that declaration should not be applied to what Matthew relates. So they
understand this place. But I think that Matthew had more deeply considered the
purpose of God in having Christ led into Egypt, and in his return afterwards
into Judea. In the first place, it must be remembered that Christ cannot be
separated from his Church, as the body will be mutilated and imperfect without a
head. Whatever then happened formerly in the Church, ought at length to be
fulfilled by the head. This is one thing. Then also there is no doubt, but that
God in his wonderful providence intended that his Son should come forth from
Egypt, that he might be a redeemer to the faithful; and thus he shows that a
true, real, and perfect deliverance was at length effected, when the promised
Redeemer appeared. It was then the full nativity of the Church, when Christ came
forth from Egypt to redeem his Church. So in my view that comment is too frigid,
which embraces the idea, that Matthew made only a comparison. For it behaves us
to consider this, that God, when he formerly redeemed his people from Egypt,
only showed by a certain prelude the redemption which he deferred till the
coming of Christ. Hence, as the body was then brought forth from Egypt into
Judea, so at length the head also came forth from Egypt: and then God fully
showed him to be the true deliverer of his people. This then is the meaning.
Matthew therefore most fitly accommodates this passage to Christ, that God loved
his Son from his first childhood and called him from Egypt. We know at the same
time that Christ is called the Son of God in a respect different from the people
of Israel; for adoption made the children of Abraham the children of God, but
Christ is by nature the only-begotten Son of God. But his own dignity must
remain to the head, that the body may continue in its inferior state. There is
then in this nothing inconsistent. But as to the charge of ingratitude, that so
great a favour of God was not acknowledged, this cannot apply to the person of
Christ, as we well know; nor is it necessary in this respect to refer to him;
for we see from other places that every thing does not apply to Christ, which is
said of David, or of the high priest, or of the posterity of David; though they
were types of Christ. But there is ever a great difference between the reality
and its symbols. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now repeats the ingratitude of the people
in neglecting to keep in mind their redemption. The word, &#8220;called,&#8221;
is here to be taken in a different sense. For God effectually called, as they
say, the people, or his Son, from Egypt: he has again called by the outward
voice or teaching through his Prophets. Hence, when he said before that he
called his Son from Egypt, it ought to be understood, as they say, of actual
liberation: but now when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have called
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it is to be understood of
teaching. The name of the Prophets is not expressed; but that they are intended
is plain. And the Prophet seems designedly to have said in an indefinite manner,
that the people had been called, that the indignity might appear more evident,
as they had been called so often and by so many, and yet had refused. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have called
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When he thus speaks, he is not to
be understood as referring to one or two men, or to a few, but as including a
great number of men, doing this everywhere. Even thus now have they called them;
that is, this people have been called, not once or twice, but constantly; and
God has not only sent one messenger or preacher to call them, but there have
been many Prophets, one after the other, often thus employed, and yet without
any benefit. We now perceive what the Prophet meant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have called
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so they went away from their
presence</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The particle <i>so,</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>can</i>, is introduced here to enliven the description; for the Prophet
points out, as by the fingers how wickedly they conspired to execute their own
counsels, as if they wished purposely to show in an open manner their contempt.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So they went
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> when the Prophets called them to
one course, they proceeded in an opposite one. We then see, that to point out
thus their conduct was not superfluous, when he says, that they in this manner
went away: and then he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
their face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he shows that the
people sought hiding-places and shunned the light. We may indeed conclude from
these words, that so great was the perverseness of the people, that they not
only wished to be alienated from God, but also that they would have nothing to
do with the Prophets. It is indeed a proof of extreme wickedness, when
instruction itself is a weariness, and ministers cannot be endured; and no doubt
the Prophet meant to set forth this sin of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrificed unto Baalim, and burnt
incense to graven images</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In the former
clause, he shows the contumacy of the Israelites, that they deigned not to give
ear to God&#8217;s servants. He now adds, that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they made incense to graven
images</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and also offered worship to
their idols. By Baalim, as it has been already stated, the Prophet means the
inferior gods. For no such stupidity prevailed among the people as not to think
that there is some chief deity; nay, even profane Gentiles confessed that there
is some supreme God. But they called their advocates (<i>patronos</i>) Baalim,
as we see to be the case at this day under the Papacy, this same office is
transferred to the dead; they are to procure for men the favour of God. The
Papists then have no grounds for seeking an evasion by words; for the very same
superstition prevails at this time among them, as prevailed formerly among
Gentiles and the people of Israel. Here the Prophet enhances the wickedness of
the people; for they not only contemptuously neglected every instruction in
religion, but also openly perverted the whole worship of God, and abandoned
themselves to all abominations, so as to burn incense to their own idols. Let us
go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again God amplifies the sin of the people, by
saying, that by no kindness, even for a long time, could they be allured, or
turned, or reformed, or reduced to a sound mind. It was surely enough that the
people of Israeli who had been brought by the hand of God from the grave to the
light of life, should have repudiated every instruction; it was a great and an
atrocious sin; but now God goes on farther, and says, that he had not ceased to
show his love to them, and yet had attained nothing by his perseverance; for the
wickedness and depravity of the people were incurable. Hence he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have led Ephraim on
foot</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Some are of opinion that it is a nouns from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lgr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>regel</i>, foot, and it seems the most suitable. For otherwise there will be
a change of a letter, which grammarians do not allow in the beginning of a word;
for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tau</i>, in this case would be put instead of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>he</i>; and put so as if it was of frequent occurrence in Hebrew; but no such
instance can be adduced. So they who are skilful in the language think that for
this reason it is a noun, and with them I agree. They, however, who regard it as
a verb, give this view, &#8212; &#8220;I have led him on foot,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytlgrt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>teregelti</i>; that is, as a child who cannot yet walk with a firm foot, is
by degrees accustomed to do so, and the nurse, or the father, or the mother, who
lead him, have a regard for his infancy; so also have I led Israel, as much as
his feet could bear. But the other version is less obscure, and that is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My walking on
foot</i></font><font face="Palatino"> was for him; that is, I humbled myself as
mothers are wont to do; and hence he says, that he had carried the people on his
shoulders; and we shall presently see the same comparison used. And Moses says
in Deuteronomy 32, that the people had been carried on God&#8217;s wings, or
that God had expanded his wings like the eagle who flies over her young ones.
With regard to the matter itself the meaning of the Prophet is not obscure; for
he means, that this people had been treated by God in a paternal and indulgent
manner; and also, that the perseverance of the Lord in continuing to bestow his
blessings on them had been without any fruit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To carry on his
arms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some render the expression,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kochem</i>, &#8220;He carried them,&#8221; as if the verb were in the past
tense; and they consider the word, Moses, to be understood. But it is God who
speaks here. Some think it to be an infinitive &#8212; &#8220;To carry,&#8221;
as when one carries another on his shoulders; and this seems to be the most
suitable exposition. There is in the sense no ambiguity; for the design of the
Prophet is what I have already stated, which is to show that this people were
most wicked in not obeying God, since they had been so kindly treated by Him.
For what could they have expected more than what God had done for them? As he
also says by Isaiah, &#8216;What, my vine, ought I to have done more than what I
have done?&#8217; So also in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My walking has been on foot with
Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and for this end,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to carry
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as when one carries another in his
arms. &#8216;They yet,&#8217; he says, &#8216;did not know that I healed
them;&#8217; that is, &#8220;Neither the beginning of my goodness, nor its
continued exercise, avails anything with them. When I brought them forth from
Egypt, I restored the dead to life; this kindness has been blotted out. Again,
in the desert I testified, in various ways, that I was their best and most
indulgent Father: I have in this instance also lost all my labour.&#8221; How
so? &#8220;Because my favour has been in no way acknowledged by this perverse
and foolish people.&#8221; We now then see what the Prophet meant: and he
continues the same subject in the next verse.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet states, first, that this people had not
been severely dealt with, as either slaves, or oxen, or asses, are wont to be
treated. He had said before, that the people of Israel were like a heifer, which
shakes off the yoke, and in wantonness loves only the treading of corn. But
though the perverseness of the people was so great, yet God shows here that he
had not used extreme rigour: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have drawn him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with human cords and lovely
bands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By the cords of man, he means
humane government. &#8220;I have not,&#8221; he says, &#8220;treated you as
slaves, but dealt with you as with children; and I have not regarded you as
cattle, I have not driven you into a stall; but I have only drawn you with
lovely bands.&#8221; The sum of the whole is, that the government which God had
laid on the people was a certain and singular token of his paternal favour, so
that the people could not complain of too much rigour, as if God had considered
their disposition, and had used a hard wedge (as the common proverb is) for a
hard knot; for if God had dealt thus with the people, they could have objected,
and said, that they had not been kindly drawn by him, and that it was no wonder
if they did not obey, since they had been so roughly treated. &#8220;But there
is no ground for them,&#8221; the Lord says, &#8220;to allege that I have used
severity: for I could not have dealt more kindly with them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have drawn them with human
cords;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I have not otherwise governed them than
as a father his own children; I have been bountiful towards them. I indeed
wished to do them good, and, as it was right, required obedience from them. I
have at the same time laid on them a yoke, not servile, nor such as is wont to
be laid on brute animals; but I was content with paternal discipline.&#8221;
Since then such kindness had no influence over them, is it not right to conclude
that their wickedness is irreclaimable and extreme?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have been to them like those
who raise up the yoke upon the cheeks</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>&#8220;I have not laden you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;with too heavy burdens,
as oxen and other beasts are wont to be burdened; but I have raised up the yoke
upon the cheeks. I have chosen rather to bear the yoke myself, and to ease these
ungodly and wicked men of their burden.&#8221; And God does not in vain allege
this, for we know that when he uses his power, and vindicates his authority, he
does this not to burden the people, as earthly kings are wont to do; but he
bears the burden which he lays on men. It is no wonder then that he says now,
that he had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lifted the yoke upon
the cheeks</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of his people, like one who wishes
not to burden his ox, but bears up the yoke himself with his own hands, lest the
ox should faint through weariness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have made them to eat in
quietness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, &#8220;I have brought
meat to them.&#8221; Some think the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lykwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aukil</i> to be in the future tense, and that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lykwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aukil</i> is put for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lykaa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aakil</i>; that is, I will cause them to eat; and that the future is to be
resolved into the past: and it is certain that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ath,</i> means tranquil sometimes. Then it will be, &#8220;I have caused them
quietly to eat.&#8221; But another exposition is more commonly received; as the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ath,</i> is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hfn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nathe</i>, to raise, it is the same as though the Prophet had said, that meat
had been brought to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then does here in various ways enhance the
ingratitude and wickedness of the people, because they had not acknowledged his
paternal kindness, when he had himself so kindly set forth his favour before
their eyes; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,

it on the ground, nor placed it too high for them; they have not toiled in
getting it; but I have, as it were, brought it with mine own hand and set it
before them, that they might eat without any trouble.&#8221; In short, God
declares that he had tried in every way to find out, whether there was any
meekness or docility in the people of Israel, and that he had ill bestowed all
his blessings; for this people were blind to favours so kind, to such as clearly
proved, that God had in every way showed himself to be a Father. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet denounces a new punishment, that the
people in vain hoped that Egypt would be a place of refuge or an asylum to them;
for the Lord would draw them away to another quarter. For the Israelites had
cherished this hope, that if by any chance the Assyrians should be too powerful
for them, there would yet be a suitable refuge for them in Egypt among their
friends, with whom they had made a treaty. Since, then, they promised themselves
a hospitable exile in Egypt, the Prophet here exposes their vain confidence:
&#8220;This their expectation,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that they shall find a way
open to Egypt, shall disappoint the people: it is shut up,&#8221; he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not return to the land
of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be their king.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
By saying, that the Assyrian shall rule over them, he means that the people
would become exiles under the Assyrians, which indeed happened. He then
anticipates here all the vain hopes by which the people deceived themselves, and
by which they hardened themselves against all the threatening of God.
&#8220;There is no reason for them,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to look towards
Egypt; for the Lord will not allow them to go there; for he will draw them to
Assyria.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards gives the reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they have been
unwilling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This &#8220;return&#8221; is to
be taken in another sense: but there is here a striking similarity in the words.
They thought that there would be to them a free passage into Egypt; and yet they
had been unwilling to pass over unto God, when he had so often called them. The
Prophet therefore says that a return into Egypt was now denied them, inasmuch as
they had been unwilling to return to God. The import of what is said is, that
when men perversely resist God, they in vain hope for any free movements either
to this or that quarter; for the Lord will hold them tied and bound. As it is
wont to be done to wild beasts, who, when they show too much ferocity, are shut
up in cages or bound with chains, or as it is usually done to frantic men, who
are bound with strong bands; so also the Lord does with obstinate men; he binds
them fast, so that they cannot move a finger. This, then, is the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, at the same time, to be understood, an
implied comparison between the former bondage they endured in Egypt, and the new
bondage which awaited them. They had known of what sort was the hospitality of
Egypt, and yet so great a blindness possessed their minds, that they wished to
return there. Their fathers had been kindly enough received; but their posterity
were grievously burdened; nay, they were not far from being entirely destroyed.
What madness was this, to wish of themselves to return to Egypt, when they knew
how great was the ferociousness and cruelty of the Egyptians? But as I have
said, something more grievous awaited them; they were not worthy to return to
Egypt. To return there would have been indeed a dreadful calamity; but the Lord
would not, however open a way for them to go there; for he would force them to
pass to another country; yea, they were to be by force dragged away by their
conquerors into Assyria. The drift of the whole is, that though the people had
been cruelly treated in Egypt, there was now drawing nigh a more grievous
tyranny; for the Assyrians would double the injuries, and the violence, and all
kinds of wrongs and reproaches, which had been exercised against this
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that it was added for consolation, that
God, though greatly provoked by the people, was yet unwilling to lead them again
into Egypt, lest the former redemption should be made void; but that a middle
course was prepared by which he would chastise the ungrateful and yet retain
them as his peculiar possession. But I have already shown what I mostly approve.
At the same time, whichever view is taken, we see how grievous and severe was
the denunciation of the Prophet.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As it was difficult to persuade proud people that the
overthrow was at hand, which Hosea had foretold, seeing, as they did, that they
were furnished with many defences, it is therefore now added, that their
fortified cities would not prevent the enemy to break through, and to devastate
the whole country, and to lead away the people captive. We now understand how
this verse is connected with the last. The Prophet had threatened exile; but as
the Israelites thought themselves safe in their nests, he adds, that there was
no reason for them to trust in their fortresses, for the Lord could by the sword
destroy all their cities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sword shall
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> on their cities. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chul,</i> means to abide, and to encamp, and sometimes to fall or rush upon:
and this second sense is more suitable to this place. Some, however, render it,
The sword shall <i>abide</i> on the cities until it consume them. But as to the
meaning, there is not much difference. I will, however, briefly state what I
deem the right view. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
fall,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or rush,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon his
cities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and further<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall consume his
bars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Hebrews often call bars or
bolts </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;badim&#8221;, still oftener, branches, or
members, &#8212; the branches of a tree, or the members of man. Hence some take
the word metaphorically, as meaning towns and villages; for they are, as it
were, the branches or members of cities. Others, however, explain it as
signifying sons, who grow from their parents as branches from the tree: but this
seems too far-fetched. I do not disapprove of the opinion, that the Prophet
refers here to towns and villages, which are, as it were, the appendages of
cities, as branches spread out here and there from the tree. The sense then is
not amiss, that the sword will consume and devour towns and villages, when it
shall fall on the cities. But what I have already said of bolts seems more
suitable to the design of the Prophet. We must at the same time consider the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bedim,</i> as including a part for the whole; for bolts were only a part of
the fortifications; but the gates, being closed and fastened, render the cities
strong. So this place, by taking a part for the whole, may be thus expounded,
that the sword, when it fell on cities, would consume and destroy whatever
strength and defence they possessed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at the same time mentions the cause,
<i>Because,</i> he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of their
own counsels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No doubt, he added this
expression, because the Israelites thought themselves wise; for ungodly men
arrogate to themselves much prudence; and this they do, that they may, as it
were, from their height look down on God, and laugh at every instruction. Since
then they who despise God seem to themselves to be very wise, and to be
fortified by their good counsels, the Prophet shows that the cause of ruin to
the Israelites would be, that they were swollen with this diabolical prudence,
and would not condescend to obey the word of the Lord.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is variously rendered. Some explain the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yawlt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>teluaim,</i> as signifying &#8220;perplexed;&#8221; as though the Prophet had
said, that the people would suffer a just punishment through being anxious and
looking around them, and yet finding no comfort; for this would be the reward of
their defection or apostasy. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people are in
suspense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, there is no wonder
that the Israelites are now tormented with great anxiety, and find no end to
their evils; for they who have rebelled against the Lord are worthy of being
thus bound fast by him. It is the fruit of their defection that they are now so
full of sorrow, and also of despair. This is one exposition. Others say that God
here complains of the wickedness of the people, as of those who deliberated
whether they ought to repent. They then take suspense for doubt,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people are in
suspense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they debate on the
subject as on a doubtful matter, when I exhort them to repent, and they cannot
at once decide what to do, but alternate between divers opinions, and now
incline to one thing and then to another; as if truly the subject itself made it
necessary for them to deliberate. Doubtless what is right is in no way hid from
them: but as they are unwilling, they seek for themselves, by evasions, some
excuses for doubting; for the Prophets cry to them, and no one extols them. This
is the second exposition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must at the same time be observed, that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tbw&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshubat,</i> is variously taken; for the first render it, &#8220;turning
away,&#8221; and the &#8220;job&#8221; that is affixed must then be expounded
passively, and must mean their turning away from God, because the Israelites had
fallen away from him; as in Isaiah chapter 56 he calls that the house of his
prayer in which the people were wont to pray. Then the turning away from God,
according to them, is to be taken passively, because the people were alienated
from him. Others render it, &#8220;conversion.&#8221; But the Hebrew doctors
will have this word to be ever taken in a bad sense, and affirm that there is no
place where it signifies any thing but rebellion or apostasy. Since it is so, I
am inclined to consider it to be turning away; and thus the second sense, that
the people deliberated whether they ought to hear the admonitions of the
Prophets, will not stand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet also seems to me to mean what is
different from what I have referred to in the first place, as the opinion of
those who say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people are in
suspense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they anxiously
torment themselves on account of their defection, because I punish them for
their apostasy; through which it has happened, that, forsaking me, they have
wandered after their own inventions. But I take the passage otherwise, as I have
already said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people are
fastened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, my people have not
only once departed from me, but they are, as it were, fastened in their
defection. He says, that they were fastened, not that they were sorrowful and
endured great tortures, and found their affairs perplexed; but that they were
fastened, because they remained obstinate; as when one says, that a man is
fastened to a thing, when he cannot be moved. This being fastened, is indeed
nothing else but the obstinacy of the people. They were then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fastened to
defection.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To him on high they call them;
none at all rises up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What an indefinite
sentence signifies we stated yesterday. The Prophet means that instruction had
been given the people, and that many witnesses or preachers had been sent by the
Lord, but that all this had been wholly useless. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They call them to him on high, no
one raises up himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some indeed consider the
word, God, to be understood; and this is the commonly received opinion; but in
my judgement they are mistaken; for the Prophet, speaking of the Israelites,
doubtless means that they remained in the same state, and were not moved by any
instruction to make any progress, or to show any sign of repentance. Hence,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no one rises
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He uses the singular number, and puts down
the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">djy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ichad,</i> as though he said, &#8220;There is no one, from the first to the
last, who is touched with grief, for they continue obstinate in their
wickedness.&#8221; And when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No one raises up
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he seems to allude to the word,
<i>fastened.</i> They are then fastened to their defection; and when the
Prophets cry and diligently exhort them to repent, they do not rise up; that is,
they do not aspire to God; and this indeed they neglect with one consent, as if
they all alike blindly united in one and the same wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse then the Prophet brings again to view
the sins of the people, that it might more fully appear that God threatened them
so dreadfully not without a cause; for they who were so perversely rebellious
against God were worthy of the most grievous punishment. This is the sum of the
whole. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here God consults what he would do with the people:
and first, indeed, he shows that it was his purpose to execute vengeance, such
as the Israelites deserved, even wholly to destroy them: but yet he assumes the
character of one deliberating, that none might think that he hastily fell into
anger, or that, being soon excited by excessive fury, he devoted to ruin those
who had lightly sinned, or were guilty of no great crimes. That no one then
might assign to God an anger too fervid, he says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How shall I set thee aside,
Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee up, Israel? How shall I set thee as
Sodom?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these expressions God shows what the
Israelites deserved, and that he was now inclined to inflict the punishment of
which they were worthy and yet not without repentance, or at least not without
hesitation. He afterwards adds in the next clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This I will not do; my heart is
within me changed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> I now alter my
purpose, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and my repenting are
brought back again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is it was in my
mind to destroy you all, but now a repenting, which reverses that design, lays
hold on me. We now apprehend what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to this mode of speaking, it appears indeed at the
first glance to be strange that God should make himself like mortals in changing
his purposes and in exhibiting himself as wavering. God, we know, is subject to
no passions; and we know that no change takes place in him. What then do these
expressions mean, by which he appears to be changeable? Doubtless he
accommodates himself to our ignorances whenever he puts on a character foreign
to himself. And this consideration exposes the folly as well as the impiety of
those who bring forward single words to show that God is, as it were like
mortals; as those unreasonable men do who at this day seek to overturn the
eternal providence of God, and to blot out that election by which he makes a
difference between men. &#8220;O!&#8221; they say, &#8220;God is sincere, and he
has said that he willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be
converted and live.&#8221; God must then in this case remain as it were
uncertain, and depend on the free-will of every one: it is hence in the power of
man either to procure destruction to himself, or to come to salvation. God must
in the meantime wait quietly as to what men will do, and can determine nothing
except through their free-will. While these insane men thus trifle, they think
themselves to be supported by this invincible reason, that God&#8217;s will is
one and simple. But if the will of God be one, it does not hence follow that he
does not accommodate himself to men, and put on a character foreign to himself,
as much as a regard for our salvation will bear or require. So it is in this
place. God does not in vain introduce himself as being uncertain; for we hence
learn that he is not carried away too suddenly to inflict punishment, even when
men in various ways provoke his vengeance. This then is what God shows by this
mode of speaking. At the same time, we know that what he will do is certain, and
that his decree depends not on the free-will of men; for he is not ignorant of
what we shall do. God then does not deliberate as to himself, but with reference
to men. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must also bear in mind what I have already
said, that the Prophet here strikes with terror proud and profane despisers by
setting before their eyes their own destruction, and by showing how little short
they were of the lot of Gomorra and other cities. &#8220;For what
remains,&#8221; the Lord says, &#8220;but that <i>I should set</i> you as Sodom
and Zeboim? This condition and this recompense awaits you, if I execute the
judgement which has been already as it were decreed.&#8221; Not that God would
immediately do this; but he only reminds the Israelites of what they deserved,
and of what would happen to them, except the Lord dealt mercifully with them.
Thus much of the first part of the verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart was
changed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentings were brought back
again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> the same mode of speaking after
the manner of men is adopted; for we know that these feelings belong not to God;
he cannot be touched with repentance, and his heart cannot undergo changes. To
imagine such a thing would be impiety. But the design is to show, that if he
dealt with the people of Israel as they deserved, they would now be made like
Sodom and Gomorra. But as God was merciful, and embraced his people with
paternal affection, he could not forget that he was a Father, but would be
willing to grant pardon; as is the case with a father, who, on seeing his
son&#8217;s wicked disposition, suddenly feels a strong displeasure, and then,
being seized with relenting, is inclined to spare him. God then declares that he
would thus deal with his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows an explanation of this
sentence,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will not execute the
fury of my wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>by which figurative
mode of speaking he sets forth the punishment which was suitable to the sins of
men. For it must ever be remembered, that God is exempt from every passion. But
if no anger is to be supposed by us to be in God, what does he mean by the fury
of his wrath? Even the relation between his nature and our innate or natural
sins. But why does Scripture say that God is angry? Even because we imagine him
to be so according to the perception of the flesh; for we do not apprehend
God&#8217;s indignation, except as far as our sins provoke him to anger, and
kindle his vengeance against us. Then God, with regard to our perception, calls
the fury of his wrath the heavy judgement, which is equal to, or meet for, our
sins.<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not
execute</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says, that is, &#8220;I will
not repay the reward which you have deserved.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What
then?<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not
return to destroy Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bw&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ashub,</i> seems to have been introduced for this reason, because God had in
part laid waste the kingdom of Israel: he therefore says, that the second
overthrow, which he would presently bring, would not be such as would destroy
the whole of Israel, or wholly consume them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return to destroy
Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;Though I shall
again gird myself to punish the sins of the people, I shall yet restrain myself
so that my vengeance shall not proceed to the destruction of the whole
people.&#8221; The reason is subjoined,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I am God, and not
man.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As he intended in this place to leave to the godly
some hope of salvation, he adds what may confirm this hope; for we know that
when God denounces wrath, with what difficulty trembling consciences are
restored to hope. Ungodly men laugh to scorn all threatening; but those in whom
there is any seed of piety dread the vengeance of God, and whenever terror
seizes them, they are tormented with marvellous disquietude, and cannot be
easily pacified. This then is the reason why the Prophet now confirms the
doctrine which he had laid down:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and not
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he had said, that he
would be propitious to his people, for he was not implacable as men are; and
they are very wrong who judge of him, or measure him, by men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must here first remember, that the Prophet directs
not his discourse promiscuously to all the Israelites, but only to the faithful,
who were a remnant among that corrupt people. For God, at no time, suffered all
the children of Abraham to become alienated, but some few at least remained, as
it is said in another place,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 19:18.) These the Prophet now addresses; and to administer consolation, he
moderates what he had said before of the dreadful vengeance of God. This saying
then was not to relieve the sorrow of hypocrites; for the Prophet regarded only
the miserable, who had been so smitten with the feeling of God&#8217;s wrath,
that despair would have almost swallowed them up, had not their grief been
mitigated. This is one thing. But further, when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is God, and not
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> this truth ought to come to our
minds, that we may taste of God&#8217;s gratuitous promises, whenever we
vacillate as to his promises, or whenever terror possesses our minds. What! Do
you doubt when you have to do with God? But whence is it, that we with so much
difficulty rely on the promises of God, except that we imagine him to be like
ourselves? Inasmuch then, as it is our habit thus to transforms him, let this
truth be a remedy to this fault; and whenever God promises pardon to us, from
which proceeds the hope of salvation, how much soever he may have previously
terrified us by his judgements, let this come to our mind, that as he is God, he
is not to be judged of by what we are. We ought then to recumb simply on his
promises. &#8220;But then we are unworthy to be pardoned; besides, so great is
the atrocity of our sins, that there can be no hope of reconciliation.&#8221;
Here we must take instant hold on this shield, we must learn to fortify
ourselves with this declaration of the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He is God, and not man:</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">let this shield be ever taken to repel every kind
of diffidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question may be raised, &#8220;Was He not
God, when he destroyed Sodom and the neighbouring cities?&#8221; That judgement
did not take away from the Lord his glory, nor was his majesty thereby
diminished. But these two sentences are to be read together;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am God, and not man, holy in
the midst of thee.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">When any one reads these
sentences apart, he does wrong to the meaning of the Prophet. God, then, does
not only affirm here that he is not like men, but he also adds, that he is holy
in the midst of Israel. It is one view of God&#8217;s nature that is here given
us, and what is set forth is the immense distance between him and men, as we
find it written by Isaiah the Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;My thoughts are
not as yours: as much as the heaven is distant from the earth, so distant are my
thoughts from your thoughts,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
55:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also in this place, the Prophet shows what God is,
and how much his nature differs from the dispositions of men. He afterwards
refers to the covenant which God made with his people: and what was the purport
of that covenant? Even that God would punish his people; yet so as ever to leave
some seed remaining.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;I will chastise
them,&#8217; he says, &#8216;with the rod of men; I will not yet take away from
them my mercy,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;100714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Samuel 7:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since God then had promised some mitigation or some
alleviation in all his punishments, he now reminds us, that he will not have his
Church wholly demolished in the world, for he would thus be inconsistent with
himself: hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am God,
and not man, holy in the midst of thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
and since I have chosen thee to myself to be my peculiar possession and
inheritance, and promised also to be for ever thy God, I will now moderate my
vengeance, so that some Church may ever remain.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason he also says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not enter into the
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some say, &#8220;I will not enter
another city but Jerusalem.&#8221; But this does not suit the passage; for the
Prophet speaks here of the ten tribes and not of the tribe of Judah. Others
imagine an opposite meaning, &#8220;I will not enter the city,&#8221; as though
he said, that he would indeed act kindly towards the people in not wholly
destroying them; but that they should hereafter be without civil order, regular
government, and other tokens of God&#8217;s favour: &#8216;I will not enter the
city;&#8217; that is, &#8220;I will not restore you, so that there may be a city
and a kingdom, and an united body of people.&#8221; But this exposition is too
forced; nay, it is a mere refinement, which of itself vanishes. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
is no doubt but that the similitude is taken from a warlike practice. For when a
conqueror enters a city with an armed force, slaughter is not restrained but
blood is indiscriminately shed. But when a city surrenders, the conqueror indeed
may enter, yet not with a sudden and violent attack, but on certain conditions;
and then he waits, it may be for two days, or for some time, that the rage of
his soldiers may be allayed. Then he comes, not as to enemies, but as to his own
subjects. This is what the Prophet means when he says, &#8216;I will not enter
the city;&#8217; that is, &#8220;I will make war on you and subdue your and
force you to surrenders and that with great loss; but when the gates shall be
opened, and the wall demolished, I will then restrain myself, for I am unwilling
wholly to destroy you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If one objects and says, that this statement
militates against many others which we have observed, the answer is easy, and
the solution has already been adduced in another place, and I shall now only
touch on it briefly. When God distinctly denounces ruin on the people, the body
of the people is had in view; and in this body there was then no integrity.
Inasmuch, then, as all the Israelites had become corrupt, had departed from the
worship and fear of God, and from all piety and righteousness, and had abandoned
themselves to all kinds of wickedness, the Prophet declares that they were to
perish without any exception. But when he confines the vengeance of God, or
moderates it, he has respect to a very small number; for, as it has been already
stated, corruption had never so prevailed among the people, but that some seed
remained. Hence, when the Prophet has in view the elect of God, he applies then
these consolations, by which he mitigates their terror, that they might
understand that God, even in his extreme rigour, would be propitious to them.
Such is the way to account for this passage. With regard to the body of the
people, the Prophet has already shown, that their cities were devoted to the
fire, and that the whole nation was doomed to suffer the wrath of God; that
every thing was given up to the fire and the sword. But now he says, &#8220;I
will not enter;&#8221; that is, with regard to those whom the Lord intended to
spare. And it must also be observed, that punishment was mitigated, not only
with regard to the elect, but also with regard to the reprobate, who were led
into captivity. We must yet remember, that when God spared them for a time, he
chiefly consulted the good of his elect; for the temporary suspension of
vengeance increased his judgement on the reprobate; for whosoever repented not
in exile doubled, as it is evident, the wrath of God against themselves. The
Lord, however, spared his people for a time; for among them was included his
Church, in the same way as the wheat is preserved in the chaff, and is carried
from the field with the straw. Why so? Even that the wheat may be separated. So
also the Lord preserves much chaff with the wheat; but he will afterwards, in
due time, divide the wheat from the chaff. We now understand the whole meaning
of the Prophet, and also the application of his doctrine. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall walk after
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he proceeds farther than
before; for here he refers not to the mitigation of punishment, but promises
restoration. He had said before, that though the Lord would deal severely with
his people, there would yet be some moderation in his wrath, so that he would
not destroy the whole people. Now, it follows, that God, after having thus
restrained himself, will extend his favour even to the restoration of the
people, and bring to life those who seemed to have been dead. We now then
perceive what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to expound this, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall walk after
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> of the obedience of the people,
as it is done by interpreters, does not seem right to me. It is indeed certain
that no people can be restored except they repent; yea, it is the main beginning
of God&#8217;s favour, when he chastises men and heals them of their wickedness.
But here the Prophet handles another thing, even that the Lord will show himself
a leader to his people, who had been for a time dispersed. As long as the people
were scattered in Assyria and in other distant lands, they were without any
head, as a mutilated body. But when the ripened time of restoration came, the
Lord revolved to deliver them, and proclaimed himself the leader of his people;
and in this manner the people were gathered to God. This is what the Prophet now
means when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> that is, for a time, indeed,
God will forsake them, that they may languish in their dispersion; but at length
he will gather them, and show himself as their leader in their journey, that he
may restore them to their country.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>follow Jehovah, and he shall roar
as a lion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> when he shall roar, then
children from the sea shall tremble&#8221;; that is, God will be formidable to
enemies so that none will hinder the return of his people. Many, indeed, will be
the enemies, many will labour to set up opposition: but the people shall
nevertheless come forth free. How so? For the Lord will fill all with dread, and
restrain all the efforts of their enemies; so that they shall be constrained to
withdraw from the Assyrians, as well as from the Egyptians. Though, on one side,
the Egyptians may resist, and, on the other, the Assyrians, they shall not yet
impede the return of the people. Why? Because the Lord will put them to flight,
and he will be to them as a lions and fill them all with terror. But the rest we
shall defer.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since we are
too secure and torpid in our sins, thy dread majesty may come to our minds, to

mayest then be prepared to receive us: and that unbelief may not shut the door
against us, enable us to regard thee to be such as thou hast revealed thyself,
and to acknowledge that thou art not like us, but the fountain of all mercy,
that we may thus be led to entertain a firm hope of salvation, and that, relying
on the Mediator, thy only-begotten Son, we may know him as the throne of grace,
full of compassion and mercy. O grant, that we may thus come to thee, that
through him we may certainly know that thou art our Father, so that the covenant
thou hast made with us may never fail through our fault, even this, that we are

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
THIRTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last lecture, we began to explain what the
Prophet means by saying, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Israelites shall come after the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i>
that is, that when the time of the exile shall be completed, God will be the
leader of his people in their journey, that they might return safe to their
country. And for this reason, he also subjoins, that the Egyptians as well as
the Assyrians would be timid; and hence he compares them to doves and sparrows,
or birds; for when the nations should attempt to hinder the return of the
people, and strive against them with great forces and great efforts, God would
break down their courage. For as God had determined to redeem his people, his
decree could not have been nullified, no, not by the whole world. Whatever then,
the Assyrians, and also the Egyptians, might attempt to do, though powerful in
forces, it would yet avail nothing; nay, God would strike into both such fear
and dread, that they should not make any stir when the Lord restored his people.
There is a similar mode of speaking in Joel 3, except that he does not introduce
the similitudes that they would be like birds and doves. But he speaks of the
roaring of God, as though he said, that the power of God would be terrible and
invincible, so that he would defend and protect his people, and no one would
dare to rise up against him; and that if one should dare, he would be
constrained instantly to succumb. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I shall not stay now to recite the opinions of
others; nor does it seem necessary. I might have indeed referred in the last
verse to what some say respecting the roaring of God, &#8212; that his voice
will roar through the Gospel: but as this and the like are refinements of which
I think the Prophet never thought, it is enough to understand the simple meaning
of the Prophet, and not to accumulate the sentiments of others. I indeed know
that this makes a great display, and there are some who are delighted with a
mass of opinions; but I regard what is more useful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the last verse, in which the Lord
complains,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that he had been
compassed with the falsehood and fraud of the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By these words he means that he
had in every thing found the multiplied perfidy of the Israelites; for this is
the import of the word, &#8220;compassed&#8221;. We now then perceive that the
Prophet means that the Israelites, not only in one way, or in one thing, acted
unfaithfully towards God, and used frauds: but that it was the same, as when one
besieges an enemy with a great army; so that they were thus full of innumerable
frauds, with which on every side they surrounded God. And this is what
hypocrites are wont to do; for not only in one thing do they endeavour to
deceive God, but they transform themselves in various ways, and ever seek some
new subterfuges. When they are caught in one sin, they pass into another; so
that there is no end to their deceit. This subject the Prophet now takes up,
that is, that the Israelites never ceased to act deceitfully towards
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>frauds and
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for they thought that they
escaped, provided they covered themselves with some disguise whenever the
Prophets reproved them. But God here testifies, that they gained nothing by
their craftiness, as though he said, &#8220;Ye think indeed that your coverings
will avail with me, but they are vain. I indeed see myself as it were
encompassed by your falsehoods, for on every side ye attempt to cover your sins;
but they are false coverings.&#8221; In short, the Prophet reprobates those
specious excuses, by which people think that they are absolved before God, so as
to elude through this confidence all the threatening and reproofs of the
Prophets. &#8220;I see,&#8221; the Lord says, &#8220;what the Israelites bring
forward for themselves; but they are only falsehoods and frauds.&#8221; This
passage then teaches, that men in vain make excuses before God; for when they
contrive pretences to deceive God, they are themselves greatly deceived; for he
clearly perceives their guiles and falsehoods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah still
ruled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>held sovereignty, with God, and
was faithful with the saints</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By saying
that he held sovereignty with God, he declares, I doubt not, that the kingdom of
Judah was legitimate, because it was connected with a pure and lawful
priesthood. For whence did arise the corruptions in the other kingdom, but
because the people had revolted from the family of David? Hence it was that the
new king changed both the law and the worship of God, and erected new temples.
Israel then did not rule with God, for the kingdom was spurious, and the
beginning of the dispersion, so that the people forsook God. But of Judah the
Prophet speaks much otherwise, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he still ruled with
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> because the posterity of David,
though we know that they laboured under many vices, had not yet changed the
worship prescribed by the law, except that Ahab had erected an altar like one at
Damascus, as the sacred history relates,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;121612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:12;) but yet pure religion always prevailed at Jerusalem. But the
Prophet speaks comparatively, as it will be presently seen: for he does not
wholly excuse the Jews, but says that in comparison with Israel they yet ruled
with God; for the kingdom and the priesthood, as we have said, were joined
together in Judah, and both had been divinely instituted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says further, that he <i>was
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful with the
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By saints some understand God.
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y&ccedil;wdq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kodushim</i>, we know, is plurals and sometimes an epithet of the singular
number is joined to it, though not often. In the last chapter of
Joshua</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">we have these words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arh
&#181;y&ccedil;wdq</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>kodushim eva,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holy is
he</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But as I have said, these examples
are rare. And here I know not whether or not the Prophet means God. I would
rather refer this word to the holy fathers or to the whole Church; so that the
Prophet calls here
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y&ccedil;wdq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kodushim</i>, saints, Abraham and others who justly deserved to be counted
among the children of God; and I am inclined to include the angels. But of the
sanctuary we do not find this word anywhere used; when the Scripture refers to
the sanctuary, the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>m,</i> is added. He uses indeed the plural number, though one may suppose
that both the sanctuary and its worship are here intended. But as this
application would be strained, and without example, I am satisfied with this
plain meaning &#8212; that Judah was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful with the
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, that he retained faith
in God together with the fathers, and departed not from the pure worship which
had been delivered to him, according to which God had made his covenant with
Abraham and his seed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet here praises the tribe of Judah, not
because he wished to flatter them; but, as it has been stated in a former place,
he had regard to the office deputed to him. When we at this day cry against our
domestic evils, when we say that things are better ordered elsewhere, under what
supposition is this done? We take it as granted, that others have their own
teachers by whom they are reproved and if there be any vices prevailing, there
are those who are to apply the remedy. This consideration then ought often to be
remembered by us, that we may, by way of reproach, bring forward the conduct of
others, when we wish deeply to wound those, the care of whom has been committed
to us by God. Even so our Prophet did: at the same time, those who then taught
at Jerusalem did not spare the Jews; they cried boldly and vehemently against
their vices. But Hosea, as we have said, does here attend to his own vocation;
and hence he exposes the sin of the ten tribes in having departed from the
legitimate worship of God, when they had at the same time a well-known and
memorable example in the tribe of Judah, who had continued in obedience to the
law. This is the meaning. Let us now go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here inveighs against the vain hopes of
the people, for they were inflated with such arrogance, that they despised all
instruction and all admonitions. It was therefore necessary, in the first place,
to correct this vice, and hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim feeds on
wind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For when one gulps the wind, he
seems indeed to fill his mouth, and his throat, and his chest, and his whole
stomach; but there is nothing but air, no nourishment. So he says that Israel
entertained indeed much confidence in their crafty ways, but it was to feed only
on the wind. They dreamt that they were happy, when they secured confederacies,
when they had both the Assyrians and the Egyptians as their associates. They are
only blasts, says the Prophet; nay, he says, they are noxious blasts; for by the
<i>East</i> he understands the east wind, which blows from the rising of the
sun; and this, as they say, is in Judea a dry and often a stormy wind. Other
winds either bring rain or some other advantage: but this wind brings nothing
but drought and storms. It hence then appears that the Prophet meant that
Israel, through this their vain confidence, procured for themselves many sorrows
and ever remained void and empty.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim then feeds on the
wind,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and further, he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>follows after the east
wind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hosea explains afterwards his mind more clearly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He daily multiplies falsehood and
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says. By falsehood he
glances, I have no doubt, at the impostures by which the people deceived
themselves, as hypocrites do, who, by sharpening their wits to deceive God,
involve themselves in many fatal snares. So also is Israel said to have
multiplied falsehood; for they made themselves so obstinate, as to become quite
hardened against God&#8217;s teaching; and this obstinacy is called falsehood
for this reason, for unbelieving men, as we see, fabricate for themselves many
excuses; and though they be impostures, they yet think themselves safe against
all the threatening of God, provided they set up, I know not what, something
which they think will be sufficiently available. Hence the Prophet repeats
again, that there was nothing but falsehood in all their crafty
decrees.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then presses the point still more, and says, that
it was &#8220;desolation&#8221;, that is, the cause of desolation. He then first
derides the vain confidence of the people, because they thought that they could
blind the eyes of God by their vain disguises; &#8220;This is falsehood,&#8221;
he says &#8220;this is imposture.&#8221; Then he presses them more heavily and
says &#8220;This is your perdition: you shall at last perceive, that you have
gained nothing by your counsels but destruction.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How so? Because they made a <i>covenant.</i> I take
this latter clause as explanatory: for if the Prophet had only spoken generally,
the impiety of the people would not have been sufficiently exposed; and the
masks of secure men must be torn away, and their crimes, as it were, painted,
that they may be ashamed; for except they are drawn forth as it were before the
public, and their turpitude exposed to the view of all, they will ever hide
themselves in their secret places. This then is the reason why the Prophet here
specifically points out their frauds, which he had before mentioned.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they made a covenant
with the Assyrian, and carry their oil into
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, they hunt for the
friendship of the Assyrian on one side, and on the other they conciliate with
great importunity the Egyptians; nay, they spare not their own goods, for they
carry presents in order to gain them. We now then understand how Israel had
multiplied falsehood and desolation; for they implicated themselves in illicit
compacts. But why it was unlawful for them to fly to the Assyrians and
Egyptians, we have explained elsewhere, nor is it needful here to repeat at
large what has been said: God wished the people to be under his protection; and
when God promised to be the defender of their safety, they ought to have been
satisfied with his protection alone: but when they retook themselves to Egypt
and to Assyria, it was a clear evidence of unbelief; for it was the same as to
deny the power of God to be sufficient for them. And we also know that the
Israelites never went to Assyria or to Egypt, except when they meditated the
destruction of their own brethren; for they often laboured to overturn the
kingdom of Judah: they only sought associates to gratify their own cruelty. But
this one reason, however, was abundantly sufficient to condemn them, that they
fortified themselves by foreign aids, when God was willing to keep them as it
were inclosed under his own wings. Whenever then we attempt to provide for
ourselves by unlawful means, it is the same thing as if we denied God; for he
calls and invites us to come under his protection: but when we run in our
thoughts here and there, and seek some vain helps, we grievously dishonour God:
it is, as it were, to fly into Egypt or into Assyria. And for this purpose ought
the doctrine of this verse to be applied. It follow &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It may seem strange that the Prophet should now say,
that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had a controversy with
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for he had before said, that
Judah stood faithful with the saints. It seems indeed inconsistent, that God
should litigate with the Jews, and yet declare them to be upright and separate
them from the perfidious and ungodly. What then does this mean? The Prophet, as
we have said, spake comparatively of the tribe of Judah, when he said that they
remained faithful with the saints: for he did not intend wholly to exculpate the
Jews, who were also full of grievous evils; but he intended to praise the
worship which as yet prevailed at Jerusalem, that the impiety of the ten tribes
might appear less excusable, who of their own accord had departed from the rule
which God had given.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When any one at this day reproves the Papists, they
say, that another mode of worship is unknown to them, and that they have been
thus taught by their forefathers, and that the worship which they observe has so
continued from antiquity, that they dare not either to change it or to deviate
from it. Such might have been the excuse made by the Israelites. But the prophet
charges them with voluntary defection, for the temple which God had chosen for
himself stood in their sight; there the face of God was in a manner to be seen;
for all things were arranged according to the heavenly pattern which had been
shown to Moses in the mount. Since then pure religion was before their eyes, was
not their sin proved by this very fact, that having neglected the word of God,
they gave themselves up to new and fictitious modes of worship? The Prophet then
had before praised the worship, but not the manners, of the tribe of Judah; and
he now comes to their manners, and says, that there were many things in Judah
which God would chastise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath a controversy with
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and he will begin with that
tribe, and will then come down to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, however, speaks here
only in passing of the house of Judah, and touches but lightly on the
controversy he had with that portion of the people. How was this? Because be was
not a teacher, as it has been said already, set over the kingdom of Judah, but
only over the Israelites. He now refers only to that kingdom for the purpose of
striking terror into his own people: as though he said &#8220;Think ye that the
forbearance of God is to be forever, because he has hitherto borne with you?
Nay, God will begin to contend with the tribe of Judah. I have said, indeed,
that they are innocent compared with you; but yet they shall not escape
punishment; for in a short time God will summon them to judgement. If he will
not spare the Jews, how can your great crimes go unpunished? For certainly you
deserve hundred deaths in comparison with the Jews, among whom at least some
integrity and uprightness exist; for they have made no change in the worship of
God. Their life is corrupt; but yet the law of God and religion are not despised
by them as they are by you. If then God will not spare them, much less will he
spare you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand for what purpose the Prophet says
that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had a controversy with
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for it was not his design to
terrify the Jews themselves, or to exhort them to repentance, except it may be
by the way; but his object was to present an example to the Israelites, that
they might fear; for they ought to have thought within themselves, &#8220;If
this shall be done in the green, what shall become of the dry tree?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422331&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:31.) If God will exercise with so much severity his vengeance against our
brethren the Jews, among whom pure religion as yet exists, what sort of end and
how dreadful is that which awaits us, who have departed from the law, the
worship, the teaching, and the obedience of God, who are become truce-breakers,
and degenerate, and in every way profane?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will punish
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> &#8220;God will indeed begin with
the tribe of Judah; this will be the prelude, and he will treat the Jews more
mildly than you; but against you he will thunder in full force. It will not then
be a remonstrance to draw you to repentance, but a punishment such as ye
deserve; for he has already contended with you more than
enough.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to his ways. according to
his doings, will he recompense him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He
sets down here <i>ways</i> and <i>doings,</i> with no superfluous repetition,
but to show that the repentance of this people had been already more than
sufficiently looked for; for they had not ceased for a long time to pursue their
own wickedness. The Prophet then, no doubt, condemns here the Jews for their
perverse wickedness, that they never left off their sins, though they had now
for a long time been admonished, and had been often reproved by the Prophets. It
now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In all this discourse the Prophet condemns the
ingratitude of the people; and then he shows how shamefully they had departed
from the example of their father, in whose name they yet took pride. This is the
substance. Their ingratitude is showed in this, that they did not acknowledge
that they had been anticipated, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the
person of their father Jacob, by the gratuitous mercy of God. The first history
is indeed referred to for this end, that the posterity of Jacob might understand
that they had been elected by God before they were born. For Jacob did not, by
choice or design, lay hold on the heel of his brother in his mother&#8217;s
womb; but it was an extraordinary thing. It was then God who guided the hand of
the infant, and by this sign testified his adoption to be gratuitous. In short,
by saying that Jacob held the foot of his brother in his mother&#8217;s womb,
the same thing is intended, as if God had reminded the Israelites, that they did
not excel other people by their own virtue or that of their parents; but that
God of his own good pleasure had chosen them. The same is alleged against them
by Malachi,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Were not Jacob and
Esau brethren? Yet Jacob I loved, and Esau I regarded with hatred,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Malachi
1:2,3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For we know wish what haughtiness this nation has
ever exalted itself. &#8220;But whence have ye arisen? Look back to your origin:
ye are indeed the children of Abraham and Isaac. In what then do ye differ from
the Idumeans? They have certainly been begotten by Esau; and Esau was the son of
Isaac and the brother of Jacob, and indeed the first-born. Ye then do not excel
as to any dignity that may exist in you. Own then your origin, and know that
whatever excellency may be in you proceeds from the mere favour of God, and this
ought to bind you more and more to him. Whence then is this
pride?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Even thus does our Prophet now speak,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob held the foot of his
brother in his mother&#8217;s womb</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that
is, &#8220;You have a near relationship with Esau and his posterity; but they
are detested by you. Whence is this? Is it for some merit of your own? Boast
when you can show that any thing has proceeded from you which could gain favour
before God. Nay, your father Jacob, a most holy man indeed, while yet in his
mother&#8217;s womb, laid hold on the foot of his brother Esau; that is, when he
became superior to his brother and gained primogeniture, he was not grown up,
and could do nothing by his own choice or power, for he was then inclosed in his
mother&#8217;s womb, and had no worthiness, no merit. Your ingratitude is now
then the more base, for God had put you under obligations to him before ye were
born; in the person of the holy patriarch he chose you for his possession. But
now, having forsaken him, and relinquished the worship which he has taught in
his law, ye abandon yourselves to idols and impious superstitions. Bring now
your pretences by which ye cover your impiety! Is not your baseness so gross and
palpable, that you ought to be ashamed of it?&#8221; We now then understand the
end for which the Prophet said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Esau&#8217;s foot was laid hold
on by Jacob in his mother&#8217;s
womb</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, this passage clearly shows that men do not
gain the favour of God by their free-will, but are chosen by his goodness alone
before they are born, and chosen, not on account of works, as the Papists
imagine, who concede some election to God, but think that it depends on future
works. But if it be so, the charge of the Prophet was frigid and jejune. Now
since God through his good pleasure alone anticipates men, and adopts those whom
he pleases, not on account of works, but through his own mercy, it hence follows
that those who have been chosen are more bound to him, and that they are less
excusable when they reject the favour offered to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here someone may object and say, that it is
strange that the posterity of Jacob should be said to have been elected in his
person, and yet they had in the meantime departed from God; for the election of
God in this case would not be sure and permanent; and we know that whom God
elects he also justifies, and their salvation is so secured, that none of them
can perish; all the elect are also delivered to Christ as their preserver, that
he may keep them by his divine power, which is invincible, as John teaches in
chapter 10 What then does this mean? Now we know, and it has been before stated,
that the election of God as to that people was twofold; for the one was general,
and the other special. The election of holy Jacob was special, for he was really
one of the children of God; special also was the election of those who are
called by Paul the children of the promise,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:8.) There was another, a general election; for he received his whole seed into
his faith, and offered to all his covenant. At the same time, they were not all
regenerated, they were not all gifted with the Spirit of adoption. This general
election was not then efficacious in all. Solved now is the matter in debate,
that no one of the elect shall perish; for the whole people were not elected in
a special manner; but God knew whom he had chosen out of that people; and them
he endued, as we have said, with the Spirit of adoption, and supplied with his
own grace, that they might never fall away. Others were indeed chosen in a
certain way, that is, God offered to them the covenant of salvation; but yet
through their ingratitude they caused God to reject them, and to disown them as
children.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet subjoins, that Jacob
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by his strength had power with
God, and had prevailed also with the
angel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He reproaches here the Israelites
for making a false claim to the name of Jacob, since they had nothing in common
with him, but had shamefully departed from his example. He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had then power with the angel and
with God himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he prevailed over
the angel. But what sort of persons were they? As the heathen Poets called the
Romans, when they became degenerated and effeminate, Romulidians, and said that
they had sprung from those remarkable and illustrious heroes, whose prowesses
were then well known, and for the same reason called them Scipiadians; so also
the Prophet says, &#8220;Come now, ye children of Jacob, what sort of men are
ye? He was endued with a heroic, yea, with an angelic power, and even more than
angelic; for he wrestled with God and gained the victory: but ye are the slaves
of idols; the devil retains you devoted to himself; ye are, as it were, in a
bawdy house; for what else is your temple but a brothel? And then ye are like
adulterers, and daily commit adultery with your idols. Your abominations, what
are they but filthy chains, and which grove that there is no knowledge and no
heart in you? For you must have been fascinated, when ye forsook God and adopted
new and profane modes of worship.&#8221; This difference between the holy
patriarch Jacob and his posterity must be marked, otherwise we shall not
understand the object of the Prophet; and it will avail but little to collect
various opinions, except first we know what the Prophet meant, and what was the
purport of this upbraiding, and of this narrative, that Jacob had power with God
and the angel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be noticed, that God and angel are here
mentioned in the same sense; we may, indeed, render it angel in both places; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Aleim,</i> as well as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;alm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melac,</i> signifies an angel. But, however, every doubt is removed by the
Prophet, when he at last adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah, God of hosts, Jehovah is
his name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> for here the Prophet expressly
mentions the essential name of God, by which he testifies, that the same was the
eternal and the only true God, who yet was at the same time an angel. But it may
be asked, How was he the eternal God, and at the same time an angel? It occurs,
indeed, so frequently in Scripture, that it must be well known to us, that when
the Lord appeared by his angel, the name of Jehovah was given to them, not
indeed to all the angels indiscriminately but to the chief angel, by whom God
manifested himself. This, as I have said, must be well known to us. It then
follows that this angel was truly and essentially God. But this would not
strictly apply to God, except there be some distinction of persons. There must
then be some person in the Deity, to which this name and title of an angel can
apply; for if we take the name, God, without difference or distinction, and
regard it as denoting his essence, it would certainly be inconsistent to say,
that he is God and an angel too; but when we distinguish persons in the Deity,
there is no inconsistency. How so? Because Christ, the eternal Wisdom of God,
did put on the character of a Mediator, before he put on our flesh. He was
therefore then a Mediator, and in that capacity he was also an angel. He was at
the same time Jehovah, who is now God manifested in the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must, on the other hand, refute the delirium,
or the diabolical madness of that caviller, Servetus, who imagined that Christ
was from the beginning an angel, as if he was a phantom, and a distinct person,
having an essence apart from the Father; for he says, that he was formed from
three untreated elements. This diabolical conceit ought to be wholly discarded
by us. But Christ, though he was God, was also a Mediator; and as a Mediator, he
is rightly and fitly called the angel or the messenger of God, for he has of his
own accord placed himself between the Father and men.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as
thou slowest thyself to us at this day so kindly as a Father, having presented
to us a singular and an invaluable pledge of thy favour in thy only begotten
Son, &#8212; O grant, that we may entirely devote ourselves to thee, and truly
render thee that free service and obedience which is due to a Father, so that we
may have no other object in life but to confirm that adoption, with which thou
hast once favoured us, until we at length, being gathered into thy eternal
kingdom, shall partake of its fruit, together with Christ Jesus thy Son.
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
THIRTY-SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yesterday we explained how it seemed proper to call
him who appeared to holy Jacob in Bethel both God and an angel; for the name,
Jehovah by which is expressed the eternal power, essence, and majesty of God,
could not be transferred to a mere angel. It is hence certain that he was the
only true God. But it could not be, that he was simply and without any
distinction called an angel; but as Christ even then sustained the character of
a Mediator, he was not inconsistently called an angel; and yet we know that he
is the eternal God. So this passage is worthy of being remembered, as it bears
testimony to the divinity of Christ; for the Prophet clearly affirms that he is
Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, and that he is so by his own power;
and that he does not subsist in another, as all creatures do. Since then he is
so, his sovereignty is proved, so that he is not inferior to the
Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, that this is his <i>memorial,</i> or
remembrance. This expression has reference to men; the Prophet then means, that
this wonderful and magnificent name would be well known in the world, when
Christ should be revealed. The people, indeed, even then acknowledged that the
true God appeared to their father Jacob; but the knowledge of a Mediator was
hitherto obscure. The Prophet then seems to have respect here to the coming of
Christ; as though he said, that the name, Jehovah, would be widely known to all,
when the Mediator would be more clearly exhibited. But I will come now to the
other parts of the passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was a
prince</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or had power,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by his strength with God.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">What this saying imports, I shall shortly explain.
The name, Israel, was given to Jacob, because of the victory he obtained in that
noble wrestling, of which mention is made in Genesis 32: for the holy man had
not a contest with a mortal being, but with God himself; and he overcame in that
combat, and is hence called the conqueror of God. As this mode of speaking is
harsh, some have endeavoured by a comment to turn it to something more moderate,
that is, that Jacob was a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prince
with God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> meaning, that God approved of
his unwonted courage. But God meant to express something more, when he gave this
name to his servant; for he confessed that he gave way, being, as it were,
overcome, and yielded the palm of victory to holy Jacob. And this ought not to
appear strange to us; for we know that whenever God proves our faith, and tries
us by temptations, these are so many combats by which he contends with us; for
he seeks to find out what is the strength of our faith. Now? when we are said to
wrestle with God, and the issue of the contest be such, that God leaves the
victory to us, we are not then improperly called conquerors, yea, even of God
himself. But how? Because God works wonderfully in his saints, so that by his
own power he casts down himself; and while he wrestles with us, he supplies us
with strength, by which we are enabled to bear the weight and pressure of the
contest. Were God to assail us, what would he find but weakness? But when he
calls us to the struggle, he at the same time supplies us with the necessary
arms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is a wonderful marshalling of the contest,
when God on one side makes himself an antagonist, and, on the other, fights in
us against his own temptations, or against all those wrestlings by which he
tries our faith. Hence God is said to be overcome by us, when, by the power and
aid of his own Spirit, he strengthens and renders us unconquerable; yea, when he
makes us to triumph over temptations, and when we consider everything, such is
the state of the case, that God will have the greater portion of strength to be
on our side, and that he only takes the weaker portion to tempt and try us.
There is not indeed, in this case, to be imagined by us, any such separation, as
if God was divided against himself; but we know, that when he tries our faith,
he comes forth as if he were a contender, or as if he challenged us to the
contest. This is indeed certain. For what are temptations, or what is their
object, but to afford us an occasion to exhibit, as on a field of battle, an
example and proof of our strength and firmness? But this could not be done
without an adversary; for what advantage would it be to fight with a shadow? or
when no one engages with us? Hence God is like an adversary whenever he tries
our faith; and, as it has been said before, we have this contest not with men,
but with God himself. We have indeed to contend with the devil; for Paul says,
that we have to fight not (only) with flesh and blood, but with mighty powers,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:12.) This is doubtless true; but the Lord, at the same time, holds the first
place, as that remarkable passage in Job testified, &#8216;The Lord gave, the
Lord has taken away,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
1:14.) So, then, we must engage with God himself. How so? Because he tries and
proves us. But he does not tempt us, as James says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:14;) for a person is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust. He does
not tempt us to evil; he does not instil into us corrupt desires, which grow up
spontaneously, and which are innate in our nature: but he tempts, that is,
proves us, as he is said to have tempted Abraham,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since it is so, we must now wrestle with God; but for
what end? That we may conquer: for God intends not to overwhelm us, while he is
making known our faith and constancy of obedience; but, on the contrary, he
builds a theatre, on which to show his gifts. We therefore come to the struggle
with the hope of overcoming. That we may overcome, he, as I have said, not only
exhorts us to be strong, but supplies us also with arms, endues us with
strength, and also fights himself, in a manner, with us, and is powerful in us,
and enables us to overcome our temptations. For this reason, Jacob is said to
have power with God, or to have been God&#8217;s conqueror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what the Prophet adds may seem strange, that this
was done by <i>his strength.</i> He had power with God, he says, by his own
strength. But if Israel had fought by his own valour, he could not have borne
even the shadow of God, for he must have fallen. He must have been brought to
nothing, had he not power greater than that of man. What, then, does this mean,
that he was a conqueror by his own strength? We grant, that this strength, of
which the Prophet speaks, may be ascribed to holy Jacob when he gained dominion.
There is no better title, as they commonly say, than that of donation; and God
is wont to transfer to us whatever he bestows, as if it were our own. It is then
necessary to distinguish wisely here between the strength which man has in
himself, and that which God confers on him. The Papists, as soon as any mention
is made of the strength or power of man, instantly lay hold on it, and say,
&#8220;If there is no freewill in man, there is no strength, or there is no
power to resist.&#8221; But they betray their own stupidity and thoughtlessness,
inasmuch as they cannot distinguish between the intrinsic strength which is in
man himself by nature, and the adventitious strength with which God endues men,
and which is the gift of the Holy Spirit. And the Prophet, when he here commends
the strength of holy Jacob, does not extol his free-will, as though he derived
strength from himself, by which he overcame God; but he means that he was
divinely endued with unconquerable power, so that he came forth a conqueror in
the contest. We now then apprehend the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And since this was especially worthy of being
remembered, he repeats, that he had power with the angel, and prevailed. But we
have already said how Jacob prevailed not indeed of himself, but because God had
so distributed his power, that the greater part was in Jacob himself. I am
therefore wont, when I speak of the wrestling and of the daily contests with
which God exercises the godly, to adduce this similitude, &#8212; That God
fights with us with his left hand, and defends us with his right hand, that is,
he assails us in a weak manner, (so to speak,) and at the same time stretches
forth his right hand to defend us: he displays, in the latter instance, his
greater power, that we may become victorious in the struggle. And this mode of
speaking, though at the first view it seems harsh, does yet wonderfully set
forth the grace and goodness of God, inasmuch as he deigns to humble himself for
our sake, so as to choose to concede to us the praise of victory; not indeed
that we may become proud of ourselves, but that he may be thus more glorified,
when he prefers exercising his power in defending us rather than in overwhelming
us, which he could do with one breath of his mouth. For he has no need of making
any effort to reduce us to nothing: if he only chooses to blow on the whole
human race, the whole world would in a moment be extinguished. But the Lord
fights with us, and at the same time suffers us not to be crushed; nay, he
raises us up on high, and, as I have already said, concedes to us the victory.
Let us now go on.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds, that he wept and entreated:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
wept</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and made supplication unto
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some explain this clause of the
angel; but I know not whether weeping was suitable to him. The saying may be
indeed defended that the angel was as it were a suppliant, when he yielded up
the conquest to the holy man; for it was the same as though he who owns himself
unequal in a contest were to throw himself on the ground. Then they explain
weeping thus, &#8220;The angel entreated the patriarch when he said, &#8216;Let
me go;&#8217; and this was a confession of victory.&#8221; The sense would then
be, that the patriarch Jacob did not gain any ordinary thing when he came forth
a conqueror in the struggle; for God was in a manner the suppliant, for he
conceded to him the name and praise of a conqueror. But I prefer explaining this
of the patriarch, and to do so is, in my judgement, more suitable. It is not
indeed said that Jacob wept; that is, it is not, I own, stated distinctly and
expressly by Moses; but weeping may be taken for that humility which the
faithful ever bring to the presence of God: and then weeping was meet for the
patriarch; for he so gained the victory in the combat, that he did not depart
without grief and loss, inasmuch as we know that his leg was put out of joint,
and that his thigh was dislocated so that he was lame all his life. Jacob then
obtained the victory, and there triumphed with God&#8217;s approbation: but yet
he departed not whole, for God had left him lame. He felt then no small grief,
since this weakness in his body continued through life. Hence weeping did not
ill become the holy man, who was humbled in the struggle, though he carried away
the palm of victory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this ought to be carefully noticed; for here the
Prophet meets all calumnies, when he so moderates the sentence, that he takes
away nothing from God and his glory, though he thus splendidly adorns the
victory of the patriarch. He was then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a prince with
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prevailed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
also, he became a conqueror, &#8212; but how? He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet wept and entreated
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which means, that there was no
cause for pride that he carried away the palm of victory from the contest, but
that God led him to humility even by the dislocation of his thigh or leg: and so
he entreated him. The praying of Jacob is related by Moses, which he made, when
he asked to be blessed. But the less, as the Apostle says, is blessed by the
greater,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:7.) Then Jacob did not exalt himself, as blind men do, who claim merit to
themselves; but he prayed to God, and asked to be blessed by Him, who owned
himself to be overcome. And this ought to be carefully observed, especially the
additional circumstance; for we hence learn that there is no cause why they who
are proved by temptations should flee away from God, though our flesh indeed
seeks ease, and desires to be spared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when a temptation is at hand, we withdraw
ourselves, and there is no one who would not gladly make a truce, and also hide
himself at a distance from the presence of God. Inasmuch then as we desire God
to be far from us, when he comes forth as an antagonist to try our faith, this
praying of Jacob ought to be remembered; for though he had his leg disjointed,
though he was worn out with weariness, he did not yet withdraw himself, he did
not wish the departure of the angel, but retained him as it were by force:
&#8220;Thou shalt bless me; I would rather contend with thee, and be wholly
consumed, than to let thee go before thou blesses me.&#8221; We hence see that
we ought to seek the presence of God; though he may severely try us, though we
may suffer much, though our strength fail, though we may be made lame through
life, we ought not yet to shun the presence of God, but rather embrace him with
both arms, and retain him as it were by force; for it is much better to groan
under our burden, and to feel his power who is above us, than to continue free
from toil, and to rot in our pleasures, as they do whom God forsakes. And we see
how much such an indulgence ought to be dreaded by us; for unless we are daily
sharpened by various temptations, we immediately gather rust and other evils. It
is therefore necessary, in order that we may continue in a sound state, that our
contests should be daily renewed: and hence I have said, that we ought to seek
the presence of God, however severe the wresting may be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He found him in
Bethel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> To remove every ambiguity, I
would render it, &#8220;In Bethel he had found him.&#8221; It is indeed a verb
in the future tense; but it is certain that the Prophet speaks of the past. But
when we take the past tense, ambiguity in the language still remains; for some
thus understand the place, that God had afterwards found Jacob in Bethel, or,
that Jacob had found God; that is, when the name of Israel was confirmed to him,
after the destruction of the town of Sichem; for, to console his grief, God
appeared to him there again. They then explain this of a second vision in that
place. But it seems to me that the Prophet had another thing in view, even this,
that God had already found Jacob in Bethel, that he had met him when he fled to
Syria, and went away through the fear of his brother. It was then for the first
time that God appeared to his servant, and exhorted him to faithfulness: he
promised to him a safe return to his own country. The Prophet then means, that
Jacob gained the victory, because God had long before began to embrace him in
his love, and also testified his love when he had manifested himself to him in
Bethel. Hence he found him in Bethel. This might indeed be referred to Jacob,
&#8220;He found him in Bethel;&#8221; that is, he found God. But as it is
immediately added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There he spake
with us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and as this cannot be applied
to any other than to God himself, I am inclined to add also, that God had found
Jacob in Bethel. And the Prophet commends to us again the gratuitous goodness of
God towards Jacob, because he deigned to meet him on his way, and to show that
he was the leader of Jacob on his journey: for he did not think previously that
God was nigh him, as he says himself,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;This is the house
of God, and the gate of heaven,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and
I knew it not,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
28:16,17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore the holy man thought himself to be as
it were cast away by God, and destitute of all aid, when he was alone and
without any hope, God is said to have found him; for of his own good will he
presented himself to him, when the holy man hoped no such thing, nor conceived
such a thing in his mind. Hence God had already found his servant in Bethel; and
there he spake, or (that the same strain may be continued) had spoken to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There he had spoken with
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnm[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>omnu,</i> for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wm[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>omu</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, he had
spoken with him; and they do this, being forced by necessity; for they find no
sense in the words that God spake with us in Bethel. But there is no need to
change the words contrary to rules of grammar. Others who dare not to depart
from the words of the Prophet, imagine a sense wholly different. Some say,
&#8220;He spake with us there;&#8221; that is, &#8220;The Lord speaks by me,
Hosea, and by Amos, who is my colleague and friend: for we denounce on you, by
his authority, utter ruin and destruction; and God has made known to us at
Bethel whatever we bring to you.&#8221; But how strained is this, all must see:
this is to wrest Scripture, and not to explain it. Others also speak still more
frigidly: &#8220;There he spake with us,&#8221; as though the angel had said,
&#8220;Wait, the Lord will speak with us; I have called thee Israel, but the
Lord will at length come, who will ratify what I now say to thee:&#8221; as if
he was not indeed the eternal God; but this he immediately expresses when he
says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is his memorial,
Jehovah of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But thus the Jews
trifle, who are like irrational beings whenever there is a reference made to
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There does not seem, however, to be any great reason
why we should toil much about the Prophet&#8217;s words: and some even of the
Rabbis (not to deprive them of their just praise) have observed this to be the
meaning, That the Lord had so spoken with Jacob, that what he said belonged to
the whole people. For doubtless whatever God then promised to his servant
appertained to the whole body of the people, and all his posterity. Why then do
interpreters so greatly torment themselves, when it is evident that God spake
through the person of one man with all the posterity of Abraham? And this agrees
best with the context; for the Prophet now applies, so to speak, to the whole
people what he had hitherto recorded of the patriarch Jacob. That they might not
then think that the history of one man was related, he says that it belongs to
all. How so? Because the Lord had so spoken with holy Jacob, that his voice
ought to resound in the ears of all. For what was said to the holy man? Did God
only reveal himself to him? Did he promise to be a Father only to him? Nay, he
adopted his whole seed, and extended his favour to all his posterity. Since then
he had so spoken to all the Israelites, they ought now to be more ashamed of
their defection, inasmuch as they had so much degenerated from their father,
with whom they were yet connected. For there was a sacred bond of unity between
Jacob and his children, since God embraced them all in his love, and favoured
them all with his adoption. We now perceive the mind of the Prophet. Let us
proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is now here urgent on the people. Having
referred to the example of the patriarch, he shows how unlike him were his
posterity, with whom God could avail nothing by sound teaching, though he was
constantly solicitous for their salvation, and stirred up his Prophets to bring
back the lost and scattered to the way of safety. Since then it was so, the
Prophet accuses them of ingratitude. But he speaks first of repentance; and then
he shows that he and other ministers of God had laboured in vain; for such was
the perversity of the people, that teaching had no effect. His sermon is short,
but yet it contains much.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to thy
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He glances here at the apostasy of the
people, by bidding them to turn to their God, and, at the same time, condemns
whatever the Israelites were wont to set up as a defence, when the Prophets
reproved them. For they wished their own fictitious modes of worship to come in
as a reason; they wished the gods devised by themselves to occupy the place of
the true God. The Prophet cuts off the handle from subterfuges of this kind by
commanding the people to turn to their God. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;you do indeed worship gods, and greatly weary yourselves in your
superstitions; but confess that you are apostates, who have rejected the law
delivered to you by the true God. <i>Return,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to your
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i> And he calls God the God of
Israel, not to honour them, but to-reproach them, because they had willingly and
designedly cast off the worship of the true God, who had made himself known to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is afterwards shown the true way of repentance.
The beginning of the verse, as I have already said, requires the people to
repent; but as we know that men trifle with God when they are called to
repentance, it is not in vain that a definitive, or, at least, a short
description of repentance, is added by which is made evident what it is to
repent, or to turn to God. Then the Prophet says, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or kindness
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
judgement</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He begins with the second
table, and then he adds piety towards God. But he lays down two things only, in
which he included the whole teaching of the second table. For what is
God&#8217;s design, from the fifth to the last commandment, but to teach us to
shape our life according to the rule of love? We are then taught in the second
table of the law how we ought to act towards our brethren; or if one wishes to
have a shorter summary, in the second table of the law are shown the mutual
duties of men. But the Prophet begins here with the second part of the law; for
the Prophets are not wont strictly to observe order, Nor do they always observe
a regular method; but it is enough with them to mention the main things by which
they explain their subject; and hence, it is no wonder that the Prophet here,
according to his usual manner, mentions love in the first place, and then goes
on to the worship of God. This order, as I have said, is not indeed either
natural or legitimate; but this is of no importance; nay, it was not without the
best reason that the Prophets usually did this; for repentance is better tested
by the observance of the second table, than by that of divine worship. For as
hypocrites dissemble, and hide themselves with wonderful coverings, the Lord
applies a touchstone, and this he does whenever he draws them to the light, and
exposes to public view their frauds, robberies, cruelty, perjuries, thefts, and
such like vices. Since, then, hypocrites can be better convicted by the second
table of the law, the Lord rightly appeals to this when he speaks of repentance;
as though he said, &#8220;Let it now be made evident what your repentance is,
whether it be feigned or sincere; for if you act justly and uprightly towards
your neighbours, if you observe equity and rectitude, it is a sure evidence of
your repentance.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, the Prophet overlooks not the
worship of God; for he adds, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hope always in thy
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By the word, hope, he first
requires faith, and then prayer, which arises from it, and thanksgiving, which
necessarily follows. Thus the whole worship of God is briefly included, as a
part for the whole, in the word, hope. The meaning of the Prophet then is, that
Israel, forsaking their own superstitions, should recumb on the one true God,
and place all their salvation on him, that they should fly to him, and ascribe
to him alone the praise due for all blessings. By so doing, they would restore
the pure worship of God, and cast away all their adulterous superstitions. He
had spoken already of the second table of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that repentance is nothing else but a
reformation of the whole life according to the law of God. For God has explained
his will in his law; and as much as we depart or deviate from it, so much we
depart from the Lord. But when we turn to God, the true proof is, when we amend
our life according to his law, and begin with worshipping him spiritually, the
main part of which worship is faith, from which proceeds prayer; and when, in
addition to this, we act kindly and justly towards our neighbours, and abstain
from all injuries, frauds, robberies, and all kinds of wickedness. This is the
true evidence of repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But while the Prophet exhorted the Israelites to
repentance, he adds, that such was their perverseness, that it was done without
any fruit.<i> Canaan!</i> he says; I read this by itself; for what some consider
to be understood is frigid, as, &#8220;He was assimilated to, or was like
Canaan, in whose hand,&#8221; etc.. But, on the contrary, the Prophet here
condemns the Israelites by one word; as though he said, that they were wholly
aliens, and unworthy to be called the children of Abraham. And thus what we say
is often abrupt, when we speak indignantly. The Prophet then calls them
&#8220;Canaan&#8221; through indignation; which means this, &#8220;Ye are not
the children of Abraham; ye falsely boast of his name, which cannot be suitable
to you; for ye are Canaan.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his hand is the balance of
fraud, he loves to plunder</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or to spoil.
Literally it is, he loves to spoil. But the sense is clear, that they loved to
plunder; that is, they were carried away with all greediness to acts of robbery.
It must first be noticed, that the Prophet here exposes to infamy the carnal
descendants of Abraham by calling them Canaan, and this imputation is often to
be met with in the Prophets. And the reason why they were thus addressed was,
that these senseless men were wont proudly to set up as their shield the
distinction of their race. &#8220;What! we are a holy people.&#8221; Since by
this pretence they rejected all the warnings of the Prophets, God casts back
this reproach, &#8220;Ye are not the children of Abraham; but ye are
Canaan:&#8221; as though he said, &#8220;Nothing in that nation has as yet
changed, the Israelites are always like themselves.&#8221; The Lord had once
cleansed the land of godless men: but when the descendants of Abraham became
like the Canaanites, they were called the seed of Canaan; as though the same
nation, which was there formerly, had still remained; for there was no
difference in their manners, for they were equal or the same in
depravity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the reason follows why he calls them the race of
Canaan even because they carried in their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand a deceitful
balance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and devoted themselves with all
avidity to plunder. The deceitful balance may be extended to their
dissimulations, fallacies, and falsehoods, by which God, as he had before
complained, was surrounded; but as it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He loves
robberies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> I prefer to understand here
those two modes of doing injury which include almost every kind of wickedness;
for men either craftily defraud when they injure others, or they do harm to
their neighbours by open force. Since, then, they who wrong their neighbours do
either openly injure them, or circumvent the simple by their frauds and crafty
dealings, Hosea lays down here, in the first place, the deceitful balance, and
then he adds their greediness in spoiling or plundering. It is then the same as
if he had said that they were fraudulent, and that they were also robbers who
proceeded with open violence. He means that they were, without law or any
restraint, addicted to acts of wrong and injustice, and were so intent on doing
mischief, as to do it either by craft or by open force. There is then no wonder
that they were called an uncircumcised race. Why? Because they had nothing to do
with God, inasmuch as they had thus departed from his law; yea, they abhorred
kindness and mercy. It also follows that they were void of all piety, since they
were thus unmindful of all equity towards their neighbours. This is the
meaning.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God complains by his Prophet, that the
Israelites flattered themselves in their vices, because their affairs succeeded
prosperously and according to their wishes: and it is a vice too common, that
men felicitate themselves as long as fortune, as they commonly say, smiles on
them, thinking that they have God then propitious to them. Since then the
condition of the people was such, they despised all the Prophets and their
reproofs. Of this hardihood the Lord now complains.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim has said I am yet become
rich</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is an emphasis to be noticed
in the adversative particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;a
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;ach&#8221;. It is sometimes in Hebrew a
simple affirmative; but here the Prophet meant to express another thing, even
this, that the Israelites laughed at all reproofs, because God seemed to be
propitious to them, as though he manifested his favour by prosperity.
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am, however, become
rich</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and therefore I care nothing for
what the Prophets may say, for I am contented with my lot.&#8221; This, as I
have said, is a common evil; and hence this passage ought to be carefully noted,
lest when the Lord spares us for a time, we may think that we are innocent
before him; for there is nothing more to be feared than the dazzling of our eyes
by a prosperous and desirable state of things. Though the Lord then may bear
with us, and not immediately draw forth his vengeance against us, but, on the
contrary, cherish us as it were kindly in his bosom; yet if he reproves us by
his word, we ought to attend to his threatenings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But they further add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All my labours shall not find
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, they shall not find
iniquity in all my labours. Many read simply as the words are, &#8220;My labours
shall not find iniquity:&#8221; but as the expression seems stiff, I have tried
to render it smoother, as others also have done, &#8220;They shall not find
iniquity in all my labours.&#8221; This boasting went farther, for the Prophet
shows that the people were not only secure, because the Lord gave them some
tokens of his paternal favour; but that they were also inebriated with this
impious confidence, that God would not have favoured them had they not been
exempt from every fault and vice: and this second clause ought to be carefully
noticed. Now it is a depravity that is by no means to be endured, when men begin
to despise God, because he deals kindly with them, and when they abuse his
levity so as to condemn all his teaching and all his threatening; this is indeed
a very great perversion: but when to all this is added such a pride, that
ungodly and reprobate men persuade themselves that they are just, because God
does not immediately punish them, &#8212; this is, as it were, a diabolical
madness; and yet we see that it is a common thing. For godless men are not only
proud of their wealth, they are not only inflated with their own power; but they
also think that God is in some way under obligations to them. &#8220;Why! it
must be that God regards me innocent, and pure from every vice, for he favours
me: he then does not find in me what is worthy of punishment.&#8221; Thus the
wicked raise up their horns against God, while he indulges them, and appears not
so severe towards them as they have deserved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When at the present day we perceive these evils
prevailing among the greater portion of mankind, there is no reason to feel
astonished: but we ought at the same time to profit by the instruction of the
Prophet, so that we may not be blinded by prosperity, and despise reproofs, and
flatter ourselves in our sin; and also, that we may not accumulate for ourselves
a store of God&#8217;s wrath, when he deals kindly with us. Let us not then
abuse his forbearance; let us not think that we are innocent before him, because
he does not immediately execute his judgements; but let us rather learn to make
a scrutiny of ourselves, and to shake off our vices, so that we may humble
ourselves under his hand, though he restrains himself from inflicting
punishment. This is the application of the present doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice what the Prophet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not find iniquity in
my labours</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, iniquity shall not
be found in my labours, because this is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or a crime requiring expiation. I wonder that interpreters explain this place so
frigidly; for they say, that there shall not be found in my labours iniquity or
sin. But the Prophet does not set down a copulative, but uses the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher</i>, which is to be taken here exegetically. And the meaning is, that
hypocrites, while they claim to themselves the praise of innocence, for the sake
of dissembling, detest ostensibly every wickedness and crime. &#8220;Iniquity
shall not be found in my labours, for this is wickedness; far be it that I
should be discovered to be a wicked person in my doings; for I am without fraud
in all my dealings.&#8221; But is this the case? By no means; but as they judge
of God&#8217;s favour by prosperous fortune, they think that God would not be so
kind to them unless he regarded them as just and pure. Hence we see how securely
hypocrites mock God, when they begin to despise his teaching and warnings. We
need not then wonder that at this day so much perverseness prevails everywhere
in the world. But let us also use this mode of teaching which the Prophet sets
before us. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In the first clause God reproaches the Israelites for
having forgotten the benefit of his redemption, the memory of which ought ever
to have prevailed and flourished among them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
yet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>am thy God from the land of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;It is strange
that you are so forgetful that your redemption does not come to your mind, which
yet ought to be well known, and be ever, as it were, before your eyes.&#8221;
That was, as we know, a memorable instance of God&#8217;s kindness. But when he
says that he is the God of that people from the land of Egypt, he points out the
end of redemption, as though he said, &#8220;I redeemed thee for this end, that
thou mightest be forever bound to me.&#8221; For we know that when he delivered
that people from their cruel tyranny, he at the same time acquired for himself
an eternal kingdom; he was then sanctified in his elect people. The end of
redemption is then to be observed in the words of the Prophet, &#8220;I
am,&#8221; he says, &#8220;thy God from the land of Egypt; how otherwise
couldest thou have come forth from thy grave?&#8221; For they were like the
dead, when God stretched out his hand to them. From the land of Egypt then I am
thy God, which means this: &#8220;Since thou hast been so wonderfully restored
from death to life by my favour, am not I thy God from that day? Thou owest then
thyself and all thine to me; for I purchased thee for myself as a peculiar
possession. When now thou detest petulantly to reject my Prophets, who speak in
my name, it is surely an ingratitude not to be endured, that thou forgettest thy
redemptions and the end for which I made known to thee my power and
grace.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to the second clause, interpreters vary; some
explain it in this way, that God would not cease to show mercy to the
Israelites, however unworthy they were,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make thee to dwell in thy
tabernacles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and they take tabernacles,
not strictly proper, for houses. Then they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the days of
Moed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, of ancient agreement, or,
according to appointed days; for God had promised to give the land of Canaan to
the posterity of Abraham for their perpetual rest. But this exposition seems not
suitable. Others say, that the Israelites are here reproved, because they
neglected the command of God, who had instituted a festal-day, on which they
were to commemorate yearly their redemption. We indeed know that there was the
annual feast of tabernacles: so they think the meaning of the Prophet to be this
&#8220;I not only once redeemed thee, but I also wished that there should be a
memorial of this favour; and for what purpose have I commanded you to keep a
yearly festival, except that ye might retain in your memory what otherwise might
have been forgotten? But I have effected nothing by this rite, for I am now
rejected, and my prophets possess no authority among you.&#8221; But this sense
also is frigid. Some think that the Prophet here threatens the Israelites, as
though he said, &#8220;God will again drive you out, that you may dwell in tents
as you did formerly in the desert.&#8221; Though I do not reject this opinion,
yet I think there is something more emphatical in the Prophet&#8217;s words,
that is, that God here says in an indirect way, that there was need of a new
redemption, that he might bind the people more to himself; as though he said,
&#8220;I see that you are unmindful of my former redemption; for I see that you
esteem it as nothing, as if it were obsolete; I must then lose all my labour,
except the memory of my ancient favour be renewed: I will therefore make thee to
dwell again in tents. It is necessary to eject thee again from thy heritage, and
to restore thee again, and that in a manner unusual and least expected, that
thou mayest understand that I am thy Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then apprehend what the Prophet meant. After
God had said that he was the God of Israel from the land of Egypt, he then adds,
&#8220;Inasmuch as your former redemption has lost all its influence through
your wicked forgetfulness, I will become again your Redeemer; I will therefore
make thee to abide or dwell in tents as formerly; as your first redemption
avails nothing, I will add a second, that you may at length repent, and know how
much you are indebted to me.&#8221; <i>The days of Moed</i> he takes for their
manner of proceeding in the desert as described by Moses; for they assembled
together for sacrifices from their camps. Hence God does not speak here of the
convention he had made with his people, as if he pointed out some perpetual
compact; but he calls those </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
days of Moed</i></font><font face="Palatino"> on which the Israelites were
assembled, when they were located in their camps according to the account given
by Moses. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet amplifies the sin of the people in having
always obstinately opposed God, so that they were without any pretext of
ignorance: for men, we know, evade God&#8217;s dreadful judgement as long as
they can plead either ignorance or thoughtlessness. The Prophet denies that the
people had fallen through want of information, for they had been often, nay,
continually warned by the Prophets. It then appears that this people were
become, as it were, wilfully rebellious against God; for they had ever despised
the Prophets, not once or twice, but when the Lord sent them in succession:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have spoken,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon my
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, by my Prophets; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol,</i> is variously taken: &#8216;I have spoken upon my Prophets,&#8217;
that is, I have deposited with them the doctrine which ought to have restored
you to the right way; and not only so, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have multiplied
visions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> it has not been in one way that
I have tried to gather you, but I have accumulated many visions: and then he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the hand of Prophets I
have placed similitudes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, I have
endeavoured in every way possible to restore you to a sound mind; for God speaks
after the manner of men. He might indeed, if he chose, effect this by the secret
movement of his Spirit; but it is enough to take away every excuse from men to
allege the fact, that they obey not the word, and offer not themselves to God as
submissive and teachable, when he by his Prophets cohorts them to repentance. It
is then an enhancing of sin worthy of being noticed, when God remonstrates, and
says, that he had uselessly spent all his efforts to collect the dispersed
Israel, though he had constantly employed the labours of his
Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this reproach may be also applied to us at this
day; yea, whatever the Prophet has hitherto said may justly be turned against
us. For we see how the world hardens itself against all warnings; and we see
also how long the Lord suspends his judgements, and tolerates men who scoff at
his forbearance. Then the same depravity rages now in the world, which the
Prophet describes in this place. Besides, God has not only redeemed us from
Egypt, but from the lowest hell, and we know that we have been redeemed by
Christ for this end, &#8212; that we may be wholly devoted to God; for Christ
died and rose again for this purpose, &#8212; that he might be the Lord of the
living and of the dead. But we see how much is the perverseness of men, and how
with impunity they grow wanton against God. Who among us remember that they are
no longer their own, because they have been purchased by the blood of Christ?
Few think of this. And not only this only true and perpetual redemption ought to
be kept in mind by us; for the Lord again redeemed us when we were sunk in the
gulf of Popery; and daily also does he renew the same kindness towards us; and
yet we are so forgetful, that often the grace of God is not remembered by us. We
now see how necessary is this doctrine even for our age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, God, as I have already said, ceases not
daily to stimulate and urge us; he multiplies prophecies and similitudes; that
is, he in various ways accommodates himself to us; for by similitudes he means
all forms of teaching. And doubtless we see that God in a manner transforms
himself in his word, for he speaks not according to his own majesty, but as he
sees to be suitable to our capacities and weakness; for the Scriptures set
before us various representations, which show to us the face of God. Since God
then thus accommodates himself to our rudeness, how great is our ingratitude,
when no fruit follows? Let us then remember that the Prophet so reproved the men
of his age, that he also speaks to us at this day. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">It is an ironical question, when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is there iniquity in
Gilead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>and he laughs to scorn their
madness who delighted themselves in vices so gross, when their worship was
wholly spurious and degenerated. When they knew that they were perfidious
towards God, and followed a worship alienated from his law, they yet were so
perverse, that they proudly refused all admonitions. Since then they were
blinded in their vices, the Prophet asks them ironically, Is there iniquity in
Gilead? They are as yet doubtful, forsooth, whether they are guilty before God,
whether they bear any blame.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are
vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;How much soever
they may seek specious pretences for themselves, and deny that they are
conscious of doing wrong, and also introduce many reasons for doubt, that they
may not be forced to own their sin, they yet, he says, are guilty of falsehood;
all their glosses contain nothing solid, but they are mere disguises, which
avail nothing before God.&#8221; We now then apprehend the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is no doubt but that he also condemns here
their perverted worship, by which the Israelites at the same time thought that
they rendered the best service to God. But obedience, we know, is better than
all sacrifices. The Prophet then inveighs here against all fictitious modes of
worship, devised without God against the authority of God&#8217;s law. But at
the same time, as we have just hinted, he indirectly exposes their
thoughtlessness for imagining themselves excusable, provided they set up their
own good intention, as it is commonly done, and say, that they built altars with
no other design than to make known everywhere the name of God, to preserve among
themselves some tokens of religion. Since, then, they thus raised up a cloud of
smoke to cover their impiety, the Prophet says, &#8220;They indeed still
inquire, as of a doubtful thing, whether there is iniquity in Gilead; let them
inquire and dispute; surely,&#8221; he says, &#8220;they are vain;&#8221;
literally, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>surely they have been
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> but he means that they
foolishly brought forward those frivolous excuses, by which they tried to escape
the crime and its punishment. How was it that they were vain? Because God values
his own law more than all the glosses of men, and he will have all men to obey,
without dispute, his own word: but when they thus licentiously depart from his
commandments, it is what he cannot endure. They are then false and deceive
themselves, who think that their own inventions are of any value before God. He
then lays down their crimes</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
Gilgal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have they sacrificed
oxen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Jerome translates, &#8220;They
sacrifice to oxen,&#8221; and thinks that the Israelites are reprehended here
for sacrificing to the calves: but this seems too remote from the words of the
Prophet. The Prophet then mentions their sin &#8212; that they sacrificed oxen
and multiplied altars. And yet it seemed to be a diligence worthy of praise,
that they increased many altars, that they worshipped God everywhere, that they
spared neither expense nor labour, that they were not content with few
sacrifices, but added a great number; &#8212; all this seemed to deserve no
common praise: but the Lord, as it has been already said, valued not these
corrupt practices; for he would have himself to be alone worshipped by his
people, and would have their piety to be attested by this single evidence
&#8212; their obedience to his word. When we then turn aside from God&#8217;s
word, nay, when we with loose reins abandon ourselves to new inventions, though
we may plausibly profess that our object is to worship God, yet all this is a
vain and fallacious pretence, as the Prophet here declares.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jerome is mistaken in thinking that Gilgal was a town
in the tribe of Judah; and the supposition cannot suit this place: for Judah, we
know, was then free from those gross pollutions; Judah was not as yet polluted
with the defilements which the Prophet here condemns in the kingdom of Israel.
It is then certain, that Gilgal was a town of Israel; and we know that a
celebrated temple and altar were there: hence he especially points out this
place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their altars are as heaps on the
furrows of the field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There was then we
know, only one legitimate altar; and God would not have sacrifices offered to
him, except in one place. Hence the more active the Israelites were in
multiplying altars, the more they provoked the vengeance of God: how much soever
it was their purpose to worship God, yet God spurned that foolish affectedness.
We then see why the Prophet here compares the altars then erected in the kingdom
of Israel to heaps of stones; as though he said &#8220;As one gathers stones
into a heap, when the land is stony, that he may drive his plough more easily,
so every one forms an altar for himself, as though he were raising up a hillock
in his own field: thus it comes, that they perversely corrupt the pure and
lawful worship which I have appointed.&#8221; We now then understand the meaning
of the Prophet to be, that superstitious men gain nothing, when they boldly and
openly boast that they worship God; for whatever disguise they may invent for
themselves and others, the Lord yet abominates every thing that is contrary to
his word: and our mode Of worshipping God is alone true and lawful, when we only
follow what he prescribes, and allow to ourselves nothing but what is according
to his command and appointment. This is the meaning. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now employs another kind of reproof,
&#8212; that the Israelites did not consider from what source they had
proceeded, and were forgetful of their origin. And the Prophet designedly
touches on this point; for we know how boldly and proudly the people boasted of
their own eminence. For as a heathen gloried that he was an Athenian, so also
the Jews think that all we are brute animals, and imagine that they have a
different origin from the rest of mankind, because they are the posterity of
Abraham. Since then they were blinded by such a pride as this God meant to
undeceive them, as he does here: &#8220;Jacob your father, who was he? What was
his condition? What was his nobility? What was his power? What was his dignity
and eminence according to the flesh? Yea, truly, he was a fugitive from his own
country: had he always lived at home, his father was but a sojourner; but he was
constrained to flee into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was
indeed with his uncle; but he was treated no better than if he had been some
worthless slave: He </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>served for a
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And how did he serve? He was a
keeper of sheep. Go then now and boast of your dignity, as if ye were nobler
than others, as if your condition were better than that of the common sort of
people.&#8221; God then brings against them the condition of their father, in
whose name they gloried, but who was an abject person and a fugitive, who was
like a worthless slave, who was a keeper of sheep; who, in short, had nothing
which could be deemed reputable among men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And God, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought you up by a Prophet from
Egypt, and by a Prophet you have been
preserved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This was, as it were, their
second nativity. Some think that the comparison is between their first origin
and their deliverance; as though Hosea had said, &#8220;Though you were born of
a very poor and ignoble man, yet God has favoured you with singular privilege;
for he gave Moses to be the minister of your liberation.&#8221; But in my
judgement the Prophet speaks in a more simple way; for, first, he shows what was
the first origin of the people, that they were from Jacob; and then he shows
what was their second origin; for God had again begotten them when he brought
them out of Egypt. And they were there, as it is well known, very miserable, and
they did not come out by their own velour, they did not attain for themselves
their liberty; but Moses alone extended his hand to them, having been sent for
this end by God. Since the case was so, it was strange that they now provoked
God, as he says in the last verse, by their altars.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it very frequently occurs in the Prophets, that
God reminds the Israelites whence or from what source they had arisen,
&#8220;Look to your origin, to the stone from which ye were cut off; for Abraham
was alone and childless, and his wife also was barren;&#8221; and yet God
multiplied their race,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
51:2.) This was said, because the Israelites did not look to God, but in their
adversity despaired, when no way appeared by which they could be restored; but
in their prosperity they became proud, and regarded as nothing the favour of
God. We then see what the Prophet had in view. The Lord says, &#8220;Acknowledge
what you owe to me; for I have chosen Jacob your father, and have not chosen him
because he was eminent for his great dignity in the world; for he was a fugitive
and a keeper of sheep, and served for his wife. I afterwards redeemed you from
the land of Egypt; and in that coming forth there was nothing that you did;
there is no reason why you should boast that liberation was obtained by your
velour; for Moses alone was my servant in that deliverance. I did then beget you
the second time, when I redeemed you. How great is your ingratitude, when you do
not own and worship me as your Redeemer?&#8221; We now then see that the Prophet
thus treated the people of Israel, that it might in every way appear that they
were unworthy of so many and so great benefits bestowed on them by God; for they
had perverted all the works of God, and so perverted them, that they did not
think that any thing, belonged to him, and they returned no thanks to God; nay,
they extolled themselves, as if God had never conferred on them any
kindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I will not dwell on the history of Jacob, for it

after Jacob. The name, Israel, was noble and memorable; yea, it was given by God
to the holy patriarch: but at the same time Jacob did not in himself or in his

and he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>served for a

present condition fascinates you, and that ye consider not that you were once
redeemed by the Lord for this end, that ye might be wholly devoted to him
forever?&#8221; Now he adds &#8212; (I will also run over this verse, for there
will be no lecture to-morrow, nor the day after) &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters agree not in their view of this verse.
Some say that trembling was excited in Israel when Ephraim, that is, Jeroboam,
who was born of that tribe, exhorted the people to worship the calves. By the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ttr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>retat</i>, &#8220;trembling,&#8221; they understand, that the people were so
astonished, that they without thought immediately obeyed the will, or rather the
humour, of their impious king. And if this sense be approved, the word,
trembling, may be in another way explained, even in this, &#8212; that the
people did not immediately embrace that perverted worship, but dreaded, as is
wont to be the case with regard to new things, and which seem to have nothing
reasonable in their favour. But these expounders wholly depart, in my judgement,
from the intention of the Prophet; for, on the contrary, he sets forth here the
twofold state of the kingdom of Israel, that it might hence be manifest that the
ten tribes had been through their own fault rejected by the Lord, and had thus
fallen from that dignity unto which the Lord had raised them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Ephraim spake formerly, his
voice dreaded,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he raised himself in
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, among the whole race of
Abraham. But now </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or is fallen,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after he has begun to sin in
Baal.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Then, in the first sentence, the Prophet
records the honours with which God had favoured that tribe. Ephraim, we know,
was the younger of the sons of Joseph. Manasseh ought not only to have had the
pre-eminence, but also to have reigned alone in that family; for the people were
divided into twelve tribes. But God intended to raise up two chiefs in the house
of Joseph, and preferred the younger to the first-begotten. Hence Ephraim, who
had increased in number and power, and had at length obtained the royal dignity,
ought to have acknowledged the singular favour of God. And by way of reproach,
the Prophet here says, that all trembled at the single voice of Ephraim; that
is, when he became endued with authority, and then, that he was exalted in
Israel. He ought to have been deemed of no account, he ought to have been
inferior to his brother, who was the first-born, and yet he excelled all the
tribes. Since, then, God had conferred so much honour on the tribe of Ephraim,
the more grievous was his fault, that he afterwards had fallen away unto idols;
yea, that he began his reign with superstition, when God was pleased to choose
and anoint Jeroboam king. And surely that he, when raised beyond all hope to the
throne by the hand of God, should, instead of testifying his gratitude,
immediately corrupt the whole worship of God, this was extremely
inconsistent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet says, in the second place, that
they<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>died</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>from the time they had thus fallen away from true and lawful worship, in
order that they might understand that they received the just reward of their
impiety when God&#8217;s hand was opposed to them, when they were oppressed by
adversity. We now perceive the obvious meaning, of the Prophet to be, that the
Israelites formerly flourished, especially the tribe of Ephraim, from whom
Jeroboam arose, so that, by their voice alone, they subdued all their
neighbours, and that beyond the expectation of men, they suddenly emerged and
erected a new kingdom among the children of Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that after
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had sinned by Baal, they
became dead:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for God deprived the tribe of
Ephraim of the power with which he had before adorned him, so that they were but
little short of being destroyed. For though his kingdom had not wholly fallen,
it had yet come to such an extremity that the Prophet might justly say that
they, who were so far removed from their former state, were dead. But when he
says that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sinned by
Baal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he does not mean that this was the
beginning of their idolatry; for Jeroboam at first made the calves, and it was
his successor who built Baal, and borrowed that superstition, as it is supposed,
from the neighbouring Sidonians. But God records here what is more grievous, and
less excusable, &#8212; that the Israelites polluted themselves with the filth
of the Gentiles, so that they differed nothing from the profane and unbelieving,
who had no acquaintance with sound doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are moreover taught in this place, that when kings
are endued with any authority, when they are strong in power, all this comes
from God; for unless God strikes terror into men, no one would receive the yoke
of another, at least all would desire equality, or one would raise himself above
others. It is then certain, that when any one excels among many in power, this
is done through the secret purpose of God, who constrains to order the common
people, and causes them not to deny obedience to the command of one man. This is
what Hosea now teaches, when he upbraids the tribe of Ephraim with respect to
this terror; for if Ephraim had been formidable through his own power, there
would have been no room for the Prophet&#8217;s reproof: but as this was the
peculiar gift of God, the Prophet justly says, that the tribe of Ephraim were in
great honour until they had fallen into superstition. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet amplifies the wickedness of
the people, and says, that they had not only in one day cast aside the pure
worship of God, and entangled themselves in superstitions; but that they had
been obstinate in their own depravity.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
added</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to their sin, and have made a
molten thing of their silver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When
Israel, as we have said, departed from the worship of God, they made calves, and
made them under a specious appearance; but when many superstitions were added,
one after another, there was, as it were, an accumulation of madness, as if the
Israelites designedly wished to subvert the law of God, and to show that they
cared nothing for the only true God, by whom they had been redeemed. This is the
reason why the Prophet says that they made progress in wickedness, and observed
no moderation in sinning, and this is what usually happens, unless God draws men
back. As soon as they fall away, they rush headlong into evil; for they take a
greater liberty in sinning, after they have turned their back on
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence this reproof of the Prophet ought to be
noticed, for he inveighs against the obstinate wickedness of Israel; and says,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
made</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for themselves
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of their silver a molten
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As we have seen above, they
abused the gifts of God by devoting to superstition what the Lord had destined
for their use. The end for which God has bestowed silver, we know, is, that men
may carry on commerce with one another, and apply it also to other useful
purposes. But when they make to themselves gods of silver, there is an
astonishing stupidity in their ingratitude, for they pervert the order of
nature, and forget that silver is given for another end, and that is as we have
said for their use. The Prophet at the same time intimates, that the Israelites
were less excusable, inasmuch as when they were enriched, they became proud of
their wealth. Satiety, we know, is the cause of wantonness, as, it will be
shortly stated again.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what the Prophet adds ought to be especially
observed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to their own
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he severely reproves
the Israelites, because they had not subordinated all their thoughts to God,
but, on the contrary, followed what pleased themselves. It was then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to their own
invention</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The word which the Prophet
uses is not unsuitable, though &#8220;understanding,&#8221; the word which the
Prophet adopts, is among the Hebrews taken in a good sense. But what is treated
of here is the worship of God, with respect to which all the prudence, all the
reason, all the wisdom of men, and, in short, all their senses, ought to be
suspended: for if, in this case, they of themselves adopt any thing, be it ever
so little, they inevitably vitiate the worship of God. How so? Because
obedience, we know, is better than all sacrifices. This then is the rule, as to
the right worship of God, &#8212; that men must become foolish, that they must
not allow themselves to be wise, but that they are only to give ear to God, and
to follow what he commands. But when men&#8217;s presumption intrudes, so that
they devise a new mode of worship, they then depart from the true God, and
worship mere idols. The Prophet then by the word, <i>understanding,</i> condemns
here whatever pleases the judgement and reason of men; as though he said,
&#8220;The true rule of religion, as to the worship of God, is, that nothing
human is to be mingled, that no one is to bring forward what is his own, or what
seems good to himself.&#8221; In short, the understanding of men is here opposed
to the command of God; as though the Prophet said, &#8220;One great difference
between the true worship of God and all fictitious and degenerated modes of
worship, is obedience to the word of God; if we be wise according to our own
judgement, all we do is corrupt.&#8221; How so? Because whatever men devise of
themselves is a pollution of divine worship. Hence Paul, in Colossians 2,
refutes all the fancies of men by this one argument, &#8220;They are,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;the traditions of men, though they may have the show of
wisdom.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend what the Prophet meant, and why he
added the word &#8220;understanding;&#8221; it was, that the Israelites might
learn, that all the worship which was in use among them, was perverted and
vicious; for it was not founded on the command of God, but flowed from a
different source, even the understanding of men. It then follows, as we have
said before, that in religion nothing is to be attempted by us, but we are to
follow this one law in worshipping God &#8212; simply to obey his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Idols, the work of artificers
altogether</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, in the second
place, derides the grossness which had fascinated the minds of the people, as
they worshipped in the place of God the works of men. For it is usual with all
the Prophets, in order to render the stupidity of men as it were palpable, to
show that it is wholly unreasonable to worship idols; for a material cannot with
any propriety be worshipped. When there is before us a great mass or a great
heap of gold or silver, no one imagines that there is in it any divinity: when
one passes through a wood, he transfers not to trees the glory due to God; and
the same may be said of stones. But when the hand of the artificer is applied,
the plate of gold begins to be a god; so also the trunk of a tree seems to put
on the glory of God, when it receives a certain form from the workman; and the
same is the case with other things. Now it is extremely absurd to suppose that
an artificer, as soon as he has hewn some wood, or as soon as he has melted gold
or silver, can make a god, and convey divinity to a dead thing; and yet it is
well known that this is thought everywhere to be the case. Superstitious men
allege in excuse, that this does not proceed from the hand of the artificer, but
that as they wish for some sign of God&#8217;s presence, and as they cannot
otherwise set forth what God is, God is in that form. But this still remains
true, that workmen by their skill make gods of lifeless things, to which no
honour can belong. Since it is so, the Prophet now justly says, that what the
people of Israel worshipped was the work of artifices; and he said this, that
they might know that they became shamefully foolish, when they left the true
God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and prostrated themselves before idols
made by hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they say to one another while
they sacrifice men, Let them kiss the calves</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Though this place is in various ways explained, I am yet content with the
obvious meaning of the Prophet. He again derides them for exhorting one another
to worship the calf: For by kissing he means by a figure a profession of worship
or adoration, as it is evident from other parts of Scripture. It is said in 1
Kings 19, I have preserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bent the
knee before Baal, nor kissed him. To kiss Baal then was a sign of reverence. And
this practice, we see, has been retained by the superstitious, as the case is at
this day with the Papists, who observe this special custom of kissing their
idols. But what does the Prophet now say?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They encourage one
another</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the worship of the
calves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and in the meantime &#8220;they
sacrifice men&#8221;. The Prophet doubtless condemns here that abominable and
savage custom of parents sacrificing their children to Moloch. It was utterly
repugnant to the feeling of nature for parents to immolate their own children.
For though this was once commanded to Abraham, we yet know that the design was,
that God intended by this proof to try the obedience of his servant: but Abraham
was not at last suffered to do what he purposed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then immolated men. If it was right to sacrifice
men, surely such a service ought to have been rendered at least to the only true
God. If it was lawful to sacrifice man for the sake of man, it was certainly
ridiculous to do so to conciliate the calf; and it was especially strange, when
parents hesitated not to appease dead statues by the blood of their children.
This absurdity then the Prophet now points out as with the finger, that he might
try to make the Israelites ashamed of their base conduct. &#8220;See,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;how brutish ye are; for ye immolate to the calves and kiss them,
and more still, ye sacrifice men. Is there so much worthiness in the calf, that
man, who far excels it, must be killed before it? Is not this wholly
inconsistent with every thing like reason?&#8221; We now understand what the
Prophet meant. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They say then one
to another, while they immolate men, Let them kiss the
calves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we learn from this and similar places, that we
ought to notice those absurdities in which wretched men involve themselves, when
they are lost in their own devices, after having left the word of God: for this
word is to be to us as a bridle to keep us from going astray with them in their
monstrous devices; for when we observe these delirious things which even nature
itself abhors, it is evident that God thereby restrains and preserves us as it
were by his outstretched hand. With this design the Prophet now shows how stupid
the Israelites were, and how prodigious was their frenzy when they kissed the
calves with great reverence, and also sacrificed men. So at this day with
respect to those under the Papacy, we ought not only to adopt this argument,
that they departed from the true God when they sought for themselves new and
strange modes of worship, without the warrant of his word, but we ought also to
bear in mind that their puerilities are to be ascribed to the same cause. And we
see how God has given them up to a reprobate mind, so that they throw aside no
kinds of absurdities. And this consideration, as I have said, will serve to
awaken those who are as yet healable, when they understand that they have been
infatuated; having been in this manner admonished, they may return to the right
way. And that we ourselves may give thanks to God, and detest more and more that
filth in which we were for a time involved, and remember that there is nothing
more to be dreaded than that the Lord should allow us loose reins, the very
example of his vengeance as to all idolaters is made known to us; for as soon as
they departed from the pure worship of God, they gave themselves up, as we have
stated, to the most shameful stupidity. Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet employs here four similitudes to show the
condition of Israel. How much soever they flourished for a time, and might be
deemed happy, their state would yet be fading and evanescent.

be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the morning

they shall be, he says, &#8220;as the smoke&#8221;; for <i>as the smoke</i>

themselves, would not continue in a permanent condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence conclude, that the Israelites were not so
much like the dead, but that yet they had some power remaining in them: for God
would have otherwise threatened to no purpose, that they should be made like a
cloud, and the dew, and the chaff, and the smoke: but they had been already in a
great measure consumed. And God denounces on them here utter destruction, that
they might not think that they had already suffered the last punishment, and
that they might not suppose that they could gather new strength: for proud men
entertain vain confidence, through which they remove to a distance the judgement
of God. Lest, then, they should delude themselves with such allurements, the
Prophet here declares that their condition would be fading, such as would soon
come to ruin. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now repeats the sentence which we have
noticed in the last chapter for the sake of amplifying the sin of the people.
For had they never known sound doctrine, had they never been brought up in the
law, there would have been some colour for alleviating their fault; because they
might have excused themselves by saying, that as they had never known true
religion, they had gone astray according to the common practice of men; but as
they had from infancy been taught sound doctrine, as God had brought them up as
it were in his own bosom, as they had learned from their first years what it was
to worship God purely, when they thus retook themselves to the superstitions of
the heathens, what could there be for an excuse for them? We then see the
bearing of the complaint, when God says, that he had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of Israel from the land
of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I am then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">
your God. By calling himself Jehovah, he glances at all their fictitious gods;
as though he said &#8220;I am doubtless justly, and in mine own rights your God;
for I am of myself &#8212; I am the Creator of the world, no one can take away
my power: but whence have these their divinity, except from the madness of
men?&#8221; He says further, <i>I am thy God,</i> O Israel; that is, &#8220;I
have manifested myself to thee from the land of Egypt, from thy very nativity.
When I redeemed thee from Egypt I brought thee out as it were from the womb to
the light of life; for Egypt was to thee like the grave. Thou didst then begin
to live, and to be some sort of people, when I stretched forth my hand to
thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And now also ought to be noticed what I have said
before, that the people were redeemed on this condition, that they should devote
themselves wholly to God. As we are at this day Christ&#8217;s, and no one of us
ought to live according to his own will, for Christ died and rose again for this
end, that he might be the Lord of the living and of the dead: so also then, the
Israelites had been redeemed by God, that they might offer themselves wholly to
Him. And since God ruled by this right over the people of Israel, how shameful
and inexcusable was their defections when the people wilfully abandoned
themselves to the superstitions of the Gentiles?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>besides me thou oughtest not to
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> These words the Prophet had not
before used. This sentence, then, is fuller, for it more clearly explains the
import of what he had said, that God had purchased Israel for himself by
bringing them out of Egypt, and that is, that Israel ought to have been content
with this one Redeemer, and not to seek for themselves other gods.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>besides me thou shalt not
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For if this one God was sufficient
for redeeming his people, what do the people now mean, when they wander, and
seek aid here and there? For they ought to render to God the life received from
him, which they now enjoy, and ought to acknowledge to be sufficiently safe
under his protection. We now then see why this was added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not know a God besides
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A reason, confirmatory of this, follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For no
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is a Saviour except
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau,</i> ought to be regarded here as a causative,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For no
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc., or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely no one is a Saviour except
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And this is a remarkable passage;
for we learn that the worship of God does not consist in words, but in faith,
and hope, and prayer. The Papists of the present day think that they do not
profane the worship of God, though they fly to statues, though they pray to dead
men, though they look here and there for the accomplishment of their hopes. How
so? Because they ever retain the only true God, that is, they do not ascribe the
name of God to Christopher or to Antony. The Papists think themselves free from
all blame, since God retains his own name. But we see how differently the matter
is regarded by the Lord. &#8220;I am,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the only true
God.&#8221; How is this? &#8220;Because I am the only Saviour: feign not to
thyself another God, for thou shalt find none that will save thee.&#8221; Then
God puts an especial value on the honour that is due to him from hope and
prayer; that is, when our soul recumbs on him alone, and when we seek and hope
for salvation from no other but from him. We see then how useful is the doctrine
contained in this passage, in which the Prophet clearly shows, that the
Israelites acted absurdly and shamefully when they formed another god for
themselves, for no Saviour, except the one true God, can be
found.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thee I knew in the desert, in the
land of droughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God here confirms the
truth that the Israelites had acted very absurdly in having turned their minds
to other gods, for he himself had known them. The knowledge here mentioned is
twofold, that of men, and that of God. God declares that he had a care for the
people when they were in the desert; and he designates his paternal solicitude
by the term, knowledge: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I knew
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;I then chose thee
a people for myself, and familiarly manifested myself to thee, as if thou were a
near friend to me. But then it was necessary that I should have been also known
by thee.&#8221; This is the knowledge of men. Now when men are known by God, why
do they not apply all their faculties, so that they may remain fixed on him? For
when they divert them to other objects, they extinguish, as much as they can,
this benefit of God. So also Paul speaks to the Galatians,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;After ye have
known God, or rather after ye are known by him,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
4:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first clause, he shows that they had done very
wickedly in retaking themselves to various devices after the light of the gospel
had been offered to them: but he increases their sin by the next clause, when he
says, &#8216;Rather after ye are known by him;&#8217; as though he said,
&#8220;God has anticipated you by his gratuitous goodness. Since, then, God has
thus first known you, and first favoured you with his grace, how great and how
shameful is now your ingratitude in not seeking to know him in return?&#8221; We
now then see why the Prophet added that the Israelites had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>known by God in the desert, in
the land of droughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And there is an express mention made of <i>the
desert:</i> for it was then necessary for the people to be sustained
miraculously by the Lord; for except God had rained manna from heaven, and had
also given water for drink, the people must have miserably perished. Since, then
God had thus supported the people contrary to the usual course of nature, so
that without his paternal care there could have been no hope of life, the
Prophet now rightly adds,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the desert, in the land of
droughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, in that dry solitude,
where not a grain of corn grew, so that the people could not live except God
had, as it were, with his own hand, given them meat, and put it in their mouth.
We now see that the extreme impiety of the people is here manifestly proved; for
having been taught in God&#8217;s law, and been encouraged by so many benefits,
they yet went astray after profane superstitions. And the Prophet, at the same
time, adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here that the people were in every
way intractable. He has indeed handled this argument in other places; but the
repetition is not superfluous. After he had said that the people were ungrateful
in not continuing in the service of their Redeemer, by whom they had been so
kindly and bountifully treated in the desert, where they must have perished
through famine and want, had not the Lord in an unwonted manner brought them
help in their great necessity, he now adds, &#8220;The Lord would have also
allured you by other means, had you not been of a wholly wild and barbarous
disposition: but it is hence manifest, that you are utterly disobedient; for
after you have been brought out of the desert, you came to rich pastures.&#8221;
For the land of Israel is here compared to rich and fertile pastures; as though
he said, &#8220;God has placed you in an inheritance where you might eat to the
full, as when a shepherd leads his sheep to a spot especially fertile.&#8221;
What did take place? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To their

memory of their redemption, after the Lord had fed them when hungry in the
desert, and since in their fulness they rejected God, and shook off his yoke,
and, like ferocious horses, kicked against him, it became evident that their
nature was so unnameable, that they could by no means be reduced to obedience or

miserable fear, and hast also favoured us with the Spirit of adoption and of
hope, &#8212; O grant, that we, being mindful of these benefits, may ever submit
ourselves to thee, and desire only to raise our voice for this end, that the
whole world may submit itself to thee, and that those who seem now to rage
against thee may at length be brought, as well as we, to render thee obedience,
so that thy Son Christ may be the Lord of all, to the end that thou alone mayest
be exalted, and that we may be made subject to thee, and be at length raised up

produced ferocity in the people of Israel.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to their pastures, he
says, they were filled; they were satiated, and their heart was

that the Sodomites, while abounding in all blessings, were full of cruelty, so
that they contemptuously despised the poor. But the prophet condemns here a
worse thing in the people of Israel, for their heart was inflated with pride
against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And there is, in the last place, a mention made of
their<i> forgetfulness</i> of God. It is impossible, when men are blinded by a
wilful self-confidence, but that they will cast aside every fear of God and
every concern for religion. And this passage teaches us, that we ought to use
our abundance temperately and frugally, and that we ought, in the first place,
beware lest the bounty of God should introduce a forgetfulness of him. For it is
an extreme perversion, that when the more largely God pours his gifts upon us,
our hearts should be more narrow, and that his benefits should be like veils to
cover our eyes. We ought then to labour, that the benefits of God may, on the
contrary, renew the recollection of him in our minds: and then, as I have said,
let moderation and frugality be added. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet denounces again on the Israelites the
vengeance of God; and as they were become torpid through their own flatteries,
as we have already often observed, he here describes the terrible judgement of
God, that he might strike fear into the obstinate, so that they might at length
perceive that they had to do with God, and begin to dread his power. And this,
as we have said, was very necessary, when the Prophets intended to awaken
hypocrites; for self- confidence so inebriates them, that they hesitate not to
despise all the threatenings of God: and this is the reason why he adopts these
three similitudes. He first compares God to a lion, then to a leopard, and then
to a bear. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like a lion, like a leopard,
and then like a bear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God, we know, is
in his own nature merciful and kind; when he says that he will be like a lion,
he puts on as it were another character; but this is done on account of
men&#8217;s wickedness, as it is said in Psalm 18,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;With the gentle,
thou wilt be gentle; with the
perverse,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">thou wilt be
perverse.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For, though God speaks sharply and severely through
his Prophet, he yet expresses what we ought to remember, and that is, that he
thus speaks, because we do not allow him to treat us according to his own
nature, that is, gently and kindly; and that when he sees us to be obstinate and
unnameable, he then contends with us (so to speak) with the like contumacy; not
that perversity properly belongs to God, but he borrows this similitude from
men, and for this reason, that men may not continue to flatter themselves when
he is displeased with them. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> therefore <i>be</i> like a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lion, like a leopard in the

<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word <i>Assur,</i> interpreters take it in
various ways. Some render it, Assyria, though it is here written with
<i>Kamets:</i> but the Hebrews consider it as an appellative, not the name of a
place or country. Some again render it thus, &#8220;I will look on them,&#8221;
and derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shur</i>, and take </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a
</font><font face="Palatino">aleph, as designative of the future tense. Others
derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher,</i> and will have it to be in the conjugation <i>Pual:</i> and here
they differ again among themselves. Some render it, &#8220;I will lay in wait
for them:&#8221; and others think it to be <i>Shoar,</i> &#8220;I will be a
layer in wait like a leopard.&#8221; But this variety, with regard to the
meaning of the passage, is of but little moment; for we see the drift of the
Prophet&#8217;s object. He intends here to take away from hypocrites their vain
confidence, and to terrify them with the apprehension of God&#8217;s vengeance
which was impending. He therefore says that though God had hitherto spared them,
nay, had in a manner kindly cherished them, yet since they continued to provoke
his wrath, their condition would soon be very different; for he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would come against
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"> like a lion; that is, he would leap on
them with the greatest fury; he would also be like a leopard: and a leopard, we
know, is a very cruel beast: and, lastly, he compares him to a bereaved
she-bear, or, a bereaved bear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he afterwards adds, <i>I will rend,</i> or will
tear, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

the enclosure of the heart to be their obstinate hardness, seem to refine too
much on the words of the Prophet. We know, indeed, that the Prophets sometimes
use this mode of speaking; for they call that a hard heart, or a heart covered
with fatness, which is not pliant, and does not willingly receive sound
doctrine. But the Prophet rather alludes to the savageness of the bear, when he
says, I will rend or tear in pieces the membrane of the heart, and will devour
you as a lion. For it is the most cruel kind of death, when the lion with his
claws and teeth aims at the heart itself and tears the bowels of man. The
Prophet therefore intended to set forth this most cruel kind of death. &#8220;I
will therefore,&#8221; he says, &#8220;tear asunder the pericardium, or the
enclosure of the heart.&#8221; I do not at the same time say, that the Prophet
does not allude to the hardness of the people, while he retains his own
similitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the beast of the field shall rend
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He speaks now without a
similitude; for God means that all the wild beasts would be his ministers to
execute his judgement. &#8220;I will then send all the beasts of the field to
rend and tear them, so that nothing among them shall remain safe.&#8221; We now
see the purport of this passage, and to what use it ought to be applied. If we
are by nature so slothful, yea, and careless, and when God does not stir us up,
we indulge our own delusions, we ought to notice those figurative
representations which tend to shake off from us our tardiness and show to us how
dreadful the judgement of God is. For the same purpose are those metaphors
respecting the eternal fire and the worm that never dies. For Gods seeing the
feelings of men to be so torpid has in Scripture applied those things which may
correct their sluggishness. Whenever then God puts on a character not his own,
let us know that it is through our fault; for we suffer him not to deal with us
according to his own nature, inasmuch as we are intractable. Let us go on

<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, God upbraids the Israelites for
having in their perverseness rejected whatever was offered for their safety: but
he proceeds farther and says, that they were past hope, and that there was a
hidden cause which prevented God from helping them, and bringing them aid when
they laboured under extreme necessity.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He has destroyed thee,
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says. Some consider the word,
calf, to be understood, &#8220;The calf has destroyed thee:&#8221; but this is
strained. Others think that there is a change of person: and I am inclined to
adopt this opinion, as this mode of speaking we know, is very common:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Destroyed thee has
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> thou art the cause of thine own
destruction, or, &#8220;Israel has destroyed himself.&#8221; Though then there
is here a verb of the third person, and there is afterwards added an affixed
pronoun at the second person, we may yet thus render the passage, &#8220;Israel
has destroyed himself.&#8221; At the same time, when I weigh more fully every
particular, this passage, I think, would be better and more fitly explained by
being taken indefinitely: &#8220;Something has destroyed thee, Israel:&#8221; as
though he said, &#8220;Inquire now who has destroyed thee.&#8221; God then does
not here name Israel as the author, nor does he point out any as the author of
their ruin; but yet he shows that Israel was lost, and that the cause of their
destruction was to be sought in some one else, and not in him. This is the
meaning. Then it is<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Something has destroyed thee,
Israel; for in me was thy help</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God
shows and proves that Israel, who had been hitherto preserved, is now destroyed
through their own fault; for God had once adopted the people, and for this end,
that he might continue to show his favour towards them. If then the wickedness
and ingratitude of the people had not hindered, God would have been doubtless
always like himself, and his goodness towards that people would have flowed in a
continuous and uniform stream.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what he means in the second clause, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In me was thine
help</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> by which he seems to say,
&#8220;How comes it, and what is the reason, that I do not now help thee
according to my usual manner? Thou hast indeed found me hitherto to be thy
deliverer: though thou hast often struggled with great and grievous dangers, I
was yet never wanting to thee; thou hast ever found from me a prompt assistance.
How comes it now that I have cast thee away, that thou criest in vain, and that
no one brings thee any help? How comes it, that thou art thus forsaken, and
receives no relief whatever from my hand, as thou hast been wont to do? And
doubtless I should never be wanting to thee, if thou wouldest allow me; but thou
closest the door against me, and by thy wickedness spurnest my favour, so that
it cannot come to thee. It then follows, that thou art now destroyed through thy
own fault:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Something</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has destroyed
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He speaks here indefinitely; but
this suspended way of expression is more emphatical when he shows that Israel
was without reason astonished, and had also without reason expostulated with
God. &#8220;There is then no ground for contending with God, as if he had
frustrated thy expectation, and despised thy desires and crying; God indeed is
consistent with himself, for he is not changeable;&#8221; as though he said,
&#8220;Their perdition is from another cause, and they ought to know that there
is some hindrance, why God should not extend his hand to help them, as he has
hitherto usually done.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the mind of the Prophet: he in the
first place records what God had been hitherto to the people; and then he takes
for granted that he does not change, but that he possesses a uniform and
unwearied goodness. But since he had hitherto helped his people, he concludes,
that Israel was destroyed through some other cause, inasmuch as God brought him
no aid; for unless Israel had intercepted God&#8217;s goodness, it would have
certainly flowed as usual. It then appears that its course was impeded by the
wickedness of the people; for they put as it were an obstacle in its
way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage teaches us, that men in vain clamour
against God in their miseries: for he would be always ready to help them, were
they not to spurn the favour offered to them. Whenever then God does not help us
in our necessity, and suffers us to languish, and as it were to pine away in our
afflictions, it is doubtless so, because we are not disposed to receive his
favour, but, on the contrary, we obstruct its way; as it is said by
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Shortened is not the Lord&#8217;s
hand, that it cannot save, nor is my ear heavy, that it does not hear. Your
sins, he says, have set up a mound between you and me,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
59:1, 2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose are the words of the Prophet here
when he says, that we ought to inquire what the cause of our destruction is,
when the Lord does not immediately deliver us: for as he has once given us a
taste of his goodness so he will continue to do the same to the end; for he is
not wearied in his kindness, nor can his bounty be exhausted. The fault then
belongs to us. We hence see how remarkable is this passage, and what useful
instruction it contains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards more fully confirms the same by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy king, where is
he</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>By saying, &#8216;I will be,&#8217;
God retreats what he had before declared, that he would always be the same; for,
as James says</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;No overshadowing
happens to him,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">James
1:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence &#8216;I will be;&#8217; that is, &#8220;Though
the Israelites rail against me, that I do not pursue my usual course of
kindness, it is yet most false; for I remain ever the same, and am always ready
to show kindness to men; for I do not, as I have elsewhere declared, forsake the
works of my hands,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8.) Seeing then that I thus continue my favour towards men, it must be that
the way to my favour is closed up by their wickedness. Let them therefore
examine themselves, when they cry and I answer not. When in their evils they in
a manner pine away, and find no relief, let them acknowledge it to be their own
fault; for I would have made myself the same as ever I have been, and they would
have found me a deliverer, had not a change taken place in them.&#8221; We now
comprehend the meaning of the Prophet in the ninth verse, and as to the
expression,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yha</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aei,</i> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> in the verse which
follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is thy
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> God again reproaches the
Israelites for having reposed their confidence in their king and other earthly
helps, by which they thought themselves to have been well fortified.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is thy
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>he says. He derides the
Israelites; for they saw that their king was now stripped of every power to
help, and that all their princes were destitute both of prudence and of all
other means. Since then there was no protection from men, the Prophet shows now
that Israel had but a vain trust, when they thought themselves safe under the
shadow of their king, when they considered themselves secure as long as they
were governed by prudent men. All these things, he says, are vain. But we must
ever bear in mind what he had said before
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for had not this shield been set up,
hypocrites would have ever said in return, &#8220;Where now is God? What is his
purpose? Why does he delay?&#8221; Hence God mentioned before that he was ready
to help them, but that they by their wickedness had closed up the
way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he further derides them for having in vain placed
their hope and their help in their king and princes.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is thy
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may save thee in all thy
cities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>It is not without reason that
the Prophet mentions cities, because the Israelites despised all threatening,
while their cities were on every side unassailable and strong to keep out
enemies. Hence when God threatened them by his Prophets, they regarded what was
said to them as fables, and thus defended themselves, &#8220;How can enemies
assail us? Though there were hundred wars nigh at hand, have we not cities which
can resist the onsets of enemies? We shall therefore dwell in safety, and enjoy
our pleasures, though God should shake heaven and earth.&#8221; Since then they
were so inebriated with this false confidence, the Prophet now says, &#8220;I
know that you excel in having great and many cities; but as you deem them as
your protection, God will show that this hope is vain and deceptive.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is thy king, that
he may save thee in thy cities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> And
though thy king be well furnished with an army and with defences, it will yet
avail thee nothing, when God shall once rise up against
thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy judges of whom thou hast
said, Give me a king and princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>Here
the Prophet ascends higher; for he shows that the people of Israel had not only
sinned in this respect, that they had placed their hope in their king, and in
other helps; but that they had also chosen for themselves a king, whom God had
not approved. For David, we know, was anointed for this end, that he might unite
together the whole body of the people; and God intended that his Church and
chosen people should remain under one head, that they might be safe. It was
therefore an impious separations when the ten tribes wished for themselves a new
king. How so? Because a defection from the kingdom of David was as it were a
denial of God. For if it was said to Samuel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Thee have they not
rejected, but me,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that I should not
reign over them,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Samuel 8:7,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it was certainly more fully verified as to David. We
now then see what the Prophet meant: after having inveighed against the false
confidence of the people for thinking that they were safe through the power of
their king, he now adds, &#8220;I will advance to another source: for thou didst
not then begin to sin, when thou didst transfer the glory of God to the king,
but when thou didst wish to have a kingdom of thine own, being not content with
that kingdom which he had instituted in the person of David.&#8221; The Prophet
does now then accuse the people of defection, when a new king, that is,
Jeroboam, was elected by them. For though it was done according to the certain
purpose of God, as we have elsewhere observed, yet this availed nothing to
alleviate the fault of the people; for they, as far as they could, renounced
God. As the foot, if cut off from the body, is not only a mutilated and useless
member, but immediately putrefies; so also was Israel, being like a half part of
a torn and mutilated body; and they must have become putrified, had they not
been miraculously preserved. But at the same time God here justly condemns that
defection, that Israel, by desiring a new king, had broken asunder the sacred
unity of the Church and introduced an impious separation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the princes, of whom thou hast
said, Give me a king and princes. I gave to thee in my wrath, and took away in
my fury</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is &#8220;It was a cursed
beginning, and it shall be a cursed end; for the election of Jeroboam was not
lawful; but through an impious wilfulness, the people then rebelled against me,
when they revolted from the family of David.&#8221; Nothing successful could
then proceed from so inauspicious a beginning. For it is only then an auspicious
token, when we obey God, when his Spirit presides over our counsels, when we ask
at his mouth, and when we begin with prayer to him. But when we despise the word
of God, and give loose reins to our own humour, and fix on whatever pleases us,
it cannot be but that an unhappy and disastrous issue will follow. God therefore
says, that he gave them a king in his wrath; as though he said, &#8220;Ye think
that you have done nobly, when Jeroboam was raised to the throne, that he might
become eminent: for the kingdom of Judah was then far inferior to that of
Israel, which not only excelled in power, but also in the number of its
subjects. Ye think that you were then happy, because Jeroboam ruled over you:
but he was given you in the anger and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of God,&#8221; saith the Prophet. &#8220;But God commanded Jeroboam to be
anointed.&#8221; True, it was so: but this, says God, I did in my wrath; and now
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away in my
fury</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;I will deprive you
of that kingdom which I see is the cause of your blindness. For if that kingdom
remains entire, I shall be nothing, the authority of my word will be of no
weight among you. It is then necessary that this kingdom should be wholly
subverted; for ye began to be unhappy as soon as ye sought a new
king.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand what the Prophet means. At the same
time, we learn from this passage, that God so executes his judgements, that
whatever evil there is, it ought to be ascribed to men. For the raising of
Jeroboam to the kingdom, we certainly allow to have been rash and unjust; for
thereby was violated that celestial decree made known to David,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My Son art thou, I
have this day begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the
Gentiles,&#8217; etc.,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
2:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But who appointed Jeroboam to be king? The Lord
himself. How could it be, that God raised Jeroboam to the throne, and that he
yet by his decree set David, not only over the children of Abraham, but also
over the Gentiles, with reference to Christ who was to come? God seems here to
be inconsistent with himself. By no means; for when he set David over his chosen
people, it was a lawful appointment: but when he raised Jeroboam to the throne,
it was a singular judgement; so that in God there is no inconsistency. The
people at the same time, who by their suffrages adopted Jeroboam and made him
their king, acted impiously and perversely. &#8220;Yet God seems to have
directed the whole by his providence.&#8221; True; for before the people knew
any thing of the new king, God had already determined to elect him and resolved
also to punish in this way the defection and ingratitude of Solomon. All these
things are true, that is, that God by his secret counsel had directed the whole
business, and yet that he had no participation in the sin of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus let us learn wisely to admire the secret
judgements of God, and not imitate those profane cavillers, who make a great
noise, because they cannot understand how God thus makes use of wicked men, and
how he directs for the best end what is done by men wickedly and foolishly. As
they do not perceive this, they conclude that if the Lord governs all things, he
must be the author of sin. But the Scripture, as we see, when it speaks of the
wrath and fury of God, does at the same time set forth to us his rectitude in
all his judgements, and distinguishes between God and men, even as the
difference is great; for God does not turn the perverse designs of men to answer
their own ends &#8212; he is a just judge. And yet his purpose is not always
apparent to us: it is, however, our duty reverently and with chastened minds to
admire and adore those mysteries which surpass our comprehension. It follows

hypocrites in vain flatter themselves while God suspends his vengeance; for
though he may connive for a time, yet he does not sleep; nor ought it to be
believed that he is blind, but he seals up the sins of men, and keeps them
inclosed until the proper time for revealing them shall come. This is the chief
point; but the Prophet has expressed something more. For as Jeremiah
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;The sin of Judah
is written with a pen of iron,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">with

<div><font face="Palatino">so now also does Hosea say, that the iniquity of
Ephraim was sealed up. For writings may perish, when they spread abroad: but
what is laid up and put under a seal always remains. What, then, Hosea now means
is, that the people flattered themselves in vain, while a truce was granted
them; for the Lord kept their sins under his seal; as though he said &#8220;God
forgets not your iniquity: as he, however, spares you only for a time, it would
be far better to suffer immediate punishment, for thus the memory of your sin
would pass away; but he now carefully keeps all your iniquities as it were under
seal, and your sins are laid up in store.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that what the Prophet means in this verse
is, that the Israelites had made such advances in their sins, that now no pardon
or remission could be hoped for. &#8220;God then shall never be propitious to
you, for<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your sin is
sealed up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i> And this sentence
applies to all those who disguise themselves before God, when he does not
severely treat them, but, on the contrary, kindly sustains and bears with them.
Since, then, they thus disappointed his forbearance, it was necessary that this
should befall them, that he should seal up their iniquities, and keep inclosed
their sins.</font><br></div>

sorrows of one in travail he points out the sudden destruction which befalls
careless men. And this mode of speaking is common in Scripture.

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrows of one in

promise to themselves continual peace, and are now awakened by any threatenings,
and as they proudly despise both my hand and my word, a sudden destruction shall
crush them.&#8221; Thus much as to the beginning of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall come on them the
sorrows of one in
travail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He is an unwise
son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, he is altogether foolish.
Here God reprobates the extreme madness of the people of Israel, as though he
had said, &#8220;If any particle of sound understanding remained in this people,
they would at least perceive the judgement which is impending; and there would
then be some hope of a remedy: but this people are now wholly infatuated.&#8221;
And this proves their folly,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for they ought
not,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to stay in the breaking forth of
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This clause, however, some
interpreters explain thus, &#8220;The time will come, they will not stay in the
breaking forth of children.&#8221; But rather the contrary is meant by the
words; for the Prophet means, that when the time of birth came, the people would
stop in the breaking forth; which they would not do, were they endued with a
right and sound mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must be noticed, that the Prophet alludes to the
time of birth; for he had said before, that the sorrows of one in travail would
come on the people of Israel; he now declares that these sorrows would be
filial. Though a woman be in labour and in great danger in giving birth, she is
yet freed in a moment, and as Christ says, joy and gladness arise from that
sorrow,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:21.) But the Prophet says that this bringing forth would be very different;
for it would be an abortion, and the child would be retained to putrefy in the
womb. If a woman in the very birth restrains effort and shrinks in her strength,
she destroys the child and herself at the same time; for she cannot bring forth
without exertion. Since then the safety of the woman depends on the exertion
made, the Prophet now says, that the contrary would be the case with the people
of Israel. They are, he says, like a woman in travail; but they are at the same
time blinded with folly, for they retain the child in the womb and make no
effort: so this parturition must at last be fatal to them. Why? Because they
make no effort to bring forth the child.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet by these figurative representations no
doubt glances at the obstinate hardness of the people; for when they ought to
bewail and humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, we know how
perversely they hardened themselves against all punishment. Since, then, this
people did thus as it were champ the bridle, and at the same time make hard
their heart, partly by their fierce temper, partly by stupidity, partly by
desperation, it was no wonder that the Prophet said that they were an unwise and
insane people<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for they
stayed at the breaking forth of children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is they made no effort to obtain the wished-for end to their evils. For
when the Lord afflicts us, and we bring forth, this bringing forth is our
deliverance. Now, how can there be deliverance except we hate ourselves for our
sins, except we raise up our minds to God, and thus open a passage for
God&#8217;s grace? But when we oppose God pertinaciously through our fierceness
and stupidity, it is the same as if one closed up every avenue. We now then see
how appropriate is this metaphor used by the Prophet, when he says that the
people were mad; for when the time of bringing, forth came, they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stayed in the breaking
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, at the opening of the womb, for
this is what the Prophet means by the word. Since then they stayed in the very
opening, and restrained, as it were, every effort, and ceased from all
strivings, they must have perished. We now see what the obstinacy of men
produces when they harden themselves, when they thus contracts as it were,
within narrow limits their heart and mind and all their faculties. For when a
woman who is in travail restrains all efforts, she wilfully seeks death for
herself: so they do the same who harden themselves against all punishments, and
especially when the time of birth is come; and to this the word, breaking forth,
refers: for when the Lord strikes us not only once, but continues to lay on us
many stripes, so that we must either repent or perish for ever, it is the
ripened time for bringing forth; for God then leads us to an extremity, and
nothing remains for us but to humble ourselves under his mighty hand or to
perish. The Prophet then calls that condition, the breaking forth, in which
obstinate men continue, who will not obey God. It is necessary to join with
these verses the two which follow: this I shall do to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, I doubt not, continues here the same
subject, namely, that the Israelites could not bear the mercy offered to them by
God, though he speaks here more fully. God seems to promise redemption, but he
does this conditionally: they are then mistaken, in my judgement, who take these
words in the same sense as when God, after having reproved and threatened,
mitigates the severity of his instruction, and adds consolation by offering his
grace. But the import of this passage is different; for God, as we have already
said, does not here simply promise salvation, but shows that he is indeed ready
to save, but that the wickedness of the people, as it has been said, was an
impediment in the way. Let us, however, more carefully examine the
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the hand of the
grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says. By the hand he doubtless
means power: for Jerome does nothing but trifle, when he speaks here of works,
and says that the works of the grave are our sins. But this is far away from the
mind of the Prophet. It is indeed a metaphor common in Scripture, that the hand
is put for power or authority. Then it is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will redeem them from the power
of the grave, I will redeem them from
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, except they resist, I
will become willingly their Redeemer. Some have therefore rendered the passage
in the subjunctive mood, &#8220;From the hand of the grave I would redeem them,
from death I would deliver them.&#8221; But there is no need to change the
tense, though, as I have said, they who do so faithfully set forth the design of
the Prophet. But lest any one say that this is too remote from the words, the
text of the Prophet may be very well understood, though the future tense be
preserved. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redeem
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as far as this depends on me; for
a condition is to be introduced as though God came forth and declared that he
was present to fulfil the office of a Redeemer. What, then, does stand in the
way? Even the hardness of the people; for they would have preferred to perish a
hundred times rather than to turn to the Lord, as we shall presently
see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be thy perdition, O death;
I will be thy excision, O grave.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">By these
words, the Prophet more distinctly sets forth the power of God, and
magnificently extols it, lest men should think that there is no way open to him
to save, when no hope according to the judgement of the flesh appears. Hence the
Prophet says, &#8220;Though men are now dead, there is yet nothing to prevent
God to quicken them. How so? For he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the ruin of death, and the
excision of the grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;&#8221;</i> that is,
&#8220;Though death should swallow up all men, though the grave should consume
them, yet God is superior to both death and the grave, for he can slay death,
for he can abolish the grave.&#8221; We now perceive the real meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we may learn from this passage, that when men
perish, God still continues like himself, and that neither his power, by which
he is mighty to save the world, is extinguished, nor his purpose changed, so as
not to be always ready to help; but that the obstinacy of men rejects the grace
which has been provided, and which God willingly and bountifully offers. This is
one thing. We may secondly learn, that the power of God is not to be measured by
our rule: were we lost a hundred times, let God be still regarded as a Saviour.
Should then despair at any time so cast us down, that we cannot lay hold on any
of God&#8217;s promises, let this passage come to our minds, which says, that
God is the excision of death, and the destruction of the grave. &#8220;But death
is nigh to us, what then can we hope for any more?&#8221; This is to say, that
God is not superior to death: but when death claims so much power over men, how
much more power has God over death itself? Let us then feel assured that God is
the destruction of death, which means that death can no more destroy; that is,
that death is deprived of that power by which men are naturally destroyed; and
that though we may lie in the grave, God is yet the excision of the grave
itself. This is the application of what is here taught. But some one gives this
version, &#8220;I will be thy perdition to death,&#8221; as if this was
addressed to the people: it is an absurd perversion of the whole passage, and
deprives us of a most useful doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But many interpreters, thinking this passage to be
quoted by Paul, have explained what is here said of Christ, and have in many
respects erred. They have said first, that God promises redemption here without
any condition; but we see that the design of the Prophet was far different. They
have then assumed, that this is said in the person of Christ, &#8220;From the
hand of the grave will I redeem them.&#8221; They have at the same time thought,
with too much refinement, that <i>the grave or</i> hell is put for the torments
with which the reprobate are visited, or for the place itself where they are
tormented. But the Prophet repeats the same thing in different words, and well
known is this character of the Hebrew style. The grave then here differs not
from death; though Jerome labours and contends that the grave means what is
wholly different from death: but the whole of what he says is frivolous. They
have then been deceived as to these words. And then into the words of the
Prophet &#8220;I will be thy excision, O hell, (or grave,&#8221;) they have
introduced the word, bait, and have allegorically explained it of Christ, that
he was like a hook: for as a worm, when fastened to the hook, and swallowed by a
fish, becomes death to it; so also Christ, as they have said, when committed to
the sepulchre, became a fatal bait; for as the fish are taken by the hook, so
death was taken by the bait of the death of Christ. And these vain subtilties
have been received with great applause: hence under the whole Papacy it is
received without doubt as a divine truth, that Christ was the bait of death. But
yet let any one narrowly examine the words of the Prophet, and he will see that
they have ignorantly and shamefully abused the testimony of the Prophet. And we
ought especially to take care, that the meaning of Scripture should be preserved
true and certain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us see what to answer to that which is said
of Paul quoting this passage. The solution is not difficult. The Apostles do not
avowedly at all times adduce passages, which in their whole context apply to the
subject they handle; but sometimes they allude to a word only, sometimes they
apply a passage to a subject in the way of resemblance, and sometimes they bring
forward passages as testimonies. When the Apostles use the testimonies of
Scripture, then the genuine and real truth must be sought out; but when they
glance only at one word, there is no occasion to make any anxious inquiry; and
when they quote any passage of Scripture in the way of resemblance, it is a too
scrupulous anxiety to seek out how all the parts agree. But it is quite evident
that Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15, has not quoted the testimony of the Prophet for
the purpose of confirming the doctrine of which he speaks. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What
then? As the resurrection of the flesh was a truth very difficult to be
believed, nay, wholly contrary to the judgement of nature, Paul says that it is
no matter of wonder, inasmuch as Christ will come to raise us. How so? Because
it is the peculiar prerogative of God to be the perdition of death and the
destruction of the grave; as though he said, &#8220;Were men to putrefy a
thousand times, God would still retain that power of which he declared when he
said, that he would be the ruin of death and the destruction of the
grave.&#8221; Let us then know, that, though the judgement of nature rejects the
truth, yet God is endued with that incomprehensible power by which he can raise
us from a state of putrefaction; nay, since he created the world from nothing,
he will also raise us up from the grave, for he is the death of death, the grave
of the grave, the ruin of ruin, and the destruction of destruction: and the
simple object of Paul is, to extol by these striking words that incredible power
of God, which is beyond the reach of human understanding.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now were any one to quote for the same purpose this
place from the Psalms, &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s are the issues of death,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:20,) would it be needful to inquire in what sense David said this or of what
time he speaks? By no means; but what is spoken of is the unchangeable
prerogative and power of God, of which he can never be deprived, so also in this
place we see what he declares by Hosea, and what he would have done, had there
not been an obstacle in the ingratitude of the people; for he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be thy ruin, O grave; I
will be thy death, O death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And since
God has promised this, let us feel assured that we shall at last find this to be
true as to ourselves. We now then perceive how the real meaning of the Prophet
agrees with the subject handled by Paul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
or, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance is hid from my
eye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuchem,</i> means both.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuchem,</i> signifies to repent, and it signifies to receive consolation. If
the term, consolation, be approved, the sense will be, &#8220;There is no reason
for any one to wonder that I speak so sharply, and do nothing but thunder
against my people; for consolation has now no place among them; therefore
consolation is hid from my eyes.&#8221; And this was the case, because the
irreclaimable wickedness of the people did not allow God to change his severity
into mildness, so as to give any hope of pardon and salvation. In this sense
then it is said that consolation was hid from his eyes. But if the word,
repentance, be more approved, it will show exactly the same thing, &#8212; that
it was fully determined to destroy that people. &#8220;There is then no reason
for you to hope that I can become milder in course of time; for repentance is
hid from mine eyes. This shall remain fixed, you shall be reduced to nothing;
for ye are past all hope.&#8221; We then see that both the words refer to the
same thing, that God takes away from this miserable and reprobate people every
hope of salvation. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God again confirms what had been said that Israel in
vain trusted in their strength and fortresses and that certain destruction was
nigh them on account of their sins which they followed without any limits or
restraint. But the Prophet begins with these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He among brethren will
increase</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He alludes, I doubt not, (as
other interpreters have also noticed,) to the blessing of the tribe of Ephraim,
which is mentioned in Genesis 48; for we know that though Ephraim was the
younger, he was yet placed first by Jacob, so that he was preferred in honour to
his brother, who was the firstborn: and further, the prophecy, we know, which
Jacob then announced, was really fulfilled; for the tribe of Ephraim excelled,
both in number and in other respects, all the rest, except only the tribe of
Judah. Ephraim had evidently gained high eminence among the whole people. But
when he ought to have ascribed all this to the gratuitous goodness of God, he
became inflated with pride. This ingratitude the Prophet now reproves,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among his brethren will
increase</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> but whence this increase?
Whence was this so great a dignity, except that he was preferred to Manasseh,
who by right of nature was the first? Now it was not enough for this wretched
people to forget so great a favour of God, without at the same time abusing
their wealth in fostering pride, and without hardening themselves in contempt of
God. For whence came so great an audacity in their rebellion, whence so great
stupidity and so great a madness as to despise the judgement of God, except from
this &#8212; that they had increased among their brethren?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though, then, he increases among his brethren, yet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall come an east wind,
the wind of Jehovah, which shall dry his spring, and his fountain shall be dried
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here God declares what had been
before mentioned, that it was in his power to take away from the people of
Israel what he had gratuitously bestowed, as he could dry up the fountains
whenever he wished. And he applies a most suitable similitude. As the east wind,
he says, dries and burns up, and if it long prevails, the fountains will be
dried up; so will I, he says, dry up all the springs of Ephraim. Whether or not
he thinks that he possesses more vigour than fountains, which have an
exhaustless source, it is certain that fountains dry up whenever it so pleases
me. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will then dry up the
springs and fountains of Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> though
he thinks that he draws from a deep fountain, yet the wind, when it shall rise,
will dry up his whole vigour and moisture. We now understand what the Prophet
means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the words, some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kodim,</i> improperly, the south wind; for it means the east wind: and then
others incorrectly explain <i>the wind of Jehovah,</i> as meaning a strong wind.
I indeed allow that what is unusual is often said to be divine; but in this
place the Prophet intended to express, that God has winds ever ready, by which
he can dry up whatever vigour there may be or seem to be in men. Hence the name
of Jehovah is set in opposition to natural causes or means. It shall not then be
a fortuitous wind that shall dry up the springs of Ephraim, but one raised up by
the counsel and certain purpose of God; as though he said, &#8220;This wind will
be the scourge of God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are then taught here, that when God for a time
blesses us, we must beware lest we abuse his favour and entertain a false
confidence, as we see that Ephraim had done: for he flourished among his
brethren, and then raised up his head; and thus he obliterated God&#8217;s
favour through his pride and haughtiness. We ought then, when prosperous, ever
to fear, lest something like this should happen to us. The more kindly then God
deals with us, the more constantly ought we to be roused up to pray to him, that
he may be pleased to carry on his work to the end, lest we slumber in our
enjoyments while God is indulgent to us. This, in the first place, we ought to
bear in mind. Then we must also notice the warning of the prophet, that God can
suddenly, and, as it were, in a moment, upset the prosperity of men, that there
is nothing in this world which cannot be immediately changed whenever God
withdraws from us his favour. This comparison then ought often to occur to us;
when the air is tranquil, when the season is quiet, a wind will in a moment rise
up, which will dry the earth, which will also make dry the fountains; and yet
the vigour of fountains seems to be perpetual; what then may not happen to us?
Cannot the Lord at any moment make us dry, since we have in ourselves no source
of strength? He might indeed have said in this place what we find in the
40<sup>th</sup> chapter of Isaiah that man is like the flower that soon fadeth;
but he intended to express something more profound; for this people, being
deeply fixed in their own strength, thought that they were supplied by
exhaustless fountains, and that their vigour could not be dried up: hence he
says, &#8220;Though thou hast fountains and springs, yet God will dry thee up;
for he will find a wind that has power, as experience proves, to dry up springs
and fountains.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It will rob the treasure of every
desirable vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This may seem to be
improperly applied to wind; but yet the meaning of the Prophet is sufficiently
clear, even this, that nothing shall remain untouched in the tribe of Ephraim,
when the Lord shall raise up his wind. &#8220;However hidden,&#8221; he seems to
say, &#8220;your treasures may be, yet this wind shall penetrate into the inmost
recesses, so that nothing shall be safe from its violence.&#8221; In short, the
Prophet means, that the force of God&#8217;s vengeance would be so violent, that
Ephraim could not be secure in any of his fortresses; for the wind of God would
penetrate unto the very inmost springs of the earth. This is the meaning. It
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This is the conclusion of the discourse: this verse
has then been improperly separated from the former chapter 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">; for
the Prophet enters not here on a new subject, but only confirms what he had said
of the ultimate destruction of Samaria and of the whole kingdom.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be
desolated</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said &#8220;I
have already often denounced on you what you believe not, that destruction is
nigh at hand; of this be now persuaded; but if you believe not, God will yet
execute what he has determined, and what he now pronounces by my mouth.&#8221;
At the same time he adds the cause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they have provoked their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> That they might not complain that
they were severely dealt with, he says, that they only suffered the punishment
which they deserved. He also specifies the kind of destruction that was to be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall fall by the sword,
their children shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women squall be
torn asunder</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the child may be
extracted from the womb. In saying that the citizens of Samaria, and the
inhabitants of the whole country, shall fall by the sword, he doubtless
intimates that God would make use of this kind of punishment by sending for
enemies who would consign them to destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what is included in the words of the
Prophet. He first shows that it was all over with Samaria and the whole kingdom
of Israel; as God could by no means bring them to repentance, he would now take
vengeance on so desperate an obstinacy. He afterwards shows that God would do
this justly, because he had been provoked; and, lastly, he shows what kind their
punishment would be. That they might not think that the Assyrians would come by
chance, the Prophet says that this army, which was to invade and destroy the
country of Samaria, would be, as it were, conducted by the hand of God; for
though the Assyrians wished to extend their own borders, and were influenced by
their own avarice and cupidity, yet God would use them as instruments to execute
his own judgement; and that they might know how dreadful the vengeance would be,
he relates two kinds of evils, &#8212; that their children would be dashed in
pieces, and that their women would be rent asunder, and their offspring
extracted from their wombs. Even to speak of this is horrible; and it is what
never takes place, except when enemies are greatly enraged and extremely
provoked. We now then comprehend the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if any one objects and says, that infants, and
babes as yet concealed in the wombs of their mothers, deserve not such a
grievous punishment, as they have not hitherto merited such a thing; it may be
answered, that the whole human race are guilty before God, so that infants
though not yet come forth to the light, are yet included as being under guilt;
so that God cannot be charged with cruelty, though he may use his own right
towards them. And further, we hear what he declares in many places, that he will
devolve the sins of parents on their children. Since it is so, let us learn to
acquiesce in these awful judgements of God, though very repugnant to our
feelings; for we know that we must not contend with God, and that it would be
extreme presumption to do so; nay, it would be impious audacity. Though then the
reason for this punishment may not appear to us, we ought yet reverently to
regard this judgement of God. We may moreover thus reason &#8212; If infants be
not spared, even those as yet hid in the mother&#8217;s womb, what will become
of adults? what will become of the old, who through their whole life have
continued to provoke the vengeance of God? The Lord no doubt intended by these
words to terrify those godless despisers of his word, with whom he had to do.
&#8220;How great a judgement,&#8221; he says, &#8220;hangs over you, and how
tremendous! since your infants shall not be exempted: for I shall involve you in
the same judgement, when they shall be dashed against the stones, after having
been drawn out of their mothers&#8217; womb. When such a dreadful punishment
shall be inflicted on them, what shall be done to you? for the cause of the evil
exists in you.&#8221; We have now then explained this verse. Then follows an
exhortation.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet exhorts the Israelites to
repentance, and still propounds some hope of mercy. But this may seem
inconsistent as he had already testified that there would be no remedy any more,
because they had extremely provoked God. The Prophet seems in this case to
contradict himself. But the solution is ready at hand, and it is this, &#8212;
In speaking before of the final destruction of the people, he had respect to the
whole body of the people; but now he directs his discourse to the few, who had
as yet remained faithful. And this distinction, as we have reminded you in other
places, ought to be carefully noticed; otherwise we shall find ourselves
perplexed in many parts of Scripture. We now then see for what purpose the
Prophet annexed this exhortation, after having asserted that God would be
implacable to the people of Israel; for with regard to the whole body, there was
no hope of deliverance; God had now indeed determined to destroy them, and he
wished this to be made known to them by the preaching of Hosea. But yet God had
ever some seed remaining among his chosen people: though the body, as a whole,
was putrid and corrupt; yet some sound members remained, as in a large heap of
chaff some grains may be found concealed. As God then had preserved some (as he
is wont always to do,) he sets forth to them his mercy: and as they had been
carried away, as it were by a tempest, when iniquity so prevailed among the
people, that there was nothing sound, the Prophet addresses them here, because
they were not wholly incurable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know that the irreclaimable, the whole
body of the people, are now dismissed; for they were so obstinate that the
Prophet could address them with no prospect of success. Then his sermon here
ought to be especially applied to the elect of God, who, having fallen away for
a time, and become entangled in the common vices of the age, were yet not
altogether incurable. The Prophet now exhorts them and says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return, Israel, to Jehovah thy
God; for thou hast fallen by thine
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This reason is added, because
men will never repent unless they are made humble; and whence comes true and
genuine humility, except from a sense of sin? Unless then men become displeased
with themselves, and acknowledge that they are worthy of perdition, they will
never be touched by a genuine feeling of penitence. These two things are then
wisely joined together by Hosea, that Israel had fallen by their iniquities, and
then, that it was time to return to Jehovah. How so? Because, when we are
convinced that we are worthy of destruction, nays that we are already doomed to
death for having so often provoked God, then we begin to hate ourselves; and a
detestation of sin drives us to seek repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turn thou, Israel, to thy
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet now kindly invites
them; for he could not succeed by severe words without mingling a hope of
favour, as we know that there can be no hope of repentance without faith. Then
the Prophet not only shows what was necessary to be done, but says also,
&#8216;Thou art Israel, thou art an elect people.&#8217; He does not, however,
as it has been already stated, address all indiscriminately, but those who were
the true children of Abraham, though they had for a time degenerated.
&#8220;Turn thou, Israel, then to thy God; for how much soever thou hast for a
time fallen away, yet God has not rejected thee: only return to him, and thou
shalt find favour, for he is placable to his own people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards shows the way of repentance: and this
passage deserves to be noticed; for we know that men bring forward mere trifles
when they speak of repentance. Hence when the word, repentance, is mentioned,
men imagine that God is to be pacified with this or that ceremony, as we see to
be the case with those under the Papacy. And what is their repentance? Even
this, &#8212; if on certain days they fast, if they mutter short prayers, if
they undertake vowed pilgrimages, if they buy masses, &#8212; if with these
trifles they weary themselves, they think that the right and the required
repentance is brought before God: but all this is altogether absurd. As then the
world understands not what repentance means, and to what it leads, the Prophet
here sets forth true repentance by its fruits. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take with you words, and turn to
Jehovah; and say to him, Take away all iniquity and bring good, and we will
render to thee the calves of our lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>When he bids them to take or find words to present instead of sacrifice, he
no doubt alluded to what the law teaches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, it is certain that the Prophet speaks not of
feigned words; for we know what God declares by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;This people draw
nigh me with their lips,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but their
heart is from me far distant,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
29:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he bids them to take words, by which they might
show what was conceived and felt in their heart. Then he means this first, that
their words should correspond with their feeling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must, secondly, be noticed, that the Prophet
speaks not here of any sort of words, but that there is to be a mutual relation
between the words of God and the words of men. How are we then to bring words to
God, such as prove the genuineness of our piety? Even by being teachable and
submissive; by suffering willingly when he chastises us, by confessing what we
deserve when he reproves us, by humbly deprecating vengeance when he threatens
us, by embracing pardon when he promises it. When we thus take words from
God&#8217;s mouth, and bring them to him, this is to take words according to
what the Prophet means in this place. We hence see the import of the
Prophet&#8217;s exhortation, when he bids us to take words: but I cannot proceed
further now.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we now
carry about us this mortal body, yea, and nourish through sin a thousand deaths
within us, &#8212; O grant, that we may ever by faith direct our eyes towards
heaven, and to that incomprehensible power, which is to be manifested at the
last day by Jesus Christ our Lord, so that in the midst of death we may hope
that thou wilt be our Redeemer, and enjoy that redemption, which he completed
when he rose from the dead; and not doubt but that the fruit which he then
brought forth by his Spirit will come also to us, when Christ himself shall come
to judge the world; and may we thus walk in the fear of thy name, that we may be
really gathered among his members, to be made partakers of that glory, which by
his death he has procured for us. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
THIRTY-SEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take with you words and turn to
Jehovah and say to him, Take away all iniquity, and bring good, and we will pay
thee the calves of our lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We
mentioned in our last lecture the sort of words the Prophet here bids the
Israelites to take, while exhorting them to repent: for as they had been
hitherto deaf and mute, he commands them to be not only attentive to the word of
the Lord, but also prompt to respond, that there might be a mutual consent
between the doctrine heard and their own confession. He now explains himself and
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take away all iniquity, and
bring good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> These are the words with
which he bids them to come to God. He dictates to them the confession which the
Lord requires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first bids them to ask remission and the pardon of
sins; for if a sinner desires to return into favour with God, and yet does not
confess his guilt, he adopts a way the most strange. The very beginning must be
a confession, such as the Prophet here describes. For the Israelites, by asking
God to remit their sins, at the same time confessed themselves to be guilty
before Him; yea, they condemned themselves that they might obtain gratuitous
absolution. And emphatical is what they said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take away all
iniquity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Thus they confessed themselves to be
guilty not only of one sin, but also of many sins, for which God might justly
punish them, had he not been propitious to them. In short, they acknowledge here
their various and multiplied guilt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But they add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This sentence is commonly
explained as if the Israelites said, that they had hitherto been barren and
empty of good works, but that now being reconciled, they would be useful and
profitable servants of God. But this sense seems not to me suitable to this
place; for he afterwards subjoins the evidence of gratitude,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall pay the calves of our
lips.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He here speaks, I doubt not, of
God&#8217;s blessing, which flows from the gratuitous pardon of sins: for God
does not simply receive us into favour, but also really shows that he is not in
vain reconciled to us; for he adds the fruits of his paternal love, by favouring
us with his kindness. As then the Prophet commanded the Israelites to bring
words before God, so now he introduces them as praying that God would bring
good: and Scripture is wont commonly to join these two together, &#8212; the
favour of God, by which he freely remits sins, &#8212; and his blessing, which
he grants to his children, after he has embraced them in his paternal love.
Hence <i>bring good;</i> that is, &#8220;O Lord, first receive us into favour,
and then prove in reality that thou art propitious to us, even by outward
benefits.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we shall
pay,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or render,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the calves of our
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In this passage, the faithful
confess that they have nothing with which they can pay God in return, when he
has bountifully granted them all things, except that they will celebrate his
goodness in their praises, and confess that they owe all things to him. This is
then a remarkable passage; for it sets forth God&#8217;s goodness towards men,
and then it teaches that men can render no mutual compensation, but can only
bring praises by which they celebrate God&#8217;s goodness, and nothing more, as
it is said in Psalm 116,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;What shall I repay the Lord for
all the benefits which he has conferred on me? The cup of salvation will I take,
and on the name of the Lord will I call.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There also the Prophet testifies that God is not
liberal towards men because he expects or demands any thing from them, for what
can they give? but that he still requires thanksgiving, and that he is content
with the sacrifice of praise, as we find it also said in Psalm 1. But we learn
the same thing from this passage,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> they says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bring
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;Though we have in
various ways exposed ourselves to thy judgement, having by our innumerable sins
provoked thy wrath, yet let thy goodness surpass all our iniquities; having made
us clean, bring also that good which has been hitherto, as it were, far away
from us.&#8221; For while God shows signs of his wrath, we are destitute of all
his blessings. They therefore ask God, after restoring them to favour, to
manifest to them his kindness. And what do they at last say? &#8220;O Lords we
promise thee no compensation, for thou requires none, nor is it in our power to
give any; but we </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will pay to thee
the calves of the lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
&#8220;We will confess that we owe all things to thee; for it is only the
sacrifice of praise that we can render thee, when thou hast loaded us with all
kinds of blessings.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And calves of the lips the Prophet fitly calls the
praises which God requires as the chief sacrifice; for under the law, some
offered calves when they paged their vows. But the Prophet shows that God
regards not external sacrifices, but only those exercises which men perform in
another way, even the sacrifices of thanksgiving. This then is the meaning of
the metaphor; as though he said, &#8220;The calves which are wont to be offered
are not the true sacrifices in which God delights, but tend rather to show that
men are to offer praise to God.&#8221; We now then perceive the meaning of this
verse. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This verse ought to be joined with the last, as the
Israelites show here more clearly and fully in what they had sinned, and, at the
same time, give proof of their repentance; for when they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Assyrian shall not save us,
we shall not mount on horses, we shall not say to the work of hands, Our
gods,</i> </font><font face="Palatino">it is to be understood as a confession,
that they had in these various ways roused against themselves the vengeance of
God; for they had hoped for safety from the Assyrians, ran here and there, and
had thus alienated themselves from God; they had also fled to statues and idols,
and had transferred to dumb images the honour due to the only true God. We hence
see, that though the faithful speak of future time, they yet indirectly confess
that they had grievously sinned, had forsaken the only true God, and transferred
their hopes to others, either to the Assyrians or to fictitious gods. But at the
same time, they promise to be different in future; as though he said, that they
would not only be grateful to God in celebrating his praises, but that their way
of living would be also new, so as not to abuse the goodness of God. This is the
substance of what is here said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Assyrian shall not save
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> they doubtless condemned, as I have
already stated, the false confidence with which they were before deluded, when
they sought deliverance by means of the Assyrians. There is, indeed, no doubt,
but that the Israelites were ever wont to pretend to trust in the name of God;
but in thinking themselves lost without the succour of the Assyrians, they most
certainly defrauded God of his just honour, and adorned men with spoils taken
from him. For except we be convinced that God alone is sufficient for us, even
when all earthly aids fail us, we do not place in him our hope of salvation;
but, on the contrary, transfer to mortals what belongs alone to him. For this
sacrilege the Israelites therefore condemn themselves, and, at the same time,
show that the fruit of their repentance would be, to set their minds on God, so
as not to be drawn here and there as before, or to think that they could be
preserved through the help of men. Let us hence learn, that men turn not to God,
except when they bid adieu to all creatures, and no longer fix their hopes on
them. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On a horse we shall not
mount</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> may be explained in two ways;
&#8212; as though they said, that they would no longer be so mad as to be proud
of their own power, or consider themselves safe because they were well furnished
with horses and chariots; &#8212; but the clause may be more simply explained,
as meaning, that they would not as before wander here and there to procure for
themselves auxiliaries; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mount a
horse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> but continue quiet in our
country; and this sense seems more appropriate. I do not then think that the
Prophet brings forward any new idea, but I read the two sentences conjointly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Assyrian shall not save us,
we shall not then mount on a horse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that
is, that we may ride in haste; for they had wearied themselves before with long
journeys: as soon as any danger was at hand, they went away afar off into
Assyria to seek help, when God commanded them to remain quiet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of this will be better understood by
referring to other passages, which correspond with what is here said. God says
by Isaiah, &#8216;On horses mount not; but ye said, We will mount: then
mount,&#8217; says he,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
30:16.) Here is a striking intimation, that the Jews against God&#8217;s will
rode and hastened to seek aids. &#8220;I see you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to be
very prompt and swift: then mount, but it shall be for the purpose of
fleeing.&#8221; We see what was the design of this reproof of the Prophet; it
was to show that the Jews, who ought to have remained still and quiet, fled here
and there for the sake of seeking assistance. So also in this place, when they
would show the fruit of their repentance, they say, &#8220;We will not hereafter
mount a horse, for the Lord, who promises to be our aid, is not to be sought as
one far off: we will not then any more fatigue ourselves in vain.&#8221; It
seems to me that this is what is meant by the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we shall not say, Our gods,
to the work of our hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As they had spoken of
the false trust they placed in men, so now they condemn their own superstition.
And these are the two pests which are wont to bring destruction on men; for
nothing is more ruinous than to transfer our hope from God; and this is done in
two ways, either when men trust in their own strength, or pride themselves on
human aids and despise God, as if they can be safe without him, &#8212; or when
they give up themselves to false superstitions. Both these diseases ever prevail
in the world, when men entangle themselves in their own superstitions, and form
for themselves new gods, from whom they expect safety; as we see to be the case
with those under the Papacy. God is almost of no account with them, Christ is
not sufficient. For how comes it that they contrive so many patrons for
themselves, that they devise so many guardianships, except that they despise the
help of God, or so extenuate it, that they dare not to hope for salvation from
him? We hence see that superstition draws men away from God, and becomes thus
the cause of the worst destruction. But there are some, who are not thus given
up to superstitions, but who derive a hope from their own velour or wisdom; for
the children of this world are inflated with their own strength; and when
princes have their armies prepared, when they have fortified cities, when they
possess abundance of money, when they are strengthened by many compacts, they
are blinded with false confidence. So then this verse teaches us, that these are
two destructive pests, which commonly draw men away from real safety; and if
then we would repent sincerely from the heart, we must purge our minds from
these two evils, so that we may not ascribe any thing to our own strength or to
earthly helps, nor form any idols to be in the place of God, but feel assured
that God alone is a sufficient help to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>will the fatherless find
&#8220;mercy&#8221;. Here the Israelites show that it is necessary for us to be
depressed that we may remain dependent on God alone; for those are compared to
the fatherless who are so humbled, that they cast away all vain hopes, and,
conscious of their nakedness and want, recumb on God alone. Hence, that
God&#8217;s mercy may find a way open to come to us, we must become fatherless.
Now what this metaphor means is well known to us. The fatherless, we know, are,
first, destitute of aid, and, secondly, of wisdom; and they are also without
strength. They are then dependent on the aid of another, and stand in need of
direction; in short, their safety depends on the assistance of others. Thus,
also, we are really fatherless, when we rely not on our own prudence, nor recumb
on our own strength, nor think that we can be safe through the aids which come
from the earth, but cast all our hopes and cares on God alone. This is one
thing. <i>The fatherless</i> then shall find mercy <i>in thee;</i> that is,
&#8220;When thou, Lord, dost so afflict us, that we become wholly cast down,
then we shall find mercy in thee; and this mercy will be sufficient for us, so
that we shall no more wander and be drawn aside by false devices, as it has
hitherto been the case with us.&#8221; When, therefore, they say,<i> in God</i>
will the fatherless find mercy, they mean that the grace offered by the Lord
will be sufficient, so that there will be no need any more of seeking aid from
any other. We now understand what the Prophet means in this verse. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">God here confirms what we have observed respecting
his gratuitous reconciliation, nor is the repetition useless; for as men are
disposed to entertain vain and false hopes, so nothing is more difficult than to
preserve them in dependence on the one God, and to pacify their minds, so that
they disturb not nor fret themselves, as experience teaches us all. For when we
embrace the promises of free pardon, our flesh ever leads us to distrust, and we
become harassed by various fancies. &#8220;What! can you or dare you promise
with certainty to yourself that God will be propitious to you, when you know
that for many reasons he is justly angry with you?&#8221; Since, then, we are so
inclined to harbour distrust, the Prophet again confirms the truth which we have
before noticed, which is, that God is ready to be reconciled, and that he
desires nothing more than to receive and embrace his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will heal their
defections</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The way of healing is by a
gratuitous pardon. For though God, by regenerating us by his Spirit, heals our
rebellion, that is, subdues us unto obedience, and removes from us our
corruptions, which stimulate us to sin; yet in this place the Prophet no doubt
declares in the person of God, that the Israelites would be saved from their
defections, so that they might not come against them in judgement, nor be
imputed to them. Let us know then that God is in two respects a physician while
he is healing our sins: he cleanses us by his Spirit, and he abolishes and
buries all our offences. But it is of the second kind of healing that the
Prophet now speaks, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will heal their turnings
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and he employs a strong term, for
he might have said, &#8220;your faults or errors&#8221; but he says, &#8220;your
defections from God;&#8221; as though he said, &#8220;Though they have so
grievously sinned, that by their crimes they have deserved hundred deaths, yet I
will heal them from these their atrocious sins, and I will love them
freely.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbdn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nudebe,</i> may be explained either freely or bountifully.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love them
bountifully</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, with an abounding
and not a common love; or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
love them freely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is gratuitously.
But they who render the words &#8220;I will love them of mine own accord,&#8221;
that is, not by constraint, pervert the sense of the Prophet; for how frigid is
the expression, that God is not forced to love us; and what meaning can hence be
elicited? But the Lord is said to love us freely, because he finds in us no
cause of love, for we are unworthy of being regarded or viewed with any favour;
but he shows himself liberal and beneficent in this very act of manifesting his
love to the unworthy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then perceive that the real meaning of the Prophet
is this, that though the Israelites had in various ways provoked the wrath of
God, and as it were designedly wished to perish, and to have him to be angry
with them; yet the Lord promises to be propitious to them. In what way? Even in
this, for he will give proof of his bounty, when he will thus gratuitously
embrace them. We now see how God becomes a Father to us, and regards us as his
children, even when he abolishes our sins, and also when he freely admits us to
the enjoyment of his love. And this truth ought to be carefully observed; for
the world ever imagines that they come to God, and bring something by which they
can turn or incline him to love them. Nothing can be more inimical to our
salvation than this vain fancy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn from this passage, that God cannot
be otherwise a Father to us than by becoming our physician and by healing our
transgressions. But the order also is remarkable, for God puts love after
healing. Why? Because, as he is just, it must be that he regards us with hatred
as long as he imputes sins. It is then the beginning of love, when he cleanses
us from our vices, and wipes away our spots. When therefore it is asked, how God
loves men, the answer is, that he begins to love them by a gratuitous pardon;
for while God imputes sins, it must be that men are hated by him. He then
commences to love us, when he heals our diseases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not without reason that he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
fury</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is turned
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"> from Israel. For the Prophet intended to
add this as a seal to confirm what he taught; for men ever dispute with
themselves when they hear that God is propitious to them. &#8220;How is this,
that he heals thine infirmities? for hitherto thou hast found him to be angry
with thee, and how art thou now persuaded that his wrath is pacified?&#8221;
Hence the Prophet seals his testimony respecting God&#8217;s love, when he says,
that his wrath has now ceased.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turned away then is my
fury</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> &#8220;Though hitherto I have by
many proofs, manifested to thee my wrath, yet I now come to thee as one changed.
Judge me not then by past time, for I am now pacified to thee, and<i>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now again repeats what he had said, that
God, after restoring the people to favour, would be so beneficent, as to render
apparent the fruit of reconciliation. Seeing that the Israelites had been
afflicted, they ought to have imputed this to their own sins, they ought to have
perceived by such proofs, the wrath of God. They had been so stupid as to have
on the contrary imagined, that their adversities happened to them by chance. The
Prophet had been much engaged in teaching this truth, that the Israelites would
be ever miserable until they turned to God, and also, that all their affairs
would be unhappy until they obtained pardon. He now speaks of a change, that God
would not only by words show himself propitious to them, but would also give a
proof by which the Israelites might know that they were now blessed, because
they had been reconciled to God; for his blessing would be the fruit of his
gratuitous love. Thus then ought this sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be to Israel as the
dew</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> to be connected: He intimates that
they were before dry, because they had been deprived of God&#8217;s favour. He
compares them to a rose or lily: for when the fields or meadows are burnt up by
the heat of the sun, and there is no dew distilling from heaven, all things
wither. How then can lilies and roses flourish, except they derive moisture from
heaven, and the dew refreshes the grounds that they may put forth their
strength? The reason then for the similitude is this, because men become dry and
destitute of all vigour, when God withdraws his favour. Why? Because God must,
as it were, distil dew, otherwise, as it has been said, we become wholly barren
and dry. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as dew to
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall Flourish as the lily,
and his roots he shall send forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some
render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;yw</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vaic</i>, &#8220;and he will strike;&#8221; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuke,</i> means to strike. Others render the words, &#8220;His branches will
extend:&#8221; but the verb is in the singular number, and the noun,
&#8220;roots,&#8221; is in the plural. The Prophet then speaks of Israel, that
he strikes his roots; but he means to fix in a metaphorical sense: he will then
fix his roots. As when we strike, we fetch a blow, and extend our arms; so he
will spread forth his roots as Libanus. This is the second effect of God&#8217;s
favour and blessing; which means, that the happiness of the people would be
perpetual. With regard to the rose or lily, the meaning of the metaphor is, that
God would suddenly, and as in a moment, vivify the Israelites, though they were
like the dead. as in one night the lily rises, and unexpectedly also the rose;
so sudden would be the change signified by this metaphor. But as the lilies and
the roses soon wither, it was not enough to promise to Israel that their
salvation would come suddenly; but it was needful to add this second clause,
&#8212; that though they would be like lilies and roses, they yet would be also
like tall trees, which have deep roots in the ground, by which they remain firm
and for a long time flourish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet. He
mentions here the twofold effect of God&#8217;s blessing as to the Israelites,
&#8212; that their restoration would be sudden, as soon as God would distil like
the dew his favour upon them, and also that this happiness would not be fading,
but enduring and permanent. And the words may be rendered,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as
Libanus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those of Libanus: as Libanus he
shall cast forth his roots</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as the trees
which grow there; or, he shall cast forth his roots as the trees which are in
Libanus. But as to the sense there is no difference. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on with the same subject, but joins
the beginning of the first verse with the second clause of the former verse. He
had said that the roots of the people would be deep when God should restore
them. Now he adds, that their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>branches shall go
on</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He mentions here &#8220;to go
on&#8221; metaphorically for extending far; for branches of trees seem to go on,
when they extend and spread themselves far and wide.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
branches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall go
on</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which means, that a tree, after
striking roots, remains not in the same state, but grows and spreads forth its
branches in all directions. In short, God promises a daily increase to his
blessing, after he has once begun to show himself bountiful to the people of
Israel. &#8220;I will then be bountiful at the beginning; and further, he says,
my blessing shall, as time passes, increase and be
multiplied.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His comeliness shall be like the
olive</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet accumulates
similitudes, that he might more fully confirm the people. And we certainly see
that the minds of men grow faint, when they look for prosperity from this or
that quarter; for there is hardly one in a hundred who is fully persuaded that
when God is propitious, all things turn out well and happily: for men regard not
the love of God when they wish things to be well with them, but wander here and
there through the whole world; and now they seek prosperity from themselves,
then from the earth, now from the air, then from the sea. Since then it is so
difficult to impress this truth fully on the hearts of men, that the love of God
is the fountain of all blessings, the Prophet has collected together a number of
similitudes to confirm what he teaches. Then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
comeliness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be like the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his fragrance like that of
Libanus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>and odoriferous trees, we know,
grow on Mount Libanus. But by these various similes the Prophet shows that the
state of the people would be prosperous and happy as soon as they should be
received by God into favour. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the dwellers under his shadow

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall grow as the vine: his

</i>The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, that God would show himself
bountiful to his people, that it might plainly appear from their different state
that they had before suffered just punishment. And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The dwellers under his shadow
shall return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ishibu,</i> in this place rightly means, &#8220;to be refreshed,&#8221; as in
Psalm 19; where the law of God is spoken of as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tby&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshibet</i>, converting the soul; which signifies the same as refreshing or
restoring the soul. So the Prophet intimates, that after the Israelites shall
begin to flourish again, their shadow would be vivifying, such as would restore
and refresh those lying under it. He calls the &#8220;dwellers under his
shadow&#8221;, all those who belong to the people; and compares the common state
of the people of Israel to a tree full of leaves, which extends its branches far
and wide, so that they who flee under its shadow are defended from the heat of
the sun. We now see the design of this metaphor, and what the Prophet means by
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ishibu</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall vivify themselves with
corn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, revive as corn. If we read the
word in the nominative case, the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caph,</i> is to be understood. The ablative case is more approved by some,
&#8220;They shall vivify themselves with corn.&#8221; But the former sense seems
more suitable; for, as I have said yesterday, the Prophet, as he handles a truth
difficult to be believed, does on this account accumulate similitudes, such as
serve for confirmation. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall revive as
corn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they shall increase. As
from one grain, we know, many stalks proceed; so also, since the prophet speaks
of the increase of the people after their restoration to God&#8217;s favour, he
says that they would grow like corn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall germinate as the
vine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This similitude strengthens what I
have just said, that the people are compared both to trees and to corn, and also
to vines. And what is said of dwellers ought not to appear strange, for he
wished more fully to express how this common benefit would come, that is, to
every one. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
odour</i></font><font face="Palatino"> shall be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the wine of
Libanus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, when they shall
germinate as the vine, they shall not produce common or sour wine, but the
sweetest, such as is made on Mount Libanus, and which is of the best odour. But
the Prophet means no other thing than that the Israelites will be happy, and
that their condition will be prosperous and joyful, when they shall be converted
from their superstitions and other vices, and shall wholly surrender themselves
to be governed by God. This is the meaning. Let us now proceed

idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> There is indeed a verb
understood, &#8216;Ephraim &#8220;shall say&#8221;, What have I to do with
idols?&#8217; But still it is evident enough what the Prophet means. There is
then in these words, as I have said, a sincere confession; for the ten tribes
express their detestation of their folly, that they had alienated themselves
from the true God, and became entangled in false and abominable superstitions:
hence they say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What have we to
do with idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>and when they add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>any
more,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> they confess that their former life had
been corrupt and vicious: at the same time they announce their own repentance,
when they say that they would have nothing more to do with fictitious
gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason follows, because God will hear and look on
Israel, so as to become to him a <i>shady tree.</i> Some so explain this, as
though God promised to be propitious to Israel after they had manifested their
repentance. But they pervert the sense of the Prophet; for, on the contrary, he
says, that after the Israelites shall perceive, and find even by the effect,
that God is propitious to them, they will then say, &#8220;How foolish and mad
we were, while we followed idols? It is now then time that our souls should
recumb on God.&#8221; Why? &#8220;Because we see that there is nothing better
for us than to live under his safeguard and protection; for he hears us, he
regards us, he is to us like a shady tree, so that he protects us under his
shadow.&#8221; We now perceive how these two clauses are connected together; for
God shows the reason why Ephraim will renounce his idols because he will
perceive that he was miserably deceived as long as he wandered after his idols.
How will he perceive this? Because he will see that he is now favoured by the
Lord, and that he was before destitute of his help. When God then shall give
such a proof to his people, he will at the same time produce this effect, that
they will cast away all false confidences, and confess that they were miserable
and wretched while they were attached to idols. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have heard and favoured
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> What is then later in the words of
the Prophet goes before; it precedes in order of things this clause, Ephraim
shall say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What have I to do with
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be as a shady
fir-tree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and adding at the same time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From me is thy fruit
found</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> the two similitudes seem not to
accord; for, as it is well known, the fir-tree bears no fruit. Why then is fruit
mentioned? The answer is that these two similitudes are not connected. For when
God compares himself to a fir-tree, he speaks only of protection: and we know
that when one seeks a cooling shade, he may find it under a fir-tree; besides,
it is always green, as we all know, when leaves fall from other trees; and
further, its height and thickness afford a good shadow. The reason, then, why
God promises to be like a fir-tree to his people is this, because all who will
fly under his shadow shall be preserved from the heat. But the meaning of the
second similitude, that God would supply his people with fruit, is different.
The Prophet had said before that the Israelites would be like a tree, which
fixes its roots deep in the ground. He now transfers the name of a tree to God.
Both these things are true; for when God makes us fruitful we are branches set
in the best vine; and it is also true, that the whole fruit we have is from him;
for all vigour would fail us, except God were to supply us with moisture, and
even life itself. We now then see that there is no inconsistency in the words of
the Prophet, as the object is different<i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then<i> is
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy fruit
found</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though God said, that the
Israelites, if wise, would be content with his favour; for they who seek support
from him will be satisfied; because they will find from him fruit sufficiently
rich and abundant. We now then understand what is meant. But it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, I have no doubt, very often inculcated
what he here says, and frequently recalled it to mind, for we know that he had a
constant struggle with extreme obstinacy. It was not only for one day that he
found the people hard and perverse, but through the whole course of his
preaching. Since then the Israelites continued, either openly to despise the
Prophet&#8217;s teaching, or at least to regard as fables what they heard from
his mouth, or to chide him in words, and even to threaten him, when he treated
them with severity and when the Prophet saw that the wickedness of the people
was irreclaimable, he, being armed with confidence, no doubt went forth very
often among them, and said &#8220;Ye think that you shall be unpunished, while
ye make a mock of what I teach; ye shall surely find at last that the ways of
the Lord are right.&#8221; And I have already reminded you, that the Prophets,
after having harangued the people at large and in many words, reduced at last
into brief heads what they had taught; for it is not probable, that since Hosea
had so long discharged the office of a teacher, he had spoken only these few
things, which might have been gone through in three hours. This is absurd. But
when he had diligently attended to the office deputed to him, he afterwards, as
I have said, collected together these few chapters, that the remembrance of his
teaching might be perpetuated. What he was constrained then often to repeat, he
now lays down at the end of his book, that it might be as it were a complete
sealing up of his teaching.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is
wise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he will understand these
things? who is intelligent, and he will know
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>This interrogatory mode is
expressive; for Hosea was amazed at the fewness of those who yielded themselves
to be taught by God. The Israelites no doubt, arrogated to themselves great
wisdom, as ungodly men are wont to do. For they seem to themselves to be then
especially acute, when they laugh at every thing like piety, when they treat
God&#8217;s name with scorn, and indulge themselves, as we see at this day, in
their own impiety. And this diabolical rage lays hold on many, because they
think that they would be very simple and stupid, were they to embrace any thing
the Scripture contains. &#8220;O! what is faith but foolish credulity?&#8221;
This is the thought that comes to their minds. There are also filthy dogs, who
hesitate not to vomit forth such a reproach as this, &#8220;Only believe! But
what is this thy believing, but wilfully to give up all judgement and all
choice, and to allow thyself to be like mute cattle driven here and there? If
then thou art wise, believe nothing.&#8221; Thus godless men speak; and hence,
as I have said, they pride themselves on their own acuteness, when they can
shake off every fear of God and all regard for divine truth. There were many
such, we may easily believe, in the time of the Prophet. Since then the whole
land was filled with dreadful contempt of God, and yet men commonly thought
themselves wise, nay, imagined in their deep thoughts, as Isaiah says, that they
could deceive God, he now asks,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is wise, and he will
understand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> As though he said, &#8220;I
indeed see, that if I believe you, ye are all wise; for, imitating the giants,
ye dare to rise up against God, and ye think yourselves ingenious when ye elude
every truth, when ye proudly tread religion under foot; in this way ye are all
wise. But at the same time, if there be any grain of wisdom in you, you must
surely acknowledge me to be sent by God, and that what I declare is not the
invention of men, but the word of the living God.&#8221; We now then see what
force there is in this question, when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is wise, and he will
understand these things? Who is intelligent, and he will know
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We at the same time see that the Prophet here
condemns all the wisdom of men, and as it were thunders from heaven against the
pride of those who thus presumptuously mock God; for how much soever they
imagined themselves to be pre-eminent, he intimates that they were both blind
and stupid and mad.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
wise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> he says. But at the same time, he
shows that the true wisdom of men is to obey God and to embrace his word; as it
is said in another place, that wisdom and the beginning of wisdom is the fear of
God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
1:7.) Whosoever then wishes to be truly wise, he must begin with the fear of God
and with reverence to his word; for where there is no religion, men cannot
certainly understand any thing aright. Let us suppose men endued, not only with
great clearness of mind, but also with the knowledge of all the sciences; let
them be philosophers, let them be physicians, let them be lawyers, let nothing
be wanting to them, except that they have no true knowledge of eternal life,
would it not be better for them to be mere cattle than to be thus wise, to
exercise their minds for a short time on fading things, and to know that all
their highly valued treasure shall perish with their life? Surely to be thus
wise is far more wretched than if men were wholly void of understanding. Justly
then does the Prophet intimate here that those were not only foolish, but also
mad, and wholly destitute of all understanding, who regarded not celestial
truth, and were deaf to the Prophets, and discerned not when God spake, nor
understood the power of his word. All then who are not thus wise, the Prophet
justly says, are utterly void of all prudence and judgement: he therefore
repeats the same thing, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is
wise, and he will understand these things? Who is intelligent, and he will know
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> that is, &#8220;If any excels
others, he ought surely to show in this particular his wisdom, and if any one is
endued with common understanding, he ought to know what this doctrine means, in
which the image and glory of God shine forth brightly. All then who know and
understand nothing in this respect are no doubt altogether
foolish.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For right are the ways of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He alleges this truth in
opposition to the profane rashness of men, who haughtily reject God, and dare to
despise his word. <i>Right,</i> he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, are the ways of the
Lord:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and by saying that they are right, he no
doubt glances at the abominable blasphemies which the ungodly have recourse to,
when they wish to render the word of God not only odious and contemptible, but
also absurd, so as not to deserve any respect. Thus we see at this day, that
godless men not only in words reject both the Law and the Prophets, but also
search out pretences, that they may appear to be doing right in destroying all
faith in the oracles of God. For instance, they seek out every sort of
contradiction in Scripture, every thing not well received, every thing different
from the common opinion, &#8212; all these absurdities, as they call them, they
collect together, and then they draw this conclusion, that all those are fools,
who submit to any religion, since the word of God, as they say, contains so many
absurd things. This raving madness prevailed then no doubt in the world: and the
Prophet, by saying that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>right are
the ways of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, means, that how much
soever the ungodly may clamour, or murmur, or taunt, nothing is yet done by the
Lord but what is right, and free from every blame and defect. However much then
the ungodly may vomit forth slanders against the word of God, it is the same as
if they threw dust into the air to darken the light of the sun; just so much
they effect, he seems to say, by their audacity: for perfect rectitude will ever
be found</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in the ways of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> his word will ever be found free
from every stain or defect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the just shall walk in them,
but in them shall the ungodly stumble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
By saying that the just shall walk in them, he confirms the last sentence by
experience, for the just really find<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the ways of the Lord to be
right</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We ought also to be furnished
with this assurance, if we would boldly repel all the impious calumnies, which
are usually heaped together by profane men against the word of God: for if we
know not what it is to walk in the ways of the Lord, we shall surely, as soon as
any thing is alleged against them, be suspended in doubt, or be wholly upset;
for we see that many, not deeply rooted in the word of God, instantly quail, as
soon as any thing is said against it, because they know not what it is to walk
in the ways of the Lord; but they who walk in the Lord&#8217;s ways courageously
fight against all the temptations of the world; they carry on the context that
they may attain celestial life; they feel assured that though now miserable for
a time, they shall yet be blessed, for they have embraced the grace of God in
Christ; they are sustained too by their own conscience, so that they can look
down on all the reproaches and slanders of the world, and proceed onward in
their course. They then who thus walk in the ways of the Lord are unconquerable;
yea, were the whole world to oppose them, and were the ungodly with their
profane words to infect the whole atmosphere, the godly would still pursue their
course until they reached the end.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the ways of Jehovah are
therefore right, the just shall walk in them; but in them shall the ungodly
stumble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or fall; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cashel,</i> means both, but I prefer rendering it &#8220;stumble,&#8221; as
it seems more suitable to the design of the Prophet. The just then find a plain
and an even way in the word of the Lord, and nothing stands in their path to
obstruct their course, and by daily advances they attain that to which the Lord
calls them, even their celestial inheritance. The just shall thus walk in the
Lord&#8217;s ways, because the Lord will lead them, as it were, by his hand;
faith will be to them for hundred eyes, and also for wings: and hope, at the
same time, sustains them; for they are armed with promises and encouragements;
they have also stimulants, whenever the Lord earnestly exhorts them; they have,
besides, in his threatenings, such terrors as keep them awake. Thus then the
faithful find in the word of the Lord the best ways, and they follow them. But
what of the ungodly? They imagine all doubts, even the least, to be mountains:
for as soon as they meet with any thing intricate or obscure, they are
confounded, and says &#8220;I would gladly seek to know the Holy Scriptures but
I meet with so many difficulties.&#8221; Hence when a doubt is suggested, they
regard it as a mountain; nay, they purposely pretend doubts, that they may have
some excuse, when they wish to evade the truth, and turn aside that they may not
follow the Lord. <i>The ungodly,</i> then,<i> stumble</i> in the ways of
Jehovah. But this ought to be read adversatively, &#8220;Though the ungodly
stumble, yet the just shall always walk in the ways of Jehovah;&#8221; which
means, that there is no reason why the ungodly should stop or retard us by their
continual stumbling, and by exclaiming that the word of God is full of what
gives offence; for we shall find in it an even way, only let us ascribe to God
this glory, that he is just, and that his ways are right. This is the meaning of
the sentence.</font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa1a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
GUSTAVUS was the KING of SWEDEN, the inhabitants of which were then called Goths
and Vandals. He was the first king of that name in Sweden, and had the surname
of VASA. He was born in 1490, and was a descendant of the royal family of
Sweden. He delivered the kingdom from the attempted usurpation of Christian II
of Denmark, and was made king in 1523, abolished Popery, and introduced
Lutheranism in 1530, and died, at the age of seventy, in 1560, the year
following the date of this Epistle. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa2a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  He was
at this time engaged in writing his Comments on The Psalms; and they were
published the following July. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Much
difference has prevailed on this subject,. That is it was a <i>real</i>
transaction, has been the opinion of not a few. <i>Poole</i> quotes <i>Basil,
Augustine, Jerome,</i> and <i>Theodoret</i>, as entertaining this view. Bishop
<i>Horsley</i> agrees with them; but he makes this wise remark, &#8220; This is
in truth a question of little importance to the interpretation of the prophecy,
for the act was equally emblematical, whether it was real or visionary only; and
the significance of the emblem, whether the act were done in reality or in
vision, will be the same.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Henry</i> seems to lean to the opinion that it was
a parable; and <i>Scott</i>, that it was a real transaction. The notion of a
parable is attended with the least difficulty, and corresponds with the mode of
teaching often adopted both in the Old and New Testament. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This does
not follow; for, as Bishop <i>Horsley </i>justly observes, &#8220;the children
of wantonness&#8221; were those previously begotten. The Prophet was to take a
woman who was a harlot, <i>together</i> with her spurious children. This is he
evident message of the passage. &#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
explanation given of this word by <i>Horsley</i> does not in the least
correspond with the context, or with the reason afterwards assigned for it. He
interprets in &#8220;the seed of God,&#8221; meaning the servants of God,
according to the supposed etymology of the word: but the first son of Hosea was
called Jezreel, as stated expressly on account of what was to take place in the
city, or in the valley of Jezreel. And to say that as the word is taken in its
etymological sense in chapter 2 verse 22, it ought to be so taken here, is no
valid reason. When a word, as in this case, has two meanings, it is the context
that must be our guide, and not the sense of it in another chapter.
&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though
Newcome and others agree with Calvin in this sense, yet I still believe that the
true rendering is that which is substantially given in the margin of our
version. The verb here used, when followed by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
does not mean to take away, but to pardon, to forgive, and the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
is sometimes rendered, that, so that, <i>ut.</i> Then the two lines may be thus
translated: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;I will no
more show mercy to the house of
Israel,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>That by
pardoning I should pardon them.&#8221;</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The main drift of the passage is still the same with
what is assigned to it by Calvin. The version of Bishop <i>Horsley </i>favors
what I have offered: he renders the last line thus: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;Insomuch as
to be perpetually forgiving them.&#8221;</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
Mediis-media means. We use medium, but not media; and yet we have no word as a
substitute. &#8220;Intervenients,&#8221; perhaps, is the most intelligible word
to the English reader. &#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  If this
were rendered &#8216;though,&#8217; as it is by some, the meaning would be more
evident; that is, they shall ascend from the land, notwithstanding the greatness
of the slaughter of Jezreel, when they should be led captive.
&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  As there
is no different reading that favors this view of the text, it is difficult to
know how Calvin came to give this paraphrase, as it is the reverse of the
meaning of the passage. It is literally rendered in our version, &#8220;Our
mouth is opened unto you.&#8221; Though the text is not correctly given, yet
what is here taught is true and important. &#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Fabled
giants with one eye. These referred to had an eye to see the absurdities of
Popery; but they had no eye to see the beauty and glory of the Gospel.
&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  The
original is &#8216;he&#8217; and &#8216;my,&#8217; as in our version, but this
is to disregard the Hebrew idiom. Pronouns in that language referring to
&#8216;people,&#8217; a noun in the singular number, are also put in the
singular number, but no so in our language. &#8216;They&#8217; and
&#8216;our&#8217; ought doubtless to be used here.
&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  A
Hebrew measure, containing 30 bushels, the load of a camel.
&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Amidst
the variety of expositions given of this clause, the one adopted by Calvin, and
substantially in our own version, is evidently the best. <i>Newcome&#8217;s</i>
version seems wide of the mark. <i>Horsley&#8217;s</i> rendering agrees
materially with our own: &#8212; &#8216;For thy people are exactly like thise
who will contend with the priest.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  These
verbs are in the future tense; but the future in Hebrew is often used, as Calvin
says in another place, to express a continued act, or an habitual
practice.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  This
choice can hardly be conceded. &#8216;People,&#8217; in Hebrew, is in the
singular number, and the pronouns referring to people are commonly put in the
same number; but not so in our language. &#8216;His&#8217; here evidently
belongs to the people, and not to the priests, and ought to be rendered

write onone, <i>Command me, Lord</i>; on the other, <i>Forbid me, Lord</i>; and
the third is left a <i>blank.</i> These are put in a bag, and one is drawn. If

49:25. The former of these two verses alludes to this circumstance. Ephraim is
compared to a bird, soon fledged and flying away from the nest: and then it is
added, that the glory of that people was their rapid increase. It is a
declaration, not a denunciation, for this follows in the next verse. Besides, a
denunciation comports not with what is said in that verse, nor with the contents
of the fourteenth. If their glory had departed from the birth, etc., how was it
that the threatening on the next verse is, that their children should not grow
up to be men, and that the Prophet should pray God to give them, in verse 14, an
abortive womb, etc.? &#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

only to suppose &#8216;tree&#8217; understood seems not necessary: for the word

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  There
is here a departure from the usual arrangement: the text is interwoven with the
exposition, and not given apart. But to preserve uniformity, the text is here
given by itself, collected from the comment. The verse may be thus literally

<div><font face="Palatino">Though the doctrine of Calvin is correct, yet his
exposition of the last two lines seems too refined. Judgment often means the
administration of justice. Instead of being right and for the general good, as
it ought to have been, it was like some noxious weed growing naturally and
abundantly in the furrows of the field. As the word is literally
&#8216;head,&#8217; it seems to designate a weed or a herb most natural to the
soil, the <i>chief</i> herb, which commonly grows abundantly. So that judgment,
or administration of justice, was not like the good seed sown in a prepared
ground, but like the noxious weed, natural to the soil, when first turned up by
the plough. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

of something huge or great: as

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  The
word occurs no where in Scripture but here. <i>Gesenius</i> in his Lexicon gives
it as a quadriliteral verb, and says that it means &#8220;to teach to go,&#8221;
or, &#8220;to guide the steps.&#8221; But <i>Parkhurst</i> is of the same
opinion with <i>Calvin</i>, and renders it &#8220;a footing,&#8221; or,
&#8220;going on foot,&#8221; and translates this passage thus: &#8212;
&#8220;And as for me, my footing was for Ephraim;&#8221; <i>q.d.</i>, &#8220; I
footed after him, I attended him pn foot, as a nurse does a child.&#8221;

&#8220;I have footed,&#8221; or, &#8220;taught Ephraim how to foot or

<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
&#8220;It is very probably that the words refer to the custom of raising the

<i>Newcome.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  There
is another exposition, which Calvin probably did not think it worth his while to
mention. It is an old one of Jerome, revived by Castallio, adopted by Lowth and
Newcome, and highly praised by Horsley: and yet it seems to have neither point
nor meaning, and certainly comports not with this place. The proposed rendering
is this&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;Although I
am no frequenter of cities.&#8221;</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God is not a frequenter of cities!! How odd and
meaningless is this when compared with the view given by Calvin of the passage?
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is another explanation approved of by Dathe,
which, as to the meaning, agrees with that of Calvin. He takes
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ry[</font><font face="Palatino">,
rendered &#8220;city,&#8221; to mean &#8220;anger,&#8221; and then the version
would be, &#8220;I will not come in anger.&#8221; The Septuagint is, literally,
&#8220;I will not come into the city.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
Praeventum fuisse. This is a most difficult word to render correctly and
intelligibly. To prevent, in the sense of going before, is not current. The
meaning here is, that they did not own that in the case of Jacob free mercy was
previous to any good on his part. &#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  This is
an instance in which critics, from not understanding the drift of a passage,
have suggested emendations, which seem plausible, and yet take away an important
meaning, as we shall see in the present case, from Calvin&#8217;s explanation.
<i>Horsley</i> takes the same view with Calvin, though <i>Newcome</i> does not.
&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Calvin
is not correct as to the meaning of this word. There is no instance in which it
means &#8220;high places;&#8221; in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:21, to which reference is made, it means obelisks or pillars set up as
way-marks. There is no doubt but that the word signifies here what is expressed
in our version. <i>Gesenius</i> says, that it is to be taken here adverbially,
and with him <i>Newcome</i> and most critics agree. <i>Horsley</i> renders the
clause thus, &#8212; &#8220;Ephraim has given bitterest
provocation.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
<i>Horsley</i> appears to have adopted Calvin&#8217;s view of this sentence. His
version is this, &#8212; &#8220;When Ephraim spake, there was
dread.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa59</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caph</i>, before the word, &#8220;pastures.&#8221; But to connect the first
two words in this verse with the last verse, as Bishop <i>Horsley</i> does, is
certainly not right; for the two different times here evidently referred to are
thereby confounded. Though <i>Calvin</i> in this, as in some other instances,
does not settle the grammatical construction, he yet sets forth the real meaning
of the passage. God says, that he knew the people of Israel, both in the desert
and in &#8220;their pastures;&#8221; that is, in the fertile land of Canaan; and
then he states the effect which their pastures had upon them. What favors the
substitution of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">
is, that the former is used before &#8220;desert,&#8221; and &#8220;the land of
droughts,&#8221; in the preceding verse. The verb &#8220;to know&#8221; is to be
understood at the beginning of this verse. The two verses, 5 and 6, may be thus
rendered: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><i>5<b>. I knew thee in
the desert,</b></i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>In the

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Some
render this &#8220;the lioness,&#8221; but it is more consonant with this
passage to render it &#8220;lion,&#8221; meaning, as its name,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aybl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>labia,</i> is taken to signify, a cruel old lion. The word in the former
verse is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shechel</i>, which means a fierce lion. So that the Lord compares himself to
the most devouring and the fiercest species of the lion tribe. The Hebrews have
other names for lions, designative of their peculiar nature of their age.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rypk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caphir</i>, is a young lion;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arie</i>, a grown up and a rapacious lion,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;j&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shichets</i>, a lion of middle age and fierce; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;yl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lice</i>, an old lion. With respect to the two mentioned here, there is a
gradation, according to the sense of the passage. The first, in verse 7, is a
lion in middle age, bold and ferocious; but the second, in verse 8, is one still
older, but retaining his vigor, and still more ferocious and devouring. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTa62</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Bishop
Horsley&#8217;s rendering of this verse which was that of <i>Rivet</i>, is the
following &#8212; &#8220;It is thy destruction, O Israel, that upon me (alone it
lies) to help thee.&#8221; He adds in a note &#8212; &#8220;Thy great privilege,
to have God alone for thy defense, becomes the occasion of thy destruction. In
my wrath I withdrew my special aid; and since forsaken by me, thou hast no other
helper, thy ruin must ensue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this instance our version, as to the first clause,
seems preferable to that offered by Calvin. The verb is not in the third person,
but the second. Its final radica; letter is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tau</i>, and the same letter is characteristic of the second person, and it
is not here doubled; another instance of which we find in

&#8216;destroyed, thy wisdom.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is reason to doubt the correctness of our
version, as well as that of Calvin, as to the second clause. Literally it is,
&#8220;Though in me for thy help,&#8221; which seems to mean this, &#8220;Though
it was in my power to help thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if the first word of the verse be taken as a
substantive, as it is by many critics, then the first clause may be considered
as having reference to the preceding verses. The meaning then would be, that
such would be Israel&#8217;s destruction, though at the same time there was for
him help in God, if he had sought it: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Such thy

into
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hya</font><font face="Palatino">,
the authority is very small, only one MS., and another doubtful: and there is no
need, and indeed the sense is thereby injured. In the Geneva Bible it is
rendered, &#8216;I am.&#8217; The future tense in Hebrew includes often the
present as well as what is future. To give it its full meaning, it must be thus
rendered, &#8216;I am and will be,&#8217; that is, thy help; for he had before
said, that there had been help for them in him. &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">This passage presents an instance of that useless
kind of criticism, by which an attempt has been made to introduce a verbal
agreement between sentences in the Old Testament and the supposed quotations of
them in the New. The apostles had more regard to the meaning than to
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Horsley</i> has a long note on the two words

predition or destruction, and

excision or extirpation; and he renders the first by &#8220;pestilence,&#8221;
and the second by &#8220;burning plague.&#8221; That the two words are so used
he proves satisfactorily. But when applied to death and the grave, they of
course can retain only their reading idea of something destructive, extirpating,
and ruinous. Words in all languages have their primary and secondary meanings:
and to retain the primary meaning in a translation would often be improper.

sense, that the opinion cannot be entertained. It is doubtless the confession of
Ephraim, as most commentators regard it. <i>Newcome&#8217;s</i> emendation,
