<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Deuteronomy 24:8,
9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> Take heed in the plague of
leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests
the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, <i>so </i>ye shall observe to
do.	<b>8.</b> Observa in plaga leprae, ad observandum diligenter et faciendum
secundum omnia quae docuerint vos sacerdotes Levitae: sicuti praecepi eis, ita
observabitis ad faciendum.	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b> Remember
what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth
out of Egypt.	<b>9.</b> Recordare quid fecerit Jehova Deus tuus Mariae in
itinere, quum egressi estis ex
Aegypto.	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take heed in the plague of
leprosy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I am aware how greatly interpreters
differ from each other and how variously they twist whatever Moses has written
about Leprosy. Some are too eagerly devoted to allegories; some think that God,
as a prudent Legislator, merely gave a commandment of a sanitary, nature, in
order that a contagious disease should not, spread among the people. This
notion, however, is very. poor, and almost unmeaning; and is briefly. refuted by
Moses himself, both where<i> </i>he<i> </i>recounts the history of Miriam's
leprosy, and also where he assigns the cause why lepers should be put out of the
camp, viz that they might not defile the camp in which God dwelt, whilst he
ranks them with those that have an issue, and that they are defiled by the dead.
Wherefore, I have thought it well, previous to attempting the full elucidation
of the matter, to adduce two passages, by way of preface, from whence the design
of God may more fully appear. When, in this passage from Deuteronomy, He
commands the people to "take heed" and "observe diligently" the plague of
leprosy, there can be no question but that He thus ratifies what He had before
set forth at greater length in Leviticus. And, first of all, He refers the
judgment of the matter to the priests, that what they pronounce should be firm
and unalterable; and secondly, He would have the priests, lest they should
pronounce rashly, and according to their own wishes, to follow simply what He
prescribed to them, so that they may only be the ministers, or heralds; whilst,
as to the sovereign authority, He alone should be the Judge. He confirms the law
which He imposes by a special example; because He had cast out Miriam, the
sister of Moses, for a time, lest her uncleanness during her leprosy should
defile the camp. For the view which some take, that He exhorts the people lest,
through sin, they should bring upon themselves the same evil as Miriam, is not
to the purpose. But that which I have stated makes excellent sense, viz., that
God's command, whereby He prohibited Miriam from entering the camp, was to have
the force and weight of a perpetual law; because He thus ordained what He would
always have done.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Numbers

<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Numbers
5:1-3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,	<b>1.</b> Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b> Command the children of
Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an
issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:	<b>2.</b> Praecipe filiis Israel ut
ejiciant e castris omnem leprosum, omnem seminifluum, et omnem immundum super
anima.	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> Both male and female shall ye
put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps,
in the midst whereof I dwell.	<b>3.</b> Tam masculum quam faeminam ejicietis:
extra castra ejicietis eos, ne contaminent castra sua, quia ego habito in medio
eorum.	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Command the children of Israel.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This passage clearly shews that God, in
desiring the lepers to be put out of the camp, was not acting as a physician by
any means, and merely consulting the health of the people: but that by this
external rite and ceremony He exercised them in the pursuit of purity; for, by
joining with the lepers those who had an issue,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f2
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and who were defiled by the dead, He
instructs the people simply to keep away from all uncleanness. The reason, which
follows, confirms this, &#8212; "that they defile not their camps, in the midst
whereof He dwells." It is just as if He had said, that all the habitations of
His elect people were parts of His sanctuary, which it was a shame to defile
with any pollution. For we know what license men give themselves in corrupting
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the service of God, by mixing, as the
proverb says, sacred things with profane. Thus we see that the very worst of men
boast themselves to be anything but the least zealous of His worshipers, and
spare not to lift up polluted hands, although God so sternly repudiates them. It
was, then, profitable that the ancient people should be reminded by this visible
proof, that all those who are defiled cannot duly serve God, but that they
rather pollute. with their filthiness what is otherwise holy, and thus grossly
abuse religious exercises; and again, that they ought not tobe tolerated in the
holy congregation, lest their infection should spread to others. Let us now
briefly examine Leviticus 13.</font><br></div>

the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of
his flesh <i>like </i>the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron

plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <i>be </i>deeper than the skin

and pronounce him unclean.	<b>3.</b> Tune videbit sacerdos plagam in cute
carnis: quod si pilus in plaga versus fuerit in albedinem, et superficies plagae
profundior fuerit cute carnis ejus, plaga leprae est, et postquam viderit eum
sacerdos judicabit illum contaminatum, (<i>vel, </i>contaminabit

</i>white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <i>be </i>not deeper than the
skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up

him the seventh day: and, behold, <i>if </i>the plague in his sight be at a
stay, <i>and </i>the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut
him up seven days more.	<b>5.</b> Posted videbit eum sacerdos die septimo et si

his clothes, and be clean.	<b>6.</b> Tune inspiciet sacerdos ipsum die septimo

abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his
cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again.	<b>7.</b> Quod si crescendo

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When a man. shall have in the
skin. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Since every eruption was not the leprosy,
and did not render a man unclean, when God appoints the priests to be the
judges, He distinguishes by certain marks a common eruption from the leprosy;
and then subjoins the difference between the various kinds of leprosy. For the
disease was not always incurable; but, only when the blood was altogether
corrupted, so that the skin itself had become hardened by its corrosion, or
swollen by its diseased state. This, then, must be observed in the first place,
that the Greek and Latin word <i>lepra, </i>and the Hebrew
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t[rx</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>tzaragmath, </i>extend further than to the incurable disease, which medical
men call
<i>elephantiasis</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>both on account of the hardness of
the skin, and also its mottled color; not, however, that there is an entire
agreement between the thickness of the man's skin and that of an elephant, but
because this disease produces insensibility of the skin. This the Greeks call
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Yw&gt;ra</font><font face="Palatino">,
and if it be not a kind of leprosy, it is nearly allied to it. Thus we see that
there was a distinction between the <i>scab </i>and leprosy; just as now-a-days,
if it were necessary to judge respecting the itch, (which is commonly called the
disease of St.
Menanus,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f5
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">the marks must be observed, which distinguish
it from leprosy. But, as to the various kinds of leprosy, I confess that I am
not a physician, so as to discuss them accurately, and I purposely abstain from
close inquiry about them, because I am persuaded that the disease here treated
of affected the Israelites in an extraordinary manner, which we are now
unacquainted with; for what do we now know of a leprous house? Indeed it is
probable that, since heathen writers knew that the Jewish people suffered from
this disease, they laid hold of it as the ground of their falsehood, that all
the descendants of Abraham were infected with the itch, and were driven away
from Egypt, lest others should catch it from them. That
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> this was an ancient calumny appears from
Josephus, both in the ninth book of his Antiquities, and in his Treatise against
Apion; and it is repeated both by C. Tacitus and Justin. Yet I make no doubt
that the <i>Egyptians, </i>a very proud nation, in order to efface the memory of
their own disgrace, and of the vengeance inflicted upon them by God, invented
this lie, and thus grossly turned against this innocent people what had happened
to themselves, when they were smitten with boils and blains. But we shall see
hereafter, amongst God's curses, that He chastised His people with the same
plagues as He had inflicted on the Egyptians:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord will smite thee
with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab,"
etc.(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052827&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
28:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whence it may be probably inferred, that God avenged
the crimes of His ancient people with special judgments, which are now unknown
to us; just as afterwards new diseases arose, from which those in old times were
free. At any rate, Josephus, by clear and solid arguments, exposes the absurdity
of this accusation, that Moses was driven from Egypt with a crowd of exiles,
lest they should infect the country with their disease; because, if they had
been universally affected with this malady, he never would have imposed such
severe laws for separating the lepers from general
society.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God first commands that, whenever a
suspicion of leprosy arose, the man was to present himself to the priest; if any
symptom of leprosy appeared, He commands him to be shut up for a period of seven
days, until it should appear from the progress of the disease that it was
incurable leprosy. That God should have appointed the priests to be judges, and
those, too, only of the highest order, is a proof that His spiritual service was
rather regarded than mere bodily health. If any shall inquire whether leprosy is
not a contagious disease, and whether it be not therefore expedient that all who
were affected by it should be removed from intercourse with others, I admit,
indeed, that such is the case, but I deny that this was the main object in view.
For, in process of time, physicians would have been better able to decide by
their art and skill: whereas God enjoined this decision upon the priests alone,
and gave them the rule whereby they were to judge. Nor did He appoint the
Levites indiscriminately, but only the sons of Aaron, who were the highest
order, in order that the authority of the decision might be greater. It was,
then, by a gross error, or rather impudence, that the Papal priests
(<i>sacrifici</i>)<i> </i>assumed to themselves this jurisdiction. It was (they
say) the office of the chief priests under the Law to distinguish between the
kinds of leprosy; and, therefore, the same right is transferred to the bishops.
But they carry the mockery still further: the official
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">the bishop's representative, sits as the
legitimate judge; he calls in physicians and surgeons, from whose answers he
pronounces what he confesses he is ignorant of himself. Behold how cleverly they
accommodate a legal rite to our times! The mockery, however, is still more
disgusting, when in another sense they extend to the whole tribe of priests what
they have said to belong solely to the bishops; for, since the sin under which
all labor is a spiritual leprosy, they thence infer that all are excluded from
the congregation of the faithful until they shall have been purged and received
by absolution, which they hold to be the common office of all the priests. They
afterwards add, that judgment cannot be pronounced till the cause is heard, and
so conclude that confession is necessary. But, if they choose to have recourse
to subtleties, reason would rather conduct us to the opposite conclusion; for
God did not desire the priests to take cognizance of a hidden disease, but only
after the manifest symptoms had appeared: hence it will follow, that it is
preposterous to bring secret sins to judgment, and that wretched men are dragged
to their confession contrary to all law and justice. But, setting aside all
these absurdities, an analogy must be observed between us and God's ancient
people. He of old forbade the external uncleanness of the flesh to be tolerated
in His people. By Christ's coming, the typical. figure has ceased; but we are
taught that all uncleanness, whereby the purity of His services is defiled, is
not to be cherished, or borne with amongst us. And surely excommunication
answers to this ceremony; since by it the Church is purified, lest corruptions
should everywhere assail it, if wicked and guilty persons occupied a place in it
promiscuously with the good. The command of God that, whilst the disease was
obscure and questionable, the infected person should be shut up for seven days,
recommends moderation to us, lest any, who is still curable, should be condemned
before his time. In fact, this medium is to be observed, that the judge should
not be too remiss and hasty in pardoning, and still that he should temper
severity by justice; and especially that he should not be too precipitate in his
judgment. What we translate "shall pronounce him clean, or unclean," is in
Hebrew, "shall<i> </i>clean, or unclean him; " thus the dignity of the judgment
is more fully established, as though it had proceeded from God Himself; and
assuredly no medical skill could declare on the seventh day a leprosy to be
incurable, respecting which there was doubt so short a time before, unless God
should in some special manner discover the uncleanness, and guide the eyes of
the priests by His Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29<i>.</i></b><i>

which so often occurs in old age; but that loss of hair, which is the
consequence of leprosy, is distinguished from any other, the cause of which may
be some indisposition, and which yet does not pollute a man. But, inasmuch as
some kinds of baldness do not so greatly differ at first sight from leprosy,

unclean. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In the first part of the verse he says
that the leprous man must be counted unclean; but, in the latter part, he
commands the priest to give sentence against this uncleanness, lest it should be
carried into the congregation. On this ground he says, "<i>his </i>plague is
upon his head," which is as much as to say, that he is sentenced to just
ignominy, for Moses takes it for granted that God holds up to public infamy
whomsoever He smites with leprosy, and thence reminds them that they justly and
deservedly bear this punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The two
following verses contain the form in which the sentence is executed, viz., that
the man should wear a rent in his garment, which is to be the mark of his
disgrace, that he should walk with his head bare, and with his mouth covered,
(for this I take to be the meaning of the covering of his lip;) and besides
this, that he is to be the proclaimer of his own pollution; finally, that he
must dwell without the camp, as if banished from communication with men. Moses
here </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> refers to the existing state of the
people, as long as they sojourned in the desert; for after they began to inhabit
the land, the lepers were driven out of the towns and villages to dwell by
themselves. I know not whether the opinion of some is a sound one, that they
were enjoined to cover the mouth or lip, lest by the infection of their breath
they should injure others. My<i> </i>own view is rather, that because they were
civilly dead, they also bore the symbol of death in having the face covered
&#8212; as their separation deprived them of the ordinary life of men. Where we
translate "shall cry, Unclean, unclean," some, taking the verb,

f10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>indefinitely, construe it
passively, "shall be called,:" and I admit that in many passages it has the same
force as if it were in the plural number. But, because the repetition of the
word "unclean" is emphatic, it is probable that the word is not to be taken
simply for "to call," (<i>vocare</i>;) and therefore, I rather incline to the
opinion that, by the command of the Law, they warned all with their own mouth
not to approach them, lest any one should incautiously pollute himself by
touching them; although their uncleanness was perhaps proclaimed publicly, so
that all might mutually exhort each other to beware And Jeremiah seems to allude
to this passage, where, speaking

with rottenness, in order that everywhere our eyes should light on the
punishment of sin; but what the leprosy of garments may be, is unknown. But its
expiation under the Law admonished his ancient people that the must carefully
beware of even external uncleanness, so as to cleanse themselves "from all
filthiness of the flesh and spirit." It has appeared to me sufficient to touch
upon the sum of the matter, because it would be almost superfluous labor to
insist upon the words, although I should be unwilling to condemn the diligence

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This shall be the law of the
leper. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Moses now treats of the manner in which
those who were cured of leprosy were to be cleansed and restored. Thus far he
had shewn whom the priest was to admit into the holy congregation, and account
to be clean; he now prescribes the rite of expiation, whereby the people might
learn how greatly God abominates the uncleanness, which He commands to be
purified by a solemn propitiation; and also that he who is healed may
acknowledge that he is rescued from death by God's special blessing, and may in
future be more diligent in seeking to be pure. For there were two parts in the
sacrifice here demanded-purification and thanksgiving. But we must ever keep in
view the object which I have stated in the last chapter, that the Israelites
were instructed by this ceremony to serve God in chastity and purity, and to
keep far away from those defilements, whereby religion would be profaned. Since,
then, leprosy was a kind of pollution, God was unwilling that those who were
cured of it should be received into the holy
congregation,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> except after the offering of a sacrifice;
as if the priest reconciled them after excommunication. It will now be well to
discuss the points which are worthy of consideration. The office of cleansing is
imposed on the priest; yet he is at the same time forbidden to cleanse any
except those who were already pure and clean. In this, on the one hand, God
claims for Himself the honor of the cure, lest men should assume it; and also
establishes the discipline which He would have to reign in His Church. To make
the matter clearer, it belongs to God only to forgive sins; what, then, remains
to man, except to be the witness and herald of the grace which He confers? God's
minister can, therefore, absolve none whom God has not before absolved. In sum,
absolution is not in the power or will of man: the minister only sustains an
inferior part, to endorse God's judgment, or rather to proclaim God's sentence.
Hence that remarkable expression of Isaiah, "I<i>, </i>even I, am he that
blotteth out thy transgressions, <i>O</i> <i>Israel, and none but me.</i>"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:25.) In which sense, too, God everywhere promises by the prophets that the
people shall be clean, when He shall have cleansed them. Meanwhile, however,
this does not prevent those who are called to the office of teaching from
purging the uncleanness of the people in a certain peculiar way. For, since
faith alone purifies the heart, in so far as it receives the testimony which God
proffers by the mouth of man, the minister who testifies that we are reconciled
to God, is justly reckoned to take away our pollution. This expiation is still
in force, though the ceremony has long ceased to be in use. But, since the
spiritual healing, which we receive by faith, proceeds from the mere grace of
God, the ministry of man does not at all detract from His glory. Let us, then,
remember that these two things are perfectly consistent with each other, that
God is the sole author of our purity; and yet that the method, which He uses for
our justification, must not on that account be neglected. And this is properly
referred to discipline, that whosoever has been once cast out of the holy
congregation by public authority, must not be received again except upon
professing penitence and a new life. We must observe, too, that this
jurisdiction was given to the priests not only on the ground that they
represented Christ, but also in respect to the ministry, which we have in common
with them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the priest shall go
forth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the examination, which was more
fully treated of in the last chapter, without which it was not lawful to receive
him who had been once rejected. The priest's command, which is mentioned
immediately afterwards, I refer to the Levites, some one of whom probably
accompanied the priest to prepare the sacrifice, that thus the priests might
only discharge the principal duty. The sum of the rite respecting the two birds
tends to this, that the cleansing from leprosy was a kind of resurrection Two
birds were placed before their eyes; the liberty of one was purchased by the
blood of the other; because the former was not let go until it had been first
dipped in the blood and the water; and thus the matter of sprinkling was
prepared for the man's purification. The sevenfold repetition was intended to
impress more deeply on men's memories a continual meditation on God's grace; for
we know that by this number perfection is often expressed in Scripture. With the
same object, he who had been cured shaved his hair, and washed in water. Yet he
did not return home on the first day, but on the eighth. Meantime, on the
seventh day he shaved his beard, and his eyebrows, and all the hair of his head;
he washed himself and his garments, and then proceeded to the sacrifice. So
difficult is it to accustom men to a serious acknowledgment of the two points,
to hold their vice in detestation, and worthily to estimate the grace of God
whereby they are delivered.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on the eighth.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As infants on the eighth day after they were
cleansed from the uncleanness which they had brought from the womb, were grafted
into the Church, and made members of it; so now the eighth day is prescribed for
the restoration of those who, in the cure that they have received, are as it
were born again; for they are accounted dead whom the leprosy had banished from
the holy congregation. A sacrifice is therefore appointed which may renew the
circumcision that had been in some measure effaced. Now, the meaning of all the
things here mentioned is not clear to myself, and I would not have my readers
too curious respecting them. Some may be probably accounted for; the right ear,
the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot, were sprinkled
with the blood of the offering, because the leper was restored to the ordinary
habits and customs of life, so as to have freedom of walk and action, and free
conversational intercourse; for in the ear there is a mutual correspondence
between speaking and hearing. The head is anointed, or cleansed with the oil,
that nothing impure should remain in his whole body
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God spare the poor and lowly, and does
not compel them to offer the two lambs, lest they should be burdened beyond
their means; whence it appears, that sacrifices are not estimated according to
their intrinsic value, but according to the pious feeling which disposes each on
liberally to offer in proportion to what is given
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye be come into the land.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Another sort of leprosy is here treated of, as
to which we may not unreasonably rejoice that it is now unknown to us. But, as
God had honored that people with extraordinary privileges, so it was consistent
that their ingratitude should be punished by more severe penalties, if they
defiled the gifts in which they excelled. It is not to be wondered at,
therefore, that punishments were inflicted upon them, which it fills us with
surprise and horror to hear of. It was a sad sight to behold the leprosy
invading the human body; but there was something portentous to perceive it
affecting their houses also, and driving out the owners and their families; for
if they wittingly and voluntarily remained there, the contagion spread to
themselves and all their furniture. But, since God marked with public ignominy
those whose houses were struck with leprosy, He commands them to confess their
guilt, and not only when the evil had made much advance, but when any suspicion
of it had begun to exist. It appears, too, from the Law, that some were but
lightly chastised: for, if after the priest's inspection, in seven days the
plague did not increase on the scraped walls, the possessor returned to his
house. God punished others more severely, and it was necessary that the building
should be utterly destroyed, because the pollution was incurable. But, although
these were tokens of God's wrath, yet, inexpiating the uncleanness, He exercised
His people in the study of purity; for it was just as if He drove away from
approaching His sanctuary those who came from an unclean house. The sense, then,
was that. they should each of them diligently endeavor to keep their houses
pure, and chaste, and free from every stain. But if, through God's mercy, the
plague ceased, a sacrifice of thanksgiving was to be offered, as for the human
beings (who had been healed.) The next chapter, in which general pollutions and
their purifications are not treated of, but only one kind of pollution is
glanced at, which has reference to fleshly lust, would perhaps be suitably
introduced under the Seventh Commandment; but it will presently appear from the
context that it must be brought under this head.</font><br></div>

of contamination, for which a solemn purification is required. And, first, he

because every </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> indisposition arising from lust appears
here to be condemned; but, if we look more closely, we shall perceive that it is
a general law for the cultivation of purity, and which must <i>not</i> be
confined to chastity alone. For this flux, arising from disease and debility,
unless it be contracted from immoderate venery, has nothing in common with
venereal lust. Besides, what is immediately after added concerning the
menstruation of women, is connected with other forms of uncleanness and
defilement. The sum then is, that the seminal-flux is reckoned among the
pollutions which prevented the Israelites from entering the tabernacle, and from
the external service of God; and thence the rule must always be borne in mind,
that whatever proceeds from an unclean man is corrupt, and that no one can duly
offer either himself, or what he possesses, to God, except he who is pure and
perfect in soul and body. Thus Paul explains the end and object of this
ceremony, when he exhorts believers that, being received as God's peculiar
people, they should cleanse themselves</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"from all filthiness of
the flesh and
spirit."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 7:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Moses further declares, that uncleanness is
contracted, not only when the seed is emitted, but when it is retained; and that
not only is the man himself rendered unclean, but whatever he may have touched
&#8212; his bed, his seat, his saddle, his clothes; and that the contagion
extends to others also, if any should have lain on the same bed, or ridden on
the same saddle. Thus did God desire to impress them with horror, that they
might be more accustomed to fly from all impurity. Nor would the<i> </i>crime
have<i> </i>been detestable: in itself, had not spiritual purity been set forth
under this external exercise and symbol. Thus, too, in
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
24:3, 4), the truth of this figure is described:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Who shall ascend into
the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean
hands, and a pure heart."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore he who was conscious of no sin in the
seminal-flux, still must be reminded by this sign of the corruption of his
nature; and at the same time be an example to others, that all should diligently
take heed to themselves, because corruption cleaves<i> </i>to the whole human
race. In the ablution the remedy of the evil was proposed, since the mark of
ignominy induced them to repentance. It is expedient that whosoever is infected
with any stain should be brought to shame, so as to be displeased with himself;
but the acknowledgment of the evil would produce despair, unless the hope of
pardon were associated with it. Therefore, those to whom purification was
necessary, are always sent to water; and, whenever water is mentioned, the
passage in St. John should be brought to mind, that Christ came "by water and
blood," to purge and expiate all uncleanness.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:6.) Besides the water, a sacrifice of turtle doves, or two young pigeons
is added; and this has reference to the same thing; viz., that purification for
the unclean must be sought for elsewhere, which we have at length obtained by
the sacrifice of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And if a woman have an issue. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Women are now
spoken of who suffer under a twofold issue of blood; for with almost all it
occurs every month, (whence it is called <i>menses, </i>or
<i>menstruation,</i>)<i> </i>and some labor under a constant hemorrhage. He
declares both to be unclean; and, after menstruation, a certain period of
separation is appointed, during which the law prohibited their cohabitation with
men; but, if the blood flowed beyond the usual time, the time of purification is
postponed until it ceased. Whence it appears, that in every shameful thing the
Jews were reminded of their uncleanness, that thus they might be accustomed to
modesty and seek after purity. And this still more clearly appears at the end of
the chapter, where it is said, (v. 3l,) "Thus<i> </i>shall ye separate the
children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not &#8212; when they
defile my tabernacle." God, I say, briefly sets forth His intention that He
would drive away all profanation far from His people; because he desires
sincerity to prevail amongst his worshippers, and cannot bear his tabernacle to
be polluted by any stain.</font><br></div>

respecting those who are mutilated, and who are bastards, has a similar object;
lest the Church of God should be onctaminate by foul stains, and thus religion
should lose its honor. Moses rejects from the congregation of the faithful two
sorts of men, viz, eunuchs and bastards. But, before we treat of the subject
itself, the definition of the words is to be considered. The first question is,
that it is to enter into the congregation; the second, what it is to be wounded
in the stones; the third, who are the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrzmm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mamzerim</i>, which we have translated bastards, (<i>spurios</i>).Many
understand that both are rejected from the church, lest they should undertake
any public office in it; others, lest they should marry wives of the seed of
Abraham; because it would not be fair that women should be thrown away upon
bastards, (<i>Lat, mamzeris;</i>) and it would be absurd that those who were
created to multiply God's people, should marry impotent persons,
(<i>effoeminatis</i>). But both these opinions appear to me to be tame. For what
is afterwards added respecting certain foreign nations cannot be so taken, that
no government or dignity should be entrusted to them; besides, by "the
congregation of the Lord," the purity and holiness of religion is sufficiently
expressed. I do not doubt, then, but that Moses prohibits those who are defiled
by these two stains from communicating in the sacrifices. For although they were
circumcised as well as the rest of the chosen people, still God would have them
bear this mark of their disgrace, that they might be an example to others, and
that the people might be more diligent in preserving themselves from all
pollution. This, then, is to be concluded that the privilege which was peculiar
to the legitimate Israelites, was to be denied them of being participators and
associates </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the sacrifices. As to the wounded
testicles, the Jews dispute more curiously, in my opinion, that the subject
warrants, and after all miss the right meaning. For God intended nothing else
than to exclude from the congregation of His people, wherever holy assemblies
were held, those who were mutilated or defective in the genital organs; although
by <i>synecdoche,</i> He comprehends more than are specified. Finally, by
condemning this external bodily defect He commends the excellency of His people
that they may remember themselves to be His chosen property, not that they
should pride themselves upon it

correspond with such high nobility.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A bastard shall not

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rzmm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mamzer</i>, a bastard is signified, who is born of an uncertain father; but
they take it in different ways, For some extend it to all bastards who spring
from fornication, whilst others imagine that it refers to those only whose
origin is doubtful, and who are called <i>vulgo geniti</i>; viz, whose mothers,
in their base and common prostitution of themselves, have brought it about by
their gross licentiousness, that their children should be born from this
monstrous medley, as it were. This second opinion I approve of most. But, by
this symbol God would admonish the seed of Abraham how exalted was its dignity,
as being separate from the polluted heathen. Meanwhile, He would not altogether
exclude these unhappy persons from the hope of salvation, although, by no fault
of their own, they were unable to give the name of their father; but He only
humbled them by a temporal punishment, and desired that their example should be
profitable to others.</font><br></div>

pollution are specified, whereof the purification is required. God commands that
a red heifer should be slain, which had never been subjected<i> </i>to the yoke;
and that it should be burnt without the camp, together with its skin and dung;
that the ashes should be gathered by a man that was clean, and laid up without
the camp for the common use of the people. But, in order that the water, which
was mixed with these ashes, should have the power of reconciliation, God at the
same time commands that the blood should be sprinkled seven times before the
altar by the finger of the priest. The object of this ceremony was twofold: for
God would awaken the attention of the people to reflect more closely upon their
impurity; and, although they might be pure within, still would have them
carefully look around them, lest they should be polluted from without; and also
taught them that, as often as they were infected by any pollution, expiation was
to be sought for from elsewhere, viz., from sacrifice and sprinkling; and thus
admonish them that men inquire in vain in themselves for the remedies demanded
for their purification, because purity can only proceed from the sanctuary.
Those, who speculate subtilty on the details, advance some questionable matters.
I leave them, therefore, to the enjoyment of their conceits; let it suffice for
us to consider generally what God referred to in this ceremony, and what
advantage accrued from it to the people. By the red color, they suppose that sin
is signified. Meanwhile, lest they should run into a manifest contradiction,
they are obliged absurdly to interpret what follows, that He required a heifer
perfect and without blemish, as if it were said that there should be no
difference of color in her hair; whereas God demands the same thing as in the
other sacrifices, which were rejected as faulty if any mark of deformity existed
in them. And in this sense it is added that she should never have borne a yoke.
Therefore I make no doubt but that God enjoined that a pure heifer, neither
mutilated nor lame, should be chosen; and, that her perfectness might be more
apparent, as yet unbroken to the yoke. What, then, is the meaning of the red
color? First of all, I prefer confessing my ignorance to advancing anything
doubtful; but it may be conjectured that a common and ordinary color was rather
chosen, lest it should be too conspicuous, as it would have been, if either
white or black. But this should be deemed sure, that a perfect heifer, and one
free from every blemish, was to be offered, and one too, which had not been
broken to bear the yoke by the hands of men, that the purification might have
nothing of humanity about it.: But the command to offer her was given to the
whole people; because, in order that we may be partakers of ablution, it is
necessary that each of us should offer Christ to the Father. For, although He
only, and that but once, has offered Himself, still a daily offering of Him,
which is effected by faith and prayers, is enjoined to us, not such as

f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the Papists have invented, by whom in
their impiety and perverseness, the Lord's Supper has been mistakenly turned
into a sacrifice, because they imagined that Christ must be daily slain, in
order that His death might profit us. The offering, however, of faith and
prayers, of which I speak, is very different, and by it alone we apply to
ourselves the virtue and fruit of Christ's
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall give her unto
Eleazar. </i></font><font face="Palatino">A clear distinction is here made
between two offerings; for the people are not permitted to kill the heifer, but
this is the peculiar office of the priest. Thus the people offered vicariously
by the hand of the priest; and in this way also at present, although we set
Christ before God's face in order to propitiate Him, still it is necessary that
Christ Himself should interpose, and exercise the office of a priest. Again, the
heifer was to be taken outside the camp, as a sign that it was accursed, since
it was an atonement. On which account, too, the atoning victims, whose blood was
carried into the Holy of Holies, were burnt without the camp; the truth of which
figure was accomplished in Christ, who therefore suffered outside the gates of
the city, as the Apostle testifies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:11-12.) But, because this was a species of rejection, lest the heifer should
be less accounted of, or lest the Israelites should think her polluted by the
curse, God shews that her blood was sacred and of a sweet savor, by commanding
that it should be sprinkled seven times upon the altar, which might not be
profaned by anything unclean. The same thing is most clearly seen in Christ; for
although He was made a curse for us, and is called "sin<i>,</i>"<i> </i>because
by bearing our accursed sins upon the cross, He was our atoning victim, yet
nothing was thereby taken from His purity, so as to prevent His holiness from
being the sanctification of the whole world. For He offered Himself through the
Spirit, and by His own blood entered into the holy place, and His death is
elsewhere called by Paul, "a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor."

might be conjoined with that of the water, the cedar-wood, and hyssop, and
scarlet, thread, with which the sprinkling was wont to be made, were cast into
the fire; for, unless the Israelites had been admonished by this visible sign,
they would not have so clearly known that they were not only washed with the
water, but that by the offering of the sacrifice also their uncleanness was
removed. But it was not enough that the blood should be poured forth, unless, as
has been already seen, they were purified by its aspersion. But, for as much as
the scent of cedar-wood is precious, and in hyssop there is a cleansing
property, we gather from hence also that the victim was pure, although it bore
their sins together with the curse and expiation. Peter teaches us how we are

discrepancy in the facts, that the heifer was sacred to God, and pure, and still
that the priest was polluted by touching it; yet they accord very well with each
other. But that both the priest as well as the minister who made the burning,
were unclean until the evening, ought to have forcibly struck the people, and
taught them the more to abominate sin. And, since it was not permitted to any
but a man that was clean to gather the ashes, not that they should be laid
anywhere but in a clean place, it was manifested by this sign that there was no
impurity in the sacrifice itself, but that from an extraneous and adventitious
pollution; because it was destined to purge away uncleanness, it was accounted
in a certain sense unclean. Whence too the water, into which the ashes were
thrown, was called the water of separation, as well as the
expiation</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">.
f23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For this translation which I have given
is the right one; and others improperly render it "for waters of separation, and

regards this word, "<i>because </i>the heifer is burnt for sin." But since in
Hebrew the word,</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">
hafj</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>chateah</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">,
f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means not only wickedness or sin,
but also the sacrifice on which the curse is imposed; what Moses intended to
convey is better expressed by the word "<i>expiation.</i>"<i> </i>But the
expression "separation"<i> </i>has reference to the men, whose personal
uncleanness excluded them from the holy congregation. But the question arises,
why this ordinance is pronounced to be common to the strangers who sojourned in
the land of Israel, as well as to the natives; because it was by no means
reasonable that the uncircumcised should be purified. The reply is easy, that
such strangers are not adverted to as were altogether aliens from the people,
but those who, although born of heathen parentage, had embraced the Law. These
God equalizes with the children of Abraham in the sacrifices and other religious
services; for if their condition were different, the-church, into the body of
which they were ingrafted, would be rent
asunder.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that toucheth the dead
body. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now recites certain forms of pollution
in which the washing was necessary; all of them, however, come to the point,
that men are defiled by the touch of a corpse or, bones, or a grave. Nor is
there here any distinction between the body of a person who is slain, or of one
who has died in bed; whence it follows that death is here set forth as a mirror
of God's curse: And assuredly, if we consider its origin and cause, the
corruption of nature, whereby the image of God is defaced, presents itself in
every, dead man; for, unless we were altogether corrupt, we should not be born
to perish But God also taught His people by another mode of signifying it, that
uncleanness is contracted by our communication with the unfruitful works of
darkness. For the Apostle
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:1) calls them "dead works," either from their consequences, or because, as
faith is the life of the soul, so unbelief keeps it in death. Since, then, the
corpse the bones, the grave, designate whatever we bring from the womb, because,
until we are born again, and God quickens us by His Spirit and faith, we are
dead while we live; there is no question but that the children of Israel were
reminded, that in order to keep themselves pure before God, they must abstain
from all corruption; inasmuch as, if they were rendered unclean by their contact
with a dead man, they must immediately have recourse to ablution. In fine, the
ceremony had no other object than that they should serve God in pureness from
the sins of the flesh; and exercise themselves in constant thoughts of
repentance, whilst, if they fell from their purity, they should labor to obtain
reconciliation with God, by means of sacrifice and
ablution.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever toucheth the dead

punishment shews how very pleasing to God is purity. If any one bad forgotten to
sprinkle himself on the third or the seventh day, he might redeem his negligence
by a prolongation of the term, because he only postponed his purification to
another day; but it was a capital crime to enter the sanctuary in his
uncleanness, since thus holy and profane things would be mixed together, nay,
the altar would have been polluted as well as the whole service of God. But
indeed the act of touching a dead body was of slight importance, nor was it to
be deemed an atrocious crime; but here the external defilement is not regarded
in itself, as if God were wroth on account of a stain contracted by the
performance of a pious duty.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Rather must the object of the <i>ceremony
</i>be considered, for God designed by these rudiments to teach the Israelites,
like children, that if any one should pollute sacred things by his impurity, he
would by no means be tolerated in this audacity. In this then consisted the
religious import of the transaction, that the worship of God was too precious
for the Israelites to be permitted to contaminate it with impunity. Whence we
gather that the punishment was denounced as against sacrilege. In sum, it comes
to this, that God is not duly worshipped except with a sincere<i> </i>heart and
pure hands; and that if any pollution be contracted<i>, </i>there is need of
expiation before a free access<i> </i>is re-opened to holy things. But it must
be remarked as to the contact, that it was accounted the same thing, whether the
corpse lay in a field or a house; whilst, if any one died in a tent, men were
polluted by merely entering it, and likewise vessels without covers thus became
unclean.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>

unsuitable; except that we gather from the second clause, that reference is
rather made here to the contagion with which unclean persons infect either men
or garments, or other articles. For those who had touched a dead body, or bones,
or a grave, were not only unclean until the evening, but for seven entire days.
But it appears that this was added in conclusion, lest the Jews should murmur at
the severity of the punishment, as if God would inflict the penalty of death for
a trifling sin. In this way, then, Moses shews how great is the guilt incurred
by those who, being unclean, intrude into the sanctuary; because, as far as in
them lies, they pollute the holiness of God, and not without intolerable
impertinence. Hence appears to be taken the reproof of the Prophet, when he
reproaches the Jews with having done nothing but defile the worship of God with
their sacrifices; for he proposes this question to the priests, &#8212; "If one
bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread,
or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?" After they have
replied in the negative, he asks again, "If<i> </i>one that is unclean by a dead
body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?" and they answer, "It shall be
unclean." Whence the Prophet
infers:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"So<i> </i>is this people,

preservation of purity at home, and in time of peace, he now extends to times of
war also, so that they might keep themselves clean from all defilement even in
the midst of the clang of arms. We know how greatly laws are disregarded during
war, when all things are under the control of violence rather than reason; and
we know that much license is wont to be given to soldiers, which would be by no
means tolerated in peace. God would remedy this evil by requiring the Israelites
to aim at the same purity in war as in peace; for this is a special law which
forbids their being dissolute and unruly in war-time, as He has before condemned
all impurity in general, as if He had said, that under no pretext would they be
excusable, if they neglect the duty of cultivating habits of purity. For He does
not command them to be cautious in the army and in the camp, as if they might
sin with impunity when at home, but admonishes them that God would by no means
excuse them although they should allege the necessity of war. Much more would
the crime be aggravated, if they should pollute themselves in peace and when
their minds were calm. Whence we gather that it is vain to catch at empty
excuses for the violation of God's commands in any respect; for, however
difficult the performance of duty may be, still God never resigns His rights.
Now, if war, which seems to dispense with laws, does not excuse crime, much
greater, as I have said, shall their guilt be accounted, who in a tranquil
condition of life are licentiously carried away by
sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If there be among
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He enumerates two kinds of
pollution, whereby the Israelites may know what is meant by their keeping from
the "wicked<i> </i>thing." First, He pronounces to be unclean, and casts out of
the camp those who may have had a filthy dream, until they shall have washed
themselves in the evening. Secondly, He forbids them to defile the camp with
what passes from the bowels; and not only this, but, even when they have gone
outside the camp, He commands them to bury their excrement beneath the earth,
lest any filthiness should appear. Yet it is probable that, by <i>synecdoche,
</i>everything is referred to which rendered men unclean and polluted. But
Moses, speaking as to soldiers, considered it sufficient to tell them briefly,
that although they might be occupied with war, cleanliness must still be
attended to. By "what chanceth at night<i>,</i>"<i> </i>all are agreed in
understanding a flow of semen; from whence we infer how greatly impurity defiles
a man, since uncleanness is contracted even from foul dreams. As to the second
part, some desire to appear quick and clever by attacking Moses, because he has
introduced among the precepts of holiness, that none should relieve his bowels
in the camp. Forsooth, they say, the smell might offend the nostrils of God! But
their silly petulance is easily rebutted; for God would by such rudiments keep
His ancient people in the way of duty, lest liberty even in the most trifling
things should lead them onwards to audacity. If they had been permitted to
defile every part of the camp, the people would presently have been hardened
against filthiness of every sort. Thus they were held back by this rein, that
they might more earnestly apply their minds to spiritual integrity. They also
are<i> </i>mistaken who suppose that this was a sanitary precaution, lest the
smell should produce diseases, and be injurious to their bodily health. For
Moses plainly declares that he not only had regard to what was wholesome, or
even to what was decent in the eyes of men; but rather that he would accustom
the people to abhor uncleanness, and to keep themselves pure and unpolluted
&#8212; for he adds, that God presided in the camp, to protect them from the
power and assaults of their enemies; and that they should fear, lest, if they<i>
</i>should contaminate the camp, He would be offended with their filthiness and
forsake them. The sum is, that when they have need of God's assistance, and are
engaged in war against their enemies, the pursuit of holiness must not be
omitted or neglected even in the midst of arms.</font><br></div>

condemn strange medleys, I doubt not to be supplements of the First Commandment;
and the reason, which is subjoined in Deuteronomy, directs us to this, where God
declares that the produce of the seed and of the vineyard is polluted, if there
be divers mixtures. Whence it appears that nothing else is demanded but that
they should cultivate purity. The word indeed, which Moses uses, means to
"<i>sanctify,</i>"<i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>kadesh; </i>but, by <i>antiphrasis, </i>it is taken for to
"<i>contaminate.</i>"<i> </i>To the same effect is what follows, that they
should not plough with an ox and an ass together; for this diversity is
forbidden on no other account, but because men contract some defilement as soon
as they depart from simplicity. Yet, if any one thinks otherwise, I shall not
strongly contend with him. It might indeed be objected, that when God forbids
animals to be used promiscuously, so that those of different kinds should not be
mixed together, He has regard to chastity,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that, by forbidding the fields to be
sown with divers seeds, and garments to be woven of divers materials, He would
prevent frauds. But the more simple explanation is, that the people were thus
retained in purity, lest they should accustom themselves to corrupt habits, and
lest they should bring in strange rites from various quarters, or seek, with
depraved curiosity, for mixtures which might at length invade the worship of
God. For if animals of different species are joined together, the integrity of
nature is corrupted, and an adulterine offspring is produced, which degenerates
from the institution of God; but, if various kinds of seed should be mixed
together, or if a garment should be woven of linen and wool, there would be no
danger of deception or fraud in so manifest a matter. It is probable, therefore,
that the end which, as I have said, was proposed by God was, that, by
cultivating natural and simple habits all their life through, they should keep
themselves pure and uncorrupted from every strange vice. On this account
Scripture compares strange doctrines to leaven, since by their additions or
curtailings they corrupt the pure word of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:11.) And this was by no means a useless discipline; when, in trifles, and
almost things of nought, the rein was applied to them, so that they should not
decline from purity in the very least degree. It was a small matter to
interweave a thin thread with a thicker one, and perchance such a process would
have been profitable for their general advantage; in some fields, too, a better
crop is grown, if the seed is compounded of pure wheat, and some other sort of
grain (<i>siligine</i>)<i>, </i>as also the union of the horse and ass has been
approved of, since thus mules are produced. But God would not allow these things
amongst His ancient people, lest, sinking by degrees to greater license, they
should at length addict themselves to the practice<i> </i>and customs of the
heathen. He therefore uses this preface: "Ye<i> </i>shall keep my statutes,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;031919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when ye shall come.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">There seems to me no question but that the
circumcision of trees as well as of men appertains to the First Commandment, not
only that the Jews might see a symbol of their own adoption in the very trees,
but that they might learn that it was permitted to none but the children of God
to feed on their fruit; and also that whatsoever the earth produces is in a
manner profane, until it is purified. For surely by this ceremony was set forth
what Paul teaches, that all things are "sanctified by the word of God, and
prayer,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:5;) not that anything is in itself impure, but because the earth has
contracted pollution from the corruption of man, it is just, as regards us, that
the harmless fruits also should be accounted to be in uncircumcision. In sum,
God would raise up a wall whereby He might separate His people from the
Gentiles, and at the same time admonish them that a legitimate use of those
things which the earth produced could not be made by the sons of Adam, except by
special privilege. But the similitude of uncircumcision<i>, </i>until the year
appointed for their being circumcised, was a very appropriate one, that they
might acknowledge the fruits of their trees to be pure for them by the same
right whereby they were consecrated as God's peculiar people. But, lest the
three years' unproductiveness should press heavily upon them, he promises them
compensation from the future blessing of God; for, if they should abstain from
eating the unclean fruit, a larger produce was to be expected in
future.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall not round the corners.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It clearly appears that God had no other object
than by the interposition of this obstacle to sever His people from heathen
nations. For there is nothing to which men are more prone than to conform
themselves to the customs of others; and hence it arises, that they mutually
communicate each other's vices. Wherefore care was especially to be taken lest
the people of Israel should adopt foreign habits, and by this pliableness should
fall away from the true worship of God; from whence too the ordinary phrase has
arisen, that the word "common" should be used for "unclean." God then strictly
forbids them from declining to the habits of the Gentiles, and confounding the
distinction which He had Himself placed between them. There is no doubt but that
it was usual for the Gentiles, out of superstition, to cut marks
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f31
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">upon their faces, to trim the hair in certain
steps or circles, and in their mourning to lacerate their flesh, or to disfigure
it with marks. It is well known that the priests of Cybele
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> made gashes in their flesh with knives
and razors, and covered themselves all over with wounds, for the sake of shewing
their zeal. The same thing was also commonly practiced by others; inasmuch as
the world is easily deceived by external ceremonies. But though this were a
thing in itself indifferent, yet God would not allow His people to be at liberty
to practice it, that, like children, they might learn from these slight
rudiments, that they would not be acceptable with God, unless they were
altogether different from uncircumcised foreigners, and as far as possible from
following their examples; and especially that they should avoid all ceremonies
whereby their religion was testified. For experience teaches how greatly the
true worship of God is obscured by anything adscititious, and how easily foul
superstitions creep in, when the comments of men are tacked on to the word of
God. Doubtless that part, "Ye<i> </i>shall not make any cuttings in your flesh
for the dead," etc., might be expounded as a correction of immoderate grief;
because we know how intemperately men set themselves against God when they give
the reins to their sorrow; but since the object of the Gentiles was to pay what
was due to the dead, and to celebrate their funeral obsequies
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as a kind of propitiation, it is
probable, and more suitable, that by the whole context those preposterous
gestures are condemned, which were proofs of piety among the Gentiles, but which
would have been defilements to the people of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The same thing appears more clearly from
the passage in Deuteronomy, which next follows, wherein Moses condemns cutting
themselves, and making themselves bald for the dead in connection with each
other, as if they were one thing; and confirms the law by a general argument,
that they might withdraw themselves from every pollution as the children of God;
since they were chosen to be His peculiar people; as much as to say, that God's
grace would be altogether frustrated, if they did not differ at all from foreign
nations. As to his saying that they were chosen out of all the nations, it does
not a little illustrate the gratuitous mercy of God, wherewith He honored them
alone, by calling them to the hope of eternal salvation, and passing by the
Gentiles; for there was no nobility found in them, nor did they exceed others
either in number or in any other superiority, on account of which He should
prefer them to the whole world. But the design of Moses in magnifying the
extraordinary goodness of God, was that they might the more abhor that impure
cornmixture, which, by bringing them on a par with the Gentiles, degraded them
from this high honor.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall therefore put
difference. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I have no doubt but that this
sentence depends on the end of the foregoing verse; for although that verse
contains a reason to deter them from incest, of which he had been speaking,
still it refers also to the doctrine before us, and stands in the shape of
preface to it. In a word, it connects two things, for God here briefly declares
His will, not only with respect to unlawful and improper intercourse, but also
why He forbids His people to eat of unclean animals. Therefore He says, "I<i>
</i>am the Lord your God, which have separated you from <i>other </i>people."
Whence it follows, that for no other reason were they prohibited from eating
those animals, except that they thence may learn to take more diligent heed, and
to withdraw themselves far from all the pollutions of the Gentiles. He had
before recommended purity by various symbols, and now extends it even to the
very animals. And this reason must be carefully marked, that the distinction
between meats is propounded to them in order that they may study purity. For
there would be something unmeaning in what is here said, if we did not know that
this interdiction was imposed with this object, that they should not mix
themselves promiscuously with the Gentiles. Therefore it is again repeated, that
they were severed, that they might be God's inheritance; and hence it is
inferred, that holiness was to be cultivated by them, that they might conform
themselves to the example of their God. Now it cannot be questioned, that the
distinction of meats which is prescribed, is a supplement to the First
Commandment, wherein the rule for worshipping God duly and purely is laid down;
and thus religion is rescued from all admixtures of
superstition.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the beasts which ye
shall eat. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The holy fathers, before the birth
of Moses, knew what animals were unclean; of which fact Noah afforded a manifest
proof, when, by God's command, he took into the ark seven pairs of the clean
animals, and offered of them his sacrifice of thanksgiving to God. Certainly he
could not have obeyed the command of God, unless he had either been taught by
secret inspiration, or unless this tradition had descended to him from his
forefathers. But there is nothing absurd in the notion that God, desiring to
confirm the traditional distinction, appointed certain marks of difference
whereby its observation might be more scrupulously attended to, and lest any
transgression of it should creep in through ignorance. For God also consecrated
the Sabbath to Himself from the creation of the world, and desired it to be
observed by the people before the promulgation of the Law; and yet afterwards
the peculiar holiness of the day was more distinctly expressed. Besides, the
clean animals are here distinguished from the unclean, by name as well as by
signs. The proper names, which are recited, are of little service to us
now-a-days; because many species which are common in the East, are unknown
elsewhere; and it was therefore easy for
Jews</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> 
f35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who were born and had lived in distant
countries, to fall into error about them; whilst, on the other hand, the more
bold they are in their conjectures, the less are they to be trusted. As to many
of them, I acknowledge that there is no ambiguity, especially as to the tame
animals, or those that are to be found everywhere, or that have plain
descriptions of them given in the Bible. A positive knowledge then is only to be
sought from the signs which are here laid down; viz., that the animals which
have cloven hoofs, and which ruminate, are clean: and that those are unclean in
which either of these two things is wanting; that either sea or river fish,
which have fins and scales, are clean. No such distinction as to birds is given,
but only the unclean are named, which it was sinful to eat. Lastly, mention is
made of reptiles. As to details, if there be anything worthy of observation, the
place to consider them will be further on; let us now remember, in general, what
I have before touched upon, viz., that whilst the Gentiles might eat every kind
of food, many were forbidden to the Jews, in order that they might learn in
their very food to cultivate purity; and this was the object of their separation
from ordinary customs. Hence it arose that they use the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chalal</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> 
f36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>both for "to<i> </i>make common,"
and to "contaminate; " and the word<i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
chol, </i>signifies "polluted<i>,</i>"<i> </i>because it is opposed to anything
holy or set apart. It is true, indeed, that the Gentiles, by natural instinct,
have regarded with the utmost horror the eating of some of the animals which are
here forbidden; still, God would surround His people with barriers, which must
separate them from their neighbors.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those who
imagine that God here had regard to their health, as if discharging the office
of a Physician, pervert by their vain speculation the whole force and utility of
this law. I allow, indeed, that the meats which God permits to be eaten are
wholesome, and best adapted for food; but, both from the preface, &#8212; in
which God admonished them that holiness was to be cultivated by the people whom
He had chosen, &#8212; as also from the (subsequent) abolition of this law, it
is sufficiently plain that this distinction of meats was a part of that
elementary instruction
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> under which God kept His ancient
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Let<i> </i>no man
therefore judge you (says Paul) in meat or in drink, which are a shadow of
things to come; but the body is of Christ."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
2:16-17.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">By which expressions he means, that
what was spiritual had been shadowed forth in the external rite of abstaining
from meats. To the same effect he elsewhere says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:14) that he knows and is persuaded,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that in the Lord Jesus Christ there is
nothing unclean; viz., because Christ by his death has redeemed His people from
slavish subjection. Hence it follows, that the prohibition of meats must be
counted among the ceremonies, which were exercises in the worship of God. But
here a question arises, how it is reconcilable that, even from the days of Noah,
certain animals were unclean, and yet that all without exception were allowed to
be eaten? I cannot agree with some in thinking that the distinction originally
made by God grew obsolete by degrees; for God, in excepting the eating of blood
only, makes a grant of whatsoever moves upon the earth as the food of the
posterity of Noah. I therefore restrict to the sacrifices that uncleanness, with
the knowledge of which the hearts of the Patriarchs were then inspired, nor do I
doubt but that it was as lawful for Abraham, as well as for them, to eat swine's
flesh as the flesh of oxen. Afterwards, when God imposed the yoke of the Law to
repress the licentiousness of the people, He somewhat curtailed this general
permission, not because He repented of His liberality; but because it was useful
to compel in this way to obedience these almost rude and uncivilized people.
But, since before the Law the condition of the saints was the same as our own,
it must be remembered, as I said before, that, agreeably to the dictates of
nature, they spontaneously avoided certain foods, just as at present no one will
hunt wolves or lions for food, nor desire to eat serpents and other venomous
animals. But the object of this ordinance was different, viz., lest they who
were God's sacred and peculiar people, should freely and promiscuously
communicate with the
Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>

confidence can be placed in the allegories, in which many have taken delight; so
I do not find any fault with, nor even refuse that which has been handed down
from the ancients, </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> viz., that by the cleaving of the hoof is
signified prudence in distinguishing the mysteries of Scripture, and by the

divide the word" who have known how to elicit mystical senses from its letter;
because<i> </i>hence it has come to pass that they have allowed themselves in
all sorts of imaginations. I therefore embrace the more simple notion, that they
who only have a taste for the carnal sense, do not divide the hoof; for, as Paul
says, only "he that is spiritual discerneth all things."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:15<i>, margin.</i>)<i> </i>The chewing of the cud ought to follow,
duly to prepare and digest the spiritual food; for many gulp down Scripture
without profit, because they neither sincerely desire to profit by it, nor seek
to refresh their souls by it, as their nourishment; but satisfied with the empty
delights of knowledge, make no efforts to conform their life to it. In the first
clause, then, brutal stupidity is condemned; in the other, the ambition and
levity of curious men.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God, indeed, set before Peter, in the
vision, unclean animals as images and figures of the Gentiles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:12;) and therefore it is lawful, by probable analogy, to transfer to men what
is said about the animals. But why God should have appointed the cloven hoof and
rumination as signs, is no more clear to me than why He should have forbidden
their eating swine's flesh; unless, perchance, because the solid hoof is a sign
of wildness; whilst the animals which do not ruminate feed for the most part on
filth and excrement. We know that on this point there was much contention
immediately after the promulgation of the Gospel, because some of the Jews, in
their excessive devotion to the Law, and considering that the distinction of
meats was not to be reckoned among the, ceremonial enactments, desired that the
new Church should be bound by the same trammels as had been imposed upon the
ancient people. At length, by the decree of the Apostles, permission was given
to the Gentiles to eat all kinds of meat, except only blood and things
strangled, and that only for a time, for the sake of avoiding offense, since the
Jews would not otherwise have been propitiated. Now, after what God Himself had
ordained respecting the distinction of meats had been abrogated, it was an act
of diabolical audacity to oblige men's consciences<i> </i>by human laws, and to
prevent them from enjoying the liberty obtained by
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Another question remains, how God should
pronounce anything which He has created to be unclean; for, if an animal be
rejected on account of its uncleanness, part of the reproach redounds to the
Author Himself. Besides, this rejection seems also to be opposed to the first
declaration of God, when, considering all things which He had made, He
acknowledged them to be "very<i> </i>good." The solution is, that no animal was
ever unclean in itself; but that this merely refers to its use. Thus in the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil there was naturally neither fault nor harm, so
that it should infect man by its pollution, yet he contracted death from it on
account of God's prohibition. Wherefore, also, in this passage, God does not
condemn His work in the animals, but, as to their being eaten, He would have
them accounted unclean, that the people may abominate that which is forbidden
them. In a word, it is only transgression which defiles: for the animals have
never changed their nature; but it was in God's power to determine what He would
have to be lawful or unlawful. Thus another objection is removed. Christ
declares that</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">If any one should thence infer that harmless animals

that kind of food, they were admonished by this ceremonial precept how
abominable is the inward corruption of the heart. But by such elementary
teaching they were prepared and led onwards to spiritual doctrine, that they
might know that nothing defiles a man except what comes out of his mouth.
Now-a-days the condition of believers is different. for liberty is obtained for
them, since Christ, having abrogated the Law, has nailed</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless these shall ye

what he had previously glanced at, viz., that an animal, although it may
ruminate, shall not be clean unless it also cleaves the hoof; and, on the other
hand, that the cloven hoof will not be sufficient unless combined with
rumination. In these words Moses taught that partial and imperfect purity must
not be obtruded upon God. If any choose to think that rumination is the symbol
of internal purity, and the cloven hoof of external, his opinion will be a
probable one. Since this distinction has occurred to my mind, although I have no
taste for subtle speculations, I have thought it well to mention it, yet leaving
it free for any one to accept it or not. Meanwhile we must hold it as certain,
as I have lately said, that God demands perfect cleanliness, undefiled by any
admixture. But the prohibition was most onerous to the Jews with respect to
swine's flesh, because it is very well adapted for food, not only as being a
pleasant accompaniment of other meats, but because the working-classes are fed
upon it at a smaller cost. In this point, therefore, the religion of the Jewish
people was especially proved. For, when the soldiers of Antiochus desired to
force the people to an entire renunciation of the Law, they only urged them to
eat swine's flesh </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And hence the famous witticism of
Augustus, "I would rather be Herod's pig than his son;"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because, whilst he abstained from pork,
he was the murderer of his children. But, in order that the Jews might observe
this prohibition more strictly, the very touch was also forbidden them; so that
it was not only wicked to taste swine's flesh, but even to touch it with their
hands after the animal was killed. The same rule did not apply to beef or
mutton; for it is necessary to handle the meat which is appointed for our
food.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These shall ye eat of all that

little of religion, plausibly contend that God is acting the physician's part,
and distinguishing wholesome from unwholesome food. But although their opinion
is sufficiently refuted by medical men themselves, yet, even if I should admit
what they desire, they reason badly. For the purpose of God was other than to
provide for the people's health; and, because He had to do with a rude people,
He chose common marks, being admonished by which they might gradually ascend to
higher things. It would be useless to follow the allegories which Isychius has
invented </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and I would willingly bury in oblivion
these triflings, except that many have such a leaning to subtleties, that sober
views would scarcely please them, until the folly of these allegories shall have
been convicted. I will say nothing of the scales and fins. If at first sight any
should approve of what he says as to the names of the fish being omitted,
because the Church seeks not. a name upon earth, and that the Church is
signified by the fish, &#8212; let them consider whether it is consistent that
the Church should only exist in the water; and, again, that the birds, which are
nearer heaven, should be excluded from this honor; thirdly, that the clean
animals should be rejected, as if they did not belong to the Church; lastly,
that those who by their contagion pollute the Church should be counted amongst
the elect, whose names are written in heaven; for certainly many of the fish are
unclean. Those who will not acquiesce in these perspicuous reasons, I will allow
to wander in their labyrinth. This simple view will satisfy the moderate and
teachable, that the fish are not named, because the greater part of them were
unknown to the Jews, whose country did not produce many of the river-fish, since
it scarcely had any river besides the Jordan, whilst the sea-fish only visited
the neighboring shores.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are they which ye shall
have in abomination.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The species of
birds and reptiles which are forbidden, are such as common feeling almost
naturally repudiates. And assuredly God dealt with great indulgence towards His
people, so as not to weigh them down with too heavy burdens. But because man's
greediness sometimes delights in monstrous food, He desired even in minor
matters to put the rein upon them, lest they should rush with heathen nations
into intemperance, whereby they would be polluted. For there was danger lest, by
devouring filthy animals, they should harden themselves to join in various other
corruptions. Another law is added, that they should not only abstain from eating
these unclean animals, but, if any such should be killed, that they should not
defile themselves by touching its carcase; nay, that if any vessels should have
come in contact with them, those made of earth should be broken, and others
should be washed. It seems to be a trifling matter to enjoin, that if a mouse
should have been drowned in a vessel of water, the vessel itself should be
unclean; and the strictness appears excessive, that the Jews should be
commanded, </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if any such animal had fallen into a
vessel of wine, and had died there, not only to pour away the wine, but also to
destroy the vessel; and if it had been smothered in an oven, or had lain in the
hearth, to break down both of them; as if spiritual infection reached even to
things without life. But we must always consider the intention of God:. from
whence we shall learn that He was not so severe and exacting in unimportant
things as to tie His people to the observation of (superfluous)
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> matters; but that these were acts of
discipline whereby He might accustom them to study purity, which is so generally
neglected and omitted among men. Now-a-days, also, we are commanded by the mouth
of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"whether<i> </i>we eat,
or drink, or whatsoever we do, to do all to the glory of God,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">but in this respect we differ from the ancient
people, that, being delivered from childish rudiments, we are directed only to
what is spiritual, viz., that meat and drink are supplied to us by God, that we
may serve in purity the Author of our life. But it was necessary to stimulate
the Jews in various ways that they might be more attentive to this object;
whilst God commanded them to keep their houses free from all uncleanness, and to
be diligent in watching over the purity of their water, and all their vessels;
that He might constantly set before their eyes how diligently He would have them
to labor after true cleanliness; as follows in the end of the
chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43<i>.</i></b><i>

but bids them beware of defiling themselves. And a clearer explanation is
subjoined, "For<i> </i>I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
yourselves; for I am holy." Lest they should imagine that the main part of
religion was contained in external ceremonies, they were to consider the nature
of God; for, inasmuch as He is a Spirit, He would be worshipped only
spiritually. Thus holiness is only connected instrumentally with the distinction
of meats; since their abstinence had no other object than that they should
consecrate themselves to God. Therefore the superstition of the Jews<i> </i>was

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall not eat of any thing
that dieth of itself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The eating of any
carcase, or of flesh torn by wild beasts, is reckoned among the causes of
defilement; but we must understand it to be the carcase of an animal which has
died of hunger or disease, for, from the nature of its death, it contracted
impurity, although in itself it were otherwise pure. The end of the precept is
gathered from the reason which is immediately subjoined, "for thou art a holy
people unto the Lord thy God," and from the ablution which is prescribed in the
passage from Leviticus. The same thing is, secondly, enjoined respecting flesh
that has been torn, as before with regard to the carcase, for the deformity of
its laceration is counted as uncleanness. The holiness of the people is again
referred to, that they may more diligently beware of defilements. Hence it
follows that those were contaminated who should eat of torn flesh. Therefore, in
the third passage, he confirms it that the Jews were to abstain, and were
prohibited from the eating of a carcase or the flesh of an animal torn by
beasts, lest they should pollute themselves. Nor is it an objection that the
eating of carrion and of blood are here prohibited in conjunction with each
other; for we know that Moses does not always arrange his precepts in order, but
promiscuously adduces such as appertain to different classes. Therefore, I have
thought it well to separate these two prohibitions which have distinct objects,
and whose dissimilarity manifestly appears from the difference of their
punishment. He who shall have eaten blood shall be cut off from the people;
whereas he who shall have eaten carrion, shall wash himself and be unclean till
the evening. A question might again arise respecting torn or lacerated flesh;
but it seems in my judgment to be plain enough from the context, that flesh torn
by beasts is counted amongst unclean meats; for the reason of the law is
expressed, viz., because those who were chosen to be a holy people should keep
themselves pure and incorrupt. Nor would God command that meat intended for man
should be thrown to dogs, unless it were infected with a contagion, which would
pollute His holy ones. As to the command, in the first passage, to give it to a
stranger, or to sell it to an alien, that he might eat it, it does not appear
reasonable, since that would be to supply the materials for sin, as though one
should offer a sword to a madman, or transfer illicit goods to others. But the
solution of this difficulty is easy: for the Gentiles were permitted to eat
indifferently of all sorts of food, since no distinctions were placed between
them; but the prohibition of certain meats was a mark of separation between them
and the elect people of God. A more difficult question arises from a kind of
contradiction, because Moses in another passage binds both the stranger and the
home-born by the same law, and declares them to be alike unclean if they shall
have tasted of carrion. But we must bear in mind that he sometimes calls those
strangers who, although born of heathen parents, had embraced the Law.
Circumcision, therefore, connected them with God, just as if they had derived
their origin from Abraham; whilst there were other strangers, whom
uncircumcision separated from the children of Abraham as profane and
excomnmnicate. The sum is, that whosoever allege God's name, and boast
themselves to be His people, are called to cultivate holiness, and to keep
themselves pure from every stain.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou goest forth to
war.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The same thing is now commanded
respecting wives as above respecting meats. As regarded the Canaanites, who were
destined and devoted to destruction, we have seen that the Israelites were
prohibited from taking their women to wife, lest this connection should be an
enticement to sin; but Moses now goes further, viz., that the Israelites, having
obtained a victory over other nations, should not marry any of the captive
women, unless purified by a solemn rite. This, then, is the sum, that the
Israelites should not defile themselves by profane marriages, but in this point
also should keep themselves pure and uncorrupt, because they were separated from
other people, to be the peculiar people of God. It was better, indeed, that they
should altogether abstain from such marriages; yet it was difficult so to
restrain their lust as that they should not decline from chastity in the least,
degree; and hence we learn how much license conquerors allow themselves in war,
so that there is no room for perfect purity in them. Wherefore God so tempers
His indulgence as that the Israelites, remembering the adoption wherewith He had
honored them, should not disgrace themselves, but in the very fervor of their
lust should retain some religious affection. But the question here is not of
unlawful ravishment, but Moses only speaks of women who have been made captives
by the right of war, for we know that conquerors have abused them with impunity,
because they had them under their power and dominion. But since many are led
astray by the blandishments of their wives, God applies a remedy, viz., that the
abjuration of their former life should precede their marriage; and that none
should be allowed to marry a foreign wife until she shall have first renounced
her own nation. To this refers the ceremony, that the woman should shave her
head, and cut her nails, and change her garments, and lament her father and her
family for an entire month, viz., that she may renounce her former life, and
pass over to another people. Some of the rabbins twist the words to a different
meaning, as if God would extinguish love in the minds of the husbands by
disfiguring the women; for the shaving of the head greatly detracts from female
beauty and elegance; and "to make the nails," for so the words literally mean,
they understand as to let them grow; and the prolongation of the nails has a
disgusting appearance. But their gloss is refuted by the context, in which she
is commanded to put off the raiment of her captivity.: But I have no doubt but
that their month of mourning, their shaven head, and the other signs, are
intended by God for their renewal, so that they may accustom themselves to
different habits. And with the same object they are commanded to bewail their
parents as if dead, that they may bid farewell to their own people. To this the
Prophet seems to allude in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
45:10, when he says, "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;"<i> </i>for he intimates
that otherwise the marriage of a foreign woman with Solomon would not be pure
and legitimate, unless she should relinquish her superstitions, and devote
herself to God's service. Nor was it needless that God should require the
Israelites diligently to beware lest they should take wives as yet aliens from
the study of true religion, since experience most abundantly shows how fatal a
snare it is. But although we are not now bound to this observance, yet the rule
still holds good that men should not rashly ally themselves with women still
devoted to wicked

But God formerly made use of the ceremonies as temporary aids, of which,
although the use has ceased, the utility still remains; because from them it
more clearly appears how God is to be duly served; and the spirit of religion
shines forth in them. Therefore the whole substance is contained in the precept,
but in the external exercise, as it were, the <i>form </i>to which God bound
none but His ancient people. Now follow The Political
Supplements</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">,
f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whereby God commands the punishments to
be inflicted, if His religion shall have been violated. For political laws are
not only enacted with reference to earthly affairs, in order that men should
maintain mutual equity with each other, and should follow and observe what is
right, but that they should exercise themselves in the veneration of God. For
Plato also begins from hence, when he lays down the legitimate constitution of a
republic, and calls the fear of God the preface of all laws; nor has any profane
author ever existed who has not confessed that this is the principal part of a
well-constituted state, that all with one consent should reverence and worship
God. In this respect, indeed, the wisdom of men was at fault, that they deemed
that any religion which they might prefer was to be sanctioned by laws and by
punishments; yet the principle was a just one, that the whole system of law is
perverted if the cultivation of piety is ignored by
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But, whilst God commends the care and study
of religion to the judge, and commands that the contempt of it should be
publicly avenged, He at the same time provides against a common error, that they
should not rush into severity with rash and inconsiderate zeal. For, inasmuch as
the several nations, cities, and kingdoms foolishly invent their own gods, He
propounds His own Law, from the regulation of which it is sinful to decline. It
has been wisely forbidden by human legislators, that men should make to
themselves private gods; but all this is vain unless the knowledge of the true
God enlightens and directs them. Justly, therefore, does God recall His people
to that doctrine which He has delivered, to the end that whosoever shall have
contumaciously despised it should be punished. But, since it would be
insufficient that they should be once instructed in the proper worship of God by
a written law, unless daily preaching were subjoined, God expressly furnishes
His prophets with authority, and denounces the punishment to be inflicted if any
should violate it. He had previously said that He would raise up prophets, that
the condition of His chosen people<i> </i>should not be worse than that of other
nations; since, therefore, He had deposited with them the treasure of true
religion, that they might be, as it were, its guardians, He now threatens with
destruction whosoever shall refuse to obey their commands. It is plain, however,
from the expression "in my name," that He does not speak of all who may usurp
the name of prophet, for it is as much as to say that they came from Him, and
advanced nothing without His command. For, although many may falsely present
themselves in God's name, this honorable distinction does not belong to them
unless God should ratify it; but this is truly the characteristic of faithful
and approved teachers, that they speak in the name of God. Thus, when Christ
promises that</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that
prophet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the ministers of Satan
deceive men by their plausible exterior, when they vaunt themselves to be the
prophets of God, Moses had already admonished them, that all. teachers were not
to be listened to indifferently, but that the true were to be distinguished from
the false, and that, after judgment had, those should obtain credit who deserved
it. He now subjoins the punishment of such as should creep in under the name of
a prophet to draw away the people into rebellion. For he does not condemn to
capital punishment those who may have spread false doctrine, only on account of
some particular or trifling error, but those who are the authors of apostasy,
and so who pluck up religion by the roots. Observe, again, that the season of
this severity would not be until a positive religion should be established; and,
therefore, the grossness of the impiety is expressly named, "if<i> </i>they
should have tried to turn the people away from the worship of the true God."
Moreover, that all excuse might be obviated, Moses says that it is sufficiently
manifested who God is, and how He is to be worshipped, both by the wonderful
blessing of their redemption, as well as by the doctrine of the Law. Therefore,
in order that God may shew that so heavy a punishment is justly inflicted upon
apostates, He declares the certainty of that religion which should exist among
the Israelites; as much as to say, that no pardon could be granted to such
impious contempt, since God had abundantly proved the glory of His Godhead by
the miracle of their redemption, and had manifested His will in the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It must then be remembered, that the crime
of impiety would not otherwise merit punishment, unless the religion had not
only been received by public consent and the suffrages of the people, but, being
supported also by sure and indisputable proofs, should place its truth above the
reach of doubt. Thus, whilst their severity is preposterous who defend
superstitions with the sword, so also in a well constituted polity, profane men
are by no means to be tolerated, by whom religion is subverted.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus they are unable to endure, who
desire to be at liberty to make disturbances with impunity; and therefore they
call those sanguinary who teach that the errors by which religion is undermined
and thence destroyed, should be restrained by public authority. But what will
they gain by openly raving against God? God commands the false prophets to be
put to death, who pluck up the foundations of religion, and are the authors and
leaders of rebellion. Some scoundrel or other gainsays this, and sets himself
against the author of life and death. What insolence is this!
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As to their denial that the truth of God
stands in need of such support, it is very true; but what is the meaning of this
madness, in imposing a law upon God, that He should not make use of the
obedience of magistrates in this respect? And what avails it to question about
the necessity of this, since so it pleases God? God <i>might, </i>indeed, do
without the assistance of the sword in defending religion; but such is not His
will. And what wonder if God should command magistrates to be the avengers of
His glory, when He neither wills nor suffers that thefts, fornications, and
drunkenness should be exempt from punishment. In minor offenses it shall not be
lawful for the judge to hesitate; and when the worship of God and the whole of
religion is violated, shall so great a crime be fostered by his dissimulation?
Capital punishment shall be decreed against adulterers; but shall the despisers
of God be permitted with impunity to adulterate the doctrines of salvation, and
to draw away wretched souls from the faith? Pardon shall never be extended to
poisoners, by whom the body alone is injured; and shall it be sport to deliver
souls to eternal destruction? Finally, the magistracy, if its own authority be
assailed, shall take severe vengeance upon that contempt; and shall it suffer
the profanation of God's holy name to be unavenged? What can be more monstrous!
But it is superfluous to contend by argument, when God has once pronounced what
is His will, for we must needs abide by His inviolable
decree<i>.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">But it is questioned whether the
law pertains to the kingdom of Christ, which is spiritual and distinct from all
earthly dominion; and there are some men, not otherwise ill-disposed, to whom it
appears that our condition under the Gospel is different from that of the
ancient people under the law; not only because the kingdom of Christ is not of
this world, but because Christ was unwilling that the beginnings of His kingdom
should be aided by the sword. But, when human judges consecrate their work to
the promotion of Christ's kingdom, I deny that on that account its nature is
changed. For, although it was Christ's will that His Gospel should be proclaimed
by His disciples in opposition to the power of the whole world, and He exposed
them armed with the Word alone like sheep amongst wolves, He did not impose on
Himself an eternal law that He should never bring kings under His subjection,
nor tame their violence, nor change them from being cruel persecutors into the
patrons and guardians of His Church. Magistrates at first exercised<i>
</i>tyranny against the Church, because the time had not yet come when they
should "kiss the Son" of God, and, laying aside their violence, should become
the nursing fathers of the Church, which they had assailed according to Isaiah's
prophecy, that undoubtedly refers to the coming of Christ.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Christ, indeed as He is meek, would also, I confess,
have us to be imitators of His gentleness, but that does not prevent pious
magistrates from providing for the tranquillity and safety of the Church by
their defense of godliness; since to neglect this part of their duty, would be
the greatest perfidy and cruelty. And assuredly nothing can be more base than,
when we see wretched souls drawn away to eternal destruction by reason of the
impunity conceded to impious, wicked, and perverse impostors, to count the
salvation of those souls for nothing. But, if under this pretext the
superstitious have dared to shed innocent blood, I reply that what God has once
commanded must not be brought to nought on account of any abuse or corruption of
men. For, if the cause alone abundantly distinguishes the martyrs of Christ from
malefactors, though their punishment may be identical, so the Papal executioners
will not bring it to pass by their unjust cruelty that the zeal of pious
magistrates in punishing false and noxious teachers should be otherwise than
pleasing to God. And this is admirably expressed in the words of Moses, when he
reminds them that judgment must be passed according to the law of God. I have
already said that. this severity must not be extended to particular errors, but
where impiety breaks forth even into rebellion. When it is added, "to<i>
</i>thrust thee out of the way, which the Lord thy God commanded thee," we
gather from it that none are to be given over to punishment, but those who shall
have been convicted by the plain word of God, lest men should judge them
arbitrarily. Whence it also appears that zeal will err in hastily drawing the
sword, unless a lawful examination shall have been previously
instituted.</font><br></div>

2:4, the covenant of God was with Levi, that his descendants might be the
guardians of His knowledge, and the interpreters of His law: yet God often
punished the laxity of the priests, by setting other teachers over his people.
At any rate, both were ambassadors for Him. Since, therefore, the authority of
the prophets had been sanctioned above, the same rights are now conferred upon
the priests; nor is this surprising, for it was no trifling crime to despise
God, the appointer of this order. Yet we must remember what I have elsewhere
stated, that the priests were not armed with tyrannical authority, so that it
was sinful to reject whatever they might have decreed according to their own
fancy. For neither did God dethrone Himself when He appointed them, nor did He
bind men's consciences to obey their ordinances without distinction, but only
would put reins on the audacity of those who have no scruple in undervaluing the
government of the Church. For this must be considered, that foul and horrible
would be the disorder, if men were promiscuously permitted to reject whatever
the rulers of the Church may have appointed; and it would be ridiculous that
persons should be called to govern, to whom no dignity should be accorded; and,
therefore, natural reason itself shews and dictates, that the reverence, which
is here demanded, is due to all lawful commands. God was the author of the
priesthood: He, too, ordained judges. What could be more absurd than that they
should be despised and laughed at with impunity, who presided in the name and by
the command of God? But He has never exalted a mortal man so high as to abdicate
His own rights; nay, it was often necessary boldly to reject what the priests
had commanded. Urijah the priest built a profane altar in the fashion of that at
Damascus, which Ahaz had sent, and offered a sacrifice
thereon,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:12,) was it necessary that Isaiah should acquiesce in this? Nay,
detestable was the adulation of all who assented to the decree of a wicked and
perfidious priest. Moreover, we see that the prophets were very often so far
from agreeing with the priests, that they waged open war with them. But the
whole of this matter is decided by the words of Moses, for he does not
unreservedly condemn all who should not obey, but restricts his law by the
addition of a special mark, viz., if the contempt should arise from presumption
or arrogance. Therefore it was not else a capital crime to disobey the priest or
the judge, unless any one should insolently and proudly oppose himself to the
ordinance established by God. Otherwise this exception would have been
interposed without reason. In fine, the priests of old were to be obeyed, as far
as it concerned the public peace that the pastors ordained by God should be
reverently honored; yet so as that there should be no departure from God
Himself, the one Head and Prince of all pastors. We have elsewhere seen how

assuredly, when He commands that the whole people should be inspired with

thy mother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The punishment which he had
commanded to be inflicted on false teachers, is now extended to each one of the
people. For although it is a lighter offense in a private individual to draw
others with him into error, both because his ignorance is excusable, and the
profession of a teacher does not increase his responsibility, yet a falling away
from religion, from whencesoever it arises, is intolerable to God. Only, those
two points, to which we have already adverted, are to be kept in remembrance,
viz., that this judgment can have no place except where religion is duly
constituted; and, also, that all are not to be put to death indifferently, who
may have erred in some particular, but that this severity is only to be
exercised against apostates, who pluck up religion by the roots, so that the
worship of God is adulterated, or pure doctrine abolished. Nor indeed does God
enjoin that the slipperiness of the tongue is to be capitally punished, if it
shall have inconsiderately let fall something amiss, but rather
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the wicked design of altering the true
religion, as the words clearly express the matter. It is worth while remarking
with what particularity God enforces upon us the duty of fostering and upholding
religion: for, because general laws are usually eluded by various exceptions, He
expressly says that neither brother, nor son, nor wife, nor intimate friend is
to be spared. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The <i>eye </i>is said to pity, because
the very look is of great power in awakening the affections on both sides;
therefore it is not without reason that God requires
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> such courage as may be moved to pity
neither by tears, nor blandishments, nor the sadness of the spectacle. The
phrases, too, are emphatic, "thy<i> </i>brother, who proceeded from the same
womb;" "the wife who sleeps in thy bosom or embrace;" "the friend whom you love
as yourself;" in order that pure zeal, when it sees God's sacred name profaned,
may not give way to any human affection. Christ says that no one is worthy to be
acknowledged as His disciple, but he who shall neglect his father, and mother,
and children, when necessary. So now God declares that all our tenderest
affections, which are implanted in us by nature, and in which all the best
persons sometimes indulge, are sinful, if they hinder us from vindicating His
glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is pious and praiseworthy to love our
wives and children as our own bowels; nor is there any reason which forbids us
from regarding our brother and our friend with similar love; only let God be
preferred to all, for it is too preposterous to betray His glory for the sake of
man. For to plead the love due to our wives, or anything of the same kind, what
is this but to set our affections against God and His precepts? Wherefore the
desire to mitigate that severity to which He would harden us, betrays an
effeminacy which He will not endure. Now, there are two most just grounds for
the heaviness of the punishment; first, because we are almost all of us slack
when we ought to be very zealous in avenging the insults which God may receive;
and, secondly, because more severe remedies are applied to perilous diseases, so
it is right that so noxious, and altogether deadly pestilence as this should be
met with extraordinary means. And to this refers the expression
"<i>secretly.</i>"<i> </i>For although it might seem cruel to betray such as
have not publicly transgressed, yet, inasmuch as sectaries fly from the light,
and creep in<i> </i>by clandestine and deceitful arts, it is necessary to
prevent them from fraudulently infecting individual houses with their poison, as
always is the case with them. Therefore God would have their insidious endeavors
checked betimes, lest the contagion should
spread.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Namely, of the gods of the

effect, that we should so acquiesce in the known truth, as that our ears may be
closed to all the falsehoods by which it is opposed. Men's neighborhood to each
other commonly produces, by their intercommunication, a conformity of habits.
Thus errors pass from one to the
other;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and since we are generally prone to evil,
the worse pervert the better. Since, then, the people of Israel were everywhere
surrounded by idolaters, they might have easily been enticed to imitate them,
unless measures were taken to prevent it. But the expression "round about" is
used, because a pretext for yielding might have been taken from the fact, that
the Israelites differed in religion not from a single nation only, but from all
who surrounded them on every side. For to whatever quarter they looked, examples
presented themselves to their eyes, whereby they were attracted to a new and
strange form of religion. He afterwards amplifies this, by adding, even if those
nations "be<i> </i>far off from thee;" for the Israelites were not divided from
their neighbors only, but severed also from the whole human race. But this was
no slight temptation, that they found no companions in the whole world, nor any
nation, which agreed with them. Besides, distance itself sometimes causes us to
have respect for those who are unknown to us; since the curiosity of men is
volatile, and traverses in its levity sea and land, in order to procure for
itself pestiferous monsters for the sake of their novelty. Meanwhile, God exalts
the faith which is founded on His Word, in comparison with the manners,
institutions, rites, and customs of all nations; for none has made any true
proficiency in religion unless he abominates whatever is opposed to
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b><i>

privately execute vengeance without a public trial; but he referred to the
ordinary custom, that the witnesses should throw the first stone at condemned
criminals, as we shall see elsewhere. For it was an admirable provision, that
God would have those who had denounced the crime, to be the executors of its
punishment, in order that they should be more cautious and moderate in giving
their testimony. The reason, which is added at the end, "because<i> </i>he hath
sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, who brought thee out<i>,</i>"
etc., again exaggerates the crime on the score of its ingratitude; which was
detestable in proportion to the inestimable blessing of their deliverance. It
was an act of gross wickedness to rebel against God after they had known Him;
but it was still more gross to undervalue their Deliverer. Finally, the
advantage and fruit of this severity is subjoined; for, whilst punishment was
inflicted on one man's crime, all others were inspired with terror; and thus the
death of one is a wholesome discipline for all, in the way of
example.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt hear
say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If impiety and rebellion should
more widely prevail, Moses declares that whole cities, together with their
inhabitants, should rather be destroyed, than that so great a crime should
remain unpunished. Hence we may better infer how unholy is the tenderness of
those who would have no punishment inflicted for the violation of the religion
of God. If any sedition may have arisen in an army or nation, and the contagion
may have spread through the whole multitude, the severity of a just and moderate
ruler does not usually proceed further than to punish the ringleaders; when,
therefore, God commands all without exception to be destroyed, the great
atrocity of the crime is made apparent. Hence, too, we are admonished, that zeal
for God's glory is but cold among us, unless true religion is held to be of more
value than the preservation of a single city or people. But if so many together
are to be dragged to death in crowds, their impudence is more than detestable,
and their pity cruelty itself, who would take no account of God's injured
majesty, so that one man may be spared. And since we are created to no other
end, and live for no other cause than that God may be glorified in us, it is
better that the whole world should perish, than that men should enjoy the fruits
of the earth in order that they may contaminate it with their blasphemies. If
those who first professed Christ's name had been inspired with such zeal as
this, true religion would never have been overwhelmed, and almost extinguished
by so many corruptions. But we must always bear in mind what I have already
said, that this severity must not be resorted to except when the religion is
suffering, which is not only received by public authority and general opinion,
but which is proved on solid grounds to be true; so that it may clearly appear
that we are the avengers of God against the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Certain men, the children of
Belial.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses puts a case, which very
often is wont to occur. For all do not break forth into impiety together at the
same moment, but Satan stirs up some who are like fans to excite others; and by
their instigations the multitude is led to imitate them. Moses calls such as
these "children of
Belial;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f61
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">by which word some think that rebellious
(<i>proefractos</i>)<i> </i>men are pointed out, and expound it "without yoke."
Their opinion, however, seems to be more correct, who interpret it "men of
nothing," men in whom nothing good or praiseworthy is found; and literally
translate it "those who are worthless."
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f62
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This expression is invariably applied to the
wicked (<i>sceleratis, improbis, et nequam;</i>)<i> </i>and therefore Paul,

wicked.

Corinthians 6:15.) He uses the words "gone out," as if they had dared to come
forward, and openly to parade their impiety. But, though the evil may have
originated with a few authors, he does not mean that punishment should stop with
them; as if the instigation of others availed as an excuse for the multitude.
And he enjoins diligent inquiry to be made, for two reasons: viz., lest they
should connive at the iniquity, and be lax, and careless about it, or lest they
should be too hasty and precipitate in their judgment; because, on the one hand,
whilst we are never equitable, nor decide rightly in precipitation and anger, so
on the other it betrays base indifference, and something like disloyalty, to
overlook so great a crime. Thus both activity and moderation are commended, so
that the judge may neither be lax, nor make any decision until the matter shall
be carefully inquired into.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt surely
smite.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest the severity of the
punishment should occasion surprise, let us first observe that the error was
unpardonable, because its authors, being educated in the doctrines of the Law,
could not be deceived involuntarily, nor unless they had grown weary of
religion, and set their hearts on the impostures of the devil. On this account
God, in the Book of Jeremiah, in order to inveigh more heavily against the
inconstancy of the Jews, refers them to distant isles and nations: "Passover (He
says) and consider," etc., "Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no
gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. Be
astonished, O ye heavens, at this<i>,</i>" etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:10-12.) For justly must their instability be accounted monstrous, that they
should have voluntarily forsaken the fountain of life, and have been carried
away to vanity by their preposterous love of novelty. If any should object that
the little children at least were innocent, I reply that, since all are
condemned by the judgment of God from the least to the greatest, we contend
against Him in vain, even though He should destroy the very infants as yet in
their mothers' womb. When Sodom and the neighboring cities were swallowed up, we
doubt not but that in the mighty multitude many infants and pregnant women also
perished; and whilst our reason struggles against this, it is better rather to
look up reverently to the Divine tribunal, than to subject it to our own laws.
The same may be said of the destruction of Babylon; for when the Prophet
exclaims: "Happy<i> </i>shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the stones," he assuredly eulogizes the just vengeance of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:9.) So also in this passage, if it does not appear to us agreeable to reason
that the whole race of evil-doers should be exterminated, let us understand that
God is defrauded of His rights, whensoever we measure His infinite greatness,
which the angels themselves admiringly adore, by our own feelings. Although we
must recollect<i> </i>that God would never have suffered any infants to be
destroyed, except those which He had already reprobated and condemned to eternal
death. But if we admit God's right to deprive of the hope of salvation
whomsoever He sees fit, why should the temporal punishment, which is much
lighter, be found fault with? Rather let us learn from the severity of this Law,
how detestable is the crime of setting up false and spurious modes of worship,
since it contaminates not only the infants, whose age prevents them from being
conscious of it, </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but even the cattle and flocks, and the
very houses and walls. For he proceeds immediately afterwards to
say,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt gather all the
spoil of it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They are commanded to burn
all the furniture, and whatever is found in the city; and the reason is
subjoined, because it is accursed (<i>anathema</i>)<i>. </i>If any city was
taken in war, all that God here commands to be burnt was to be counted as spoil,
for the Jews would pollute themselves by its very touch. It might be indeed that
God's intention was to obviate covetousness, lest the Jews should mix up their
zeal with rapine; but the principal reason was that which Moses expresses, that
the people might be more accustomed to detest the crime, which they saw to be so
cruelly punished by God. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem, </i>which the Greeks have translated <i>anathema,</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f64

that which God would have annihilated, because He cannot bear the sight of it,
is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
before Him. Therefore it is said, "Thou<i> </i>shalt burn it to the Lord thy
God;" for the translation which some give, "for<i> </i>(<i>propter</i>)<i>
</i>the Lord," is not quite literal. The sum is to this effect, that if they
fear God's vengeance for themselves, and desire to propitiate His favor, they
must hold in execration the houses and property of those who have rebelled
against the Law. Moreover, it is implied by the words "mercy"<i> </i>and
"compassion," that if God should deal with absolute justice, the wickedness of
one city would suffice to destroy a whole country. Whence we gather, that a kind
of expiation is demanded to propitiate God, when they are commanded utterly to
destroy the city, and to cast every remnant of it into the
fire.</font><br></div>

of those is appointed who should in any respect violate the worship of God. We
have lately seen how severely God avenged apostasy from the faith; but now He
touches upon certain particular points when religion is not professedly
forsaken, but some corruption is introduced, whereby its purity is affected. The
first passage denounces capital punishment upon witches; by which name Moses
means enchantresses, or sorceresses, who devote themselves to magic arts, either
to injure persons by their fascinations, or to seek revelations from the devil;
such as she was whom Saul consulted, although she might be called by a different
name </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Since such illusions carry with them a
wicked renunciation of God, no wonder that He would have them punished with
death. But since this pestilent crime would be no more tolerable in a man than a
woman, it has been probably supposed that the law was directed against women,
because their sex is more disposed to superstition. Certainly the same enactment
is made respecting males in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:1, </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> only the punishment is not there
denounced, but God merely prohibits any of the people from being an enchanter or
a witch. Now it is clear that all the kinds which are there recited, are here
included under one; so that God would condemn to capital punishment all augurs,
and magicians, and consulters with familiar spirits, and necromancers and
followers of magic arts, as well as enchanters. And this will appear more
plainly from the second and third passages, in which God declares that He "will
set. His face against all, that shall turn after such as have familiar spirits,
and after wizards," so as to cut them off from His people; and then commands
that they should be destroyed by stoning. Wherefore, since it is not just that
men should escape with impunity, when the infirmity of women is not spared, nor
that dissimilar sentences should be pronounced in similar cases, the same
punishment which was decreed against witches and enchantresses, is now extended
to either sex, and to all magical superstitions. In the words also "that turneth
to go a whoring," the atrocity of the crime is again expressed, the similitude
being taken from immodest women, who seek with wandering glances for the
indulgence of their lust. Moses, therefore, signifies that, as soon as we begin
to cast our eyes this way and that, and do not keep them fixed on God alone so
as to be content with Him, that sacred union

f68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "The soul that doeth ought with a high
hand, the same reproacheth the Lord, and, therefore, shall be cut off;" thus
there would be two propositions. We have followed another opinion, reading it
connectedly<i>, </i>"<i>The </i>soul, who shall have raised a high hand to the
reproach of God, shall be cut off<i>.</i>"<i> </i>Literally, it is, "The<i>
</i>soul, who shall have dealt with a high hand, whether born in the land, or a
stranger, himself blaspheming God, and that soul shall be plucked up from the
midst of his people." But, since either version is probable, and makes no
difference in substance, I have allowed myself freely to choose that which
expressed the meaning more clearly. "To deal with a high hand" is nothing more
than to attempt, or undertake proudly, what is not lawful: for our hands ought
to be guided, and, as it were, restrained by God's word, lest they should lift
themselves up. But although men's hands are used in various acts of audacity and
wantonness, yet here there is especial mention of the profanation of God's true
and legitimate worship, when anything is invented inconsistent with its purity:
for the punishment is not decreed against thefts, or murders, or other similar
crimes, but against the perverse imaginations, which tend to the corruption of
religion. The reason is afterwards added: "Because<i> </i>he hath despised the
word of the Lord, and hath broken His commandment." For it is no light offense
to transgress the bounds which God hath placed. Now, it is certain that all
self-invented services betray an impious contempt of God, as if men designedly
despised Him, and spurned at His commands. Whence we infer, that nothing is more
opposed to perfect and sincere religion than that temerity which induces men to
follow whatever course they please. The clause, "his<i> </i>iniquity shall be
upon <i>him,</i>"<i> </i>may be explained in two ways, either as a confirmation
by Moses of the justice of this punishment, and of its merited infliction, or as
an admonition, that the impiety should be corrected betimes, before it has
advanced too far. There is no objection to either.</font><br></div>

previously expounded in its proper place. God here commands the punishment to be
inflicted, if any one should have polluted himself with it. And surely it was a
detestable sacrilege to enslave to idols that offspring, which was begotten to
God, and which He had adopted in the loins of Abraham, since in this way they
not only despoiled God of His right, but, so far as they could, blotted out the
grace of adoption. What He had then generally pronounced, He now specially
applies, viz., that they should be stoned who offered their seed to Molech; for
otherwise they would have tried to escape on the pretense that they had no
intention of revolting to other gods. Just as now-a-days, under the Papacy,
whatever is alleged from Scripture against their impious and corrupt worship, is
coldly and contemptuously received; because they varnish over their idolatries,
and so indulge themselves in them in security. But after God has commanded His
judges to punish this crime severely, He at the same time declares that, if
perchance they should connive at it, and encourage it. by their lenity, He
Himself will avenge it, so as to punish much more heavily those who may have
escaped from the hands of men; and not only so, but that He would implicate all
those who might have been aware of it in the same
con-detonation.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou art come unto the
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this passage God sets forth the
merits of that sacerdotal kingdom, of which mention is made elsewhere; for,
since the splendor of the royal name might dazzle their eyes, so that they
should forget that God retained the sovereignty over them, they are thus early
admonished how unjust it would be if the majesty of God should be diminished by
the rule of a mortal man. In sum, the power of kings is here put beneath that of
God; and kings themselves are consecrated unto obedience to Him, lest the people
should ever turn to ungodliness, whatever change of government might take place.
But although under the judges religion was often subverted, yet it was not
without a cause that a special law was enacted with respect to kings, because
nothing is more likely than that earthly pomps should draw men away from piety.
Now we understand the design of God in this matter, let us proceed to examine
its several parts. He passes over (as I have said) all the intermediate time
until the beginning of the kingdom, because this new state of things brought
with it an increase of danger: for as long as the judges were in power, their
different form of government separated the Jews from heathen nations. All the
surrounding neighbors were subject to kings; and God always retained the
preeminence, whilst He raised up judges from amongst the people; but when they
began to choose kings for themselves, they were so mixed up with the Gentiles,
that it was easy for them to fall into other corruptions. For the very
similarity (of their governments) united them more closely; wherefore, it is
expressly said, When thou shalt set a king over thee "like as all the nations
that are about" thee. For God signifies that the example of the nations would be
an evil snare to them, that they should desire to have a king, and thus their
condition would in future be identical, though by divine decree it had been
distinct. In short, their rebellion is here indirectly condemned, when God
foretells that they would wantonly shake off their yoke; as indeed actually took
place, when they rejected Samuel, and tumultuously required a king. On which
point God elsewhere complains that He was despised. But the question arises, how
these two things can be reconciled, that kings should reign over them from the
lust or foolish desire of the people, and yet that the kingdom was the chief
glory of the people, a special pledge of God's favor, and consequently of their
welfare and full felicity. The prophecy of Jacob is well known,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The scepter shall not
depart from Judah,. &#8212; until Shiloh come." (Genesis
49:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whence it appears that a king was promised to the
children of Abraham as an inestimable blessing. Why, then, does not God declare
Himself its author? I reply that, although it was God's design from the
beginning to set up David as a type of Christ, yet, because their unseemly haste
disturbed the order of things, the commencement of the kingdom is ascribed to
the people's fault, when they were impelled by their perverse emulation to wish
to be like the Gentiles. God appears then to have designedly censured their
wilfulness, as if He had said, "Although by appointing a king, you approach more
nearly to the Gentiles, beware lest your perverse desire should altogether turn
you away from true religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt in any wise set him
king over thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">First of all, God maintains His
own supremacy in the appointment of a king, and does not consign the matter to
the people's own suffrages; that thus He may chastise their audacity in
demanding a king in accordance with a hasty impulse. Secondly, He commands that
he should be taken from the people themselves, and excludes foreigners, because,
if they had been admitted, a door was opened to apostasy; for each would have
tried to force upon them his native gods, and true religion would have been
persecuted by the force and threatenings of the royal power. Behold why God
would not suffer a king to be sought elsewhere but from the bosom of His Church;
in order that he might cherish and maintain that pure worship which he had
imbibed from his childhood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16<i>.</i></b><i>

<i>rak</i>, is an adversative particle which some construe <i>only; </i>almost
with the same meaning, because this exception was added to restrain the passions
of their kings. The first prohibition is, that he should not collect for himself
a multitude of horses; but, since it is twice repeated, we must consider why it
is so. Many thus translate it, "He<i> </i>shall not multiply horses, nor cause
the people to return to Egypt, to multiply horses;" but this manner of speaking
is harsh and obscure. Now, since the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;[ml</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>lemagnan, </i>signifies "for the sake of (<i>propter</i>)<i>, </i>it may be
properly translated to the letter, "for<i> </i>the sake of multiplying
<i>horses,</i>"<i> </i>(<i>propter multiplicare, vel propter ad
multiplicandum.</i>)<i> </i>I have no doubt, then, but that God condemns an
immoderate number of horses from the consequences which might ensue; because it
might excite the minds of the kings rashly to undertake expeditions against the
Egyptians. This, therefore, I consider to be the genuine meaning, that the king
should not provide himself with horses in too great numbers, lest, when he was
in possession of many horses, he should lead his army into Egypt. Thus, amongst
other evils which might arise from a multitude of horses, Moses mentions this,
that the king's mind will be puffed up with pride, so as to invade Egypt with an
army of horse. Now, the question is, why God forbade His people to return by
that way? Some explain it, that the horses would be brought contrary to God's
command, who had forbidden them to trade (with that people;)
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f72
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but this does not seem appropriate. Others
think that the people were prohibited from passing the desert, lest in their
curiosity they should be ungrateful to God; but this, too, is far-farfetched. To
me it seems probable, that this journey was prohibited them, in order that,
being mindful of their deliverance, they should be content with their own
boundaries. They had been rescued from a thousand deaths: if they had
voluntarily gone thither to provoke an adversary, their confidence would have
been a sign of their despising and forgetting God's grace. Therefore, in order
that the recollection of their redemption should be deeply impressed upon their
minds, God would have the honor put upon His miracles, that they should avoid
those regions like the abysses of death. Unless perhaps this reason may be
preferred, that a handle for those wicked alliances was cut off, which we see
were audaciously contracted, because the kings of Israel gloried in the
abundance of their cavalry. But the former explanation is most suitable. This
law, however, was not obeyed by their best kings; and hence it appears that the
wilfulness and pride of their kings could scarcely be repressed by any
restraints.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.</i></b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither shall he multiply wives
to himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Polygamy at that time had
generally prevailed, so that the very humblest of the people violated the
marriage vow with impunity; and therefore it was necessary that the kings should
be bound with closer restrictions, lest by their example they should give
greater countenance to incontinency. And thus their ignorance is easily refuted
who conclude that what was specially interdicted to the kings was permitted to
private individuals, whereas the law of chastity was imposed upon the former,
because without this remedy there would be no bounds to their lasciviousness.
Besides, the people would have been subjected to great expense on their
account<i>, </i>since such is the ambition of women, that they would all have
desired to receive<i> </i>royal treatment, and would have even vied with each
other in finery, as actually came to pass. David transgressed this law, and in
some degree excusably on account of his repudiation by Michal; still it appears
that lust had more power over him than the continency<i> </i>prescribed by God.
What follows is so connected<i> </i>by some as if it were the reason of the
foregoing sentence, in this way, "that kings were not to multiply wives to
themselves, lest their heart should turn away from what was right," as was the
case with Solomon; for, from being too devoted to his wives, and being deceived
by the snares of women, he fell into idolatry. And assuredly it can scarcely
fail to happen, that when many wives beset a man, they must render his mind
effeminate, and stifle in him all his manly good sense. Yet I prefer taking the
clause separately, that kings must beware lest the splendor of their dignity
should affect the soundness of their judgment, for nothing is more difficult
than for one in great power to continue disposed to temperance. Therefore God
does not in vain enjoin that they should constantly persevere in their duty, and
not lose their understanding. Moreover, He forbids kings to heap up treasures,
because it cannot be done without rapine and violent exactions; whilst, at the
same time, wealth encourages them audaciously to undertake unjust wars, incites
them to gross dissipation, and at length hurries them forward to tyrannical
excesses. First, therefore, God would have kings beware, lest in their pursuit
of riches they should exhaust the blood of the people, and lest they should
lavish their ill-gotten money in superfluous expenses, and be extravagant with
what belongs to others; and lastly, lest they should be tempted by the pride of
wealth to attempt unlawful things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be, when he sitteth
upon the throne.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It<i> </i>would not be
enough to correct their errors unless kings were also instructed in the fear of
God, and properly taught their duty; now, therefore, a system of discipline is
added, whereby it was profitable for them to be grounded in the study of
religion and justice, viz., that they should take the Law from the priests and
Levites, which was to be the rule of all their actions. Because the
demonstrative pronoun is used,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> some think that only the book of
Deuteronomy is referred to, but without good reason. I make no doubt but that
the whole sum of doctrine is included, which is delivered both here and in
Exodus and Leviticus. But although it was without exception to be common to all,
yet in order that kings might be more assiduously attentive in reading it, God
would have a copy peculiarly dedicated to their use by the priests and Levites,
and given into their hands in a solemn ceremony; that kings might know that they
required greater wisdom and counsel for ruling the people than private persons.
When, therefore, the priests and Levites presented them with this book, it was
as if God deposited this treasure with the king. He then enjoins that they
should exercise themselves in the doctrine of the Law through the whole course
of their lives, because kings are usually supplied with books only out of
ostentation and pomp, and when they have tasted of what is taught in them,
straightway grow tired and cease to read them. Finally, the object of their
reading is subjoined: first of all, in general, that they may learn to fear God
and keep His statutes; and, secondly, lest, being lifted up with pride and
vanity, they should despise and oppress their brethren. And the word <i>brethren
</i>is used designedly, lest they should imagine that the law of brotherhood was
abolished, because they were set over the whole people; but rather that they
should study to cherish all as members (of themselves.) Again, it is afterwards
repeated, lest they should "turn<i> </i>aside to the right hand or the left;"
because, when men have much liberty of action, their lusts can never be
sufficiently restrained. But, lest it should be grievous to them to be thus
reduced to order, finally God reminds them that this moderation would be useful
to them, for that they thus would prolong their reigns; whereas the tyranny of
kings is often their destruction; as the Lacedemonian king replied, when his
wife was annoyed that the Ephori were appointed to restrain him, "that he should
indeed leave less power to his children, but that it would be the more lasting.

their political government, is a Supplement to the First Commandment, enacting
that they should carry on their wars under the auspices of God, and, trusting in
His help, should follow Him as their leader. For it behoved them to give this
proof of their piety, so as to look to God not less in war than in peace, and
not to rest their hopes of safety on anything but the invocation of His name.
Whence we gather that the worship of God should be by no means passed over in
civil and earthly government; for, although its direct object is to preserve
mutual equity between men, yet religion always ought to hold the first, place.
The sum, therefore, is that, amidst the very clang of arms, they must not be in
such confusion as not to recognize that they are under the guardianship of God,
or to lose the confidence they will be safe in reliance on His power. He does
not, however, encourage them rashly to engage in war, but takes it for granted
that there is a legitimate cause for it; because this would be a gross abuse of
God's name, to seek a prosperous issue from Him, when we are engaged in anything
contrary to His command. But He forbids them to fear, although the enemy should
be superior in horses, in multitude, and in all their warlike array; and in
these words He reminds them that they would not be liable to suffer defeat,
because they were not supplied with abundance of chariots and horses; for we
have lately seen that not even their kings were permitted to collect the forces
in which the Gentile nations gloried; and therefore, lest the consciousness of
their weakness should make them afraid, God declares that His strength would be
a sufficient safeguard to them. And without question that passage in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
20:7, is taken from hence, "Some<i> </i>trust in chariots, and some in horses;
but we will remember the name of the Lord our God." On which score Isaiah
reproves the people, because, refusing the waters of Shiloah, they long for
great and rapid rivers; viz., as he elsewhere explains it, because they trust in
the horsemen of Egypt.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:6; 31:1.) But we must observe upon what their security is to be founded, viz.,
because the people ought to hope that the same Divine power would be with them
to the end, which their fathers had experienced when they were redeemed from
Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b><i>

exhortation to the priests, when the time of the conflict shall have arrived.
But we gather from the expressions used that this passage is supplementary to
the First Commandment, for it contains no more than that the priest should
encourage the Israelites to confidence, the ground of which is declared to be
the help of God in preserving and constantly protecting the Church, which He has
once redeemed. Moreover, He forbids their fears not in one word only, but heaps
many together, "let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither
be ye terrified."<i> </i>By this we are reminded how difficult it is to cure
that evil &#8212; fear, which in so many different ways assails and disturbs our
minds, that they should not rest in God. And surely we all experience that we
are troubled by such various besetments, that we have need of manifold remedies
for the establishment of our faith. We must observe, too, the familiar
representation<i> </i>of the presence of God, that He should go together with

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thee two trumpets of
silver.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage respecting the
silver trumpets, which gave the gathering-signal, so that the people should
always be attentive to the voice and will of God, is properly annexed to the
First Commandment. For God would have the Israelites set in motion by their
sound, whithersoever they were to go, so that they should not dare to commence
anything either in war or in peace, except under His guidance and auspices, as
it were. But their use was threefold, viz., to gather the people or the rulers
to public assemblies; to arm them against their enemies; and, thirdly, to
announce the sacrifices and festivals. It might seem absurd, and somewhat
indecorous, to appoint the priests to be trumpeters, since there was no splendor
or dignity in this office; but God would in this way awaken greater reverence in
the minds of the people, that the authority of the priests should precede all
their actions. For this office, to which they were appointed, was no servile
one, as that they should blow the trumpets at the command of others; but rather
did God thus set them over public affairs, that the people might not
tumultuously call their assemblies in the blindness and precipitation of
passion, but rather that modesty, gravity, and moderation should be observed in
them. We know how often in earthly affairs God is not regarded, but counsels are
confidently discussed without reference to His word. He testified, therefore, by
this employment of the priests, that all assemblies, except those in which He
should preside, were accursed. Profane nations also had their ceremonies, such
as auguries, supplications, soothsayings, victims,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because natural reason dictated that
nothing could be engaged in successfully without Divine assistance; but God
would have His people bound to Him in another way, so that, when called by the
sound of the sacred trumpets as by a voice from heaven, they should assemble to
holy and pious deliberations. The circumstance of the place also has the same
object. The door of the Tabernacle was to them, as if they placed themselves in
the sight; of God. We will speak of the
word</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">
d[wm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, mogned
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>elsewhere. Although it signifies
an appointed time, or place, and also an assembly of the people, I prefer
translating it <i>convention, </i>because God there in a solemn manner, as if
before His sacred tribunal, called the people to witness, or, according to
appointment, proceeded to make a covenant with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He was also unwilling that wars should be
undertaken precipitately, or with the desire of vengeance, but that the priests
should perform the office of heralds, (<i>feciales,</i>)<i> </i>in order that he
might be the originator of them himself. But it was honorable for the priests to
be the proclaimers of the festivals, and to cite the people to the sanctuary.
Now, since we understand the intention of the Legislator, let us briefly touch
upon the words. We have said that the priests, when they sounded, were, as it
were, the organs or interpreters of God, that the Israelites might depend upon
His voice and commandment. If the princes or heads of thousands only were to be
called, they sounded only once; if it was a convocation of the whole people,
they doubled the sound. A similar distinction was observed in war, that a
different signal should be given, according as the camps of either side were to
advance. Some use the fictitious word <i>taratantara,</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in place of what I have translated
"with jubilation:" it is probable that it was a louder and more protracted
sound, but blown with intervals. We must, however, observe the promise, which is
inserted, that the Israelites "should be remembered before the Lord," that He
should put their enemies to flight; not as if the safety or deliverance of the
people was attached to the trumpets, but because they did not go to the battle
except in reliance on God's aid. For the reality itself is conjoined with the
external symbol, viz., that they should fight under God, should follow Him as
their Leader, and should account all their strength to be in His grace. And that
all the saints were guided by this rule appears from

Also in the day of your gladness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
was as if God should make it manifest that He approved of no festivals, and that
no sacrifices pleased Him, except His command should go before them; for it was
not lawful for the people to choose this or that day, but the authority for
prescribing them was in the hands of the ministers of sacred things. And,
indeed, God Himself had appointed the New-moons (<i>Neomenias, vel
novilunia</i>)<i> </i>and the other solemnities; but, lest any change should
occur, since men are ever daring in their innovations, He would have their
lawful observation sanctioned by the sound of the trumpets; as if, by the mouth
of the priests, He Himself published the holy assemblies. The sacrifices, which
others have translated "of your peace-offerings,"

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven image.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the First Commandment,
after He had taught who was the true God, He commanded that He alone should e
worshipped; and now He defines what is His Legitimate Worship. Now, since these
are two distinct things, we conclude that the commandments are also distinct, in
which different things are treated of. The former indeed precedes in order,
viz., that believers are to be contented with one God; but it would not be
sufficient for us to be instructed to worship him alone, unless we also knew the
manner in which He would be worshipped. The sum is, that the worship of God must
be spiritual, in order that it may correspond with His nature. For although
Moses only speaks of idolatry, yet there is no doubt but that by <i>synecdoche,
</i>as in all the rest of the Law, he condemns all fictitious services which men
in their ingenuity have invented. For hence have arisen the carnal mixtures
whereby God's worship has been profaned, that they estimate Him according to
their own reason, and thus in a manner metamorphose Him. It is necessary, then,
to remember what God is, lest we should form any gross or earthly ideas
respecting Him. The words simply express that it is wrong
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f79
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for men to seek the presence of God in any
visible image, because He cannot be represented to our eyes. The command that
they should not make any likeness, either of any thing which is in heaven, or in
the earth, or in the waters under the earth, is derived from the evil custom
which had everywhere prevailed; for, since superstition is never uniform, but is
drawn aside in various directions, some thought that God was represented under
the form of fishes, others under that of birds, others in that of brutes; and
history especially recounts by what shameless delusions Egypt was led astray.
And hence too the vanity of men is declared, since, whithersoever they turn
their eyes, they everywhere lay hold of the materials of error, notwithstanding
that God's glory shines on every side, and whatever is seen above or below,
invites us to the true God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since, therefore,
men are thus deluded, so as to frame for themselves the materials of error from
all things they behold, Moses now elevates them above the whole fabric and
elements of the world; for by the things that are "in<i> </i>heaven above," he
designates not only the birds, but the sun, and the moon, and all the stars
also; as will soon be seen. He declares, then, that a true image of God is not
to be found in all the world; and hence that His glory is defiled, and His truth
corrupted by the lie, whenever He is set before our eyes in a visible form. Now
we must remark, that there are two parts in the Commandment &#8212; the <i>first
</i>forbids the erection of a graven image, or any likeness; the <i>second
</i>prohibits the transferring of the worship which God claims for Himself
alone, to any of these phantoms or delusive shows. Therefore, to devise any
image of God, is in itself impious; because by this corruption His Majesty is
adulterated, and He is figured to be other than He is. There is no need of
refuting the foolish fancy of some, that all sculptures and pictures are here
condemned by Moses, for he had no other object than to rescue God's glory from
all the imaginations which tend to corrupt it. And assuredly it is a most gross
indecency to make God like a stock or a stone. Some expound the words, "Thou<i>
</i>shalt not make to thyself a graven image, which thou mayest adore;"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if it were allowable to make a visible
image of God, provided it be not adored; but the expositions which will follow
will easily refute their error. Meanwhile, I do not deny that these things are
to be taken connectedly, since superstitious worship is hardly ever separated
from the preceding error; for as soon as any one has permitted himself to devise
an image of God, he immediately falls into false worship. And surely whosoever
reverently and soberly feels and thinks about God Himself, is far from this
absurdity; nor does any desire or presumption to metamorphose God ever creep in,
except when coarse and carnal imaginations occupy our minds. Hence it comes to
pass, that those, who frame for themselves gods of corruptible materials,
superstitiously adore the work of their own hands. I will then readily allow
these two things, which are inseparable, to be joined together; only let us
recollect that God is insulted, not only when His worship is transferred to
idols, but when we try to represent Him by any outward
similitude.</font><br></div>

Ceremonies Of Worship; and then adds immediately afterwards the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">db[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnabad, </i>which means properly <i>to serve. </i>Hence we conclude that they
make a childish endeavor at evasion, when they pay only the honor of <i>service
</i>to pictures and statues. But if we grant them what they desire, not even so
will they escape; because the prohibition is equivalent to God's declaring that
He will not be worshipped in wood and stone, or in any other likeness. For
unbelievers have never been carried away to such an extent of folly as to adore
mere statues or pictures; they have always alleged the same pretext which
now-a-days is rife in the mouths of the Papists, viz., that not the image itself
was actually worshipped, but that which it represented. But the Spirit
everywhere reproves them for worshipping gods of wood and stone, since God
rejects that carnal worship which unbelievers offer before stocks and stones. If
any one should ask them, whom they have it in their mind to worship, they will
immediately reply, that they offer to God that honor which they pay to pictures
and statues. But this frivolous excuse comes to nothing; because to erect<i>
</i>the idol before which they prostrate themselves, is really to deny the true
God; and, therefore, no wonder that He should declare that unbelievers worship
wood and stone, when they worship in that wood and stone phantoms of their own
imagination. And we have already said, that all rites which do not accord with
the spiritual worship of God, are here forbidden: and this is enough, and more
than enough to put to flight all such misty notions,
(<i>nebulas.</i>)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I the
Lord thy God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>partly terrifies
them by threats, and partly attracts them by sweet promises, in order to keep
them in the way of duty. In the earlier expressions He convicts them of
ingratitude, if they prostitute themselves to idolatry, when they had been
chosen to be a peculiar and holy people. He afterwards inspires them with
terror, by the denunciation of punishment; and, finally, allures them with the
hope of reward, if they obediently abide in the pure worship of God. Nor does He
affirm that He will be severe or kind to individuals only, but extends both to
their posterity, although, as we shall afterwards see, not equally. I have
indeed assigned another place to the promises and threatenings, whereby the
authority of the whole Law is sanctioned; but since this clause is annexed to a
particular Commandment,. it could not be conveniently separated from it. The
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>el, </i>some translate appellatively, <i>mighty; </i>but since God is so
called from His might, I have preferred following this meaning,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is more suitable here. Yet I do not
think that Moses used various names without reason; for when he had first
employed the name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>elohim, </i>he soon afterwards honors God by another title, and magnifies His
power, that He may be feared. And for this reason he also calls Him <i>the
Rival,</i> </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, as some not inaptly translate
it, the <i>jealous; </i>for to give the name of "the<i> </i>envious"
(<i>obtrectatoris</i>)<i> </i>to God, as somebody has done, is not only silly,
but monstrous. This is the word by which Cicero renders
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zhlotupi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>expressing by it the sin of guilty
rivalry, when one person envies the superiority of another. But God is here set
before us in the character of a husband, who suffers no rival; or if it be
preferred to extend the meaning of the word, He is called the assertor of His
rights; since His rivalry is nothing more than retaining what is His own, and
thus excluding all the rivals of His honor. Because mention has lately been made
of His sacred covenant with the Jews, Moses seems to allude to the violation of
this spiritual marriage. But although he begins with threatening, still, far
preferring mercy to His severity, He rather gently allures them, than compels
them by fear, to allegiance; for He declares that He will be merciful even to a
thousand generations; whilst He only denounces punishment on the thirds and
fourths, (for thus it is literally expressed,) <i>i.e., </i>on their grandsons
and great-grandsons. In order, therefore, to encourage His worshippers to
earnest piety, He declares that He will be kind, not only to themselves, but to
their posterity, even for a thousand generations. But this is the proof of His
inestimable kindness, and even indulgence, that He deigns to bind Himself to His
servants, to whom He owes nothing, so far as to acknowledge, in His favor
towards them, their seed also for His people. For hence it appears, that it is
wrong to infer merit from the promised reward, because He does not say that He
will be faithful or just towards the keepers of His Law, but merciful. Let then
the most perfect come forward, and he can require nothing better of God than
that He should be favorable to him on the grounds of His gratuitous liberality.
For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesed, </i>is equivalent to kindness, or beneficence; but when it is applied
to God, it generally signifies mercy, or paternal favor, and the blessings which
flow from it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since, then, He here promises that
He will shew mercy, it is as much as to say that He will be beneficent, or will
deal with clemency. Hence it follows, that the main source of reward is that.
gratuitous beneficence wherewith He liberally blesses His people. Now, when it
is said, "unto them that love me,"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the fountain and origin of true
righteousness is expressed; for the external observation of the Law would be of
no avail unless it flowed from hence. And praise is given to love rather than to
fear, because God is delighted with none but voluntary obedience, but He rejects
that which is forced and servile, as we shall again see elsewhere. But because
hypocrites also boast that they love God, whilst their life corresponds not with
the profession of their lips, the two things are here distinctly connected;
viz., that the true servants of God love Him, and keep His commandments,
<i>i.e., </i>make effectual proof of their piety. But here a difficult question
arises, for the history of all ages shews that a great proportion of the progeny
of the holy have been rejected and condemned; and that God has inflicted upon
them weightier manifestations of His curse and vengeance, than upon strangers.
We must, however, observe, that in these words grace is not promised severally
to all the posterity of the saints, as if God were bound to each individual who
may derive their race and original from them. There were many degenerate
children of Abraham, to whom it profited nothing that they were called the
offspring of the holy patriarch; nor indeed is the promise restricted to
individuals, for many who are children after the flesh, are not counted for the
seed &#8212; but God in His free election adopts whom He will, yet so governs
His judgments, as that His paternal favor should always abide with the race of
believers. Besides, the fruits of this promised grace are manifested in temporal
blessings; and thus although God severely avenged the sins of the children of
Abraham, and at length when their impiety shewed itself to be desperate,
renounced them, yet did He not fail to be kind to them for a thousand
generations. For again, God fulfills and performs what He here promised by the
outward testimonies of His favor, although they turn to the destruction of the
reprobate. Thus He was merciful to the race of Abraham, as long as he saw fit to
leave them the Law, the Prophets, the Temple, and other exercises of religion.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, again, it. will be well for us to
consider how far even the holiest fall short of the perfect keeping of the Law,
and perfect love of God; and therefore we need not wonder if they experience in
many respects the failure of this grace, and only enjoy some slight taste of it.
In any case, the goodness of God ever superabounds, so that His grace, if it
does not shine with full splendor, still appears in bright sparks unto a
thousand generations. As to the opposite clause, wherein God limits His
vengeance to the third or fourth generation, we see how He prefers to attract
men to duty by gentle invitations, than by terrifying threatenings to extort
from them more than they are willing to do; inasmuch as He extends His mercy
further than the severity of His judgment. We must also observe that the
transgressors of the Law are called the enemies and <i>haters </i>of God. It is
surely horrible, and almost monstrous impiety to hate God; and scarcely would
any one be found so wicked as openly to declare Him to be his enemy; yet it is
not without a cause that God pronounces thus harshly respecting their impiety;
for since He cannot be separated from His justice, a contempt of the Law
convicts men of this hatred; for it is impossible that they should not wish to
deprive Him of His dominion, who endure Him not as a Lawgiver and a
Judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino">"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
visit iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>" is equivalent to
inquiring into them, or taking cognizance of them, in order that punishment
should be inflicted in proportion to the crime; for as long as God spares men
and suspends His judgment, He seems to connive at them, or to pay no attention
to them. Therefore, when men shall think that their sin is buried, He declares
that He will bear it in memory. But it may be asked, how it is consistent for
God to exact punishment from the children or grandchildren on account of the
sins of their fathers? for nothing is more unreasonable than that the innocent
and guilty should be involved in the same punishment; and the declaration of the
Prophet is well known,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The son
shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
iniquity of the son; but the soul that sinneth, it shall die."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
18:20.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The difficulty, which arises from the
words of the Prophet, is easily solved, for God therein refutes the wicked
expostulation of the people, that their children, who were not in fault, were
unjustly and cruelly exposed to punishment. The proverb was generally rife, that
"the<i> </i>fathers had eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on
edge;" but God replies, that not one of those with whom He<i> </i>was angry and
severe was free from crime; and, therefore, that their complaint was false,
since each<i> </i>of them received the recompense of his own iniquity. And this
is most true, that God's severity never assails the innocent; and however the
world may murmur against His judgments, that He will always be clear in
condemning this person or
that</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">.
f87</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">But when God declares that He will
cast back the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of the children, He does
not mean that He will take vengeance on poor wretches who have never deserved
anything of the sort; but that He is at liberty to punish the crimes of the
fathers upon their children and descendants, with the proviso that they too may
be justly punished, as being the imitators of their fathers. If any should
object, that this is nothing more than to repay every one according to his
works, we must remember that, &#8212; whenever God blinds the children of the
ungodly, casts them into a state of reprobation, (<i>conjicit in sesum
reprobum</i>)<i>, </i>and smites them with a spirit of madness or folly, so that
they give themselves up to foul desires, and hasten to their final destruction,
&#8212; in this way the iniquity of the fathers is visited on their children.
But suppose other punishments are added, all are under condemnation
(<i>convicti,</i> so that they have no ground for murmuring against God; and
even then also God still proceeds to execute the vengeance which He here
denounces; for, when He would direct one work to various objects, He uses
wonderful and secret<i> </i>expedients. When He commanded the people of Canaan
to be destroyed, it is certain that those, who then were living, were worthy of
this punishment; yet, inasmuch as God foretold
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that their iniquities were not yet full,
we infer that He then inflicted the punishment upon them which He had deferred
for 400 years. On this ground, Christ declares that the Jews of His time were
guilty of all the blood that had been shed from that of Abel to the blood of
Zacharias, the son of Barachias,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402335&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:35.) But if it be not agreeable to our judgment that God should repay every
one according to his deserts, and yet that He at the same time requires the sins
of their fathers of the children, we should remember that His judgments are a
great depth; and, therefore, if anything in His dealings is incomprehensible to
us, we must bow to it with sobriety and reverence. But since this doctrine will
recur elsewhere, I have thought fit only to touch upon it lightly here. One
question remains, how we can reconcile the statement of Paul, that the fifth
commandment is the first with promise,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:2,) whereas a promise is annexed to this second. The solution of this is easy;
for if you duly consider, this promise, which we have now explained, is not
peculiarly annexed to any single commandment, but is common to the whole first
Table of the Law, and these refer to the whole service of God; but when it is
said, "honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long," the keeping
of that commandment is particularly and specially sanctioned.</font><br></div>

statues, and pictures, by the name of gods, he shews the object and sum of the
Second Commandment, viz., that God is insulted when He is clothed in a corporeal
image. Moreover, the name of God is transferred to idols, according to common
parlance, and the corrupt opinion of the Gentiles; not that unbelievers thought
that the Deity was included in the corruptible material, but because they
imagined that it was nearer to them, if some earthly symbol of its presence were
standing before their eyes. In this sense, they called the images of the gods
their gods; because they thought they could not ascend to the heights in which
the Deity dwelt, unless they mounted by these earthly aids. There is no doubt
but that he comprehends by <i>synecdoche, </i>all kinds of images, when he
forbids the making of molten gods; because metal is no more abominated by God
than wood, or stone, or any other material, out of which idols are usually made;
but, inasmuch as the insane zeal of superstition is the more inflamed by the
value of the material or the beauty of the workmanship, Moses especially
condemned molten gods. All question on this point is removed by the fourth
passage here cited, wherein the Israelites are forbidden to make gods of silver
or gold, viz., because idolaters indulge themselves more fully in their worship
of very precious idols, by the external splendor of which all their senses are
ravished. To the same effect is the third passage, in which mention is not, only
made of graven images, but there is also added the name of a statue
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or figured stone; for, although some
expound these words as referring to a pavement, yet I have no doubt but that all
monuments are included in them, wherein foolish men think that they have God in
some measure visible, and therefore that they express all sculptures and
pictures by which the spiritual worship of God is corrupted. For the object of
Moses is to restrain the rashness of men, lest they should travesty God's glory
by their imaginations; for another clause is immediately added, "I<i> </i>am the
Lord your <i>God,</i>"<i> </i>in which God reminds them that He is despoiled of
His due honor, whenever men devise anything earthly or carnal respecting Him.

f90 </font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>matsebah, </i>is sometimes used in a
good sense; whence it follows, that no other statues are here condemned, except
those which are erected as representations of God. The same also is the case as
to the polished stone,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> viz., when it receives a consecration,
which may attract men's minds to regard it in a religious light, so as to
worship God in the stone. But both in the second and third passages, Moses
teaches men that as soon as they imagine anything gross or terrestrial in the
deity, they altogether depart from the true God. And this is also expressed in
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylyla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>elilim, </i>which embraces in it statues, stones, and graven images, as well

have rendered it<i> </i>"idols."<i> </i>It is plain, that the false
representations, which travesty God, are so called to mark them with disgrace
and ignominy. But, since the superstitious cease not to gloss over their errors
with cavils, God is not content with this opprobrious name, but adds others
also, respecting which their pretext was more specious; that we may know that
whatsoever withdraws us from His spiritual service, or whatsoever men introduce
alien from His nature, is repudiated by Him. In the fourth passage, the
<i>antithesis </i>must be noted, which will presently be explained more fully,
viz., when God forbids them to make gods of corruptible materials, since He has
"spoken<i> </i>from heaven;"<i> </i>in which words He signifies that all are
doing wrong, who, when they ought to look up to heaven, tie down their own minds
as well as Him to earthly elements.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a confirmation of the Second
Commandment, that God manifested Himself to the Israelites by a voice, and not
in a bodily form; whence it follows that those who are not contented with His
voice, but seek His visible form, substitute imaginations and phantoms in His
place. But here arises a difficult question, for God made Himself known to the
patriarchs in other ways besides by His voice alone; thus Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob knew Him not only by hearing, but by sight. Moses himself saw Him in the
midst of the burning bush; and He also manifested Himself to the Prophets under
visible figures. Since it would be superfluous to heap together many citations,
let the remarkable vision of Isaiah suffice, which is related in (Isaiah 6), and
those of Ezekiel, which we read of in (Ezekiel 1 and Ezekiel 10) And yet God was
not forgetful of Himself, when He thus presented Himself to the sight of His
servants. Wherefore, this argument does not appear to be valid and good, that it
is sinful to represent God in a visible image, because His voice was once heard
without His being seen; when, on the other side, it is easy to object that
visible forms have often been exhibited, wherein He testified His presence. The
solution is twofold: first, that, although God may have invested Himself in
certain forms for the purpose of manifesting Himself, this must be accounted as
a peculiar circumstance, and not be taken as a general rule; secondly, that the
visions shewn to the patriarchs were testimonies of His invisible glory, rather
to elevate men's minds to things above than to keep them entangled amongst
earthly elements. In the promulgation of His Law, God first prescribed what
believers must follow; because He saw that this was the best method
(<i>compendium</i>)<i> </i>for retaining the minds of His people in true
religion, and at the same time the best remedy for idolatry. Unless we submit to
this counsel of God, we shall not only betray a licentious spirit of contention,
but shall run directly against God, like butting bulls. For it was not in vain
that Moses laid down this principle, that when God collected to Himself a
Church, and handed down a certain and inviolable rule for holy living, He had
not invested Himself in a bodily shape, but had exhibited the living image of
His glory in the doctrine itself. Hence we may conclude that all those who seek
for God in a visible figure, not only decline, but actually revolt, from the
true study of piety.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any one should object
that God is not inconsistent with Himself, and yet, as has been said, that He
has more than once taken upon Himself a visible form, the reply is simple and
easy, that, whenever He appeared to the patriarchs in a visible form, He gave a
temporary sign, which still was by no means contradictory of this commandment.
Isaiah saw the Lord of hosts sitting on His throne; yet he boldly cries out as
from the mouth of God, "To whom will ye liken me?"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
60:25.) Nor need I repeat how constantly he speaks against idolaters; certainly
he inveighs more strongly than any of the prophets against the folly, nay, the
madness of those who make to themselves any image of God; because they thus turn
truth into falsehood; and finally he assumes the same principle as that of
Moses, that the true nature of God is corrupted by tricks and delusions if a
corruptible thing be called His image. But what was His vision itself? The
seraphim, who surrounded God's throne, sufficiently shewed by their covering
their faces with their wings that the sight of Him could not be borne by
mortals. As to what Ezekiel relates, no painter could represent it; for God has
always appeared distinguished from the shape of any creature by those marks
which surpass man's apprehension. This conclusion, therefore, always remains
sure, that no image is suitable to God, because He would not be perceived by His
people otherwise than in a voice. But then also fire was a symbol of His
presence, yet He testified by it that His glory is incomprehensible, and thus
would prevent men from idol-making. We have elsewhere explained what it is "to
guard themselves as to their souls."
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But we infer, from his anxious
exhortations, that they should take heed, how great is the leaning of the human
soul to idolatry. This is the tendency of that attestation against them, which I
have inserted from (Deuteronomy 8); for Moses not only threatens them, but, as
if summoning witnesses according to the custom of solemn trials, denounces that
they shall perish, in order to inspire them with greater fear by this earnest
mode of address. Whence it appears that this insane lust (of idolatry) is not to
be repressed by ordinary means. With the same object he says that they are
"corrupted, or corrupt themselves," who make any similitude of God. Thus Paul
also declares that in this way the truth is changed into a lie,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:25;) and Jeremiah and Habakkuk condemn images for their falsehood.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:14;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:18.) No wonder, then, that an idol should be called the "corruption" of men,
since it adulterates the worship of God; and it is a most just recompense to
those who pollute the pure and perfect knowledge of God, that they should be
thence infected with a rottenness which consumes their souls. Hence, also, the
stupid ignorance of the Papists is confuted who confine this prohibition to the
ancient people, as if it were now permitted to paint or to sculpture (images of
God) </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if they had been Jews whom Paul was
addressing, when he reasoned from the common origin of our nature: "Forasmuch as
we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto
gold or silver," or corruptible matter.

f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is no necessity for entering into
details; but the Spirit declares no less plainly now that we must keep ourselves
from idols,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:21,) than He of old forbade their being made. Moreover, it was an act of
diabolical madness to make away with one of the Ten Commandments, in order that
they might rush into this foul and detestable extravagance with impunity. They
pretend that the Jews were formerly prohibited from idolatry with greater
strictness, because they were too much disposed to it, as if they were not
themselves much worse in this respect. But, setting aside this, who does not see
that the vice of superstition, which is natural to the human mind, was corrected
by this remedy? Until, therefore, men have laid aside their nature, we infer
that this Commandment is necessary for
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And lest thou lift up thine eyes.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Moses proceeds further, lest the Jews should
imagine any divinity in the sun, and moon, and stars; nor does he only recall
them from the error with which many were imbued,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> thinking that these were so many gods;
but also anticipates another superstition, lest, being ravished by the
brightness of the stars, they should conceive them to be <i>images </i>of God.
And to this the expression, to "be<i> </i>driven," refers. For since God
represents His glory in the heavenly host, so also Satan, under this pretext,
confuses and stupefies men's minds by a wily artifice, in order that they may
worship God in these luminaries, and thus stumble at the very threshold.
Therefore, that the Israelites may the better acknowledge how absurd it is to
seek for God in earthly things, or in the elements of the world, or in
corruptible matter, he expressly declares that they must not even lean
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> on heavenly creatures; since God's
majesty is superior to the sun, and moon, and all the stars. Besides, he
reproves the absurdity of transferring the worship of God to the stars, which,
by God's appointment, are to minister to us; for when he says that "God hath
divided them unto all nations," it implies subjection; as if he had said that
the sun was our minister, and the moon, together with all the stars, our
handmaid. Still, by the word "divided," God's admirable providence is fitly
commended in respect to their varied position, and course, and different
offices; for the sun does not enlighten and warm all lands at the same moment;
and, again, it now retires from us, and now approaches us more closely; the moon
has her circuits; the stars rise and set as the heaven revolves. I pass over the
slower movement of the planets; but, according to the aspect of the stars, one
climate is moister, another drier; one feels more heat, another more cold. This
variety is aptly called by Moses "dividing<i>.</i>"<i> </i>Yet it aggravates the
sin of superstition, if the Jews give themselves to the service of the stars,
which minister also to heathen nations; for what can be more unworthy than for
the children of God to worship the sun, which is the servant of all the world?
whence again it follows, that in proportion to the dignity and excellence of the
creatures themselves, so is the ingratitude of men towards God all the more
base, if they adorn with His worship as with spoils, those creatures which He
has appointed to minister to their advantage. The silly notion in which some of
the Rabbins delight themselves,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is unworthy of mention, viz., that God
has divided the stars to the Gentiles, since they are subject to their
influences, from which by special privilege the Jews are free; as if the
condition of the human race had not been the same from the beginning. But the
reason which I have adduced plainly shews, that they depart most widely from the
meaning of Moses, and therefore pervert his intention; viz., that the creatures
which are destined for our use, are by no means to be worshipped as

the sense, that he should first of all altogether forbid that idols should be
made; and, secondly, speak only of worshipping and adoring them; for it is
already in itself a wicked error to attribute any image to God; and another
superstition always accompanies it, that God is always improperly worshipped in
this visible symbol. There is a strong confirmation here of what I have
previously stated, that whatever holds down and confines our senses to the
earth, is contrary to the covenant of God; in which, inviting us to Himself, He
permits us to think of nothing but what is spiritual, and therefore sets His
voice against all the imaginations, whereby heathen nations have always been
deceived; because they have been deprived of the light of that doctrine which
would direct them to the heavenly greatness of God Himself. But those who have
been taught by God's Law, not only that He alone is to be worshipped, but that
He may not be represented by any visible effigy, are justly accounted
covenant-breakers, if they do not confine themselves within these bounds; for
they violate that Second Commandment (<i>caput</i>)<i> </i>by which they are
commanded to worship God spiritually; and consequently are forbidden to make to
themselves likenesses, or images, whereby they would deface and pollute His
glory. At the end of the verse, which some translate "the<i> </i>likeness, which
your God. hath <i>forbidden,</i>"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher,</i> must be taken, as in many other places, as an adverb of
comparison. The meaning of Moses is indeed by no means obscure; viz., that we
must simply obey God's word; and that we must not dispute whether what He has
forbidden is lawful or not; and that no other rule of right is to be sought for,
except that we should follow what He has prescribed. Let the Papists dispute as
they please, that images are not to be removed because they are useful for the
people's instruction; but let this be our wisdom, to acquiesce in what God has
chosen to decree in this matter. Although the threat which is subjoined might
have been placed amongst the sanctions, which we shall hereafter consider in
their proper place, yet I have been unwilling to separate it from the Second
Commandment, to which it is annexed. A confirmation is added in Deuteronomy;
viz., that God, who has not spared foreign nations, will much less pardon His
people; inasnmch as it is a greater crime, and fouler ingratitude to forsake God
when once He is known, and to cast aside the teaching of His Law, than to follow
errors handed down from our forefathers. I have already explained in what sense
He is called a "jealous God;"<i> </i>but in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:14, Moses has not deemed it sufficient simply to honor God with this title;
but, in amplification, he has added that this is His name, in order that we may
know that He can no more bear a companion, or a rival, to be compared with Him,
than He can cast away His Godhead, or deny Himself. He compares Him to fire, to
increase our terror of Him. We know how audaciously the world indulges itself in
superstitions; so that, as if in very<i> </i>sport, it metamorphoses God just as
fancy leads. Wherefore, in order to incline men's minds to reverence, he sets
before us in this figure God's fearful vengeance; as though He would instantly
consume them, just as fire consumes stubble, if they shall have dared to think
of God otherwise than is right.</font><br></div>

same thing, viz., that they should diligently take heed, he indirectly arraigns
man's proneness to superstition; and this too is again expressed in the words,
"that your heart be not deceived;"<i> </i>for by them he signifies, that unless
they take diligent heed to themselves, nothing will be more easy than for them
to fall into the snares of Satan. Wherefore the impudence of the Papists is the
less excusable, who intoxicate their own and others' minds with security, when
God constantly exhorts them to solicitude. Let us learn, then, that since many
impostures and deceits besiege us on every side, we shall in the vanity of our
nature be liable immediately to fall into them, unless we carefully guard
ourselves. By the expression "turn aside," he implies what has been before said,
that whosoever declines to corrupted worship, impiously falls away from the true
God. Unbelievers but little think so, for with them it is a light transgression
to exceed in this respect; and they would wilfully blind the eyes of God with
their inventions (<i>commentis</i>)<i>, </i>nay, there is nothing too silly for
them to desire to be approved of, and sanctioned by God. But if it be objected
that obedience is better than sacrifice<i>, </i>they shield themselves under the
cover of their good intention, as if God were not at liberty to repudiate what
they foolishly obtrude upon Him. At any rate, they so pertinaciously indulge
themselves in their inconsiderate zeal, that they will hardly acknowledge the
slightest fault in it. But, on the other side, God declares<i> </i>that all are
apostates who do not confine themselves to the simplicity of the Law. A threat
is again added, that God will avenge the violation of His worship, and will
curse their land, until He shall destroy them by dearth and famine; and,
finally, He pronounces that they shall perish off that land which God had
promised them to the end that He might be there purely
worshipped.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall not do so unto the
Lord your God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The principal
distinction, as far as regards the external exercises of devotion, is here laid
down between the legitimate worship of God, and all the fictitious rites which
the Gentiles have invented; viz., that God would have but one sanctuary and one
altar, which might be a symbol of the difference between Himself and all idols;
and thus that true religion should have no affinity to superstitions. To this
refers the prohibition, that the Israelites should not conduct themselves
towards God as the Gentiles did towards their idols; but that a barrier should
be raised, which would separate
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> them from the whole world. The whole
external profession of God's worship is fitly annexed to the Second Commandment,
because upon that it depends, and has no other object than its due observation.
But when I begin to speak of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the sacrifices,
I am entering on a deep and vast ocean, in which many interpreters, whilst
indulging their curiosity, have pursued a wild and wandering course. Admonished,
therefore, by their example, I will take in my sails, and only touch upon a few
points which tend to edification in the faith. But my readers must now be
requested, not only to pardon me for abstaining from subtle speculations, but
also themselves willingly to keep within the bounds of simplicity. Many have
itching ears; and in our natural vanity, most men are more delighted by foolish
allegories, than by solid erudition. But let those who shall desire to profit in
God's school, learn to restrain this perverse desire of knowing more than is
good for them, although it may tickle their minds. Now let us consider the words
of
Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But unto the place which the Lord your God shall
choose.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is asked why God would have
sacrifices offered to Him only on one altar? Besides the reason which I have
lately advanced, it is not to be doubted but that He in this way had regard to
believers, that He might cherish in them an agreement in the unity of the faith.
This place, then, was like a standard to gather together the people, lest their
religion should be torn by divisions, and lest any diversities should insinuate
themselves. Moreover, God, by claiming His right and authority to choose the
place, commends obedience, on which also the purity of worship depends. But,
again, another question arises; because, before the time of David, the Ark had
nowhere a fixed resting-place, but traveled about, as it were, to various
lodgings, therefore, if the chosen place is understood to be Mount Zion, the
people were free in the intermediate time to perform the sacrifices wherever
they pleased. I reply, that the place was not, chosen until the Ark was placed
in Zion; for not till then was fulfilled what is said in the
Psalm,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I was glad when they said
unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord; our feet shall stand within thy
gates, O
Jerusalem,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
122:1-2;)</font><br><font face="Palatino">in which words the Prophet intimates
that there was before no resting-place, because God had not yet pointed out the
place in which He would be worshipped. Therefore it is expressly said, "out of
all your tribes," or "in<i> </i>one of your tribes," whereby a special privilege
is referred to, which was to be conferred on one of their tribes, to the
exclusion of the others. And to this relates what is said in another
Psalm,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Moreover he refused the
tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of
Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved: and he built his sanctuary like high
<i>palaces, </i>like the earth, which he hath established for
ever."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197867&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
78:67-69<i>.</i>)</font><br><font face="Palatino">To the same effect the
faithful elsewhere congratulate themselves, after the Ark was deposited with
David, "We will go into his tabernacles, we will worship at his footstool;" and,
on the other hand, the Spirit
declares,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord hath chosen
Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will
I dwell; for I have desired it<i>.</i>"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:13-14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Similar statements everywhere occur,
confirming the opinion that the Ark never rested in its true home until it was
deposited on Zion; and God, in my judgment, in order that He might keep the hope
of His people in suspense, promised, although the Ark changed its place from
time to time, that He had still determined on a perpetual abode in which it
should rest. Yet it does not therefore follow that, up to that period, a free
permission was given to the people to sacrifice wherever they would. For,
wherever the sanctuary was, there was also a temporary choice of the place,
until the legitimate resting-place was shewn them. Therefore God, chastising by
Jeremiah the foolish confidence by which the Jews were puffed up,
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Go ye now unto my place,
which was in Shiloh,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and see what I
did to it," etc.,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
7:12;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">in which words he implies that Shiloh had been highly
honored for a season, but had now been deprived of its honor, because the
sacrifices had there been unworthily
polluted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although, then, there is a special
promise here concerning Zion, still there is no doubt but that God in the
meantime confines the Jews to His sanctuary, lest any one should erect a private
altar for himself, or build for himself other cities and other temples. The
phrase is worthy of observation, "to put his name there; " and again, "his
habitation." The gross imaginations of men are thus obviated, lest the people
should enclose God within walls, as they are wont to circumscribe His infinite
essence, or to draw Him down from heaven, and to place Him beneath the elements
of the world. But God's name is said to inhabit a place, not in His own nature,
but with reference to man; whilst, in deference to their ignorance, He sets
before their eyes a visible symbol of His presence. Thus He is often said to
"come<i> </i>down," not as if He, who fills heaven and earth, actually moved,
but because the familiar knowledge of Him brings Him near to men. But although
He allows Himself to be invoked on earth, yet He would not have the minds of men
rest there, but rather lifts them up on high as if by steps. Therefore, by
Isaiah, He harshly chides them, because, although enwrapped in their sins, they
still thought that He was under obligation to them because His temple was in
their sight,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:1,) whereas it is our business to approach Him by faith and with serious
feelings when He extends His hand to us. The Ark of the Covenant indeed is often
called "His face;"<i> </i>but, lest men should form any gross or earthly
conceptions of Him, the sanctuary is also called "His
footstool."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The various kinds of oblations which
are here enumerated will be hereafter more clearly explained. I will only
briefly remind you that the burnt-offerings are included in the sacrifices, as a
part is taken for the whole. The Hebrew word, which we have translated "the
elevating of the hand," is,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmwrt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>therumah, </i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to which another word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpwnt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thenuphah, </i>is often added; but, although both are derived from the act of
elevating, still they seem to differ, and those skilled in the language thus
distinguish them, viz., that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmwrt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>therumah, </i>is to be lifted up, and then brought down; and,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpwnt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thanuphah, </i>to be turned at the same time to the right and left, although
others think it means to be turned round to the four quarters of the globe.
There is a difference between vows and freewill-offerings; for although a vow is
at first freely made, yet we may offer things which we have not vowed. I have
already spoken of the
firstlings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there shall ye
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see that the sanctuary in which
God manifested Himself is called His face;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for, although believers are taught that
always, wherever they dwell, they walk before God; yet they placed themselves
nearer, and in some special manner in His sight, when they approached His
sanctuary. By this mode of speaking God also stimulates the laziness or
tardiness of the people, lest it should be irksome to them to come to the Ark of
the Covenant for the purpose of sacrificing, inasmuch as this inestimable
benefit would compensate for the labor and expense of the journey. I have
elsewhere shewn that, when men are said to feast before the Lord, sacred feasts
are thus distinguished from our daily meals. For this was as it were an
accessory to the sacrifices, to eat what remained of the victims; and in this
way the guests were made partakers of the offering, which custom even heathen
nations imitated, though improperly. Again, God kindly invites them when He
says, "ye shall rejoice in all that thou puttest thine hands unto," for which
some translate it, "in<i> </i>everything to which you shall have sent your hand;
" literally it is, "in<i> </i>the sending forth of the land." There is no
ambiguity in the sense, for it refers to those works which require the motion
and application of the hands. A little below, where I have translated it, "which
he hath blessed," (<i>quibus benedixerit,</i>)<i> </i>some insert the
proposition <i>in, </i>and supply the pronoun <i>you, </i>(<i>i.e., in </i>which
he hath blessed <i>you;</i>)<i> </i>but it is quite appropriate to say, that God
blesses their works, although it may be understood of their families also. As to
the command that the tithes should be eaten in the holy place, I do not extend
it to tithes in
general,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">  f106

adding the reason, viz., that they had not yet entered into the rest which the
Lord had promised them. He shews them, then, that when they shall have attained
the tranquil possession of the land, there would be no further room for excuse
if they should sacrifice wheresoever it pleased them. When, therefore, it is
said that they then did "ever<i>y </i>man whatsoever was right in his own eyes,"
it does not extend to any of the inventions which men devise for themselves in
the worship of God, but only points out a freer system and form in the exercise

is declared at the end of the verse, that God would give them rest round about,
so that they should dwell in safety, was not in fact perfectly exhibited before

but the other sense is more simple, that all the vows were comprised which every
one had made of his own free judgment and choice. Soon afterwards he more fully
expresses his meaning, when he prohibits them from offering sacrifices of their
own accord in any places that might please them; for, "to see a

be brought into the place of the sanctuary; although by the place which God
shall choose, he designates Jerusalem, as has been said in the above commentary
on chap. 12.; for the Ark of the Covenant had no settled resting-place until the
time of David, but was received as it were in temporary lodgings. Moses,
therefore, now commands, that when God shall have so greatly honored a
particular place, and shall have chosen a perpetual rest, in which His name
shall dwell, thither are the offerings to be brought. But we know that this
place was Jerusalem; and all the oblations were restricted to this one place,
lest any corruption should creep in to destroy the unity of the faith. For all
strange inventions, as has already been sufficiently seen, are so many
profanations of God's worship. But, whereas in chap. 12, Moses had promiscuously
joined the tithes with the firstlings, and had made the same appointment with
respect to both, he now relaxes the stringency of that law, by adding an
exception, viz, that if the way should be too long, a commutation might be made,
and money might be paid instead of corn. He does not, indeed, speak only of the
tithes, but unites with them the vows and free-gifts; nay, he refers properly to
these alone. But, since as to the latter there is no question, let us only
consider whether it was consistent that the tithes should be paid in one place
alone. They were given to the Levites for their maintenance, who, as is well
known, were dispersed throughout the whole land; either then their residence
must have been fixed at Jerusalem, or they must not be deprived of their
subsistence, wherever they might dwell. The command, therefore, appears to be
absurd, that all the tithes of the whole land should be brought to Jerusalem,
for that would have amounted to nothing less than to destroy the poor Levites by
famine. This absurdity has compelled the commentators to fabricate a doubtful
conjecture; viz., that the people voluntarily set apart certain tithes, which
they might carry to Jerusalem at the festivals; but it is not probable that so
heavy a burden was imposed upon them,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as that they should only keep at home
what remained of the fifth part. But a nearer approach to probability would be,
that the tithes of the neighboring country, as convenience offered, were carried
to Jerusalem; whilst those which were collected in more distant places were set
aside there; but that they were accounted for at Jerusalem, so that upon a
calculation of the number of their families, an equal distribution might be made
to the Levites. Certainly it is by no means probable that the respective tillers
of the soil carried up to Jerusalem what the Levites, having received there,
were compelled to take back again for the maintenance of their families; for
what would have been the advantage of all this expense and trouble of carrying
them backwards and forwards? Besides, it would have been useless to command the
Levites, and that too with the addition of severe threats, to pay the priests
faithfully, if the tithes had been first deposited with the priests themselves,
who might easily have provided against all deception, since they had the whole
quantity of corn in their own hands. I have, therefore, no doubt but that the
Levites collected the tithes each in their own neighborhood, but that another
tithing, of which mention will be made presently, was carried up to the
sanctuary as a sacred offering, and a profession of service to God. For we have
lately seen, that after that part had been withdrawn, the nine parts which
remained were assigned to the Levites, as if they had been grown on their own
ground. But because it was a subject which might cause complaints, that the
first-fruits and other tithes should be collected into one place, God would
anticipate this by showing the advantage of it to the whole people, in that
there might be food enough for all who should come to the celebration of the
festivals; for this is the meaning of the words, "thou<i> </i>shalt eat before
the Lord thy God;" as if it had been said, that the place should be sacred to
God, to which the worshippers of God might come from the whole land. Yet He
commands, in the meanwhile, the pure observation of His worship; lest a
diversity of places might draw away the people in various directions to false
superstitions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24<i>.</i></b><i>

explanation which is soon after added, that they should bring money with them
instead of their offerings, and buy with it oxen and sheep, wine, and strong
drink, as they pleased. The sum is, that if it were too burdensome for them to
bring from their distant homes victims and other gifts, they were permitted to
buy at Jerusalem whatever they chose to offer, provided they made no offerings
elsewhere.</font><br></div>

a place, </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet the mention of a place is omitted,
and it only touches upon the material and form of the altar. God, therefore,
commands that an altar should be built to Him, either of earth or of a heap of
stones, which had not been artificially polished. But I understand this of the
altars, which either in the desert or elsewhere should be built, before the
choice of the perpetual place had been manifested to them. God would have them
built of earth, that they might fall down of themselves, and that no trace of
them might remain after the departure of the people; but if stones were used, He
forbade their being fitted together in a permanent structure, but would have
them thrown rough and unpolished into a heap, lest their appearance should
entice posterity to superstition. I am surprised that commentators
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should here put themselves to the pains
of inventing allegories; since God had no other object than to remove
stumbling-blocks, whereby the Israelites might be turned away from the
sanctuary; for we know how antiquity, and the example of our forefathers, is apt
to attract the minds of the vulgar. If anything in the shape of an altar had
remained, immediately religious notions would have been associated with it,
that, God could nowhere be more solemnly or better worshipped, than in the place
already dedicated of old by their fathers. Thus degenerate modes of worship
would have sprung up, and the dignity of the sanctuary would have been brought
into contempt. Wherefore this evil is anticipated when He forbids altars to be
built which might exist for any length of time; and only allows them to be
adapted for present use, being made of earth, or of an unfashioned heap of
stones. As to "the sacrifices of prosperities,". I have elsewhere stated why I

</i>has been ignorantly perverted by commentators, and hence has afforded a
ground of error; for they have read it in connection with the former part, as if
God had forbidden such an altar to be made in Mount Sion also; whereas He rather
anticipates a doubt, which might have otherwise perplexed the minds of the
people; Will not God be favorable to us where He heard the prayers of our
fathers? He replies, I say, to this by the promise, that they will pray to Him
well and duly, if they only obey His command, and seek no other place except
that which He shall choose. On this score it is said, that wheresoever it shall
please God that sacrifices should be offered, there He will descend to you, to
be favorable unto you.</font><br></div>

built on the bank of Jordan, (Joshua 22,) insomuch that they determined utterly

f114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> although I would not pertinaciously
contend with him, still I have not only a probable, but a sure reason for my
opinion. For it appears to me that I clearly gather from Exodus 33, that the
tabernacle was already built before Moses brought down the first tables from the
Mount; for it is there said, that in token of their divorce, in order that the
people might know that they were repudiated by God, Moses took the tabernacle
and pitched it separately for himself without the camp; not for his own peculiar
use, because it is expressly said that he did not dwell there, but that he went
out of the camp as often as he desired to consult God; whilst Joshua was its
keeper and guardian, (<i>aedituus.</i>)<i> </i>But there is no doubt but that
this took place previous to his second ascent to bring down new tables from the
Lord; it is, therefore, clear that the tabernacle was already erected. If any
object that it was not set up till the end of the second year, the reply is
easy, that it was placed anew in its proper position, so that being everywhere
surrounded by the children of Israel, it might have all its guards, according to
the twelve tribes encamped in their due order; and again, that the tables were
then actually deposited in the Ark of the Covenant, and by them God represented
Himself, so that without them the tabernacle was in a manner empty; finally,
that the solemn dedication is there treated of, for which the due season had not
arrived, until in testimony of God's presence the covenant was deposited in the
Ark, by way of pledge. In order the better to remove all ambiguity, we must
briefly calculate the time. In the third month from their exodus the people
reached Mount Sinai. On what day the Law was given is nowhere stated, unless we
may probably conjecture that it was promulgated about the end of that month.
Thus there will be eight months to be computed until the day on which the
tabernacle was dedicated, and the tables deposited in the Ark of the Covenant,
as Moses expressly says in the last chapter of Exodus; but, in the Book of
Numbers, he relates that in the second month of that year the people removed the
camp from that place, and departed to
Kibroth-Hattaavah.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

tabernacle and their departure only one month intervened, we must admit that the
two ascents into the mountain had preceded<i> </i>in order of
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, the question is, whether he was
called to receive the first tables in the beginning of the fourth month? If this
be allowed, he could scarcely have prescribed the building of the sanctuary
before the end of the eighth month; for it would have been absurd to give
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the tables of God's paternal favor
between the two ascents, while the separation of the tabernacle was testifying
of their divorce from Him. Thus, then, I establish the fact, that four whole
months were employed in this long and difficult work. And surely it was
wonderful that so short a time should suffice; had not incredible activity
surpassed all men's expectation, whilst they all emulously devoted themselves
with unwearied labor to hasten the work. And it is probable, that after God had
established His covenant, He immediately delivered the ordinances respecting the
tabernacle and its adjuncts; lest the people should be without the external
exercises of religion, which we have seen to be so very necessary. But after the
completion of the work, Moses was again commanded to come nigh to God with
Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders; and after the offering of sacrifices, he
was taken up into the cloud to hold familiar communion with God, where he passed
about a month and a half. Having returned, and being made aware of the rebellion
of the people, the slaughter of the three thousand took place, and he commanded
the people to mourn. How long he remained we know not, but it is probable that
at least a month passed before he was recalled We have now more than nine
months; and if we add the month and a half during which he was kept in the
mount, we shall not be far from the end of the year. God then reconciled Himself
to the people, and thus the legitimate dedication of the tabernacle soon
followed, which took place in the second year at the beginning of the first
month. The Passover having been celebrated, the sign of removal was given in the
second month.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any disagree with me, I would
now have them answer me, how it is consistent that Moses, having detected the
people's transgression, should then have begun to exhort them to the building of
the sanctuary, whereas in his whole address there is no mention made of
idolatry? Surely, all things well considered, we must be ready to confess that
the people were still loyal when they so heartily consecrated their property to
God. But the whole question is sufficiently settled by what I have alleged on
the testimony of Moses, viz., that before he came down with the first tables the
tabernacle was already in being, unless, perhaps, it be objected that it was
another tabernacle, and different from that which was afterwards set up by God's
command. But this is a very foolish cavil, for Moses had no authority to make an
earthly dwelling-place for God, and to impose on it the sacred name whereby the
sanctuary is always honored; and he expressly relates that God's glory appeared
in it, in order that the people might more surely know that they were separated
from God for their uncleanness, of which matter we shall again speak in its
proper place. Again, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jql</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
lakach,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f117
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">implies that Moses <i>took </i>the tabernacle
out of the camp, to transfer it to another place. If any one should now object
that the tabernacle was arranged according to the pattern which Moses saw in the
mount, the reply is easy, that Moses was not then first in the mountain
instructed in the true worship of God and heavenly mysteries, when he was kept
there forty days, but already before the promulgation of the Law; nor is there
any doubt but that the same things were then shewn to him which he had learned
before, in order that the people might be more disposed to diligent meditation
on the Law. For, from the length of time, they might acknowledge that nothing
was omitted which it would be useful for them to know; since, although God might
have so instructed His servant in a moment that nothing should have been
wanting, still He chose gradually, and as if at His ease, to form for Himself a
perfect teacher; and this concession was made to the infirmity of the people.
For thus we read in

saying that he had already seen the pattern of the tabernacle wherein God would
be worshipped.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But lest any should object that I
rest upon conjectures only, Moses himself plainly shews that, before he received
the tables, God gave him instructions respecting the making of the tabernacle;
for twice in chapter 25 it is said, "Thou shalt put in the Ark the testimony
which I shall give thee," verses 16 and 21; from whence it is clear that the
tables were not yet given, when from God's command he described the whole
structure; and thence we again infer that, when the tabernacle was set up, he
went up into the mount to bring down the tables which were to be placed in the
Ark. But, before he begins to treat of the construction of the tabernacle, he
imposes a tribute upon the people, that each, according to his means, should
contribute materials both for the tabernacle itself and for all its furniture.

sacrifice, which is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpwnt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thenuphah. </i>But the Israelites are simply commanded to bestow from their
abundance what may suffice for the worship of God. It is indeed certain that all
we have is God's, and that all He bountifully gives us is polluted unless we
devote it to His glory. Still in His indulgence He permits us the free use of
all, if only we testify that it remains under His power, and are ready to expend
it as He shall command. Thus we duly offer alms, as sacrifices of,
sweet-smelling savor; although the rich may not exhaust himself to poverty, but,
whilst he relieves the poor, enjoys the goods which he possesses. In sum,
whatever we offer to God is like the first-fruits, whereby we testify that all
we have is consecrated to His glory. Now, although He required no assistance
from the people for the building and adorning of His tabernacle, since it was He
who, for the maintenance of them all, daily rained down manna from heaven; yet
he would have every one, from the very least to the greatest, bring together, in
testimony of their piety, whatever was necessary for the sacred work. But what
He then would have spent on the visible sanctuary, He now requires for the
building of His spiritual temple. Properly speaking, it is He alone that builds
His Church; yet He uses the work of men, and will have many builders associated
with Him, that the edifice of His Church may arise in some measure by the labor
of men; as also He ascribes the praise of its prosperity and success to them.
Meanwhile we offer nothing which He Himself has not bestowed; just as the
Israelites gave nothing but what had been derived from his bounty alone.
Therefore, He distributes the gifts of His Spirit in certain measures,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:7;) that, as each has received more or less, he may employ it on
the building of the Church. But this should be the best incentive to activity,
that none is so poor or humble but that his offering is acceptable and pleasing,
however small it may be, and almost worthless in the eyes of men. Moreover, it
must be observed, that the tribute is not demanded authoritatively, but it is
declared that each should freely offer what he pleased; for, from the beginning,
Paul's word was true, that "God loveth a cheerful giver,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:7;) and all Scripture teaches us that no obedience is pleasing to
God except what is voluntary; for, although the word

<i>yidbenu,</i> </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is variously rendered by the
translators, the sum comes to this, that the gift of each would be pleasing to
God according to the cheerful alacrity of his mind. The old interpreter
(<i>i.e., </i>the <i>Vulgate</i>)<i> </i>has it "<i>qui</i> <i>offert
ultroneus,</i>" (he who offers voluntarily;) but this is rather paraphrastic
than literal. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others differ from each other: some
understand the relative as referring to the offering, and translate it,
"<i>whose </i>heart shall have voluntarily given it;" others, "He<i> </i>who
shall have shewn his heart liberal, or willing." The second rendering is the
right one.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the
offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence, what I have before said
is more fully continued, viz., that what the poor offer of their little will not
be eclipsed by the abundance of the rich, since God deigns to reckon goats' hair
among the sacred offerings not less than gold, purple, and precious stones.
Again, by the varied and manifold contributions, He would shew, as in a glass,
that a variety of gifts are necessary to the building of the spiritual temple,
as Paul sets forth in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. The liberality of the rich
was indeed more splendid; but, as they did not scruple to mix their gold and
silver, blue, purple, and precious stones, with brass, iron, and other common
materials, so also, now-a-days, those who aid the edification of the Church by
their more excellent gifts, admit, without contempt or dislike, into fellowship
poor brethren, to whom it is not given to equal
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let them make me a
sanctuary.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By first setting before them
an inestimable recompense, God stirs up the people to give largely; for,
although liberality is praised by all as a most excellent virtue, yet no one
willingly deprives himself of his own to bestow it upon others, since all think
that it is so much lost to themselves, unless they have some compensation in
view. Wherefore, that they may expend cheerfully, God promises that He will
dwell among them, than which nothing is more desirable. But we must beware of
imagining anything inconsistent with the nature of God, for He who sits above
the heavens, and whose footstool is the earth, could not be enclosed in the
tabernacle; but, because in His indulgence for the infirmities of an ignorant
people, He desired to testify the presence of His grace and help by a visible
symbol, the earthly sanctuary is called His dwelling amongst men, inasmuch as
there He was not worshipped in vain. And we must bear in memory what we have
lately seen, that it was not the infinite essence of God, but His name, or the
record of His name, that dwelt there. This was the object of the expressions;
that the Israelites ought not to be slow or lazy in setting up the tabernacle,
because by these means they would obtain for themselves an inestimable
advantage. Another clause follows, that the artificers should copy the pattern
shewn to Moses, and not dare to invent anything, since it would be a profanation
to mix up anything human with the commands of God; on which matter we shall
treat more diffusely when we speak generally of the types. Now is described the
form of the Ark and its covering: for the composition of the tabernacle, and its
various parts, which Moses now only slightly adverts to, will be presently
repeated at greater length in chapter 32. But, although the tabernacle was
called God's house, yet there was a more express image of His glory in the Ark
of the Covenant; because the Law, whereby God bound the people to Himself, was
there deposited. The material was shittim-wood, covered<i> </i>or overlaid with
plates of gold. As to the species of the tree,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f121</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not even the Hebrews are agreed among
themselves, although we may conjecture that it was beautiful and costly; yet God
would have gold over its whole surface, and even shining on its staves, that the
dignity of the Law might be enhanced<i>. </i>But here a question may arise,
which introduces many others with it, how the sumptuous splendor both of the
Ark, as well as the tabernacle and all its utensils, contributed to the worship
of God? for it is certain that God would never be worshipped except agreeably to
His nature; whence it follows, that His true worship was always spiritual, and
therefore by no means comprised in external
pomp.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the great number and intricacy of the
ceremonies were so far from awakening piety, that they were even the occasion of
superstition, or era foolish and perverse confidence. Again, so many and such
various rites seem to have had no other tendency than to feed curiosity. It will
be therefore worth while briefly to premise something respecting this point,.
They are, in my judgment, at fault, who think that the eyes of the people were
captivated by these magnificent sights, lest their religion, being stripped of
all ornament, should become dishonored, when amongst the Gentiles their false
worship was splendid even to a miracle; and thus a depraved rivalry might affect
their minds, </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if the beauty of the tabernacle did not
at least equal the pomp of others, as though the God they worshipped were
inferior to idols. On the same grounds they imagine that the Jews were burdened
with many observances; lest<i>,</i> if God had only sparingly and slightly
exercised them, they would in their natural curiosity, have sought in all
directions after profane trifles. They tell part of the truth, but not the
whole; for I admit that this was given to the ancient people, in order that,
when they saw the tabernacle so brilliantly ornamented, they might be inspired
with greater reverence. I also admit that, by God's command, they were engrossed
with many ceremonies, that they might not seek after strange ones; but if this
had been the only object proposed in them, the whole legal service would have
only availed for ostentation in its shadows and histrionic pomps. But it is most
absurd to think that God so trifled with His people. We see, too, how honorably
David and the Prophets speak of these exercises.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f123</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is, therefore, impiety to suppose
that the legal rites were like farces composed in imitation of the Gentiles. In
order, then, to preserve their honor and dignity, we must remember the principle
to which we have lately alluded, viz., that all of them were arranged according
to the spiritual pattern which had been shewn to Moses in the mount.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022540&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
25:40.) And this both Stephen, and the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
wisely observed, when they would reprove the gross follies of the people who
continued to be wrapped up in the external ceremonies, as if religion were
comprised in them.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440744&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:44;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
8:5.) Stephen and the Apostle, therefore, are our best expositors, that the
tabernacle, the altar, the table, the Ark of the Covenant, were of no importance
except in so far as they referred to the heavenly pattern, of which they were
the shadows and images. Thence their entire utility, and even their legitimate
use, depended on the truth, (which they represented.)
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For the slaughter of an ox profits
nothing in itself, nay, it is but an unimportant thing; and so all the
sacrifices, except that they were types, would have been thought nothing of.
Whence we gather that there is the greatest difference between the ceremonies of
the Law and the profane rites of the Gentiles, for they differ from each other
not only inasmuch as God is the author of the one, and that the temerity of men
has foolishly invented the other, but because among the Gentiles their religion
was entirely comprised in these bare and empty pomps; whilst God, by these
rudiments, which He gave to His people, elevated pious minds, as it were by
steps, to higher things. Thus the Gentiles seemed to themselves duly to
propitiate (their gods) when they offered victims; whilst the sacrifices of the
Jews were acceptable to God, because they were exercises of repentance and
faith. So the Law instructed the Jews in the spiritual worship of God, and in
nothing else, though it were clothed in ceremonies agreeably to the requirements
of the age. For, before the truth was fully made known, the childhood of the
Church was to be directed by earthly elements, and thus, though there was great
affinity and likeness between the Jews and Gentiles as regarded the external
form of their religious service, yet its end was widely different. Moreover,
when we would seek the body or substance of the ancient shadows, and the truth
of the figures, we may learn them, not only from the Apostles, but also from the
Prophets, who everywhere draw the attention of believers to the kingdom of
Christ; yet their clearer explanation must be sought in the Gospel, where
Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, shining forth, shews that their fulfillment
exists in Himself alone. But, although by His coming He abolished these typical
ceremonies as regards their use, yet at the same time He established the
reverence justly due to them; since they have no claim to be held in esteem on
any other grounds, except that their completion is found in Him; for, if they
are separated from Him, it is plain that they are mere farces,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f125</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since neither the blood of animals, nor
the sweetness of fat, nor aromatic odors, nor candles, nor anything of that
sort, have any power to propitiate God. This indeed must be remembered, that the
Jews did not pay attention to the legal sacrifices in vain, since the promises
were annexed to them; as often, therefore, as these sentences occur, "your
iniquity shall be blotted out," &#8212; "ye shall appear before my face<i>,</i>"
&#8212; "I will hear you from the sanctuary," we are reminded that all the
ancient figures were sure testimonies of God's grace and of eternal salvation;
and thus Christ was represented in them, since all the promises are in Him, yea,
and amen.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:20.) Yet it by no means follows from hence that there were
mysteries hidden in all their details, since some, with mistaken acuteness, pass
over no point, however trifling, without an allegorical exposition; as, in this
passage, for instance, the dimensions of the ark afford them matter of
speculation. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

John 2:2,) they both refer to this figure, because God was propitiated towards
believers by the covering of the Law, so as to shew Himself favorable to them by
hearing their vows and prayers. For as long as the law stands forth before God's
face it subjects us to His wrath and curse; and hence it is necessary that the
blotting out of our guilt should be interposed, so that God may be reconciled
with us. Nor is it without reason that David exclaims, after he has proclaimed

as the human form. It is enough for me that the images were winged, which
represented angels. Therefore, when Moses speaks of the angels, who were placed
as guards to keep man away from approaching paradise, he calls them cherubim;
not so much in reference to that time, as to keep the people in the doctrine of
the Law </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

exercises His dominion, and who are the ministers of His blessings, to be a

His virtue exercises itself by His angels. That they covered the lid of the ark
with their extended wings, I do not imagine to have been done to hide it, but to
mark the readiness of their obedience, for the extension of their wings is
equivalent to their being prepared for the performance of whatever God might
command. Thus they are said to turn their faces towards the mercy-seat, because
they are attentive to the will of God. Moreover, because the fullness of the
Godhead resides in Christ, He justly declares that, in His descent upon earth,
the heavens were opened that the angels might ascend and descend. Their looking
towards each other indicates that harmony in which the angels are united for
performing the commands of God. It is indeed a plausible conceit,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take ye from among you an
offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I<i> </i>have introduced a passage
from chapter 35, wherein Moses again requires what he had before prescribed; but
he goes more into detail, and treats at greater length of the parts of the
tabernacle. In the former passage he employed a verb, where he here uses a noun,
"willing or voluntary of heart." There is, however, no ambiguity in the meaning;
since in both places God requires a cheerful zeal, so that they may not only
contribute abundantly, but willingly. He will afterwards use a different form of
expression, viz., that <i>they </i>did their duty, whose heart roused, or
stirred them up, so as to distinguish them from the indifferent and slow.
&#8212; 5:21.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every wise-hearted among

who excelled in shrewdness of intellect, and so, after having commanded them
severally of their private means to supply the materials, he now exhorts others
to contribute their industry for shaping and joining them together. He then
briefly enumerates the parts of the Tabernacle, a longer explanation of which
will be seen in chapter 26. This is, therefore, a kind of epitome of all those
things, of which he before spoke more in full, since it was necessary to spur
them on afresh to the performance of what they had been clearly instructed in.
For we know that instruction is very often coldly received without the addition
of exhortations. It might indeed seem strange,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> how so much wealth could be possessed by
a miserably pillaged people, and long driven to servile work; unless it may be
inferred from the abundance which is here described, that they were incredibly
enriched at their departure from Egypt by the booty which God gave them. The
kingdom of Egypt was very wealthy; and its people, as we know, had always been
devoted to pleasures and luxuries. What, then, they had accumulated by their
rapacity in many years, flowed away from them by the secret influence of God,
when they were suddenly made prodigal. But, just as He had blinded the
Egyptians, that they should profusely give all they had, so He now directed the
minds and hearts of His people, that, mindful of so great a benefit, they should
willingly expend, at His command, what they had obtained of His mere
grace.</font><br></div>

ancient bishop </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is deservedly praised, who, when he sold
the sacred vessels in the time of a famine, to relieve the distress of the poor,
thus excused himself to the Church: "Our God, who does not eat or drink, has no
need of patens and chalices;" and yet this seems little in accordance with this
His command, that bread should be offered to Him. I answer, that if, under that
pretext, the bishop had stripped the sacred table of its ornaments under the
Law<i>, </i>he would have spoken unseasonably, what, under the Gospel, he spoke
piously and wisely; because at the coming of Christ the shadows of the Law
ceased. But God would then have the loaves, which were offered to Him, deposited
among the golden dishes and censers, and spoons placed with them, not that He
had need of meat and drink, but that He might prescribe the duty of temperance
to His people, by deigning to have His table among them; for, when they ate of
the same wheat, of which the sacred loaves were made, they were reminded by that
symbol that their meat and drink was to be taken, as if they sat before God, and
were His guests. Finally, they were taught that the food, by which man's life is
sustained, is in a manner sacred to God; that thus they might be contented with
simple and sober food, and might not profane the things which were dedicated to
His service. Although, therefore, this offering might appear to be gross and
rude, yet it had a just object, <i>i.e., </i>that believers might acknowledge
that God presided over their tables, because the loaves were presented in the
temple before God in the name of all the people. The same was the intention of
the first-fruits, in which the produce of the whole year was consecrated; that
even in their feasts they might cherish a recollection of God, who fed them as a
father does his children. They are called "the<i> </i>bread of faces"

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make a
candlestick. </i></font><font face="Palatino">God would have seven bright lamps
burning day and night in the Tabernacle: <i>first, </i>that the people might
know that they were directed by God Himself as to how they were to worship Him
aright, and that a light was set before their eyes which might disperse all the
darkness of error; and, <i>secondly, </i>lest they should obscure the very
worship of God with their gross inventions, but that, intent on the instruction
of the Law, they might with a pure and enlightened mind seek after God in all
the ceremonies. Let us, therefore, remark a distinction here set forth between
the rule of true religion and the superstitions of the Gentiles; because the
Gentiles were carried away by their foolish and blind devotions, as they call
them, into circuitous and erring ways, so that nothing was straight in them; for
unless we have divine teaching to enlighten us, our own reason will beget
nothing but mere vanity. But it was not enough for the Israelites that the right
way should be pointed out, unless their eyes were open to direct them, since men
sometimes are blind in the very midst of light. And this occurred to themselves
not only when they went astray into strange and adulterous worships, for though
they held fast the external form of the Law, they were, nevertheless,
degenerate; and religion was corrupted among them by foul superstitions, when,
in obedience to their carnal reason, they conceived that religion consisted in
ceremonies. For when God is not worshipped spiritually according to His nature,
this is to travesty Him. Hence there was so much security in the hypocrites,
that they proudly despised all the reproofs of the Prophets, nay, that they
broke out into open fury whenever their empty pomps were condemned. But the
candlestick, shining with its seven lights, reminded the people that, in their
worship of God, they should look attentively to the light of heavenly
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But, for the understanding of this
type, the vision of Zechariah will be no slight assistance to us, since the
truth of this symbol is there set forth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
4:2.) God there promises that the power of His Spirit will alone avail, and more
than avail, for the preservation of His Church, although it may be destitute of
all other aid. To awaken confidence in this, He represents the same image of a
candlestick which is here described, with the addition of some other
circumstances, whereby He reminds us that the shining lights were no vain show
like stage plays<i>,</i> but that in the candlestick was represented what
believers would really experience to take place. But, that the comparison may be
made clearer, we must say a little respecting this passage. The material of the
candlestick is pure gold, whereby the excellency of the thing signified is
denoted. But, when we have spoken somewhat of its form, the application of
Zechariah's prophecy will be more manifest. Some parts of it were merely for
ornament, that its dignity might be increased by its very appearance, such as
the flowers and the balls or knops; others for use<i>,</i> as the bowls or
receptacles, to prevent the sacred oil from falling on the ground. The lamps
were placed at the top, that the Israelites might know that men are surrounded
with darkness on earth, if God did not enlighten His Church from on high, and
that by day and by night. Thus Isaiah, describing the kingdom of Christ, in
which the reality of this sign was at length exhibited, says, &#8212; "Behold,
darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord
shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." And
again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thy sun shall no more go

60:2-20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, since God is called the Father of lights, the
grace of illumination resides in the Spirit; and since a variety of gifts are
distributed by the Spirit, there were seven lamps which visibly represented what
Paul says, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The
manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one
is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by
the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another
prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues;
to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the
self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."

Corinthians 12:7-11.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some, however, have
gratuitously invented a mystery in the number seven, whence the common notion
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f136
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">among the Papists about the sevenfold grace
of the Spirit, which is refuted both by the above-cited passage of St. Paul and
the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, where a greater number of gifts are enumerated.
I suppose rather that perfection is denoted by the seven lamps according to the
ordinary and acknowledged use (of the figure); as if God thus declared that
nothing would be wanting for the full enlightenment of believers, who should
seek it from its one and only source; secondly, that the Spirit presides over
all religious rites when He shines forth to the Church in His gifts. Now, the
Prophet,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
4:2,) desiring to teach that what had been shewn forth in this visible symbol
would be fulfilled in the restoration of the Church, adds to the lamps seven
pipes and two olive-trees, from whence oil would continually flow, so that there
was no fear of want or failure. Thus he signifies that God is possessed of a
manifold abundance of blessings for the enrichment of the Church; and so that
the virtue which flows down from heaven is sufficient for its preservation,
according to what is added in connection,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">For although God uses the ministry of men and earthly
means at His discretion for the protection and maintenance of the Church, yet He
would have, as is just, all the praise ascribed to Himself; whilst He would also
have believers to be contented under His guardianship, and not to be discouraged
although they should find no ground of confidence in the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40<i>.</i></b><i>

already seen, that Moses should take care that all things were exactly modeled
according to the original or pattern seen in the mount. But it is certain that
it is not any mere vision which is here in question, but that the external
ornaments of the sanctuary have <i>reference </i>to their spiritual object, as
is plain from the explanation of Stephen and the Apostle. Wherefore we need not
wonder that Zechariah should say that God would make manifest, and that by
certain proof, under the reign of Christ, that it was no empty spectacle which
God had set before His people under the Law.</font><br></div>

these two passages from elsewhere, since they relate to the service of the
tabernacle; for the children of Israel are commanded to contribute as much oil
as may be sufficient for the seven lamps. Now, since Divine illumination and the
grace of the Holy Spirit were, as we have seen, the truth of this symbol, God
requires pure oil, <i>i.e., </i>not muddy, or mixed with lees, for, had it been
in any respect faulty, so much would have been detracted from the dignity of the
mystery. Its purity, then, shewed that nothing mean or common was signified by
it; that the Israelites also might bring with them pure minds, and duly prepared
and disposed to consider the spiritual light. He again repeats, that the oil
must be supplied seasonably at its proper hours, so that the lamps may be always

should shine from heaven in a perpetual flow. Thus, in the second passage cited,
He thrice reiterates the word "continually,"<i> </i>to shew that the true light
should never be put out in any respect. This office God enjoins upon the

scrupulously forced to the rule, as if there were nothing in the outward sign
with which the reality did not correspond; and again, that although men having
nothing of their own and of themselves to bring, yet, that they may more
diligently exert themselves in their endeavors to serve God, they are justly
required to dedicate themselves and all that they have to God. At the end, where
the words "a<i> </i>statute for ever" are added, understand them to mean, until

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moreover, thou shalt make the

the tabernacle we must remember what we have already seen, that the Israelites
were instructed by external figures how precious a thing is the worship of God,
and therefore that they must diligently beware lest it should be polluted by any
meanness. For all this richness and magnificence of ornament was the very
contrast to meanness. They were also reminded that, if they would be accounted
pure worshippers of God, they must avoid all uncleanness, for the tabernacle was
the type of the Church. Thus it is certain that by its external ornaments the
excellency of spiritual gifts was designated. On this ground Isaiah, discoursing
of the perfect glory of the Church as it would be under the reign of Christ,
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will lay thy stones with
fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires; and I will make thy windows
of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant
stones,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
54:11, 12;)</font><br><font face="Palatino">by which words he plainly signifies
that the Church would be adorned with heavenly beauty, since all kinds of graces
shone forth in her But the chief excellency of her adornment must be referred to
the instruction which renews us into the image of God. Thus David, when he
celebrates the beauty of God's house, assigns this honor chiefly to the
exercises of faith and piety:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"One
thing have I desired of the Lord," he says, "that will I seek after, that I may
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of
the Lord, and to inquire in his temple."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
27:4.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Was this that he might feed his eyes with
empty pictures, with its costly materials, and with the exquisite workmanship of
it? Assuredly he does not speak of gazing inquisitively at it, but thus alludes
to its visible workmanship, that with the spiritual eyes of faith he may
consider the glory more excellent than the whole world, which was there
represented. Nor indeed did anything magnificent appear in the tabernacle to
delight men's eyes, but rather was all its richness and excellence covered up
with goats' hair and paltry leather, in order that believers beneath that hidden
beauty might reflect on something higher than the carnal
sense.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will suffice to have given these
general hints; I now descend to particulars, in which let not my readers expect
of me any conceits which may gratify their ears, since nothing is better than to
contain ourselves within the limits of edification; and it would be puerile to
make a collection of the <i>minutiae </i>wherewith some philosophize; since it
was by no means the intention of God to include mysteries in every hook and
loop; and even although no part were without a mystical meaning, which no one in
his senses will admit, it is better to confess our ignorance than to indulge
ourselves in frivolous conjectures. Of this sobriety, too, the author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews is a fit master for us, who, although he professedly
shews the analogy between the shadows of the Law and the truth manifested in
Christ, yet sparingly touches upon some main points, and by this moderation
restrains us from too curious disquisitions and deep speculations. In the first
place, curtains are made of twilled linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet, which,
when coupled together, made an inclosure of forty cubits; for they were ten in
number, and the breadth of each was four cubits. By "cunning work," commentators
are agreed that embroidery is meant, especially when God commands that cherubim
should be made in them. But some translate the word cherubim by the general name
of <i>pictures,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f140</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which, although it is not
grammatically incorrect, yet, since we have before seen that angels were
designated by this word, it; is more probable that figures of angels were
everywhere scattered over them; for, when the majesty of God is represented to
the life by

be empty and unsightly unless they are adorned with images; for in order that
the similitude should hold good, they must needs hide their images under a
triple covering, lest the people should be able to see them; and then, how would
they be "the<i> </i>books of the unlearned" (<i>idiotarum</i>)<i>, </i>as they
call them?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

6:2,) signify the same as the cherubim, and are said "with<i> </i>twain of their
wings to cover their faces, and with twain their feet," their images must be
veiled, in order to correspond with them. Besides, it is preposterous, as I have
said, forcibly to transfer these rudiments, which God delivered only to His
ancient; people, to the fullness of time, when the Church has grown up and has
passed out of its childhood. But how far the Jews were from worshipping the
cherubim, the heathen poets bear them witness; for Juvenal, speaking of them,
said,</font><br></div>

f143</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and God extorted these words from an impure and
licentious man, that all might know that the Law of Moses lifted his disciples
to things above. A threefold covering is then described, the inner one of goats'
hair, another of rams' skins dyed red, and the outer one of badgers' skins; a
wooden frame is then added, to strengthen the tabernacle within by its firmness,
since otherwise the curtains would have got out of place at the slightest
motion. The boards were of shittim-wood, overlaid with gold, either only gilt or
covered<i> </i>with gold plates; each<i> </i>of them was supported by two silver
bases,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> like feet, and they were joined together
by bars, passed through rings of gold. In this space the whole tabernacle was
contained, which then was distinguished into the outer sanctuary and the Holy of
holies. Besides these there was the court in which the people were to stand,
because<i> </i>it was not lawful for them to enter the sanctuary, to which the
priests alone had access, and they only when clean. Thus David, after having
exclaimed, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts," immediately adds,
"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts<i> </i>of the Lord;"<i>
</i>and again, "for a day in thy courts<i> </i>is better than a thousand,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
84:1, 2, 10;) and again, "Worship the Lord in his holy

</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
29:2.) But on so plain a matter there is no need of the abundant proofs which he
furnishes. The disposition of the tabernacle is said again, in ver. 30, to have
been shewn in the mount, that the people should not rest their attention on the
visible tabernacle, but with the understanding of faith should penetrate to
heaven, and direct their minds to the spiritual pattern, the shadows and types
of which they beheld. Neither here must we philosophize too curiously. The
allegory will please the ears of many, that by the two bases are meant the Old
and New Testament, or the two natures of Christ, because believers rest on these
two supports. But with no less probability we might say, that two bases were
placed beneath each of the boards; either because godliness hath the promise of
this life and of that which is to come; or because we must resist on both sides
the temptations which assail us from the right and from the left; or because
faith must not limp nor turn to the right or left: thus there would be no bounds
to trifling. They allegorically explain that the covering of the tabernacle was
made of rams' skins,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because the Church is protected by the
blood of Christ, who is the spotless lamb; but I ask, what do the badgers'
skins, which were above, mean? Why was the covering of goats' hair put below?

and with what seriousness holy things are to be engaged in, so that they might
not approach God's presence without fear, nor boldly break in upon the mysteries
of things sacred. But by the vail the obscurity of the shadows of the Law was
principally denoted, that the Israelites might know that the time of full
revelation had not yet come, but that the spiritual worship of God was as yet
enshrouded in a vail; and thus might extend their faith to their promised
Messiah, at whose coming the truth would be discovered and laid bare. Wherefore,
when Christ rose again from the dead, "the vail of the temple was rent in twain
from the top to the bottom,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402751&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:51;) and an end was put to the ceremonies of the Law, because God then
presented Himself in His living and express image, and the perfect reality of
all the ceremonies was manifested. Now, therefore, in the light of the gospel,
we behold "face to face," what was then shewn afar off to the ancient people
under coverings.

openly and familiarly looking upon Christ, let us learn from this figure that

burnt-offerings (<i>holocaustorum</i>)<i> </i>is here described, which, however,
it was called by <i>synecdoche, </i>for not only entire victims were burnt
there, but also parts of them only, as we shall see in Leviticus. The
burnt-offerings received their name from their
<i>ascending,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>whereby the Israelites were
reminded that they had need to be purified, that they might ascend to God; and
at the same time were instructed that whatever corruption there might be in the
flesh did not prevent the sacrifices from being acceptable and of a sweet savor
to God. It is clear that from the first beginning of the human race there were
burnt-sacrifices, suggested by the secret inspiration of God's Spirit, since
there was no written Law; nor can we doubt but that by this symbol they were
taught that the flesh must be burnt by the Spirit, in order that men may duly
offer themselves to God; and thus they acknowledged, under this type, that the
flesh of Christ must receive this from the divine power, so as to become a
perfect victim for the propitiation of God; thus, as the Apostle testifies, he
offered himself through the Spirit.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:14.) But fuller mention of this subject will be made elsewhere. The altar was
so constructed that the sacrifices might be cast upon a grate placed within it,
and thus they were covered by its external surface. The ashes were received into
a pan, so that they should not fall about upon the ground and be trodden under
foot, but that reverence<i> </i>might be inculcated even towards the very
remnants of their holy
things.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

118:27, "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar." And
this also is the beginning of a proper offering of spiritual sacrifices, that
all the lusts of the flesh should be subdued, and held captive as it were unto
the obedience of God. Wherefore even Christ, although in Him there was nothing
which was not duly regulated, was nevertheless bound, in order to prove His
obedience; as He had said, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402639&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:39.) The altar was carried on staves, to obviate the necessity of having more
than one; else there would have been danger of their being compelled, by the
very difficulty of carrying it, to leave it behind after it was made, if they
were setting about a long journey; and this would have been the seed or ground
of superstition, whilst no other could be built which was not
spurious.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make the
court.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There were two courts divided
from the sanctuary, one for the priests, the other common to the whole people.
To the first chambers were annexed, in which the Levites dwelt, who were the
keepers of the tabernacle; and thus sometimes the courts are spoken of in the
plural number, and especially in the Psalms,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
64:4; 84:2; 92:13; 96:8.) It is the court of the people which is here referred
to, where they consecrated the victims, offered their prayers, and were
reconciled to God. In this manner the condition of mankind was shewn to the
Israelites, by their being forbidden to enter the Temple, whilst at the same
time they were reminded that men, although unworthy outcasts, are received by
God, if only they seek Him simply, and with due humility, mindful of their own
unworthiness. Hence the consolation in which David
gloried,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f149</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "I had rather dwell in the courts of the
Lord, than in the splendid tents of the ungodly." The court was formed by four
curtains, two of which, on the north and south sides, were 100 cubits long, and
supported by 20 pillars, whose bases were of brass, and their
capitals</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and fillets of silver; on the east and
west, each curtain was 50 cubits long, supported by 10 pillars. The length
spoken of is not from the ground upwards, but from their opposite corners: for
the court was twice<i> </i>as long as it was broad, as is said in ver. 18.
There<b> </b>would be an appearance of contradiction in the fact that Moses
afterwards speaks of two sides, and assigns fifteen cubits to each, if he did
not immediately go on to mention the<b> </b>hanging or curtain, which covered
the gate of the court, and which he sets at twenty cubits. Thus the measure will
be correct, and the passage will be quite accordant; for, after he has said in
ver. 13 that the curtain on the east side should consist of fifty cubits, he
adds in explanation that there were two curtains at the sides of the door, and a
third between them to cover the door, making up in all the fifty cubits. But the
door was covered by the hanging, that the Israelites might reflect in
themselves, whenever they went into the sanctuary, that it was no profane or
common (<i>promiscuum</i>)<i> </i>place; but if they came thither in purity and
chastity, they might be assuredly persuaded that they were safe under the
protection of God. Finally also the majesty of holy things was shewn them in
this type, in order that they might reverently approach the worship of God; and
they were reminded of their own unworthiness, that they might humble themselves
the more before God, and that fear might beget penitence, whilst moderation in
the desire of knowledge was recommended to them, that they might not be unduly
inquisitive. The religion of the Gentiles also had its secret shrines with the
same object, but for very different causes; for it was a brutal religion, for
which veneration was sought by darkness, and the disguise of ignorance; whereas
God, whilst He retained His people in modesty and simplicity, at the same time
set before them the Law, from which they might learn whatever it was right and
useful for them to know.</font><br></div>

Christ. But we must remember, what I before adverted to, that no similitude is
identical (with the reality); for then the substance and reality of the shadows
could not be represented in their perfection. Yet this was an apt similitude,
shewing that God could only be propitiated towards the human race by an
expiation made with blood. On this account not only was the altar to be
cleansed, but; also dedicated to its use, that reconciliation might proceed from
it; and this is expressed by the word "sanctify," especially when it is added,
"it shall be the holiness of
holinesses,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f151</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that it may sanctify whatever is put
upon it. Others read it in the masculine gender: "Whosoever<i> </i>shall touch
it, shall be holy;" and understand it of the priest, who by right of his
anointing might approach the altar; but; it rather dignifies the consecration of
the altar by its consequence, viz., because it sanctifies the victims
themselves. The sum is that the body of Christ, inasmuch as it was offered as a
sacrifice, and consecrated with blood, was acceptable to God; so that its
holiness washes away and blots out all our uncleanness. We shall speak of the
anointing a little further on.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make an

respecting the altar of burnt incense, whereby the people were assured that the
odor of the worship under the Law was sweet to Him. This ceremony indeed also
prevailed among the Gentiles; whence there is frequent mention made by heathen
authors of incense-burning; but what its object was they knew not themselves,
nor did they care to reflect upon its proper intention, since they conceived
themselves to have done all that was required of them, by the bare sign itself.
In this way, however, God would encourage His believing people, by giving them
to know that the worship which they offered at this command sent up to him a
sweet savor. Meanwhile He admonished them diligently to beware lest any
uncleanness should profane their sacrifices, but that they should come cleansed
and pure into His sight. And David applies this type specially to prayer, when
he says:</font><br></div>

hearing, was devoted to the victims for the purpose of propitiating God, so also
this altar perfumed the sacrifices with the odor of its incense, that they might
be acceptable to God. Hence it was placed near the ark of the testimony, though
with the vail between, that its savor might ascend directly to God without any
let or hindrance. There is no ambiguity in the words, except that some think
there is a repetition where it is said, "every<i> </i>morning," and "between the
two evens;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> others suppose that there are two
separate oblations, and this latter view is the more probable, <i>i.e., </i>that

that the sacrifices would not please God, unless all uncleanness were wiped away
by pure and holy prayers, so also the altar of incense was purified by the
sprinkling of blood, that they might learn that their prayers obtained
acceptance through sacrifices. Although this was only done once a year, yet it
was daily to be called to mind, in order that they might offer the death of
Christ by faith and

spices.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This oblation might have been
noticed with the others, yet, since it merely describes the composition of the
incense, which is connected with the altar of incense, and in fact is but an
appendage to it, I have seen no reason why I should separate them. Let the
curious subtilely discuss, if they please, the ingredients themselves; it is
enough for me that they were chosen at God's will to make a very sweet smell.
For I know not whether it is likely, as some suppose, that
galbanum</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is of a strong and disagreeable savor,
and, since they only offer this conjecture in an unknown matter, they deserve
little credit. My conviction is that it was sweet, which the words of Moses
himself a little further on confirm, where he denounces the penalty of death
upon those who should use such perfume for their private gratification; for this
prohibition would have been absurd, unless its odor had been very agreeable.
Besides, the analogy between the sign and the thing signified would not have
held good, unless its sweet savor had testified that God is greatly pleased with
the prayers of His people. Moreover, in order that the sacred symbol might be
the more reverenced,<i> </i>it was not allowable to transfer this mixture to
private use; for since men are rude and earthly-minded, there is nothing they
are more prone to than to mix up heavenly things with those of earth. Therefore,
to elevate their minds the more, it was necessary that the incense, in which
there was a special holiness due to God alone, should be set apart from common
use.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

of the purity which God required in His priests, yet, inasmuch as this hollow
vessel (<i>concha</i>)<i> </i>or laver, which supplied the water, was a part or
utensil of the sanctuary, I have thought it best to insert here what is ordained
respecting it, not only as to its fashion, but also its use, which could not be
well separated: for if bare mention had only been made of a laver or
water-vessel,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the reader would have received no profit
from it. But, when God expressly commands that water should always be ready in
this basin for the priests to wash their hands and feet, we gather from hence
with what reverence and sanctity God would have His holy service performed. It
was, indeed, a common proverb among the Gentiles that they were guilty of
impiety who handled holy things with unwashen hands, and they testified in this
ceremony that they could not worship God aright except when purified from all
pollution and uncleanness. One in Virgil says: &#8212; </font><br></div>

Sometimes they even seemed almost to hit the right point; as where the poet
commands the ungodly and the criminal to depart from the sacrifices, lest they
should contaminate
them;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f157</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but this was only a fleeting
imagination, since no anxiety to repent had awakened in them a desire to
propitiate God; and so, even whilst they were diligent in performing ablutions,
their minds, darkened with error, knew not what it meant. But the Israelites
were thus chiefly reminded how unworthy they were to offer sacrifices to God,
since the impurity of the very priests, who were chosen to this once, prevented
them from exercising it, until they were cleansed with water. The washing of the
hands and feet denoted that all parts of the body were infected with
uncleanness; for, since Scripture often uses the word "hands"<i> </i>for the
actions of life, and compares the whole course of life to a way or journey, it
is very suitable to say by <i>synecdoche </i>that all impurity is purged away by
the washing of the hands and feet. The comparison with Christ now remains to be
considered; but this we shall understand better a little beyond in reference to
the sacrifices.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We now arrive at the second part of the Legal
Worship, <i>i.e., </i>the Priesthood; for we must bear in mind what I have said,
that there are three things to be considered,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The
Tabernacle;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The Priestly Office;
and</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The Sacrifices.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And indeed all the splendor of
the tabernacle, of which we have been speaking, would have been an empty parade
without the priest, who so mediated as an intercessor, that he reconciled men to
God, and in a manner united heaven to earth. Now it is unquestionable, that the
Levitical priests were the representatives of Christ; since, with respect to
their office, they were even better than the very angels; which would be by no
means reasonable, unless they had been the type of Him, who is Himself the head
of the angels. The heathen nations, it is true, had their priests, who presided
over their religious services, but they were but empty phantoms; for there was
no mention with them of the Mediator, so that the people might know that God
cannot be duly appeased, and that our prayers cannot be heard by Him, unless a
peace-maker interfere between us. But the nature of the Levitical priesthood was
widely different; for the Israelites were instructed that all of them were
unworthy to stand before God, and so that there was need of an Intercessor to
propitiate Him. Now, since the general rule had been laid down, that all things
should be rigidly referred to the pattern which had been shewn to Moses in the
mount, their minds were necessarily drawn upwards; and this too they might
easily have arrived at, for various reasons. The whole body of the people saw a
man like themselves, who could not enter the sanctuary trusting in his own
innocence,<i> </i>and whose dignity was conferred upon him by adventitious
rites; <i>i.e., </i>by anointing, and by investiture. The full truth, therefore,
did not shine forth in this, but only a figure to direct them to the truth; and
of this they were doubtless admonished, lest they should rest in earthly things.
Besides, its interpretation was added (by the
prophets</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f158</font></sup><font face="Palatino">); because, as the Apostle wisely teaches
us in the Epistle to
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580718&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:18, the promise to appoint hereafter a priest after the order of Melchisedec
would not hold good, unless it were applied to Christ; for it is plain that the
Levitical priesthood is there brought into comparison by contrast with one of a
different nature; and since the latter is eternal, it follows that the former is
temporary; and, whilst the one is sanctioned by an oath, it clearly is superior
to the other. There is no doubt, then, but that David, as a faithful interpreter
of the Law, more manifestly shewed forth what there was obscurely
shadowed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus far my wish has been to teach
that the Levitical priest was ordained, that he might be a type of the true
Mediator. It will now be worth our while briefly to advert to the marks by which
our perpetual and only Priest, the Son of God, is to be distinguished from those
of old; for a fuller exposition will follow hereafter in its proper place. The
<i>first </i>distinction I have already pointed out, viz., that the type was
temporary; since perpetuity<i> </i>is only to be sought in the reality itself:
whence we learn that the priestly office was not so instituted by Moses to last
for ever, but to direct the people to a better hope. But what I have said as to
the office, must be transferred also to the persons. There was only one high
priest under the Law, who was afterwards succeeded by one of his race, since
they were all mortal. None, then, was ever such a priest as became us, except
Christ; because none other could be perpetual; and hence we arrive at the
<i>second </i>distinction. The <i>third </i>arises from Christ's divinity, which
is proved by the fact, that the priest after the order of Melchisedec has no
beginning; for we find nowhere the origin of Melchisedec; but he is only brought
forward once and unexpectedly, as if be had come down from heaven. The <i>fourth
</i>is the combination of the kingdom and the priesthood. Under the Law God
would have some to be kings, and others to be priests; nor was it allowable to
mix up the one office with the other; but He, of whom it is said that He should
be a priest like Melchisedec, is honored with the title of king. The <i>fifth
</i>is, that the legal priest only appeared before God in the visible and
sanctuary, but Christ entered into heaven, to present us to His Father, not in
the external symbols of (precious)
stones,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f159
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but in the reality itself; for in Him as our
Head we are all gathered together unto God. The <i>sixth </i>lies in the perfect
righteousness of Christ; for the legal priest, since he was one of us sinners,
had need to seek pardon for himself; but Christ, being free from all guilt,
awakens favor towards us by His own purity. The <i>seventh </i>is, that the
priest borrowed from external figures what was truly and really shewn forth in
Christ. The sacred garments, as we have lately said, denoted something more than
human; the anointing, too, was a symbol of the Spirit which dwells in Christ;
and He therefore was not consecrated with visible and corruptible oil, but with
the fullness of all gifts. The priest of old abstained from intercourse with his
wife when he went into the sanctuary; he was only allowed to marry a virgin; the
perfect and spiritual purity of Christ was contented with its own perfection.
The <i>last </i>distinction consisted in the <i>sacrifices </i>themselves,
respecting which I abstain at present from speaking more fully, because they
will have their proper place hereafter. This only we must now recollect, that
Christ expiated the sins of the world, not with the blood of beasts, but with
His own blood. Now we turn to the words of
Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And take thou unto thee
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The calling of God is here
alleged to prove the importance and dignity of the priesthood, and this too the
Apostle has well weighed in the words:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And<i> </i>no man taketh
the honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews

<div><font face="Palatino">Among heathen nations the priests were appointed by
popular election, so that ambition alone governed their appointment; but God
would only have those accounted lawful priests whom He had selected at His own
sole will; and surely the whole human race together had no power to obtrude any
one on God, who should interpose himself to obtain pardon and peace; nay, not
even Christ Himself would have been sufficient to propitiate God, unless He had
undertaken the office by the decree and appointment of His Father. To which
refers the famous oath, whereby His heavenly Father appointed Him to be priest;
and so much the more vile and detestable was the sacrilege which afterwards
prevailed in the Jewish nation, viz., that the successors of Aaron bought the
priesthood! This unworthy traffic of the office, which Josephus relates, ought
to awaken horror in us now, when we see that sacred honor profaned by the family
which had been chosen by God to represent Christ. Nevertheless, however they may
have violated all law and justice, still the counsel of God remained inviolable,
that believers might know that the priesthood depended on His authority, just as
reconciliation flows from His mere mercy. For in order that it should be lawful
for men to establish a priest, it would be necessary that they should anticipate
God by their own deservings; and from this they are very far distant. The case
is different as to the election of the pastors of the Church; since, after
Christ had instituted the order itself, He commanded that there should be chosen
out of the Church those who by their doctrine and integrity of life were fitted
to exercise the office. Still He does not thus resign His own right and power to
men, for He does not cease through them to call those (by whom He would be
served.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f160</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) Wherefore, to shew that He is the sole
author of the priesthood, God commands Aaron and his sons to be separated from
among the others; and the performance of this He entrusts to Moses, whom,
however, He does not elevate to the like honor. Moses consecrates Aaron,
although he was never himself dedicated by anointing and investiture to the
service of God;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whence we perceive that the sacraments
have their power and effect not from the virtue of the minister, but only from
the commandment of God; for Moses would not have given to others what he had not
himself, if it had not so pleased
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make holy
garments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These external ornaments
denoted the want of those which are true and spiritual; for if the priest had
been absolutely and entirely perfect, these typical accessories would have been
superfluous. But God would shew by this symbol the more than angelical
brightness of all virtues which was to be exhibited in Christ. Aaron was defiled
by his own corruption, and therefore unworthy to appear in the presence of God;
in order, then, that he might be a fit peacemaker between God and man, he put
off his ordinary garments, and stood forth as a new man. Hence the holy garments
were, first of all, supposed to conceal his faults; and, secondly, to represent
the incomparable adornment of all virtues. The latter may indeed be in some
measure applied to the pastors of the Church; nor will the comparison be absurd,
if we say that no others are worthy of so excellent an honor, except those in
whom surpassing and extraordinary virtue brightly manifests itself. But we must
chiefly recollect what I have said, viz., that in these garments the supreme
purity and wondrous glory of Christ were represented; as if God should promise
that the Mediator would be far more august than the condition of man could
produce. He therefore declares that they shall be "for<i> </i>glory and for
beauty." We shall speak more fully hereafter, what I will touch upon now, as to
the wisdom of the artificers, viz., that all who from the foundation of the
world have invented arts useful to the human race, have been imbued with the
Spirit of God; so that even heathen authors have been compelled to call them the
inventions of the gods. But inasmuch as in this Divine work there was need of
rare and unwonted skill, it is expressly spoken of as a peculiar gift of the
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are the
garments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here<i> </i>again I must
remind my readers, that they should abandon all subtle speculations, and be
contented<i> </i>with simplicity. I might repeat many plausible allegories,
which perhaps would find more favor with some than a sound knowledge of facts.
If any should delight in this kind of child's play, let him only read what
<i>Jerome </i>wrote to <i>Fabiola; </i>in which he collected<i> </i>almost
everything that he possibly could from the writings of others; but nothing will
be found except dull trifling, the folly of which it is painful even to report,
much more to refute. Those who are conversant with my writings, are aware that I
do not willingly find fault with the opinions of others; but when I reflect how
dangerous are those itching ears, with which many are troubled, I am obliged to
prescribe this remedy. Six principal parts of the dress are enumerated. What the
Greeks call the
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">logei~on</font><font face="Palatino">,
and the Latins the <i>pectorale, </i>was like a square breastplate attached by
small chains, so as to be connected with the ephod. Inclosed in it were twelve
stones to represent the tribes of Israel; and the Urim and Thummim were also
annexed to it. But what its form might be, cannot be certainly declared from the
words of Moses; and since even the Jews also differ among themselves, let us be
satisfied with its comparison to a breastplate. I have no objection to the
opinion, that its name</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was derived from <i>strength, </i>or a
<i>treasure. </i>But this is worthy of the utmost attention, that the priest
bore the sons of Abraham as it were upon his heart, not only that he might
present them to God, but that he might be mindful of them, and anxious for their
welfare. The twelve precious stones were by no means given to be symbols of the
twelve tribes as a cause for awakening their pride, as if they were so highly
esteemed on the score of their own dignity or excellence; but they were thus
reminded that the whole value, in which believers are held by God, is derived
from the sanctity of the priesthood. Therefore, let us learn from this figure,
that:, however vile and abject we may be in ourselves, and so altogether
worthless refuse, yet inasmuch as Christ deigned to ingraft us into this body,
in Him we are precious stones. And to this Isaiah seems to allude in the passage
before cited, where, speaking of the restoration of the Church, which was to
take place under the reign of Christ, he says, "Behold, I will lay thy stones
with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires; and I will make thy
windows with carbuncles, and all thy borders with pleasant stones;" for
immediately after the exposition follows, "And<i> </i>all thy children shall be
taught of the Lord."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
54:11-13.) Therefore what was to be fulfilled in Christ, was typified by the
external sign under the Law; viz., that though we sojourn in the world, yet are
we united with Christ by faith, as if we were one with Him; and, besides, that
He takes care for our welfare, as if He bore us enclosed in His heart; and,
finally, that when our heavenly Father regards us in Him, He esteems us above
all the wealth and splendor of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to
the Urim and Thummim, it appears probable to me that they were two conspicuous
marks on the breastplate, corresponding to these names; for the supposition of
some of the Jews,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the ineffable name of God was
placed beneath its texture, is not free from foolish and dangerous superstition.
I pass over other fancies, which are equally frivolous; nor am I anxious to know
what was the form of either of them; the fact itself is sufficient for me. By
the <i>Urim, </i>therefore, or <i>splendors, </i>I doubt not but that the light
of doctrine, wherewith the true Priest illuminates all believers, was
represented; first, because He is the one "light<i> </i>of the world," without
which all things are full of darkness; and because in Him "are<i> </i>hid all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:12; 9:5;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3.) Hence did Paul justly glory that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:2,) since His priesthood sufficiently and more than sufficiently
enlightens us. As then the people were admonished that their eyes should be
directed to the splendor of the priest, so now we must diligently remember what
Christ Himself teaches, that "he that followeth him shall not walk in darkness."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:12.) On the other hand, the <i>Thummim, </i>which signifies <i>perfections,
</i>was a symbol of the perfect and entire purity which is only to be sought in
Christ; for He would not have been a meet high priest unless He had been
perfect, free from every spot, and deficient in nothing which is required unto
complete holiness. It is not, then, an improper distinction, that the <i>Urim
</i>refers to the light of doctrine, and the <i>Thummim</i> to the life; and
this is indeed in some measure applicable to the pastors of the Church, who
ought to shine both in sound doctrine and in integrity of life. But it was God's
design to shew that neither of these things is to be sought anywhere except in
Christ; since from Him we obtain both light and purity, when He deigns to make
us partakers of them according to the measure of His free bounty. Whence it
follows, that they who seek for the least spark of light or drop of purity out
of Christ, plunge themselves into a labyrinth, where they wander in mortal
darkness, and inhale the deadly fumes of false virtues unto their own
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What the Scripture sometimes
relates, as to the inquiries made by <i>Urim </i>and <i>Thummim, </i>it was a
concession made by God to the rudeness of His ancient people. The true Priest
had not yet appeared, the Angel of His Almighty counsel, by whose Spirit all the
Prophets spoke, who, finally, is the fountain of all revelations, and the
express image of the Father; in order then that the typical priest might be the
messenger from God to man, it behooved him to be invested with the ornaments of
Christ. Thus even then believers were taught in a figure, that Christ is the way
by which we come to the Father, and that He also brings from the secret bosom of
His Father whatever it is profitable for us to know unto salvation, hence that
fiction of the Jews is contradicted, that the responses were given in this way:
if a question was asked respecting a particular tribe, that the stone which
represented it was lighted up; and that the colors of the stones were changed
according as God refused or assented. For even if we allow that the Urim and
Thummim were the rows of precious stones themselves, still this imagination is
altogether unmeaning. But,<i> </i>as I have said, by the very form of the
breastplate God would testify that the fulness of wisdom and integrity was
contained in it; for which reason it is called "the breastplate of judgment,"<i>
i.e., </i>of the most perfect rectitude, which left nothing to be desired; for
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>mishphot, </i>often signifies in Scripture whatsoever is well and duly
ordered. The interpretation which some give, that "judgment"<i> </i>means
"inquiry," because the priest only asked for responses when he had the
breastplate on, is too restricted, and is even proved to be erroneous by sundry
passages. Let this then be deemed settled, that this honorable appellation is
meant to express a correct and infallible rule (<i>ordinem.</i>)<i> </i>Because
the breastplate was, as it were, a part of the ephod, it is therefore sometimes
comprehended in that word; in which it may be well also to observe, that this
peculiar ephod of the high priest's was different from the others, of which
mention is made elsewhere; for all of the sacerdotal lineage wore an ephod in
the performance<i> </i>of religious duties.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 14:3; 23:6.) Even David, when he danced before the Ark, wore his ephod,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 6:14;) and this custom is still retained by the <i>Jews </i>at their
chief festivals. The rest I will introduce presently in their proper
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt take two
onyx-stones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That the connection between
the priest and the people might be made more plain, God not only placed on his
breast the memorials of the twelve tribes, but also engraved their names on his
shoulders. Thus all occasion of envy was removed, since the people would
understand that this one man was not separated from the others for the sake of
private advantage, but that in his one person they were all a kingdom of
priests, which Peter teaches to have been at length really fulfilled in Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:5;) as Isaiah had foretold that there should be priests of God, and
Levites brought from the Gentiles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:21;) to which John makes allusion in the Apocalypse, where he says that we
are all priests in Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;660106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
1:6.) But we must remember the reason why our High Priest is said to bear us on
His shoulders, for we not only crawl on earth, but we are plunged in the lowest
depths of death; how then should we be able to ascend to heaven, unless the Son
of God should raise us up with Him; Now, since there is no ability in us unto
eternal life, but all our powers of mind and body lie prostrate, we must be
borne up by His strength alone. Hence<i> </i>then arises our confidence<i>
</i>of ascending to heaven, because Christ raises us up with Him; as Paul says,
we "sit<i> </i>together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:6;) however weak then we may be in ourselves, herein is all our strength, that
we are His burden. Therefore in this old type was prefigured what Paul teaches,
that the Church is "his<i> </i>body," and "the<i> </i>fullness of him,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:22.) It remains that each of us, conscious of our own weakness, should rest on
Christ; for when in foolish arrogance we exalt ourselves, we do not suffer
ourselves to be lifted up by Him, to be borne and sustained by His power. Let
the proud then, by lifting themselves on high, fall down in ruin, whilst Christ
supports us upon His shoulders. These stones are called "stones of memorial;"
and again, "for a memorial" to the children of Israel; as is also afterwards
repeated of the twelve stones; which some expound, that "God<i> </i>may be
mindful of the children of Israel;"<i> </i>others, that "the<i> </i>priest
himself may remember them;"<i> </i>others, that "the<i> </i>children of Israel
may remember that God is reconciled to them for the sake of the one Mediator;"
but I simply interpret it, that they were a monument of the mutual agreement
between God and them; as if God would shew by a visible sign that He embraced
them and received them into His sanctuary, as often as they were offered in this
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt put in the
breastplate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From these words some infer
that the <i>Urim </i>and <i>Thummim </i>were distinct from the whole work, which
is before described; others think that they were the twelve stones, because no
mention will be made of them when Moses relates that the whole was completed.
But nothing is more probable, as I have already said, than that on the
breastplate itself some representation was given of light in doctrine, and of
entire uprightness of life; and therefore after Moses has called it "the<i>
</i>breastplate of judgment," he also speaks of it as "the<i> </i>judgment of
the children of Israel;"<i> </i>by which expression he means a certain and
defined system, or an absolutely perfect rule, to which the children of Israel
ought to direct and conform
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make the
robe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This robe was above the oblong
coat between that and the ephod; and from its lower edge hung the bells and
pomegranates alternately. Although there was no smell in the
pomegranates,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet the type suggested this to the eyes;
as if God required in that garment a sweet smell as well as a sound; and surely
we who stink through the foulness of our sins, are only a sweet smell unto God
as being covered with the garment of Christ. But God would have the bells give a
sound; because the garment of Christ does not procure favor for us, except by
the sound of the Gospel, which diffuses the sweet savor of the Head amongst all
the members. In this allegory there is nothing too subtle or far-fetched;<i>
</i>for the similitude of the smell and the sound naturally leads us to the
honoring of grace,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and to the preaching of the Gospel. By
the pomegranates, therefore, which were attached to the hem of the garment, God
testified that whatever was in the priest smelt sweetly, and was acceptable
to<i> </i>Him, provided the sound accompanied it; the necessity of which is
declared, when God denounces death against the priest if He should enter the
sanctuary without the sound. And assuredly it was a general invitation which
awakened<i> </i>the peoples' minds to attention, whilst the sacred offices were
performed. There is no absurdity in the fact, that the punishment which God
threatens does not properly apply to Christ; because it was necessary to issue
severe injunctions to the Levitical priests, lest they should omit these
external exercises of piety, until the truth was manifested. The ancients do not
unwisely make a spiritual application of this to the ministers of the Church;
for the priest is worthy of death, says
Gregory,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f166</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from whom the voice of preaching is not
heard; just as Isaiah reproves "the dumb dogs."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
56:10.) But this we must especially remember, that the garment of Christ is
sonorous, since only faith, which cometh by hearing, clothes us with His
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make a
plate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without reason that
this inscription is placed upon the priest's forehead, that it may be
conspicuous; for not only did God thus testify that the legal priesthood was
approved of, and acceptable to Him, since He had consecrated it by His word, but
also that holiness was not to be sought elsewhere. These two things, then, are
to be observed, &#8212;<i> first, </i>that the priesthood of His own appointment
is pleasing to God, and so, that all others, however magnificently they may be
spoken of, are abominable to Him, and rejected by Him; and <i>secondly, </i>that
out of Christ we are all corrupt, and all our worship faulty; and however
excellent our actions may seem, that they are still unclean and polluted. Thus,
therefore, let all our senses remain fixed on the forehead of our sole and
perpetual Priest, that we may know that from Him alone purity flows throughout
the whole Church. To this His words refer,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For<i> </i>their sakes I
sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."

17:19;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and the same thing is expressed in this passage of
Moses, "that<i> </i>Aaron may hear the iniquity of the holy things," etc. It is
undoubtedly a remarkable passage, whereby, we are taught that nothing proceeds
from us pleasing to God except through the intervention of the grace of the
Mediator; for here there is no reference to manifest and gross
sins,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the pardon of which it is clear that we
can only obtain through Christ; but the iniquity of the holy oblations was to be
taken away and cleansed by the priest. That is but a poor exposition of it, that
if any error were committed in the ceremonies, it was remitted in answer to the
prayers of the priest; for we must look further, and understand that on this
account the iniquity of the offerings must be purged by the priest, because<i>
</i>no offering, in so far as it is of man, is altogether free from guilt. This
is a harsh saying, and almost a paradox, that our very holinesses are so impure
as to need pardon; but it must be borne in mind that nothing is so pure as not
to contract some stain from us; just as water, which, although it may be drawn
in purity from a limpid fountain, yet, if it passes over muddy ground, is tinged
by it, and becomes somewhat turbid: thus nothing is so pure in itself as not to
be polluted by the contagion of our flesh. Nothing is more excellent than the
service of God; and yet the people could offer nothing, even although prescribed
by the Law, except with the intervention of pardon, which none but the priest
could obtain for them. There is now no sacrifice, nor was there ever, more
pleasing to God than the invocation of His name, as He himself
declares,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Call upon me in the day
of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me,"

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:15.) Let us learn, then, that our acts of obedience, when they come into
God's sight, are mingled with iniquity, which exposes us to His judgment, unless
Christ should sanctify them. In sum, this passage teaches us that whatsoever
good works we strive to present to God are so far from deserving reward, that
they rather convict us of guilt, unless the holiness of Christ, whereby God is
propitiated, obtains pardon for them. And this is again asserted immediately
afterwards, where Moses says that by favor of the priest the sins of the sacred
oblations are taken

f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when they are made fit for offering
sacrifices, for as long as their hands are unconsecrated (<i>profanae</i>)<i>
</i>they are accounted empty, even though they may be very full, since no gift
is acceptable to God except in right of the priesthood; consequently their
fullness arose from consecration, whereby it came that the oblations duly made
had access to God. But we must observe that it is not their father Aaron, but
Moses, who sanctifies them, that the power itself, or effect of their
sanctification, may rest in God, and may not be transferred to His ministers.
Perhaps, too, God would anticipate the calumnies of the ungodly, lest any should
afterwards object that Aaron had fraudulently and unjustly extended the honor
conferred upon himself alone to his sons also, and thus had unlawfully made it
hereditary. He was protected against this reproach by the fact, that the
sacerdotal dignity came to them from elsewhere. Besides, by these means the
posterity of Moses was more certainly deprived of the hope they may have
conceived in consideration of what their father was. Therefore Moses, by
inaugurating the children of Aaron, reduced his own to their proper place, lest
ally ambition should hereafter tempt them, or lest envy should possess them when
they saw themselves put below
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt make them
linen breeches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since men, in their
natural levity and frowardness, lay hold of the very slightest causes of offense
to the disparagement of holy things, and so religion easily sinks into contempt,
God here, as a precaution against such a danger, delivers a precept
respecting<i> </i>an apparently trivial matter, viz., that the priests should
cover their nakedness with breeches. The sum is, that they should conduct
themselves chastely and modestly, lest, if anything improper or indecorous
should appear in them, the majesty of holy things should be impaired. Some,
therefore, thus explain the clause, "that<i> </i>they may minister <i>in
holiness,"</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

sense. A threat is added, that if they neglected this observance it would not be
with impunity, since<i> </i>they would bring guilt upon themselves. Nor can we
wonder at this, since all carelessness and negligence in the performance of
sacred duties is closely connected with impiety and contempt of God. What
immediately follows as to its being a perpetual law or statute, some, in my
judgment improperly, restrict to the precept<i> </i>respecting the breeches,<i>
</i>for it has a natural reference to the other ordinances of the priesthood.
God therefore declares generally, that the Law which He gives is not for a
little time, but that it may always remain in force as regards His elect people;
whence we infer that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
gnolam</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>whenever the legal types are in
question, attains its end in the advent of Christ; and assuredly this is the
true perpetuity of the ceremonies, that they should rest in Christ, who is their
full truth and substance. For, since in Christ was at length manifested what was
then delineated in shadows, these figures are established, because their use has
ceased after the manifestation of their reality. And this we have already seen
was long ago foretold by David, when he substitutes for the Levitical priesthood
another "after<i> </i>the order of Melchisedec,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:4;) but the dignity being transferred, as the Apostle well reminds us, the
Law and all the statutes must be of necessity transferred also.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:12.) The ancient rites, therefore, are now at an end, because they do not
accord with the spiritual priesthood of Christ; and herein the twofold sacrilege
of the Papacy betrays itself, in that mortal men have dared to substitute
another third priesthood for that of Christ, as if His were transitory; and
also, in their foolish imitation of the Jews, have heaped together ceremonies
which are directly opposed to the nature of Christ's priesthood. They reply,
indeed, that His priesthood remains entire, although they have innumerable
sacrifices; but they vainly endeavor to escape by this subterfuge, for if it was
unlawful to change, or to innovate anything in the legal priesthood, how much
less is it lawful to corrupt the priesthood of Christ by strange inventions,
when its integrity has been ratified by the inviolable oath of God? The Father
says to the Son, "Thou art a priest for ever;" how, then, does it avail to make
the silly assertion that nothing is taken away from Christ, when an innumerable
multitude (of priests) are appointed? How do these things accord, that He was
anointed to offer Himself by the Spirit, and yet that He is offered by others?
that by one offering He completed His work unto our full justification, and yet
that He is offered daily? Now, if there be now-a-days no lawful priest except
such an one as possesses in himself what was foreshewn in the ancient types, let
them bring forth priests adorned with angelic purity, and as it were separate
from the ranks of men, otherwise we shall be at liberty to repudiate all who are
defiled by the very slightest stain. Hence, too, has arisen their second
sacrilege, viz., that they have dared to obscure the brightness of the gospel
with a new Judaism. They were altogether without the means of proving their
priesthood, and so their easiest plan was to envelop their vanity in an immense
mass of ceremonies, and, as it were, to shut out the light by clouds. So much
the more diligently, then, must believers beware of departing from the pure
institution of Christ, if they desire to have Him for their one and eternal
Mediator.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the thing that
thou shalt do unto them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since I shall
again repeat and more fully explain these things as they are written in
Leviticus 9, in the history of the consecration of the tabernacle, it will be
sufficient to give nothing more than a brief summary of them here; nor is it my
custom to invent mysteries out of vague
speculations,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f174</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> such as may rather gratify than instruct
my readers. First, since the whole human race is corrupt and infected with many
impurities, so that his uncleanness prevents every single individual from having
access to God, Moses, before he consecrates the priests, washes them by the
sprinkling of water, in order that they may be no longer deemed to be of
ordinary rank. Hence we gather that true purity and innocence, which was but
typical in the Law, is found in Christ alone. "For<i> </i>such an high priest
became us,"<i> </i>says the Apostle, "who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
from sinners," to present Himself before God for us.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580726&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:26.) After they had been washed, God commands that they should be invested
with the sacerdotal dress, according to their respective ranks: that the high
priest should wear the ephod with the <i>Urim </i>and <i>Thummim, </i>and the
mitre with the golden plate, on which shone forth "holiness to Jehovah;"<i>
</i>and in the third place, He adds the anointing. This preparation was for the
purpose of initiating them, before they performed the office of sacrificing; but
it must be observed that, as to this first sacrifice, the duties which were
afterwards transferred to Aaron were imposed upon Moses, as if he were the only
priest; and, in point of fact, the temporal dignity which he afterwards resigned
to his brother, was still in his own hands. What Moses introduces about the
division of the victim, we shall more conveniently explain elsewhere, in
treating of the offerings, which we have stated to be the third part of the
legal worship.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt slay the
ram.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses had previously been commanded
to take the parts of the victim from the hands of Aaron, to propitiate God with
them, in order that he and his posterity might be able hereafter to perform the
same office; but here a peculiar ceremony is described, that he should smear the
right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the toe of the right foot, both of
Aaron and his sons, with the blood of a ram; and then that he should sprinkle
them and their garments with the blood which was deposited upon the altar. What
we must first observe here is, that the priest must be sprinkled with blood, in
order that he may conciliate the favor of God towards himself for the purpose of
intercession. Thus the priesthood of Christ was dedicated with blood, so that it
might be efficacious to reconcile God with us. The question now arises, why only
the right ear and the right thumb and toe were sprinkled with blood, as if the
priests were consecrated and devoted to God only in half of their persons? I
reply, that in this one part the other was comprehended; since both the ears,
and both the hands and feet have the same object, and their offices are so
connected, that what is said of one ear applies to the other. Again, it is
asked, why the ear, and foot, and hand, were smeared rather than the breast and
the tongue? and I do not doubt but that by the ear obedience was designated, and
by the hands and feet all the actions and the whole course of life; for there is
scarcely anything more common in Scripture than these metonymies, by which the
cleanness of the hands is taken for the integrity of the whole life, and the
way, or course, or walk for the direction, or manner of living. It is therefore
very appropriate that man's life should be consecrated by blood; and, inasmuch
as the foundation of welldoing is obedience, which is preferred to all
sacrifices, Moses is commanded to begin with the ear. And we know that the "odor
of a sweet smell" in the sacrifice of Christ was obedience,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:18;) on which account, David, in the spirit of prophecy, introduces himself,
saying, "Mine ears hast thou
bored."</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:6.) If any should object that the tongue is of no less importance, because
the priest is the messenger of the Lord of hosts, I answer that the office of
teaching is not here referred to, but only that of intercession; wherefore in
these three members Moses embraced whatever related to atonement. But we must
remember that what is said of the consecration of Christ does not apply to His
own person, but refers to the profit of the whole Church; for neither was He
anointed for His own sake, nor had He need to
borrow</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> grace from the blood; but He had regard
to His members, and devoted Himself altogether to their salvation, as He himself
testifies, "For<i> </i>their sake I sanctify myself."

offerings, which are called the holiness of the Lord, should be impaired,
strangers are prohibited from partaking of them; for, if it had been permitted
that every one should touch them and eat of them, there would have been no
distinction between them and ordinary food. Of the priests' portion some parts
were common to all their families; but the holy parts were excepted, to the
intent that by this particular instance the reverence due to all might be
inculcated. The reference to place has the same object, for it was not lawful to
eat what was holy within the walls of their houses, in order that it might be
distinguished from their common and ordinary food. For the same reason, whatever
remained of it was to be burnt, lest, if the flesh became rank, or the bread
moldy, their ill savor and filthy appearance might somewhat detract from the
dignity of the holy things; for the infirmity of the ancient people had need of
childish rudiments, which might still have a tendency to elevate the minds of
the pious to things above. This was the object of all these things, that no
corruption should creep in which might pollute or render contemptible the
service of God.</font><br></div>

</i>but we shall elsewhere see that this was also used separately; for it was
lawful without a victim to offer either plain meal, or cakes, or wafers seasoned
with oil. Therefore, besides the sacrifice of consecration, of which Moses has
already treated, this second offering is required from the priest, that he
should present at his inauguration a cake fried in a pan, and cut in pieces. The
reason of this appears to have been, that he might thence become the legitimate
minister of all the people, and might duly offer in the name of others, when he
had done what was right for himself. But a distinction is drawn between the
demand upon the priest and that, upon the people, viz., that it should be
"wholly burnt; " the reason for which, since it will be explained elsewhere, it
will be now sufficient to advert to in a single word. The fact was that God was
unwilling that the priests should indulge themselves in vain ostentation, which
might have been easily the case, if the oblation had been preserved for their
use, like the <i>minha </i>of the people which remained in their
hands.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although the Levites were not
allowed to go into the sanctuary, but were only the priests' ministers, and
chiefly employed in servile duties, yet, inasmuch as they carried the tabernacle
and the sacred vessels, prepared the sacrifices, took away the ashes and other
offscourings from the altar, God would have them consecrated to Himself by a
solemn rite. For as all Israel, with respect to the Gentiles, was God's peculiar
people, so the house of Levi was chosen out of the people itself to be His own
property, as it is here said. But, lest they should arrogate to themselves more
than was right, God anticipates their presumption:<i> first, </i>by putting off
their consecration for some time; <i>secondly, </i>by<i> </i>desiring that they
should not be initiated by Moses, but by Aaron; and <i>thirdly, </i>by<i>
</i>appointing a different ceremony for it. For, if they had been initiated at
the same time as the priests, under this pretext they might have contended to be
on an equality with them; therefore, although the priests were already separated
from the common people, yet the Levites still remain unconsecrated,
(<i>privati,</i>)<i> </i>in order that they may learn to reverence the priestly
office. And again, since, if they had been dedicated likewise by Moses, there
was a danger of their being puffed up with pride against all others, Aaron is
appointed to preside over their consecration, that they may modestly submit
themselves to his authority. Since, too, they were only purified by water, and
sacrifice, and without the addition of anointing, the difference in the external
rite reminded them that their degree of honor was not similar or the
same.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take the Levites from
among.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To take them from among the
children of Israel, is equivalent to subtracting them from the number of the
people, that they might not be included in the general <i>census, </i>and
accounted to be one of the tribes. This separation, then, as he will more
clearly express a little further on, devoted the Levites to God for the service
of the sanctuary. That under this pretext the Papal clergy should claim immunity
for themselves, so that they may live as they like in exemption from the laws,
is not only an unsound deduction, but one full of impious mockery; for, since
the ancient priesthood attained its end in Christ, the succession, which they
allege, robs Christ of His right, as if the full truth had not been manifested
in Him. Besides, inasmuch as all their privileges only depend on the primacy of
the Pope, if they would have them ratified they must needs prove, first of all,
that the Pope is appointed by God's command to be the head of the whole Church,
and therefore that he is the successor of Christ. As to Aaron, since he was the
minister of their installation, in this way he was set over the Levites to rule
them at his discretion. Meanwhile this ministry is thus entrusted to a man, in
such a manner as not to stand in the way of God's gratuitous good
pleasure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thus shalt thou do unto
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Aaron is commanded first to
sprinkle the water of purifying upon them, to cleanse them from their
uncleanness; and not only so, but they are commanded to wash their clothes, that
they may diligently beware of any impurity being anywhere about them, whereby
their persons may be infected. Thirdly, they are commanded to shave their skin
with a razor, that, putting off their flesh, they may begin to be new men. A
sacrifice is afterwards added, and that twofold, to make an atonement for them.
These things being completed, Aaron, in right and to the honor of the
priesthood, is commanded to offer them just like the holy bread or incense. But
the end of this was, that they might acknowledge that they were no longer their
own masters, but devoted to God, that they might engage themselves in the
service of the sanctuary. It was in testimony of alienation that some of the
people were ordered at the same time to lay their hands upon them; as if by this
ceremony all the tribes bore witness that with their consent the Levites passed
over to be God's peculiar property, that they might be a part or appendage of
the sanctuary. For private individuals (as we shall see hereafter) were
accustomed to lay their hands on their sacrifices, yet not with the same object
as the priests.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f177</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they are wholly
given.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest the other tribes should
complain that the number of the people was diminished, God declares that the
Levites were alienated from the race of Abraham, since He had acquired them to
Himself when He smote all the first-born of Egypt; for it is certain that the
first-born of the people, as well as those of their animals, were miraculously
rescued from the common destruction. Since, then, God delivered them by special
privilege, He thus bound them to Himself by the blessing of their redemption.
But this reason would seem no longer to hold good, when God, in demanding the
<i>price </i>of redemption, set the first-born
free,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f178</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as was elsewhere stated; else He would
require the same thing twice over, which would be unjust. The solution, however,
of this is easy; when, in the first <i>census, </i>the first-born of the twelve
tribes were counted, they were found to exceed the Levites in number. An
exchange was then made, viz., that all the first-born of the twelve tribes,
being 22,000 in number, should be free from the tribute, and that God should
take the Levites in their place as His ministers. Only 273 were redeemed,<i>
</i>because this was the excess of their number above that of the Levites. Thus
was it brought to pass, that God was content with these just and equal terms, so
as not to oppress the people by a heavy burden. But this compensation, which was
only made on that one particular day, did not prevent the Israelites from owing
their children, who were not then born, to God. Since, then, this obligation
still lay upon them as regarded their posterity, the law was passed that they
should redeem their first-born. If any should object that it was not fair for
those who should be born of the Levites to be consecrated to God, &#8212; I
reply, that on this point there was no unfairness, for of whatever tribe they
might be descended, they were already His property, together with all their
offspring; the condition of the people was not therefore made worse by the
exchange; and hence, in all equity, God appointed for the future at what price
the Israelites should redeem their first-born. In saying that they were "given"
to Him, He means to assert that they were His by
compact;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f179</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and in this sense He declares that from
the day in which He smote the first-born of Egypt, the first-born of Israel had
become His; and then adds, that He then took the Levites; as much as to say,
that He only dealt with his people with respect to the time
past.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have given the
Levites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He declares on what terms He
desires to have them as His own, viz., that they may be directed by Aaron, and
obey his commands; for by "a gift" is not to be understood such an act as that
whereby a person resigns and cedes his own right to another; but, when He
devotes them to the ministry of the sanctuary, He desires that they should have
a leader and master. At the end of the verse, Moses teaches that this is done
for the advantage and profit of the whole people: whence it follows, that there
was no room for ill-will towards them, unless the people should perhaps be
annoyed that God had taken measures for their welfare. A two-fold advantage is
pointed out; first, because they were to be the intercessors or ministers of
reconciliation, (for either sense would be appropriate;) secondly, because,
whilst they would be the guardians of the sanctuary, they would prevent the
Israelites from bringing destruction upon themselves, by their rash approach to
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is it, that belongeth to
the Levites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The age is here prescribed
when the Levites should begin and end the execution of their office. God
commands them to commence in their 25th year and grants them their dismissal in
their 50th; and for both these provisions there is very good reason. For, if
they had been admitted in early youth, their levity might have greatly detracted
from the reverence due to sacred things: not only because those, whose manhood
is not yet mature, are generally given to pleasure and intemperance, but because
either by negligence, or levity, or want of thought, or ignorance and error,
they might have made many grievous mistakes in the service of God; and, whilst
they were by no means fitted to exercise their charge until they should have
attained prudence and gravity, so also, lest they should fail from old age, it
was right that they should be seasonably dismissed; for as we have before said,
their duties were laborious, and such as demanded bodily strength. If, however,
any should choose to make an application of this to the pastoral office, it
should be generally remembered, that none should be chosen to it except such as
have already given proofs of their moderation, and float those who diligently
devote themselves to it should not be unreasonably pressed upon, nor should more
be required of them than their ability can bear; for some foolishly count their
years, as if it were a sin to choose a pastor before his 24th year, although he
might be otherwise fully provided with the necessary
qualifications.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto

<i>first, </i>That the Levites should be set apart for the ministry of the
sanctuary and altar; and, <i>secondly, </i>That they should obey the chief
priests of the family of Aaron, and do nothing except by their authority and
command. But it has been already said, and we shall hereafter see again, that
the tribe of Levi in general was divinely chosen to perform the sacred offices;
so that the people might know that no one was worthy of so honorable a charge;
but that it depended on the gratuitous calling of God, whose attribute it is to
create all things out of nothing. In this way, not only was the temerity of
those repressed who might be foolishly ambitious of the honor, but the whole
Church was taught that, in order to worship God aright, there was need of
extraneous aid. For, if the Levites had not stood between, the Law prohibited
the rest of the people from having access to God, since it brought in the whole
human race guilty of pollution. But, in order that they might be more certainly
directed to the One Mediator, the high priesthood was exalted, and one priest
was chosen to preside over all the rest: on this account God would have the
Levites subject to the successors of Aaron. At the same time, He had regard to
order, for a multitude, which is not governed by chiefs, will always be
disorderly. Yet, it is unquestionable that the supreme power of Christ was
represented in the person of Aaron; and hence the folly of the Papists is
refuted, who transfer, or rather wrest, this example to the state of the
Christian Church,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so as to set the bishops over the
presbyters, and thus to fabricate the primacy of the Roman See. But if the true
meaning of this figure be sought, it will be more appropriate to reason that,
whatever ministers and pastors of the Church are now appointed, they are placed
as it were under the hand of Christ, in order that they may usurp no dominion,
but behave themselves modestly, as having to render an account to Him who is the
Prince of pastors.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:4.) Hence we conclude that the Papacy is only founded in wicked
sacrilege; for Christ is unjustly deprived of His own, if any one else is
feigned to be Aaron's successor. Meanwhile, the political distinction of ranks
is not to be repudiated, for natural reason itself dictates this in order to
take away confusion; but that which shall have this object in view, will be so
arranged that it may neither obscure Christ's glory nor minister to ambition or
tyranny, nor prevent all ministers from cultivating mutual fraternity with each
other, with equal rights and liberties. Hence, too, was taken that declaration
of the Apostle, that it is not lawful for any man to take this honor upon
himself, but that they are the legitimate ministers of the Church who are
"called"<i> </i>to be so.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take thou also unto thee
principal spices.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although the oil here
treated of was not only destined for the anointing of the priests, but also of
the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altars, and all the vessels, yet no
fitter place occurs for discussing the sacred unction, than by connecting it
with the priesthood, on which it depends. First of all its composition is
described, exquisite both in expensiveness and odor; that by its very excellence
and costliness the Israelites may learn that no ordinary thing is represented by
it; for we have already often seen that there had been set before this rude
people a splendor in sacred symbols, which might affect<i> </i>their external
senses, so as to uplift them as it were by steps to the knowledge of spiritual
things. We must now see why the priest as well as all the vessels and the other
parts of the tabernacle had need of anointing. I conclude that without
controversy this oil mixed with precious perfumes was a type of the Holy Spirit;
for the metaphor of anointing is everywhere met with, when the prophets would
commend the power, the effects, and the gifts of the Spirit. Nor is there any
doubt but that God, by anointing kings, testified that He would endow them with
the spirit of prudence,<i> </i>fortitude, clemency, and justice. Hence it is
easily gathered that the tabernacle was sprinkled with oil, that the Israelites
might learn that all the exercises of piety profited nothing without the secret
operation of the Spirit. Nay, something more was shewn forth, viz., that the
efficacy and grace of the Spirit existed and reigned in the truth of the shadows
itself; and that whatever good was derived from them was applied by the gift of
the same Spirit for the use of believers. In the altar, reconciliation was to be
sought, that God might be propitious to them; but, as the Apostle testifies, the
sacrifice of Christ's death would not otherwise have been efficacious to appease
God, if He had not suffered by the Spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:14;) and how does its fruit now reach us, except because the same Spirit
washes our souls with the blood, which once was shed, as Peter teaches us?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15, 26.) Nay, whence comes the faith which admits us to a participation in the
benefits of Christ, but from the same Spirit?
</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we were especially to consider the
anointing of the priest, who was sanctified by the Spirit of God for the
performance of his office; thus, as Isaiah, in the person of Jesus Christ,
declares that he was anointed with the spirit of prophecy,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
61:1;) and David affirms the same of the royal spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
45:7;) so Daniel is our best interpreter and witness how the sacerdotal unction
was at length manifested (in
Him</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f181</font></sup><font face="Palatino">), for when he says that the time, when
by the death of Christ the prophecy shall be sealed up, was determined upon
"to<i> </i>anoint the holy of holies," he plainly reminds us that the spiritual
pattern, which answers to the visible sanctuary, is in Christ; so that believers
may really feel that these shadows were not mere empty things.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:24.) We now perceive why Aaron was anointed, viz., because Christ was
consecrated by the Holy Spirit to be the Mediator between God and man; and why
the tabernacle and its vessels were sprinkled with the same oil, viz., because
we are only made partakers of the holiness of Christ by the gift and operation
of the Spirit. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f182
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Some translate it in the masculine gender,
where of the vessels it is said, <i>"whatsoever </i>toucheth them shall be
holy;" ver. 29: as if they were not to be touched by any but the priests; but it
appears to me to be rather spoken for another reason, viz., that they may embue
the oblations with their own
sanctity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt take it an oil
of holy ointment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although the genitive
is put in the place of an epithet, as if Moses had said "a holy oil;"<i> </i>yet
it is so called from its effect, because without it nothing is accounted pure.
And assuredly the Spirit of God sanctifies ourselves and all that is ours,
because without Him we are unholy, and all that belongs to us corrupt. He
enjoins the use of the ceremony throughout all the generations of the ancient
people, ver. 31. In these words there is an implied contrast with the new
Church, which wants no shadows since the manifestation of the substance; and
justly does the only begotten Son of God possess the name of Christ, since by
His coming He has abolished these figures. And Simeon, when he took Him in his
arms, and called Him "the<i> </i>Lord's
Christ,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> taught that the external use of the
legal oil had ceased. So much the sillier is the superstition of the Papacy,
when in imitation of the Jews<i> </i>it anoints its priests, and altars, and
other toys:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f184</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><b> </b>as if they desired to bury Christ
again with their ointments; wherefore let us hold this invention in detestation
as blasphemous, because it overthrows the limits prescribed<i> </i>by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order that the Jews may hold this
mystery in just reverence, he forbids similar ointment to be made. We know that
ointments were then among the luxuries of a fine banquet; but it is accounted
profanation if they make use of this kind; and we must mark the reason, that
what is holy, may be holy unto them, ver. 32, <i>i.e., </i>that they may
reverently observe what is peculiarly devoted to their salvation. For although
the sacred things divinely instituted always retain their nature, and cannot be
either corrupted or made void by our vices, yet may we by our filthiness, by our
impure use or neglect of them, pollute them as far as in us
lies.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto the
priests.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All these things which follow
tend to the same end, <i>i.e., </i>that the priests may differ from the rest of
the people by notable marks, as if separated from ordinary men; for special
purity became those who represented the person of Christ. It seems, indeed, as
if God here gave precepts respecting small and unimportant things; but we have
elsewhere said that the legal rites were as it were steps by which the
Israelites might ascend to the study of true holiness. The declaration of Paul
indeed was always true, that "bodily exercise profiteth little,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8;) but the use of the ancient shadows under the Law must be estimated
by their end. Although, therefore, the observation of the things which are now
treated of did not of itself greatly please God, yet inasmuch as it had a higher
tendency, it was sinful to make light of it. Now though the priests were thus
admonished that holiness was to be cultivated by them with peculiar diligence,
as the sanctity of their office required; yet the principal design of God was to
set forth the image of perfect holiness which was at length beheld in Christ.
The first law contains a prohibition of mourning, absolutely and without
exception as regarded the high priest, and as regarded the sons of Aaron with
certain specified restrictions; for although God elsewhere forbids the people
generally to imitate the custom of the Gentiles in excessive mourning, yet here
he requires something more of the priests, viz., that they should abstain even
from ordinary mourning, such as was permitted to others. This prohibition indeed
was again repeated, as we shall see, arising from an actual occurrence; for when
Nadab and Abihu, who had offered incense with strange fire, were consumed with
fire from heaven, God allowed them to be mourned for by all the people, except
the priests;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f185</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but on this occasion the general law was
again ratified afresh, lest the priests should pollute themselves by mourning
for the dead; except that there mourning was forbidden even for a domestic loss,
that they might acquiesce<i> </i>in God's judgment, however sad it might be. For
by these means they were impeded in the discharge of their duties; because it
was not lawful for mourners to enter the sanctuary. Therefore God threatens them
with death, unless they should restrain their grief even for the death of a near
relative<i>. </i>But this (as is elsewhere said) is a rare virtue, so to repress
our feelings when we are deprived of our brothers or friends, as that the
bitterness of our grief should not overcome<i> </i>our resignation and composure
of mind. In this way, therefore, the exemplary piety of the priests was put to
the proof. Besides, abstinence from mourning manifests the hope of the blessed
resurrection. Therefore the priests were forbidden to mourn for the dead, in
order that the rest of the people might seek<i> </i>for consolation in their
sorrow from them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This was truly and amply fulfilled in
Christ, who although He bore not only grief, but the extreme horror of death,
yet was free from every stain, and gloriously triumphed over death; so that the
very recollection of His cross wipes away our tears, and fills us with joy. Now
when it is said, "They shall not profane the name of their God;" and in the case
of the high priest, "neither shall he go out of the sanctuary;" this reason
confirms what; I have just stated, that mourning was forbidden them, because it
prevented them from the discharge of their duties; for their very squalidness
would have in some sense defiled God's sanctuary, in which nothing unseemly was
to be seen; and being defiled too, they could not intercede as suppliants for
the people. God then commands them to remain pure and clear from all defilement,
lest they should be compelled to desert their office, and to leave the
sanctuary, of which they were the keepers. Moreover, we learn that the
fulfillment of this figure was in Christ, from the reason which is immediately
added: viz., because the holy oil is on the head of the high priest; whereby God
intimates that it is by no means right that His glory and dignity should be
profaned by any pollution.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the words
themselves; first, greater liberty is granted to the rest of the posterity of
Aaron, than to the high priest; but only that they should mourn for their
father, mother, children, their own brothers, and unmarried sisters. Lest
ambition should carry them further, they are expressly forbidden to put on
mourning even upon the death of a prince. Nor can we doubt but that the mourning
was improper which God permitted to them out of indulgence; but regard was had
to their weakness, lest immoderate strictness might drive them to passionate
excess; yet God so spared them as still to distinguish them from the multitude.
To "defile"<i> </i>one's-self, (as we have elsewhere seen,) is equivalent to
putting on mourning for the dead, celebrating the funeral rites, or going to the
burial; because the curse of God proclaims itself in the death of man, so that a
corpse infects with contagion those by whom it is touched; and again, because it
must needs be that where lamentation is indulged, and as it were excited, the
affection itself must burst out into impatience. As to the prohibition to make
"baldness,"<i> </i>this was not allowed even to the rest of the people; but God
expressly forbids it to the priests, in order to keep<i> </i>them under stricter
restraint. With regard to the high priest, something greater seems to be decreed
besides the exceptions,<i> </i>that he "shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
clothes:"<i> </i>which is still enjoined elsewhere on the sons of Aaron. But
here what would be allowable in others is condemned in the high priest; and it
was surely reasonable that he should present a peculiar example of moderation
and gravity; and therefore the dignity of his office, in which he was superior
to others, is called to mind, that he may acknowledge his obligations to be so
much the greater. This is indeed the sum, that since the priesthood is the
holiness of God, it must not be mixed up with any defilements.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses wrote this law.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It is unquestionable that Moses deposited the
Book of the Law in the custody of the Levites, to enjoin upon them the duty of
teaching; for although it is only related that they were commanded to recite the
book before the people every seventh year, yet it is easy to gather that they
were appointed the constant proclaimers of its doctrine. For it would have been
absurd that the Law should lie buried for seven whole years, and that not a word
should be heard of its instruction; besides, the difficulty of hearing in so
great a multitude would be great, and the recollection<i> </i>of it would soon
have vanished. In a word, very little would have been the use of the ceremony,
if at all other times the Levites had been dumb, and nothing should have been
heard throughout the land regarding the worship of God. This then was the object
of the solemn promulgation of the Law,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
31:10, etc.), which was made in the year of release, that the people should
daily inquire the right way of serving God of the Levites, who were chosen to be

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">nomofu&gt;lakev</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(guardians of the Law), that they might bring forward in due season whatever
it was profitable to know. Here, then, is represented to us as in a mirror what
Paul says, that the Church of God is "the pillar and ground of the truth,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:15;) because purity of doctrine is preserved unimpaired in the world,
and propagated by the ministry of pastors, whilst piety would soon decay if the
living preaching of doctrine should cease. Therefore Paul also elsewhere
commands that the sound doctrine, of which he was a minister, should be
committed by Timothy</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"to<i> </i>faithful men,
who should be able to teach others

Timothy 2:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, then, we must remember, that the Book of the
Law was given in trust, as it were, to the Levites, that the people might learn
from them what was right. The addition of "the elders" is not superfluous; for
although the office of teaching was not committed to them, yet were they given
as coadjutors to the Levites, in order that they might uphold the doctrine of
the Law, and not suffer it to be scorned. We know how great is the insolence of
the people in rejecting pious teachers, unless they are restrained by those in
authority; nor do the latter indeed duly fulfill their duty, if they do not keep
their subjects to the study of religion, who would be otherwise too much
disposed to impiety.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses in this passage calls
by the name of "the Law," not the Ten Commandments engraved on the two tables,
but the interpretation of it contained in the four books. The circumstances<i>
</i>took place thirty-nine years after God had spoken on Mount Sinai. What
follows, that it was to be read every seven years, I have commented on
elsewhere;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but there will be no harm in repeating
what may serve for the understanding of this passage. The seventh year was
chosen for this purpose, because all, both males and females, might then
assemble at Jerusalem without detriment to their private interests, for there
was a cessation from all labor; they neither sowed, nor reaped, and agriculture
was altogether at a stand-still. There was therefore no business to prevent them
from celebrating that festival, whereby God represented to them in a lively
manner, how miraculously He had preserved their fathers in the desert. Lest the
recollection of so great a benefit should ever perish, the Law indeed commanded
them, wherever they might be, to go forth from their houses every year, and to
pass seven days under the boughs of trees; but in the Sabbatical Year, when all
was at rest at home, it was more convenient for them to go up to Jerusalem from
all quarters, that by their very multitude they might the better testify their
gratitude. Therefore it is added, "when all Israel is come," etc. And it must be
observed, that in that assembly they were more solemnly pledged, one and all, to
keep the Law, because they were mutually witnesses against each other if they
should break the covenant thus publicly renewed. On this account it is added,
"Gather the people together, men, women, and children." But that it might not be
a mere empty spectacle, it is expressly commanded that the book should be read
"in their hearing:"<i> </i>by which words a recitation is expressed, from whence
the hearers might receive profit, else it would have been a sham and ludicrous
parade; just as in the Papacy, when they loudly bellow out the Scriptures in an
unknown tongue, they do but profane God's name. To this end, therefore, did God
desire the doctrine of His Law to be heard; viz., that He might obtain disciples
for Himself; not that He might fill their ears with a senseless and unprofitable
clamour. And indeed when the Popish priests were a little ashamed of altogether
driving the people away from hearing God's word, they devised this foolish plan
of shouting to the deaf, as if this silly formality would satisfy God's command,
when He ordains that all should be taught from the least to the greatest: for it
is afterwards again expressed, "that they may hear, and that they may learn."
Hence we lay it down, that the legitimate use of Scripture is perverted when it
is enunciated in an obscure manner such as no one can understand. But whilst no
other mode of reading Scripture is approved by God, except such as may instruct
the people, so also the fruit of understanding, <i>i.e., </i>that they may learn
to fear God, is required in the hearers. But it is undoubted, that "the fear of
God" comprehends faith, nay, that properly speaking it springs from faith; and
by this expression Moses indicates that the Law was given for the purpose of
instructing men in piety and the pure service of God. At the same time we may
learn from this passage, that all the services which are paid to God in
ignorance, are extravagant, and illegitimate. The beginning of wisdom is to fear
God; and on this point all agree; but then each one slips away to his own
imaginations and erroneous devotions, as they choose to call them. God, however,
in order to restrain such audacity as this, declares that he is not duly
worshipped, except He shall first have been listened to. As to "the<i>
</i>strangers," when their participation in sacred things is in question, I have
elsewhere observed that all foreigners are not so called, but only those who,
being Gentiles by origin, had devoted themselves to God, and having received
circumcision, had been incorporated into the Church; otherwise it would not have
been lawful to admit them into the congregation of the faithful; and this is
confirmed by the additional words, "that is within thy gates:" which is as much
as if Moses had said, inhabitants of your cities, and dwelling together with the
people. Finally, when their children are mentioned, reference is made to the
propagation of sound doctrine, that the pure worship of God may continually be
maintained. He therefore commands that the Law should be recited, not in one
generation only, but as long as the status<i> </i>of the people may last; and
surely all God's servants ought to take care, that they may transmit to
posterity what they have learnt themselves. Yet we must remark, that all
doctrine which may have been handed down from their ancestors, is not here
promiscuously commended; but God rather claims for Himself the entire authority,
both towards the fathers and the children.</font><br></div>

f188</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in which word Jerome says that
everything<i> </i>intoxicating is included; and this I admit to be true; but the
definition would be more correct, that all liquors espressed from fruits are
denoted by it, in whose sweetness there is nearly as much to tempt men as in
wine. Even in these days the Orientals compose of dates as well as of other
fruits, liquors, which are exceedingly sweet and delicious. The same rule is,
therefore, here prescribed for the priests, whilst in the performance of their
duties, as for the Nazarites. Both were allowed freely to eat of all the richest
foods; but God commanded them to be content with water, because abstinence in
drinks very greatly conduces to frugality of living. For few are intemperate in
eating, who do not also love wine; besides, an abundance of food generally
satisfies the appetite, whilst there is no limit to drinking, where the love of
wine prevails. Therefore, abstinence from wines was enjoined upon the priest,
not only that they might beware of drunkenness, but that they might be temperate
in eating, and not luxuriate in their abundance. But, inasmuch as sobriety is
the main point in moderate living, God especially limited His priests in this
respect, lest the rigor of their minds, and rectitude, and integrity of
judgment, should be impaired by drinking. Hence it appears how great is man's
proneness to all defilements. Wine is very wholesome as one of our means of
nutriment; but by the too free use of it many enervate their strength, becloud
their understanding, and almost stupify all their senses so as to make
themselves inactive. Some, too, degrade themselves into foul and brutish
stupidity, or are driven by it to madness. Thus a pleasure, which ought to have
incited them to give God thanks, is taken away from them on account of their
vicious excess; and not without disgrace, because they know not how to enjoy
God's good gifts in moderation. He afterwards confirms the fact, that He
interdicted wine to the priests when exercising their office, that they may
distinguish "between clean and unclean," and be sound and faithful interpreters
of the Law. On this score it became them to be abstemious throughout their whole
life, because they were always appointed to be masters to instruct the people;
but lest immoderate strictness should tend to disgust them, so that they might
be less disposed for the willing performance of the rest of their duty, God
deemed it sufficient to admonish them by this temporary abstinence, that they
should study to be sober at other times. Thus, then, it must be concluded that
none are fit to teach who are given to gluttony, which corrupts the soundness of
the mind, and destroys its rigor. The comment of Jerome is indeed a childish
one, that "A fat belly does not engender a quick understanding:"<i> </i>for many
corpulent men are of vigorous and active intellect, and indeed leanness is often
the consequence of drinking too much. But those who stuff their bodies will
never have sufficient activity of mind to execute the office of teaching. In
conclusion, we gather from this passage, as Malachi says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7,) that the priests were interpreters of the Law, and messengers of the Lord
of hosts, and not dumb masks For though the Law was written, yet God would ever
have the living voice to resound in His Church, just as now-a-days preaching is
inseparably united with Scripture.</font><br></div>

wife.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The third kind of purity is in
marriage itself, that the priests' home may be chaste and free from all
dishonor. At this time also God commands by the mouth of Paul, that pastors
should be chosen, who rule well their own houses, whose wives are chaste and
modest, and their children well-behaved.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

1:6.) The same cause for this existed under the Law, lest those appointed for
the government of the Church should be despised and looked down upon on account
of their domestic vices. But God most especially had regard to the priesthood of
Christ, that it should not be exposed to contempt. It was indeed permitted that
men should marry with impunity a woman divorced from her husband; though in the
sight of God such an union was unlawful. No law forbade private individuals from
marrying a deflowered woman; but what was permitted to the multitude God
condemned in the priests, in order to withdraw them from every mark of infamy.
And this reason is also expressed when he says that He would have the priests
holy, because He has chosen them for Himself; for if the people had not
reverenced them, all religion would have been contemptible. Therefore that their
dignity might be preserved, He commands them to take diligent heed not to expose
themselves to ignominy. Finally, still more highly to commend reverence to their
holy office, He reminds them that it related to the welfare of the whole people:
"I the Lord (He says) do sanctify him," ver. 15. In these words He intimates
that the grace of adoption, whereby they were chosen as His heritage, was based
on the priesthood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall take a wife in her
virginity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>More is required in the high
priest, viz., that he should not marry a widow, nor a woman of any other tribe
than his own. A question may indeed arise as to the latter clause, whether the
plural word ought to be restricted to one
tribe,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f189</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whereas it is elsewhere applied to all.
But, if we examine it more closely, it is plain that "his peoples" is equivalent
to "of<i> </i>his people," (<i>populares.</i>)<i> </i>But nothing peculiar will
be here required of the priest, if his wife is to be taken only from the
children of Abraham. I admit that the chief priests married wives of Other
tribes, as Elizabeth, sprung of the tribe of Judah, married Zacharias; but,
since the high priest is here distinguished from all others, I do not see how it
would follow that a law or privilege referring to him should be observed by the
whole posterity of Aaron. On this point, however, I will not contend, if any one
thing is otherwise. But assuredly, since he presented the brightest type of
Christ, it was right that superior and more perfect holiness should be beheld in
him.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For this was the tendency of the
restriction, that his wife, not having known another man, should manifest the
modesty worthy of her station and quality of sacred honor. If any should object
that the marriage of, an old priest with a young girl was ridiculous and
somewhat indecorous, as well as liable to many inconveniences; I answer, that
special regulations should be so expounded as not to interfere with general
principles. If a decrepit old man falls in love with a young girl, it is a base
and shameful lust; besides he will defraud her if he marries her. Hence, too,
will jealousy and wretched anxiety arise; or, by foolishly and dotingly seeking
to preserve his wife's love, he will cast away all regard for gravity. When God
forbade the high priest to marry any but a virgin, he did not wish to violate
this rule, which is dictated by nature and reason; but, regard being had to age,
He desired that modesty and propriety should be maintained in the marriage, so
that, if the priest were of advanced years, he should marry a virgin not too far
from his own age: but, if he were failing and now but little fitted for marriage
on account of his old age, the law that he should marry a virgin was rather an
exhortation to celibacy, than that he should expose himself to many troubles and
to general ridicule.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>

by <i>synecdoche </i>all that relates to good discipline is comprised under a
single head; viz., that his children should be educated in the study of virtue,
and in decent and pure morality. A heavy punishment is denounced against a
priest's daughter if she should play the harlot, because sacrilege would be
combined with her disgraceful licentiousness. But it is no light crime to
violate God's sanctuary; and, if the priest had tolerated such an iniquity in
his daughter, he would have been no severe avenger of the same turpitude in
strangers; nay, he would not have been at liberty to punish crimes, unless he
made a beginning in his own house.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto Aaron,
saying.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Priests in whom there was any
notable bodily defect are here forbidden from approaching the altar. I will not
curiously inquire into the defects which Moses enumerates, since the same rule
is here laid down, which is afterwards applied to the sacrifices, whereof none
but perfect ones were to be offered. For God rejected whatever was defective or
mutilated, in order that the Israelites might know that no victim would suffice
for the expiation of sin, except such as possessed complete perfection; and this
is justly required in a priest, who cannot be a mediator between God and men
unless he is free from every spot. But the analogy must be kept in view between
the external figures and the spiritual perfection which existed only in Christ.
God could bear no defect in the priests; it follows, then, that a man of angelic
purity was to be expected, who should reconcile God to the world. The bodily
imperfections, then, which were here enumerated, must be transferred to the
soul. The offering of bread comprehends by <i>synecdoche </i>the other
offerings, and the whole legal service, which the priests were wont to perform
in their course; and this the words of Moses immediately afterwards confirm,
wherein he mentions all "the offerings made by fire," besides the bread. We have
seen elsewhere that any of the people wounded in the testicles were prohibited
from entering the sanctuary; that they were, not even to set foot in the court;
but there was a special reason for this as regarded the priests, lest they
should pollute the sanctuary by their defects. Hence it appears how needful for
us is the intercession of Christ; for, if his perfect cleanness did not wash
away our impurity, no oblation could proceed from us except what would be foul
and unsavory. Moreover, it is worthy of observation that the sanctuary of God is
polluted by any defect or imperfection; and, consequently, that whatever of
their own men obtrude upon God, is condemned as profane, so far are they from
conciliating God's favor by any
merit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>

God's presence as mediators to propitiate Him. And here the imperfection of the
legal service betrays itself; for nothing could be found among men which could
fully represent the truth. Since then the defects of men rendered it necessary
to<i> </i>separate the two connected things, viz., the honor and the burden,
hence the Israelites were admonished that another priest was promised them, in
whom nothing would be wanting for the consummation of all virtues and
perfection. Finally, Moses relates that he delivered God's commands not only to
Aaron and his sons, but to all the people likewise; so that the humblest of them

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the Lord spake unto Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses
here treats of the accidents whereby pollution is contracted, although a man may
be by nature pure and sound. If any labored under natural defects, Moses
prohibited them from exercising the sacerdotal office; now, if any extrinsic
pollution may have affected a priest, he commands him to abstain from his duties
until he shall have been purified. He had already commanded that any unclean
person should be separated from the people lest their contagion should infect
others; it may therefore seem superfluous to prescribe to the priests what had
been universally enjoined. But since men placed in any position of honor are apt
to abuse God's favor as a pretext for sin, lest the sacerdotal dignity might be
used as a covering for the indulgence or excuse of scandals, it was necessary to
enact an express law, that the priests should not plead their privilege to eat
in their uncleanness of the sacrifices which none but the clean might offer. And
that their sacrilege might be the more detestable, he denounces death against
any who should intrude their pollutions into the sacrifices; for it was
necessary to arouse by the fear of punishment, and as it were to drive by
violence to their duty those who would not have been otherwise restrained by any
religious feeling from making God's service contemptible. He then enumerates the
particular kinds of pollution of which we have before spoken. Whence it appears,
that the priests were brought into discipline by this law, lest they should
think themselves more free than the rest of the people, thus might indulge
themselves in security; and this is afterwards more clearly expressed where God
admonishes them to "keep his
ordinance,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (ver. 9:)<i> i.e., </i>diligently to
observe whatever He commanded; and the greater dignity He had honored them with,
that the greater should be their study to persevere in the exercises of piety;
for he shews them that so far from their sacerdotal rights conducing to the
alleviation of their sin, they were more strongly bound by them to keep the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall no
stranger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was also necessary to add
this, that the majesty of sacred things might not be impaired; for if it had
been promiscuously permitted to all to eat of the sacred bread and the other
oblations, the people would have straightway inferred that they differed not
from ordinary food. And unless the avarice of the priests had been thus
anticipated,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> an unworthy trade would have prevailed;
for banquets would have been see up for sale, and the priest's house would have
been a kind of provision-market. The prohibition, therefore, that the meats
offered in sacrifice should be eaten by strangers, was not made so much with
reference to them as to the priests, who would have else driven a profitable
trade with the offerings, or, by gratifying their guests, would not have
hesitated to bring disrepute on the whole service of God. The Law consequently
prohibits that either a sojourner, or a hired servant, should eat of them; and
only gives this permission to their slaves, and those who were incorporated into
their families. Moreover, He counts the priests' daughters who had married into
another tribe as aliens. The sum has this tendency, that whatsoever depends on
the service of God should obtain its due reverence; nor could this be the case,
if what was offered in the temple were not distinguished from common food.
Inasmuch as they were human beings, they were allowed to subsist in the ordinary
manner; yet was this distinction necessary, which might savor of the sanctity of
Christ. This was the cleanness of the priests as regarded
food.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>

here arise, why God would have satisfaction made to the priests, if any one
should have eaten of the offerings; for they deserved punishment rather than
reward, if they had suffered sacred things to be brought into contempt by their
promiscuous use. But the error of those is here dealt with, who had not reserved
for the priests their lawful share. A portion, as we shall see, was assigned by
God, which they were to set aside before they tasted any part of the victim;
those, therefore, who had sinned by inadvertency, are commanded by Him to
expiate their fault, to restore so much to the priest, and to add a fifth part.
And this was done with the object of which we have spoken, lest, if the things
offered to God were exposed to common use, religion should be brought into
contempt. What follows afterwards, "and<i> </i>they shall not profane the holy
things," I interpret as addressed to the priests themselves; for this sentence
is connected with the previous one, in which the injunctions were directed to
the priests alone; and this is further confirmed by the next verse, which
declares that the whole people would be accomplices in the sin of the priests if
they should have polluted the sacred oblations. For thus I take the words,
"that<i> </i>they should not suffer <i>the people </i>to bear the iniquity," or
the punishment of the transgression, if the unclean should have touched things
offered to God. For as the priest is the mediator of reconciliation to
propitiate God towards men, so his impiety is a common iniquity, which brings
guilt upon all. The translation which some give, "that<i> </i>they should not
lade themselves,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is further from the sense, and
altogether wrested. Finally, God again declares that in proportion to the
greatness of the honor which He had put upon them, would be the heaviness and
inexcusableness of the crime, if they acted unworthily of their
calling.</font><br></div>

should require especial care of decency and propriety in the performance of

drawers or breeches when they went into the sanctuary; yet not content with this
symbol of purity, He forbids them to ascend the altar by steps, lest haply the
drawers themselves should be seen; since the dignity and sanctity of sacred
things would thus be impaired. By all means, therefore, He would induce the

Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A part of the sacerdotal duties,
of which mention is constantly made in the Law, is here briefly set forth; for
God says that He had appointed the priests to bless the people. To this David
seems to allude in the words:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"We<i> </i>have blessed
you out of the house of the

<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine is especially profitable, that
believers may confidently assure themselves that God is reconciled to them, when
He ordains the priests to be witnesses and heralds of His paternal favor towards
them. The word to <i>bless </i>is often used for to pray for blessings, which is
the common duty of all pious persons; but this rite (as we shall see a little
farther on) was an efficacious testimony of God's grace; as if the priests bore
from His own mouth the commandment to bless. But Luke shews that this was truly
fulfilled in Christ, when he relates that "He<i> </i>lifted up His hands,"
according to the solemn rite of the Law, to bless His disciples.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422450&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:50.) In these words, then, the priests were appointed ambassadors to
reconcile God to the people; and this in the person of Christ, who is the only
sufficient surety of God's grace and blessing. Inasmuch, therefore, as they then
were types of Christ, they were commanded to bless the people. But it is worthy
of remark, that they are commanded to pronounce the form of benediction audibly,
and not to offer prayers in an obscure whisper; and hence we gather that they
preached God's grace, which the people might apprehend by
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord bless
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Blessing is an act of His genuine
liberality, because the abundance of all good things is derived to us from His
favor as their only source. It is next added, that He should "keep" the people,
by which clause lie intimates that He is the sole defender of the Church, and
protects it under His guardianship; but since the main advantage of God's grace
consists in our sense of it, the words, "and<i> </i>make His face shine on
you,"<i> </i>are added; for nothing is more desirable for the consummation of
our happiness, than that. we should behold the serene countenance of God; as it
is said in

Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
us."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus then I interpret this clause, that the people
may perceive and taste the sweetness of God's goodness, which may cheer them
like the brightness of the sun when it illumines the world in serene weather.
But immediately afterwards the people are recalled to the First cause; viz.,
God's gratuitous mercy, which alone reconciles Him to us, when we should be
otherwise by our own deserts hated and detested by Him. What follows, "The<i>
</i>Lord lift up his countenance upon thee,"<i> </i>is a common phrase of
Scripture, meaning, May God remember His people; not that forgetfulness can
occur in Him, but because we suppose that He has cast away His care of us,
unless He actually gives proof of His anxiety for our welfare. Finally, it is
added, may He "establish peace upon his people," which others translate a little
less literally,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f197</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "put thee into peace:"<i> </i>and since
this word signifies not only rest and a tranquil state, but also all prosperity
and success, I willingly embrace this latter sense, although even its proper
signification is not disagreeable to
me.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

translated this, "They shall call upon my name:" yet since the Hebrew phrase is
emphatic, I have preferred retaining it; for God deposits His name with the
priests, that they may daily bring it forward as a pledge of His good will, and
of the salvation which proceeds from thence. The promise, which is finally
subjoined, gives assurance that this was no empty or useless ceremony, when He
declares that He will bless the people. And hence we gather, that whatsoever the
ministers of the Church do by God's command, is ratified by Him with a real and
solid result; since He declares nothing by His ministers which He will not
Himself fulfill and perform by the efficacy of His Spirit. But we must observe
that He does not so transfer the office of blessing to His priests, as to resign
this right to them; for after having entrusted this ministry to them, He claims
the accomplishment of the thing for Himself alone.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although there was no inheritance
assigned to the tribe of Levi, yet it was necessary that they should be supplied
with dwelling-places. No lands were given then where they might sow and reap;
but by way of compensation the tithes were a sufficient means of subsistence,
even after deducting the tithes which were paid to the poor. God now, however,
makes provision for their residences; and here we must carefully remark, that
they were so distributed over the whole land, as to be, as it were, guards
regularly posted for the preservation of the worship of God, lest any
superstition should creep in, or the people should fall into gross contempt of
God. For we know that they were chosen by Him, not only to attend to the
ceremonies, but to be the interpreters of the law, and to cherish sincere piety
among the people. Now if all had been placed in one station, it was dangerous
lest the doctrine of the Law should immediately fall into oblivion through the
whole land; and thus the other tribes should grow irreligious. Wherefore the
incomparable goodness of God here shone forth, since their punishment was turned
as it were into a reward of virtue, and their disgrace into honor; for this
dispersion of the tribe of Levi had been foretold by the holy patriarch Jacob,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
46:7,) that their posterity should be scattered in that land, which Levi the
father of their race had polluted by a detestable murder and wicked perfidy. God
proved eventually that this prophecy, which proceeded from Him, did not fall to
the ground unfulfilled; nevertheless, although the Levites were to be banished
here and there in token of their disgrace, yet were they set in various parts of
the land, that they might retain the other tribes under the yoke of the Law. It
was then in God's wonderful providence that they were rather placed in peculiar
and fixed residences, than allowed to mingle themselves promiscuously with the
rest of the people; for the cities which God assigned to them were so many
schools, where they might better and more freely engage themselves in teaching
the Law, and prepare themselves for performing the office of teaching. For if
they had lived indiscriminately among the multitude, they were liable to
contract many vices, as well as to neglect the study of the Law; but when they
were thus collected into separate classes, such an union reminded them that they
were divided from the people that they might devote themselves altogether to
God. Besides, their cities were like lamps shining into the very furthest
corners of the land. They were therefore fortified, as it were, by walls, lest
the corruptions of the people should penetrate to them. Their association
together also should have stimulated them mutually to exhort each other to
confinehey, decent and modest manners, temperance, and other virtues worthy of
God's servants; whilst, if they fell into dissolute habits, they were the less
excusable. Thus their cities were like watch towers in which they might keep
guard, so as to drive impiety away from the borders of the holy land. Hence was
the light of heavenly doctrine diffused; hence was the seed of life scattered;
hence were the examples to be sought of holiness and universal
integrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the suburbs of the
cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A discrepancy here appears, from
whence a question arises; for Moses first limits the suburbs to a thousand
cubits from the city in every direction; and then seems to extend them to two
thousand. Some thus explain the difficulty, viz., that the parts nearest to the
city were destined for cottages and gardens; and that then there was another
space of a thousand cubits left free for their flocks and herds; but this seems
only to be invented, in order to elude by the subterfuge the contradiction
objected to. My own opinion rather is, that after Moses had given them a
boundary of a thousand cubits on every side, he proceeds to shew the way in
which they were to be measured, that thus he may obviate all the quarrels which
might aria: from their neighbors. It is plain that, when he repeats the same
thing twice, the latter verse is only an explanation of the former; and thus it
would be absurd, that after having fixed a thousand cubits, he should
immediately double that number. But it will be all very consistent, if this
measurement be taken in a circuit; for if you draw a circle, and then a line
from the center to the circumference, that line will be about a tenth part of
the whole circumference; compare then the fourth part of the circle with the
straight line which goes to the center, and it will be greater by one part and a
half. But, if you leave a thousand cubits for the city, the two thousand
cubits</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f199</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the four parts of the circumference
will correspond with one thousand cubits from the city towards each of the
boundaries.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards prescribed, in
accordance with equity, that a greater or less number of cities should be taken
according to the size of the possessions belonging to each tribe; for, just as
in paying tax or tribute, regard is had to each man's means, so it was just that
every tribe should contribute equitably in proportion to its abundance. As to
the cities of refuge, I now omit to explain what their condition was, because
this matter relates to the Sixth Commandment; only let us observe that the
wretched exiles were entrusted to the care of the Levites, that they might be
more safely guarded. Besides, it was probable that those who presided over holy
things would be upright and honest judges, so as not to admit men
indiscriminately out of hope of advantage, or from carelessness, but only to
protect the innocent, after duly examining their case.</font><br></div>

And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy
sons.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this solemn appeal God stirs up
the priests to devote themselves to their duty with the greatest fidelity and
zeal, for He declares that if anything should be done contrary to the
requirements of religion, they should be accounted guilty of it, since those are
said to "bear the iniquity of the sanctuary" who sustain the crime and the
punishment of all its pollutions. God would have the sanctuary kept clear from
every stain and defect; and also the dignity of the priesthood was to be
maintained in chastity and pureness; a heavy burden, therefore, was imposed upon
the priests when they were set over the holy things as their guardians, on this
condition that if anything were done amiss they were to be exposed to
punishment, because the blame rested on them; just as if God had said that
negligence alone was tantamount to sacrilege. Thus their honor, conjoined as it
was with so much difficulty and danger, was by no means to be
envied.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this way did God admonish them that
the legal rites were of no trifling importance, since he so severely avenged all
profanations of them; for thus it was easily to be gathered that something far
more excellent and altogether divine was to be sought for in these earthly
elements. This may also be very properly applied spiritually to all pastors, to
whom blame is justly imputed, if religion and the holiness of God's worship be
corrupted, if purity of doctrine impaired, if the welfare of the people
endangered, since the care of all these things is entrusted to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy brethren
also.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here assigns their duties to
the Levites, that they also may minister, but, as it were, under the hand of the
priests, viz., that they may be ruled by their commands. Thus the authority was
in the hands of the priests, but the Levites afforded them their assistance. On
this ground they are prohibited from approaching the altar, or entering the
greater sanctuary; in fact, a lower degree is assigned to them, half-way between
the priests and the people. Hence did all learn how reverently God's majesty
must be served; for although He had adopted the whole people, yet so far was it
from being lawful that any of the multitude should penetrate to the altar, that
the Law even kept back the Levites from thence, although they were God's
peculiar ministers. Moreover, in this figure, we perceive how necessary is a
Mediator for us to conciliate God's favor towards us; for, if it was not
allowable for the holy and chosen seed of Abraham to approach the typical
sanctuary, how should we, who were
aliens,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> now penetrate to heaven, unless a way of
access were opened to us through Christ? Finally, when He forbids strangers from
meddling with holy things, He does not mean only foreigners, but all the people,
except the tribe of Levi; for here a distinction is drawn, not between the
Church and heathen nations, but between the ministers of the sanctuary and the
rest of the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall keep the
charge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again exhorts the priests to
be diligent in the performance of their office, with the addition of a
denunciation of punishment if they failed in zeal and earnestness. Nor does He
now threaten them alone, but the whole people; neither does this contradict the
foregoing declaration, inasmuch as the common fault of all by no means lightened
theirs. Nay, if God punished the innocent people on account of the pollution of
the sanctuary, how much heavier a punishment awaited the priests,
(<i>antistites,</i>)<i> </i>by whose fault the sin was committed, so that they
might be justly accounted its authors. Meanwhile let us learn from this passage
how sincerely we ought to demean ourselves in the service of God, the
profanation of which is intolerable to Him. Moreover, in order that the priests
might engage themselves in their duties more actively, and with greater
sedulity, He shews that they cannot give way to idleness without base
ingratitude, since they reign in a manner over the whole tribe of Levi, or at
any rate they hold the supremacy among their brethren. An indirect reproof of
their negligence, if they do not faithfully fulfill their duties, is implied,
when God reminds them that He has of His liberality honored them with the
priesthood. "I have appointed your office, as a
gift,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

Law, when others also offered the sacrifices. But, nevertheless, He strongly
charges them that they should be attentive to the performance of their duties,
since, if any of them should offend, their crime would be fatal; for so we must
understand His words, "they<i> </i>shall bear their
iniquity</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This shall be the service of
the sons of Kohath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He assigns their
various offices to the Levites: firstly, lest their promiscuous sedulity should
beget confusion; secondly, lest ambition should stimulate certain of
them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f203</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from whence disputes and contentions
might arise. We know how confusedly men work unless a certain rule is prescribed
to them, lest they should run about in an aimless hurry; and whilst each
individual desires to anticipate others, an unworthy emulation ensues, which
afterwards vents itself in quarrels. If, therefore, this had not been prevented,
the Levites would soon have made disturbances in their duty, and contentions
would have taken place between them. God, then, comes forward, and by His own
authority confines them all within their proper bounds, and restrains their
foolish passions. That a more honorable office is assigned to the sons of Kohath
than to the others, proceeds from God's gratuitous favor; and thus all pride was
suppressed, lest any should boast of his dexterity, or industry, or other gifts.
The charge of the Holy of holies is, therefore, entrusted to the sons of Kohath;
not that they should handle any part of it, but only that they should carry on
the march its vessels, when packed by the priests; for God commands the sons of
Aaron to come and take down the sanctuary, and carefully cover the veil, the
altar, and other sacred vessels with their proper covers, before the sons of
Kohath laid a finger upon them, that thus the reverence of the people for holy
things might be increased; and besides, that when the other tribes should see
even the Levites forbidden from touching the sanctuary, they might be reminded
of their unworthiness and humbled the more. Moreover, all cause of envy was
removed when the other Levites heard that a perilous duty was entrusted to the
sons of Kohath, for God threatens them with death if they touch any forbidden
thing: and lastly, admonishes the priests, the sons of Aaron, lest by their
carelessness they should destroy their brethren; for, if they should leave
anything uncovered, they would be the cause of their
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>

apparently mean and laborious, for it was a hard and also a servile work to
carry the curtains and the tabernacle, together with its coverings, the boards,
too, and the bars, and the pillars. But hence we learn that in God's service
nothing is to be despised, but that each and every part of our duty should be
cheerfully performed, inasmuch as it ought abundantly to satisfy us, that God
should have deigned to choose us as ministers of His sanctuary, so that neither
weariness nor pride should ever hinder us in our duty.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this, and similar passages,
God appoints the priests to offer the sacrifices; for although they were common
to all the people, nevertheless He would have them offered to Him by the hand of
one person, and in a particular place: first, because, if they had been allowed
to build altars everywhere, His pure and genuine worship would have been
corrupted by this variety; and secondly, that He might direct the people to the
Mediator, because this principle was ever to be held fast by believers, that no
offerings could be legitimate except by His grace. The same doctrine will often
occur hereafter, where the sacrifices are treated of; but, since we are here
discussing the priests' office, let it be sufficient to have said once for all
that it was not lawful for private persons to offer anything to God, except by
the hands of the priest, to whom this duty was enjoined. But, since in this
point vain glory is marvelously apt to affect men's minds, He threatens His
severe vengeance against whosoever shall have attempted it. It has already been
explained why God chose a single sanctuary. He now declares that, unless the
victims are brought thither, this profanation will be equivalent to the murder
of a man. He therefore commands that all the victims should be brought before
the altar, even although those who offer them may be far away; for "the surface
of the field"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> means a distant place, lest any one
should excuse himself by the inconvenience of the journey. He expressly names
the peace-offerings, because that was the kind of sacrifice whereby private
individuals were accustomed to testify their piety. God declares, then, that
their service would be acceptable to Him, if the priest should intervene to make
the oblation in right of the charge committed to him. Finally, this law is
ratified unto all generations, that its abrogation may never be attempted. The
reason for this is stated, which has been elsewhere more fully explained,
<i>i.e., </i>that a single place had been ordained at which they were to
assemble; and again, that a priest was appointed who might observe the
ceremonies enjoined by the Law, in order that they might worship God in purity;
and pollute not nor adulterate His sacrifices by strange superstitions. For we
have stated that the ancient people were tied to the sanctuary, lest religion
should be twisted and altered according to men's fancies, and lest any
inventions should creep in whereby they might easily decline into idolatry. The
commandment which He gave, then, that the priest only should offer the victims,
is recommended on the score of its great usefulness; viz., because it would
restrain the people from prostituting themselves to devils. Hence a profitable
doctrine is gathered, that men cannot be restrained from turning away to
idolatry, except by seeking from God's mouth the one simple rule of
piety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt say unto
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The law is now extended to
strangers, not those who were heathens, but those who, springing originally from
other nations, had devoted themselves to pure religion. For, if more had been
allowed to them than to the genuine children of Abraham, the corruption would,
according to their wont, have soon spread more widely. God, then, would not have
His sanctuary defiled by foreigners, lest their liberty might make its way
amongst the whole people. From this latter portion we may gather that the word
"kill"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f205</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is elsewhere taken in a sense, is
here confined to the sacrifices; since permission is elsewhere given to the
people to eat (meat) in all their cities and villages, provided they abstain
from blood. We must remember, therefore, that the question is not here as to
their ordinary food, but only as to the victims, which were never to be offered
except at the tabernacle.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If there arise a matter too
hard for thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The principal office of
the priests is here described under a single head, viz., that they should
declare what was right in doubtful and obscure matters out of the Law of God;
for although God seems only to refer to civil controversies, yet there is no
doubt but that by <i>synecdoche </i>He appoints them to be interpreters of the
doctrine of the Law. That their authority might be more reverenced in general,
He commands the people to acquiesce in their judgment even on the most
disagreeable points: for if their sentence is to be submitted to where a man's
life is in question, or when any disputes are to be settled, much more is all
exception taken away with respect to God's worship and spiritual doctrine. I
confess that the priests are not the sole judges here appointed, but that others
of the people are associated with them as colleagues, yet the dignity of the
priesthood is especially exalted. The opinion which some hold, that the high
priest alone is intended by the word judge, is easily refuted; because Moses
distinctly enumerates the priests, the Levites, and the judge. But it is
probable that there is by <i>enallage </i>a change of number in it; for it
appears from the sacred history that several were appointed, where Jehoshaphat
is related to have chosen "of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief
of the fathers of Israel" to preside at Jerusalem in judgment.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;141908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 19:8.) Assuredly the pious king would have been unwilling to depart
in the very least degree from the rule of the Law, and his zeal is praised by
the Holy Spirit Himself: but this was the arrangement made, as appears a little
further on, that the high priest held the primacy "in matters of the Lord," and
the king's governor attended to civil causes and earthly affairs. And thus again
is confirmed what I have lately adverted to, <i>i.e., </i>that the office of
teaching was entrusted to the priests, that they might solve any difficult
questions, which is also supported by the words of Jehoshaphat, when he says,
"And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren &#8212; between blood
and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even
warn them that they trespass not against the Lord."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;141910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 19:10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Certainly, as the cognisance
of capital crimes properly belonged to judges of the other tribes, so
determinations as to precepts and statutes, and the interpretation of the whole
Law, was the peculiar province of the priests; nor can we doubt but that the
words of Malachi,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7,) "the priests' lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at
his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts," were taken from this
passage. Now, to come to the sum of this, God appoints the seat of judgment to
be at the sanctuary; for, although in the first verse He seems to nominate the
priests and judges indiscriminately to the decision of earthly quarrels, yet in
the fourth verse from this He sufficiently shews that another province is
committed to the priests, <i>i.e., </i>to keep the people in sound and pure
doctrine, and to expound what is right &#8212; in a word, to be the teachers of
the Church. But, although the people were to assent to whatever they should
decide, so that it would be sinful for them to decline from it to the right hand
or the left, yet a tyrannical power was not thus put into their hands, as if,
when they had arbitrarily changed light into darkness, their perverted decisions
were to be deemed oracular. Their interpretation was to be received without
appeal; yet, on the other hand, this rule was prescribed to them, that they
should speak as from the mouth of God. It is true that the word here used is,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f206</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>thorah; </i>which, although it means
teaching, yet undoubtedly signifies that teaching which is comprised in the Law,
nay, it is equivalent to the word law. And of this Jehoshaphat is a faithful
interpreter, when he enumerates the divisions, of which Scripture everywhere
shews the Law of Moses to consist. Although
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>phi, </i>taken metaphorically, is equivalent in Hebrew to discourse, yet it
here emphatically expresses the sentence which shall be taken from the pure
teaching of the Law. The children of Israel, therefore, are commanded to do what
the priests shall have taught them; but how? according to the sentence taken
from the Law. Nor can it be doubted but that God at the same time furnished
those, whom He desired to exalt to such a high dignity, with the spirit of
understanding and rectitude, that they might not deliver any improper sentence.
And this also is conveyed by the promise, "They shall shew thee the sentence of
judgment:" since it would have been absurd that the people should have obeyed
God in vain, and to their own destruction. Since now one sole Priest, who is
also our Master, even Christ, is set over us, wo be unto us if we do not simply
submit ourselves to His word, and are not ready to obey Him, with all the
modesty and teachableness that becomes us.</font><br></div>

together the passages, in which Moses treats of the office of the priests, and
have briefly expounded them, I will now begin to treat of their rights, <i>i.e.,
</i>of the honor which God invested them with, that He might have them ready and
cheerful in their obedience. Here, however, Moses lightly touches upon what he
more fully sets forth in other passages, as we shall presently see, viz., He
assigns to the priests all the holy oblations, the various kinds of which He
afterwards enumerates. Now, there were three principal grounds for this law;
&#8212; <i>First, </i>Lest what had been already dedicated to God should be
profaned by its promiscuous use; for, that the sacrifices might retain their
proper dignity, it was necessary to distinguish the sacred from ordinary meats.
<i>Secondly, </i>A vainglorious excess in respect to the ceremonies was
restrained; for if after the victims were killed all the flesh had been returned
to the owners, a desire of
ostentation</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> would have grown up amongst foolish men,
the rich would have come emulously to gain applause, and when they had feasted
magnificently, they would have exposed the rest for sale. Thus would they have
abused their false pretense of worshipping God to the acquirement of favor
towards themselves. The<i> third </i>ground is that which Paul touches upon,
viz., that it is just that the ministers of the altar should live by the altar,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:13;) for though it is an unworthy thing that the servants of God
should be attracted by their hire, yet was God unwilling that the priests, when
they had freely bestowed their labor on the worship of the sanctuary, should
suffer from hunger, lest their alacrity might thus be repressed. For if they
desired to execute their office properly, it was necessary that they should
attend altogether to spiritual things, and abandon the care of their domestic
affairs. If any should object that these were incentives to avarice, and that an
excellent and profitable calling was set before the priests, the reply is easy:
whatever came to their share, since it was restricted to their own eating, could
not have been excessive in quantity; for they were not allowed to sell any, nor
even to give it away to others, as we have already seen, and as will hereafter
be repeated. Thus then the foul dishonesty of those, who taunt Moses as if he
had enriched the priests by the spoils of the people, is abundantly reftired;
for if there were any whose interests he would have desired to consult, surely
his own sons would have been preferred to all; yet to them there is no reference
here. Nay, whatever he grants to the priests, he takes away from his own sons
and their posterity; as if he purposely deprived them of advantages which were
not otherwise unlawful. In a word, the dignity of holy things was alone
consulted, without any endeavor being made to enrich the
priests.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now proceeds to state more
fully what he had been lately adverting to, as to the rights of the priests with
respect to the sacred oblations. We must, however, remember the contrast, which
I spoke of, between the priests of the higher order and the Levites; for, whilst
the family of Aaron is invested with peculiar honors, the other families of the
tribe of Levi are abased. God, then, assigns to the priests alone all the
offerings, in which was the greater consecration, called "the holy of
holinesses."</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f208</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>An exception<i> </i>will
afterwards appear; viz., that the whole was to be deposited, by way of honor,
with the priests, out of which they were to pay a part to the Levites, who were
performing their office in the service of the sanctuary. He tells them that this
privilege is given them "by reason of the anointing," lest the priests should
pride themselves or magnify themselves on this score; for God's gratuitous
liberality ought to instruct us in modesty and humility. It is by this argument
that Paul corrects<i> </i>and represses all vain boasting: "Why dost thou glory,
as if thou hadst not received<i> </i>it?"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:7.) Now, the sons of Aaron had obtained their anointing by no
other right, than that God had been pleased to elect them to it. This is also
indicated by their privilege being spoken of as "a gift:" but God thus more
expressly commends His grace, for He makes mention of His gift for another
reason, <i>i.e., </i>that none should enter into any dispute or controversy with
the priests on this point.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This shall be
thine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He enumerates certain kinds of
sacrifices which He desired to come to the share of the priests; viz., all the
residue of the burnt-offerings; <i>secondly, </i>the <i>minha, </i>or
meat-offering; <i>thirdly, </i>what was consecrated of the sin and
trespass-offerings; although the following clause, "which they shall restore
unto me," seems to be added by way of restriction, as if it only designated
those sacrifices of which mention will be elsewhere
made,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f209</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and by which they purged themselves from
the guilt of theft, unless it may perhaps be preferred to read it as if to the
sin and trespass-offerings this third were added, wherein people restored what
did not belong to them, that they might be freed from the guilt of theft. After
this He adds the free gifts, which the children of Israel vowed, and the
first-fruits of oil, as well as of wine and corn. But this distinction was laid
down, that God might more surely prevent jealousy and ill-will; for if there had
been any ambiguity, many disputes would have straightway arisen, and thus the
reverence due to sacred things would have been impaired. At the same time,
however, God prescribes to the priests, that none but males should eat of the
burnt-offerings, and nowhere else but in the sanctuary; for there would have
been danger (as we said before) that the dignity of these holy offerings would
have been lessened, if they had been carried away to private houses and mixed
with ordinary meats; besides, God was unwilling to indulge the priests in
sumptuous living, but by the very sight of the sanctuary induced them to be
frugal and sober in their repasts. For this was a kind of military discipline to
encourage abstinence, that they should go away from their wife and family to
take their meal. But whatever was offered as a vow, and the first-fruits, He
allows to be eaten of by the women, and in their houses, provided only that no
unclean person should touch what had once been
sacred.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every thing that openeth the
matrix.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The same thing is now ordained
as to the first-born, viz., that the priests should have them also for
themselves; though at the same time a distinction is inserted, that the
first-born of man should be redeemed. With regard to unclean beasts, the owners
were free either to redeem or to kill them. But, since this matter is not
professedly treated of here, God only briefly declares that He gives to the
priests whatever profit may be made of the first-born. The command that the
first-born should be redeemed according to the estimation of the priests, does
not mean that the priests should themselves prescribe the value, as if they had
the authority to do so; but that estimation is referred to by which they were
bound according to God's command, as we saw elsewhere; and this may be readily
gathered from the context, because the price is presently added, which God
Himself had fixed. As to the first-born of clean animals, another law is given,
viz., that they should be killed at the altar, and their fat burned, whilst the
flesh was to belong to the priests, like the breast and the right shoulder of
the burnt-offerings. But, lest any of the Levites or of the people &#8212; since
men are always eager for innovation &#8212; should ever attempt to violate this
decree, all controversy is removed in future ages, when God declares that what
He gave to the priests He would never have taken away from them. First, He uses
the word edict or
decree,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f210</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which others translate <i>"statute:"</i>
and then adds the title
"covenant,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f211</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in order that its observation may be
more sacred, and less exposed to contentions and quarrels; for nothing could be
more indecent than that the priests should dispute regarding their rights and
privileges. God, then, signifies that He shall be Himself outraged, if any one
should trouble the priests. By the word "salt," perpetuity is metaphorically
expressed; in which, however, God appears to allude to the sacrifices, which it
was not lawful to offer unless seasoned with salt; that the Israelites might
learn that, by earthly and corruptible things, something greater was designated;
for we know that salted meats do not so easily become corrupt. In a word, this
metaphor implies inviolable stability.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the remainder
thereof.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He repeats what we have seen
just before, that the residue of those oblations, in which there was peculiar
holiness, should belong to the priests; but upon condition that they should be
eaten nowhere except in the sanctuary. A special precept is also given as to the
<i>minha, </i>(meat-offering,) that it should not be made into leavened bread;
for thus the meal, which had been already dedicated to God, would be changed
into common food, which could not be done without profanation. Since, then, God
admits the priests, as it were, to His own table, the dignity of their office is
not a little heightened by this privilege; yet in such a manner as that by their
liberty the reverence due to God's service may not be impaired. Afterwards Moses
confirms in general terms that right, which had been before assigned to them,
that they should take what remained of the burnt-offerings, on condition that it
should be eaten by males only, and in the sacred place; in order that God's
presence may not only act as a restraint on their luxury and intemperance, but,
also instruct them in the sobriety due from His servants, and, in a word,
accustom them to exceeding purity, whilst they reflect that they are separated
from all others. At the end of ver. 18, some translate it in the neuter gender,
"every <i>thing </i>that shall have touched them shall be holy:" but in this
passage Moses seems to me to prescribe that none but the priests should touch
the <i>minha. </i>It was said elsewhere of the altar and its vessels, that by
virtue of their anointing they sanctified whatever was placed upon them; but we
now see that ordinary men are prohibited from touching sacred things, that their
sanctity may be inviolate. For we know that the sons of Aaron were anointed with
this object, that they alone might be allowed to touch whatever was consecrated
to God. Therefore the verb in the future tense is put for the imperative. So
also it is soon afterwards said of the victims, ver. 27, "Whosoever shall touch
the flesh thereof shall be
holy:"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f212</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because Moses enacts this special law
for the priests, that they alone should handle the sacrifices. Nor does what
immediately follows contradict this, "when there is sprinkled of the blood
thereof on any garment," etc.; for he does not mean to say that the garments or
any vessels would be consecrated by the mere touch; but it is an argument from
the less to the greater; if it were not lawful to take a garment sprinkled with
the blood, or the pots in which the flesh was dressed, out of the tabernacle,
unless the garment were washed, or the pots broken or rinsed, much more were
they to beware lest any of the ordinary people should meddle with it. For how
shall a mortal man dare to lay a hand upon that holy thing
(<i>sanctitati</i>)<i> </i>which could not even cleave to the garment; of a
priest without atonement? The sum is that a thing so holy should not be mixed
with unhallowed things.</font><br></div>

remove it to this place, especially since it expresses that kind of sacrifice
which Moses has lately adverted to, <i>i.e., </i>when they expiated the crime of
theft. God did not indeed desire that the priests should be enriched by others'
losses, nor that thieves should go free, if they offered what they had stolen to
the priests; but, if there were no one to whom they could restore it, He would
have their houses delivered from (the proceeds of) their sin; and with very good
reason, since otherwise the very gross offender would have never hesitated to
plunder the goods of a dead man, if he were without heirs. First, therefore, He
commanded their property to be restored to the lawful owners; and, if they were
dead, He substituted their kinsmen, who are called

<i>goelim, </i>on<i> </i>account of the right of redemption, which God granted
in the Law to relatives, as we shall see elsewhere; and because he who was next
of kin was commanded to marry the widow of one who had left no seed. It was
therefore a very uncommon thing that a person who had defrauded another had to
recompense the loss to the priest; for in most cases some successor to the dead

<div><font face="Palatino">In these passages Moses confirms what we have seen
before as to the rights of the priests, and also adds an exception to which he
had not yet referred. In general, therefore, he claims for the priests whatever
remained of the holier victims; and distinguishes them by this prerogative from
the other Levites; from whence we gather how free from all self-seeking<i>
</i>Moses was, when by God's command he deprives his own sons not only of the
dignity which was conferred on his nephews, but also of their pecuniary
advantages. Let none, he says, but the sons of Aaron enjoy the sacred oblations,
because they are divinely anointed that they may approach the altar. But, since
some rivalry might have arisen among themselves, he adds a special law, that
certain kinds of offerings should only be taken by the priest who had offered
them. For although they ought all to have disinterestedly discharged their
duties, and not to have been attracted by lucre, yet, that all might perform
their parts more cheerfully, he appoints a reward for their labor and diligence.
On this account he prescribes that the residue of the <i>minha </i>in the
peace-offerings, and also the right shoulder of the victim, and the flesh that
remained of the trespass-offerings, should be the recompense of the priest who
had performed the office of atonement and sprinkling the blood. It is
unquestionable that many were attracted by the desire of gain, who would
otherwise have neglected their duties; but this was a proof of God's fatherly
indulgence, that He consulted their infirmity so that their hire might be a spur
to their diligence. Meanwhile He did not desire to hire their services like<i>
</i>those of slaves, so that they should be mercenaries in heart; but rather,
when He reproves them by<i> </i>His Prophet because there were none of them who
would "kindle fire on His altar for nought."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi

their services gratuitously, but because, when they received their hire, they
defrauded Him who had appointed them to be His ministers.</font><br></div>

general to the payment of those tithes which were common to all the Levites. We
shall soon afterwards see that the Levites, by God's command, paid other tithes
to the priest; and a third sort will be added, which were only offered every
third year. As to the present passage, God requires tithes of the people for the
maintenance of the tribe of Levi. It is indeed certain that the custom had
existed of old among the ancient patriarchs before the Law, that they should vow
or offer tithes to God, as appears from the example of Abraham and Jacob.
Moreover, the Apostle infers that the priesthood of Melchisedec was superior to
that of the Law, because, when Abraham paid him tithes, he also received tithes
of Levi himself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
14:20;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
28:22;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:11.) But there were two different and special reasons for this payment of
tithes, which God ordained by Moses. First, because the land had been promised
to the seed of Abraham, the Levites were the legitimate inheritors of a twelfth
part of it; but they were passed over, and the posterity of Joseph divided into
two tribes: unless, therefore, they had been provided for in some other way,<i>
</i>the distribution would have been unequal. Again, forasmuch as they were
employed in the sanctuary, their labor was worthy of some remuneration, nor was
it reasonable that they should be defrauded of their subsistence, when they were
set apart for the performance of the sacred offices, and for the instruction of
the people. Two reasons are consequently laid down why God would have them
receive tithes from the rest of the people, viz., because they had no part in
Israel, and because they were engaged in the service of the tabernacle. Besides,
God, who as their King laid claim to the tithes as His own right, resigns them
to the Levites, and appoints them to be as it were His representatives. To this
the words, "I<i> </i>am thine inheritance,"<i>
</i>refer.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The manner in which the tithes were
employed will be seen afterwards in its proper place: it will be sufficient now
to remember that the part which God had taken away from them and transferred to
the sons of Joseph was thus compensated for; and since they were withdrawn from
domestic cares, that in the name of all the people they might be more at liberty
for, and more intent upon, sacred things, an income for their maintenance was
thus given them. Wherefore the Papal priests draw a silly inference, when they
claim the tithes for themselves, as if due to them in right of the priesthood;
else must they needs prove that those, whom they call the laity, are their
tenants, as if they were themselves the lords of the twelfth part of all landed
property; and again, it would be sacrilege to appropriate the tithes to their
own use, and to possess other lands of which they receive the rent. Nor does
that expression of the Apostle, which they no less dishonestly than ignorantly
allege, help them at all,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The priesthood being
changed, the right also is at the same time transferred."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
7:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle there contends, that whatever the Law had
conferred on the Levitical priests now belongs to Christ alone, since their
dignity and office received its end in Him. These blockheads, just as if they
had robbed Christ, appropriate to themselves the honor peculiar to Him. If they
duly performed their duties, and, giving up all earthly business, devoted
themselves altogether to the instruction of the people, and to the execution of
all the other offices of good and faithful pastors, unquestionably they ought to
be maintained by the public; as Paul correctly infers that a subsistence is now
no less due to the ministers of the Gospel than of old to the priests who waited
at the altar,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:14;) but under this pretext they unjustly lay hands on the tithes,
as if they were their owners, and with still greater impudence accumulate landed
properties and other revenues.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is probable
that when the Roman
Emperors</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f214</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> first professed themselves Christians,
either induced by just and proper feelings, or out of superstition, or impressed
with a pious solicitude that the Church should not be without ministers, they
gave the tithes for the maintenance of the clergy; for whilst the Roman State
was kee, the people used to exact tithes from their tributary nations. And this
was the case, too, where there were kings; for the
Sicilians</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f215</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> paid tithes before the Romans obtained
dominion over them. Moreover, if there was a scarcity of corn in the city, the
senate demanded a second tithe of the provinces. <i>Nay, </i>we gather from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 8:15, that it was a most ancient custom for kings to receive tithes; so
that we need not be surprised that the Romans should have imitated this example.
Whence we may infer that, when the Emperors wished to bestow a maintenance on
pastors out of the public stock, they rather chose a tenth than any other
proportion, that they might imitate God. And in fact some traces of this still
remain; for the tithes do not everywhere belong to the priests; and it is well
known that a good part of them are swallowed up by monks and abbots, who were
not formerly reckoned among the clergy. I need not say that some lands are tithe
free. But how would the Pope have allowed them to be held by laymen, if, by
divine right, (as they stupidly prate,) they had been the sacred inheritance of
the clergy? In conclusion, inasmuch as titlies are to be counted amongst public
imposts and tributes, let not private individuals refuse to pay them, unless
they wish to destroy the political state and government of kingdoms; but let
pious princes take care to correct abuses, so that idle bellies may not devour
public revenues which are devoted to the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am thy
part.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have just before explained the
meaning of this clause, viz., that, because the Levites were excluded from the
common inheritance, God compensates this loss out of what is His, as if they
received it from His hand; as much as to say, that He in Himself afforded a
supply abundantly sufficient for their remuneration. Meanwhile, they are
commanded to be contented in Him alone. Nor can we doubt but that David alludes
to this passage when he exclaims,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord is the portion
of mine inheritance; the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
16:5;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for he intimates not only that God is more to him
than all earthly wealth, but that in comparison with Him all that others
accounted to be most excellent and delectable was worthless. Since now we are
all made priests in Christ, this condition is imposed upon us, that we should
seek no other portion. Not that we are actually to renounce all earthly goods,
but because our felicity is so securely based on Him, that, contented with Him,
we should patiently endure the want of all things, whilst those who possess
anything should be no less free and unentangled than as if they possessed
nothing.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the tithe of the
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words God shews that in
assigning the tithes to the Levites, He ceded His own rights, inasmuch as they
were a kind of royal revenue; and thus He bars all complaint, since otherwise
the other tribes might have murmured on being unduly burdened. He therefore
appoints the priests as His receivers, to collect in His name what could not be
refused without impious and sacrilegious fraudulency. In the provision that,
where the tithes are redeemed by a money payment, a fifth part should be added
to their value, the object is not that the Levites should make a gain of the
loss of others; but, because the owners of property craftily aimed at some
advantage in this commutation of corn for money, frauds are thus prevented
whereby something would be lost to the Levites by this deceptive exchange. On
the same grounds He commands that the animals, whatever they might be, should be
given as tithe, and does not permit them to be redeemed by money, since, if the
choice had been free, no fat or healthy animal would have ever come to the
Levites. Therefore, in this law a remedy was applied to avarice and meanness,
and not without good cause; for if the proverb be true, that "good laws spring
from evil habits,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f216</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it was necessary that so covetous and
ill-disposed a people should be restrained in the path of duty by the utmost
severity. And although such careful provision was made for the Levites, yet
there was scarcely any period in which they did not suffer from want, and
sometimes they wandered about half-starved; nay, after the return from the
Babylonish captivity, the memory of so great a blessing did not prevent a part
of the tithes from being surreptitiously withheld from them; as God complains in

does not, however, immediately declare to whom they are to be paid, but inserts

But when, soon afterwards, in verse 27, he recommends the Levites to them, he
shews what is the proper use to which they are to be applied. He signifies that
it would be cruel to defraud the Levites of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the end of three

opinion, who think that another kind of tithe is here referred to. It is rather
a correction or interpretation of the Law, lest the priests and Levites alone
should consume all the tithes, without applying a part to the relief of the
poor, of strangers, and widows. In order to make this clearer, we must first
observe, that not every third year is here
prescribed,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f218</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but that the years are counted from the
Sabbatical year; for we shall elsewhere see that on every seventh year the land
was to rest, so that there was no sowing nor reaping. After two harvests,
therefore, the tithes of the third year were not the entire property of the
Levites, but were shared also by the poor, the orphans, and widows, and
strangers. This may easily be seen by calculating<i> </i>the years; for
otherwise the third year would have often fallen on the Sabbatical one, in which
all agriculture was at a stand-still. Now, this was a most equitable
arrangement, that the priests and Levites having been well provided for during
two years, should admit their poor brethren and strangers to a share. Some part
was thus withdrawn from their abundance, lest they should give themselves up to
luxurious habits; and thus it was brought about that not more than a twelfth
portion every <i>year </i>should remain to them. In sum, there was one peculiar
year in every seven in which the Levites did not alone receive the tithes for
their own proper use, but shared them with the orphans, and widows, and
strangers, and the rest of the poor. "They shall eat (He says) and be
satisfied," who would otherwise have to suffer hunger, "that the Lord may bless
thee," (verse 29;) by which promise He encourages them to be
liberal.</font><br></div>

protestation is enjoined, in which they condemn themselves as guilty before God,
if they have not faithfully paid the tax imposed upon them; but they pray for

separate, or "bring away out of the house," is equivalent to their being
conscious of no fraud in withholding from God what was His; and thus that they
were guiltless of sacrilege, since they had not diverted anything holy to their
private use. What follows, "I<i> </i>have not transgressed thy commandments,

my mourning </i>(<i>tristitia</i>)<i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>It is clear that the sacred offerings are here spoken of; but the question
is, what is meant by eating in mourning? This is the exposition received by
almost universal consent; that although want may have tempted them to theft and
fraud, yet the people assert that, even in their poverty and straits, they have
abstained from the hallowed things; and to this I willingly assent; although
this word "mourning"<i> </i>may be taken for the anxiety of a mind conscious of
its iniquity in this sense, "I<i> </i>have not knowingly and willingly eaten
anything consecrated to God, so that the hot iron (<i>cauterium</i>)<i> </i>of
an evil conscience should burn me, in the way in which man's guilt ever torments
and troubles him." As to the second clause, interpreters differ. Some translate
the word
<i>'</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[b</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
bagnar,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f221</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>"to destroy:" as if it were said,
that they had suffered nothing to perish through uncleanness; but others explain
it, I have taken away nothing for a profane purpose. My own opinion is, however,
that the word
<i>'</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">amf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tama, </i>is used adverbially for "impurely," so that the people testify that
they are not polluted, or contaminated by withholding
anything.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f222</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus, in my idea, some do not badly
translate it "by uncleanness:" for it was not possible for the Israelites to
apply the tithes to other uses, without contracting pollution by their wicked
abuse of them. The ambiguity in the third clause is still greater; literally it
is, "I have not given thereof to the dead." In my version I have followed those
who refer it to funeral rites; but some suppose that the word "dead"<i> </i>is
used metaphorically for an unclean thing; others, in a less natural sense, for
expenses, which do not contribute to support man's life. But it does not yet
appear wherefore it should he said that nothing had been spent on funeral rites.
It is true that whatever had touched a dead body was unclean; and therefore some
expound it, that the victims had not been polluted by any connection with
funeral preparations. But if this sense is preferred, the expression must be
taken by <i>synecdoche </i>for anything unclean. My own opinion however, is,
that under this particular head all things are included which have a shew of
piety. The burial of the dead was a praiseworthy office and a religious
exercise;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that it might afford a colorable
pretext for peculiar laxity; in this word, therefore, God would have the
Israelites declare, that they offered no excuse if they had misemployed any of
the consecrated things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>

offer their prayers and supplications, that God would bless the land, on this
condition, that they had not defiled themselves by any sacrilege, at the same
time they are reminded, on the other hand, that God's blessing was not else to
be hoped for. Meanwhile the expression is remarkable, "Bless<i> </i>the land
which thou hast given us, a land that floweth with milk and honey:" for we infer
from hence that the land was not so much fertile by nature, as because God daily
watered it by His secret blessing to make it so.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is another kind of tithe,
<i>i.e., </i>a hundredth part of the whole produce, which the Levites paid to
the priests. Some reckon a third kind; but I have given my reasons why I do not
agree with this opinion. Assuredly it is not probable that in the same year
double tithes were exacted and paid. Let this twofold division, therefore, be
enough for us. A larger portion was given to the priests, not only as an
honorable distinction, but. because greater holiness and integrity in expending
them was expected from them; and also that they might meet many peculiar
burdens. Lest then the Levites should be too sordid and niggardly, God declares
that their theft would be no less wicked if they dealt dishonestly towards the
priests, than as if the people should withhold any part of their own just share;
for this is the object of the words, that the tithe of the tithes, which they
are commanded to pay, should be as if they paid it from the threshing-floor and
the wine-press, (ver. 27;) as though it were said that they were no more
exempted from the second tithes, than the people from the first. The precept is
then still further extended, viz., that they should offer a part of all the
offerings. Thirdly, sincere liberality is inculcated upon them, that they should
not lay aside as the priests' portion anything that was lean or out of
condition, or in any respect of inferior quality, but that they should rather
offer whatever was most choice; for this is what is meant by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">blj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheleb,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f224</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which some translate <i>adeps;

metaphor contained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall eat
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because the tithes were reckoned to
be amongst the sacred oblations, a question might arise, whether it was lawful
to eat them anywhere except in the sanctuary. God therefore declares, that when
the Levites had separated the
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">deuuterodeka&gt;tav</font><font face="Palatino">
(the second tithes,) the residue passed into the nature and condition of
ordinary meats; inasmuch as they might then eat in any place of the bread made
of tithe-corn, like the produce of their own fields. The reason, which is
subjoined, seems to be by no means appropriate; via, that it was the reward for
the labor which they bestowed on the service of the tabernacle; for hence it was
rather to be inferred, that this food was peculiarly destined for the ministers,
whilst they were discharging their official duties, and keeping watch in the
tabernacle, or killing the victims at the altar. But since by God's command they
were scattered over the whole land, and did not cease to be ministers of the
tabernacle on account of the distance of their residence, it was justly
permitted that, wherever they might be, they should eat of the meat appointed
them by God. If it were allowable to <i>take </i>the particle

<i>ki,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f225</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>adversatively, the sense would be
clearer. In the next verse he confirms the same declaration, <i>i.e., </i>that
they should be free from all guilt when they had honestly paid the priests. Yet
at the same time they are strictly admonished that they should not commit
themselves by any fraud; for God declares that it would amount to sacrilege, if
they should have thievishly embezzled any of it, and threatens them with capital
punishment; for "to pollute the holy things" of the people, is equivalent to
profaning whatever was consecrated in the name of the whole
people.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The priests, the Levites, and
all the tribe of Levi.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This chapter
contains three principal heads; for <i>first, </i>God shews that there was no
reason why the Israelites should be aggrieved at paying tithes to the Levites,
and at remitting the first-fruits and other oblations to the priests, since this
tribe was deprived of their inheritance. <i>Secondly, </i>He<i> </i>obviates all
quarrels, and prevents unlawful gains and pilferings, by assigning their just
share to the priests and Levites. <i>Thirdly, </i>He defines how the oblations
should be parted among them, and what part of the victims the priests were to
take. As to the first clause, since God was as it were the lot of their
inheritance, they justly claimed to themselves the right which he had
transferred to them. If it were disagreeable to the people that their revenue
should be tithed, God came as it were between, and declaring that it was His
property in His right as King, appointed the Levites to be His stewards and
collectors for receiving it. There was then no ground for any one to raise a
dispute, unless he chose professedly to rob God. But this declaration often
occurs; since it was of great importance that the people should be assured that
God accounted as received by Himself what He had assigned to the Levites; not.
only lest any portion should be withheld from them, but also that every one
should willingly pay the lawful dues of God's ministers; and again, lest any
should wickedly murmur because the first-fruits and some portion of the
sacrifices were appropriated for the subsistence of the priests. Another reason
is also expressed, why the honor assigned to the priests should be paid without
grudging; viz., because God had appointed them to be the ministers of His
service; but "the<i> </i>laborer is worthy of his
hire."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this shall be the
priests' due.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not only for the
sake of the priests that God enumerates what He would have them receive, that
they may obtain what is their own without murmuring or dispute; but He also has
regard to the people,<i> </i>lest the priests should basely and greedily take
more than their due; which sacred history relates to have been done by the sons
of Eli,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 2:23,) for they had advanced to such a degree of licentiousness, that,
like robbers, they seized violently on whatever their lust desired. Lest
therefore they should give way to this gross covetousness, God prescribes to
them certain limits, to which they were to confine themselves, so that if they
transgressed them, it was easy for any of the people to convict them of
avarice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if a Levite
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This third head more clearly
explains what is elsewhere more obscurely declared; for God seemed to curtail
from the Levites whatever He gave to the priests. But He now more distinctly
places the priests in the first rank, yet so that they should admit the Levites
on the score of their labor's to a share of the oblations. This is the sum of
the law, that the Levites who remained at home, should be content with the
tithes, and touch nothing of the other offerings; but that from whithersoever
they should come to the sanctuary, they were to be accounted as ministers and
take their proper place. By this law then, it was provided that none should be
excluded on the ground of the intermission of their duties; and that the
condition of those that dwelt elsewhere should not be worse than of those who
lived at Jerusalem. For although they might reside in other cities, they did not
altogether cease<i> </i>from their ministry, since they had other duties to
perform besides that of sacrificing the victims. Yet those who entirely devoted
themselves to the work of the sanctuary, were endowed by God with double honor;
since it was by no means just that they should be defrauded of their
maintenance, who bade adieu to domestic cares and labors, and occupied
themselves totally in holy offices. That this distribution was not superfluous,
will best appear from the narrative of Josephus, who relates that
the</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

violence, and deprived the Levites of their subsistence by hostile

<div><font face="Palatino">We now come to the third part of the external service
of God, which will bring us to the end of our exposition of the Second
Commandment. We have, then, now to treat of the sacred oblations, the first
place amongst which I have thought it best to give to the loaves, which had
their peculiar table opposite the candlestick on the north side, as we saw in
the construction of the Tabernacle; for although the mention of them will recur
elsewhere, yet, since they were offered separately, and placed before the Ark of
the Covenant, as it were in God's sight, they must not be treated of apart from
the sacrifices. I have already explained that this was no ordinary symbol of
God's favor, when He descended familiarly to them, as if He were their messmate.
They were called "the bread of
faces,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f227</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because they were placed before
the eyes of God; and thus He made known His special favor, as if coming to
banquet with them. Nor can it be doubted but that He commanded them to be twelve
in number, with reference to the twelve tribes, as if He would admit to His
table the food offered by each<i> </i>of them. The "two tenths" make the fifth
part of the <i>epah. </i>And it is plaia indeed that this rite was thus
accurately prescribed by God, lest diversity in so serious a matter might
gradually give birth to many corruptions. In the word "tenths," He seems to
allude to the tax which He had imposed on the people, that thus the holiness of
the loaves might be enhanced. But why He required two "tenths" rather than one I
know not, nor do I think it any use more curiously to inquire. I refer to the
frankincense the words, "that it may be on the bread for a memorial:"<i> </i>as
if it were said that the bread, seasoned by the smell of the incense, would
renew the memory of the children of Israel, so that they should be of sweet
savor before God. Others translate it "a monument" instead of "for a memorial,"
but with the same meaning. But although some think that the bread itself is
called a memorial, it is more applicable to the frankincense; for it is
afterwards added, that the incense should be at the same time a burnt sacrifice,
viz., because in it the bread was, as it were, offered in burnt
sacrifice.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The custom of sacrificing has always been in use
among all nations, and its origin is doubtless to be traced to the ancient
Fathers; but after the whole world had fallen away into superstition, first of
all, the rites themselves became<i> </i>degenerate, when every one invented
something new for himself, and made an absurd mimicry of whatever remained
having any similarity, since they no longer retained their proper end and use.
All heathendom was ignorant of the reason why it was needful that God should be
appeased by blood; and therefore they shed the blood of their victims
unreasonably, inasmuch as they did not know themselves to be guilty before God,
so as humbly to seek for pardon; and much less did they apply their minds to
embrace the atonement, which was not only predestinated in God's secret
counsels, but likewise promised to men. Hence we infer that all the religious
services of the Gentiles were rejected of God, (<i>reprobatos,</i>)<i> </i>since
they were not based upon His word. Only let this be deemed sure, that, by the
very custom of sacrifice, adulterated as it was, they were convicted of their
own unworthiness, so that they should have acknowledged<i> </i>that God can only
be propitiated towards the human race through the medium of a reconciliation.
Foolish, then, was the philosophy of Pythagoras, which held that God's name was
contaminated by sacrifices; for thus does the Poet introduce him, inveighing

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">He was pained that an innocent animal should
be slain for man's sin; but he might have considered, what it was gross
ignorance not to feel, that men are but too impudently audacious and foolhardy
if they come into God's presence to ask His pardon, seeing that He is justly
offended with them all. There is, therefore, nothing absurd in submitting to the
eyes of sinners that judgment of death which they deserve, in order that,
descending into themselves, they may begin seriously to abominate the sin in
which they fondly indulged themselves. But this was the chief cause of the error
of Pythagoras, that he knew not that God could not be reconciled without an
expiation. Since, however, this is a thing which is beyond the reach of the
human mind, let us, who have ever truly sought after God, learn, under the
guidance and teaching of Scripture, that He has appointed the propitiation to be
by blood; so that, before the delivery of the Law, religion was always
sanctioned by sacrifices. Nor can it be doubted but that by the sacred
inspiration of the Spirit, the holy fathers were directed to the Mediator, by
whose death God was hereafter to be appeased; and surely if Christ be put out of
sight, all the sacrifices that may be offered differ in no respect from mere
profane butchery. But afterwards a clearer revelation was added in the Law; and
since many modes of sacrificing were heaped together by the Gentiles, God left
out no part of them at all which might afford a profitable exercise for
believers, whether their piety was to be testified, or thanksgivings to be made,
or zeal to be added to their prayers, or purification to be sought, or sins to
be atoned for. Yet the twofold division of them is complete and clear when we
say that some of them were expiatory, and others testimonies of gratitude. Thus,
under the first head I include the rites of consecration, by which God would
have the priests initiated, since purification was their main object. Moreover,
since it is plain that God can listen to no prayers without the intercession of
Christ, the constant morning and evening sacrifice was instituted to consecrate
the prayers of the Church; and, even when they only celebrated the bounties of
God, blood was shed, that they might know that not even their gratitude was
acceptable to Him, except through the sacrifice of the Mediator; in a word, that
nothing pure can proceed from men unless purged by
blood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now this is that which thou
shalt offer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have thought it well to
give the first place among the sacrifices to that daily one which is called the
continual sacrifice; for God would have two lambs offered to Him every morning
and evening, that the people might perpetually exercise themselves in the
recollection of the future reconciliation. But, although the sacrifices were
constantly repeated under the Law, inasmuch as their offering had no efficacy in
expiating sin, yet it must be observed that, as the priest entered once every
year<i> </i>into the holy of holies with blood, so it was profitable that
another kind of victim should be daily set before the people's eyes, in order
that they might reflect that they had constant need of being reconciled to God.
Propitiation was, therefore, daily made with two lambs, that the Israelites,
being reminded of their guilt and condemnation, from the beginning to the end of
the day, might learn to fly to God's mercy. The lamb chosen for this sacrifice
was spotless and entire, for the mention of its age (one year) implies its
perfection or entireness. It was offered with a cake made with oil, and a
libation of wine; and doubtless the ancients were reminded by these symbols that
it is not lawful to offer anything tasteless to God. True that God was not
gratified by their sweet savor, neither did He desire to accustom the priests to
delicacies that they might be epicures under color of religion; for the scent of
wine cannot in itself be pleasing to God; but the object of these seasonings was
that the people should not rest in the bare and empty figures, but should
acknowledge that something better and more excellent underlay them. The savor of
the wine and oil, then, was nothing else than the spiritual truth; that the
people, for their part., might bring to the sacrifices faith and repentance. And
assuredly the external ceremony without the reality would have been mere folly.
Even heathen nations partially imitated this rite; whence those words of Horace,

but thought that their gods took delight, like, human beings, in sweet and
delicate foods; whilst, as I have above hinted, God's intention was very
different; for, by the, external savor, He desired to arouse His people, so
that, being affected by a serious feeling of repentance, and by pure faith, they
should seek for the remission of their sins, not in these lambs which they saw
slain, but in the victim promised to them. They called it the "continual"
sacrifice, because God commanded it to be offered continually through all
generations; but it appears from Daniel that it was temporary, for it ceased at
the coming of Christ; for so speaks the angel:
Christ</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"shall confirm the covenant

people were directed to Christ. But if this was its use and object with the
ancients, the profit of it now returns upon us, that we may know that whatever
was then shewn under the figure was fulfilled in Christ. God promises that this

<i>yagnad, </i>from whence it is derived. What, then, is the tabernacle of the
convention? God Himself answers, that it is the place which He has chosen and
appointed unto His people, that they may there mutually come to agreement with
<i>each </i>other. Some conceive its root to be,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hd[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
gnadah, </i>which is to make protestation as by a solemn rite; but since this is
opposed to grammar, I will take what is certain. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[y</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
yagnad, </i>in this construction, means to contract or agree with another, or at
least to meet for the transaction of mutual business; no word, therefore, has
appeared to me more nearly equivalent to it than <i>convention; </i>for the fact
that God invited them to familiar colloquy, was of the greatest weight in
preserving the modest reverence of the faithful towards the priests. In the next
verse He repeats to them, addressing them in the third person, that whosoever
shall desire to be reckoned among the Israelites, should not turn away or wander
elsewhere; for a law is laid down for all the children of Israel, that they
should seek God there. Another confirmation is subjoined, <i>i.e., </i>that this
place ought to be sanctified, because God will there magnificently display His
glory. In fine, from the whole passage, it appears that God's design was to keep
the people bound to Him by the tie of the Levitical priesthood; yet we must
observe that it is God alone who sanctifies both the place and the offerings, as
well as the men themselves. Wherefore frivolous is the boast of those who
arrogate more than God has conferred upon them. If we believe the Pope, in him
is the holiness of holiness; yet, since he does not produce God's authority for
this, but vaunts himself of titles invented without foundation, we may safely
laugh at his stupid impudence. But from this and similar passages, our doctrine
is taken that Christ ought not to be estimated humanly, but according to His
heavenly and divine power. Hence, too, is refuted the boast of the Popish
priests that they offer Christ; for we must always ask them, By what authority?
since God claims for Himself alone this right of sanctifying those who exercise
the lawful priesthood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>46.</b><i>

here given has some connection with the feast of the passover, but since the
sacrifices are avowedly treated of, and no mention is made of its other
observances, except in this place, I have connected it with the continual
sacrifice, as its concomitant or part. Moses cursorily refers, indeed, to what
we have already seen, <i>i.e., </i>that the people should abstain from leaven
for seven days, and eat unleavened bread; but he afterwards descends to the main
point of which he here proposed to treat, viz., that the people should slay two
bullocks as a burnt-offering, a ram, and seven lambs, together with a goat for a
sin-offering; and that this sacrifice should be repeated through the whole week.
In order, then, that the reverence paid to the passover should be increased,
this extraordinary sacrifice was added to the continual one, partly that they
might thus be more and more stimulated to devote themselves to God; partly that
they might acknowledge how familiarly He had embraced them with His favor,
inasmuch as He took these offerings from their flocks and herds, and required
the sacred feast to be prepared for Him out of their cellars and granaries also;
partly, too, that professing themselves to be worthy of eternal death, they
should fly to Him to ask for pardon, and at the same time should understand that
there was but one way of reconciliation, <i>i.e., </i>when God should be
propitiated by sacrifice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Also in the day of
thefirst-fruits.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses delivers the same
commandment as to another festival, viz., that on which they offered their
first-fruits. Then, also, he instructs them, the continual sacrifice was to be
increased by the addition of two bullocks, one ram, seven lambs, a goat for a
sin-offering, together with the <i>minha </i>and a libation, with the object, of
which I have already spoken. A perplexing difficulty here arises, because in
Leviticus 23, one bullock is mentioned instead of two, and, on the contrary, two
rams instead of one.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f238</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some think that an option was left to
the priests in this matter; but when I consider how precisely God's commands
were given in everything, I question whether such an alternative was left to
their discretion. The notion that God had once been content with a single
bullock, as some think, because they were not abundant in the desert, appears to
me a subterfuge. I confess I do not know how to get out of this difficulty,
unless perhaps we say, that inasmuch as sufficiently exact provision had been
made, in all other particulars, that nothing should be done without reason, in
this respect only they were reminded that God in Himself cares not for greater
or less victims. Nor does any reverence prevent us from saying that, as it
sometimes happens in minor matters, a wrong number may have crept in from the
carelessness of
scribes;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f239</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and this is probably the most natural
solution. The more correct reading, in my opinion, is, that they should offer
two bullocks and one ram; but since it is elsewhere explained why God appointed
this day, he only briefly recites here: "When they bring the <i>fainha </i>with
the first-fruits."</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in the seventh
month.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have already observed that the
festivals are not here (<i>generally</i>)<i> </i>treated of, but only the
sacrifices, by which their solemnization was to be graced. In the beginning of
the seventh month was the memorial, as it was called, of the blowing of
trumpets. Because it was a minor festival, Moses only commands one bullock to be
killed; but the number was increased on other grounds, for we have already seen
that on the first of every month two bullocks were sacrificed. This day,
therefore, had three larger victims, whilst the number of the others was
doubled, so that there were two rams and fourteen lambs. Thus, then, God
consecrated this day doubly to Himself, so that one celebration diminished
nothing of the other; else He might have seemed to have abrogated what He had
once commanded. The memorial of trumpets was not, then, an abolition of the
new-moon, but they kept both ordinances at the same
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall have on the
tenth day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This was the day of
Atonement. For although they never came into God's presence without supplication
for pardon, they then in a special manner confessed their sins, because a fast
was appointed in token of their guilt. For thus it is written in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
23:29,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Whatsoever soul it be
that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his
people."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the sacrifices, one bullock only is required;
the rest is as before, except that an exception is added, which was omitted in
the former cases. For another propitiation is appointed besides the goat, to
accord with the fact of their affliction. For the acknowledgment of guilt would
have been a dreadful torment to their consciences without the hope of
reconciliation. The reason of this sacrifice will be soon
explained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on the fifteenth,
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Amongst their festivals this last
was the chief</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f240</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in which they dwelt in tabernacles for
seven days; for whereas in the Passover they commemorated the night in which
they came forth free from the plagues of Egypt, by dwelling in tabernacles they
embraced the whole forty years in which their fathers in the desert experienced
the constant and consummate bounty of God. That solemn convention, too, availed
for another present purpose, <i>i.e., </i>of thanksgiving to God for the
ingathering of the harvest. Hence it was that they offered sacrifices every day
and in greater number: on the first day, thirteen bullocks, two rams, and
fourteen lambs; on the second, twelve bullocks; on the third, eleven; on the
fourth, ten; on the fifth, nine; on the sixth, eight; finally, on the seventh,
seven; and on the eighth, one. Nor is it carelessly that Moses expends so many
words on the recital; <i>first, </i>that nothing might be done except at God's
command; <i>secondly, </i>lest it should be disagreeable or onerous to be at
such great expense, which they would have gladly avoided. Wherefore, that they
might cheerfully obey God's command, he diligently inculcates what victims God
would have daily offered to Him. But why the distribution was so unequal, I
confess, is not clear to me, and it is better to confess my ignorance than by
too subtle speculations to vanish into mere
smoke.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f241</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This notion, indeed, is neither curious
nor to be rejected, <i>i.e., </i>that, by daily diminishing the number, they
came at last on the seventh day to the number seven, which is the symbol of
perfection; for the eighth was superadded, merely as a conclusion. Finally,
Moses subjoins that in the continual sacrifice, as well as these extraordinary
ones, they should hold fast to what God prescribes, so that nothing should be
altered according to man's fancy. The sacrifices which depend on the
Commandments of the Second Table, I have designedly postponed to their proper
place.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the Lord spake unto Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A copious
description is here given of what we have recently adverted to cursorily, as it
were, <i>i.e., </i>the solemn atonement which was yearly made in the seventh
month; for when Moses was instructing them as to what sacrifices were to be
offered on each of the festivals, he expressly excepted, though only in a single
word, this sacrifice, where he spoke of the day of atonement itself, on which
they afflicted their souls. Now, therefore, a clear and distinct exposition of
it is separately given. For although at other seasons of the year also both
their public and private sins were expiated, and for this purpose availed the
daily sacrifices, still this more solemn rite was meant to arouse the people's
minds, that they might more earnestly apply themselves all the year through to
the diligent seeking for pardon and remission. In order, then, that they might
be more anxious to propitiate God, one atonement was performed at the end of the
year which might ratify all the others. But, that they might more diligently
observe what is commanded, Moses makes mention of the time in which the Law was
given, viz., when Nadab and Abihu were put to death by God, after they had
rashly defiled the altar by their
negligence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The sum of the law is, that the
priest should not frequently enter the inner sanctuary, but only once a year,
<i>i.e., </i>on the feast of the atonement, in the month of September. The cause
of this was, lest a more frequent entrance of it should produce indifference;
for if he had entered it promiscuously at every sacrifice, no small part of the
reverence due to it would have been lost. The ordinary sprinkling of the altar
was sufficient to testify the reconciliation; but this annual ceremony more
greatly influenced the people's minds. Again, by this sacrifice, which they saw
only once at the end of the year, the one and perpetual sacrifice offered by
God's Son was more clearly represented. Therefore the Apostle elegantly alludes
to this ceremony in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is said that by the
annual entrance of the high priest the Holy Ghost signified,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"that the way into the
holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet
standing,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
9:8;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and a little further on he adds, that after Christ
the true Priest had come,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"he entered in once into
the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
9:11, 12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus the year, in the ancient type, was a symbol of
the one offering, so that believers might understand that the sacrifice, whereby
God was to be propitiated, was not to be often repeated. That God may inspire
greater fear, and preserve the priests from carelessness, He proclaims that His
glory should appear in the cloud in that part of the sanctuary where was the
mercy seat; for we know that the sign was given from hence to the Israelites,
when the camp was to be moved, or when they were to remain stationary. But this
testimony of God's presence should have justly moved the priests to greater care
and attention; and hence we may now learn, that the closer God's majesty
manifests itself, the more anxiously should we beware, lest through our
thoughtlessness we should give any mark of contempt, but that we should testify
our submission with becoming humility and
modesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus shall Aaron come into
the holy place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The rites and formality
are now described; first, that Aaron should put on the holy garments, and wash
his person; secondly, that he should offer a bullock and ram for a
burnt-offering; thirdly, that he should take two goats from the people, one of
which should be sent away alive, and the other slain in sacrifice. We have
stated elsewhere why the priests were to be dressed in garments different from
others, since he who is the mediator between God and men should be free from all
impurity and stain; and since no mortal could truly supply this, a type was
substituted in place of the reality, from whence believers might learn that
another Mediator was to be expected; because the dignity of the sons of Aaron
was only typical, and not true and substantial. For whenever the priest stripped
himself of his own garments, and assumed those which were holy and separated
from common use, it was equivalent to declaring openly that he represented
another person. But if this symbol were not sufficient, the ablution again
taught that none of the sons of Aaron was the genuine propitiator; for how could
he purify others, who himself required purification, and made open confession of
his uncleanness? A third symbol also was added; for he who by a sacrifice<i>
</i>of his own atoned for himself and his house, how was he capable of meriting
God's favor for others? Thus then the holy fathers were reminded, that under the
image of a mortal man, another Mediator was promised, who, for the
reconciliation of the human race, should present Himself before God with perfect
and more than angelical purity. Besides, in the person of the priest there was
exhibited to the people a spectacle of the corruption whereby the whole human
race<i> </i>is defiled, so as to be abominable to God; for if the priest, both
chosen by God, and graced with the sacred unction, was still unworthy on the
score of his uncleanness to come near the altar, what dignity could be
discoverable in the people? And hence to us now-a-days also very useful
instruction is derived; viz., that when the question arises how God is to be
propitiated, we are not to look this way and that way; since out of Christ there
is no purity and innocence which can satisfy the justice of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall take the two
goats.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A twofold mode of expiation is
here presented to us; for one of the two goats was offered in sacrifice
according to the provisions of the Law, the other was sent away to be an
outcast, or offscouring
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ka&gt;qarma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
vel
</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">peri&gt;yhma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f242</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)<i> </i>The fulfillment of both figures,
however, was manifested in Christ, since He was both the Lamb of God, whose
offering blotted out the sins of the world, and, that He might be as an
offscouring,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ka&gt;qarma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>)<i>
</i>His comeliness was destroyed, and He was rejected of men. A more subtle
speculation might indeed be advanced, viz., that after the goat was presented,
its sending away was a type of the resurrection of Christ; as if the slaying of
the one goat testified that the satisfaction for sins was to be sought in the
death of Christ; whilst the preservation and dismissal of the other shewed, that
after Christ had been offered for sin, and had borne the curse of men, He still
remained alive. I embrace, however, what is more simple and certain, and am
satisfied with that; <i>i.e., </i>that the goat which departed alive and free,
was an atonement,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that by its departure and flight the
people might be assured that their sins were put away and vanished. This was the
only expiatory sacrifice in the Law without blood; nor does this contradict the
statement of the Apostle, for since two goats were offered together, it was
enough that the death of one should take place, and that its blood should be
shed for expiation; for the lot was not cast until both goats had been brought
to the door of the tabernacle; and thus although the priest presented one of
them alive "to make an atonement with him," as Moses expressly says, yet God was
not propitiated without blood, since the efficacy<i> </i>of the expiation
depended on the sacrifice of the other goat. As to the word
Azazel,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f244</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> although commentators differ, I doubt
not but that it designates the place to which the scape-goat was driven. It is
certainly a compound word, equivalent to "the departure of the goat," which the
Greeks have translated, whether properly or not I cannot say,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpopompai~on</font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>I am afraid that the expiation is decidedly too subtle which some
interpreters give, that the goat was so called as "the repeller of evils," just
as the Gentiles</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f245</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> invented certain gods, called
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajlexika&gt;kouv</font><font face="Palatino">.
What I have said agrees best with the departure of the goat; although I differ
from the Jews, who conceive that this place was contiguous to Mount Sinai; as if
the lot for Azazel were not cast every year, when the people were very far away
from Mount Sinai. Let it suffice, then, that some solitary and most
uninhabitable spot was chosen whither the goat should be driven, lest the curse
of God should rest upon the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall take a censer
full.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Before he takes the blood into the
sanctuary, (the priest) is commanded to offer incense. There was, as we have
seen, an altar of incense, on which the priest burnt it, but without the veil;
but now he is ordered to go within the veil, to
make</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f246</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> an incense-offering in the very holy of
holies. But it is worth noticing, that is said that the cloud of the incense
should cover the mercy-seat &#8212; that the priest die not; for by this sign it
was shewn how formidable is God's majesty, the sight of which is fatal even to
the priest; that all might learn to tremble at it, and to prostrate themselves
as suppliants before Him; and again, that all audacity and temerity might be
repressed. But it is uncertain whether he killed together the bullock for
himself and the goat for the people, or whether, after he had sprinkled the
sanctuary with his own offering, he killed the goat separately. Moses indeed
seems to mark this distinct order in the words he uses; for after having spoken
of the first sprinkling, he immediately adds, "Then shall he kill the goat of
the sin-offering:" but since the narrative of Moses is not always
consecutive,<i> </i>and it is a matter of little importance, let the reader
choose which he pleases.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall make an atonement
for the holy place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The cleansing of the
sanctuary might seem absurd, as if it were in man's power to pollute what God
Himself had consecrated; for we know that God remains true, although all' the
world be unholy, and consequently that whatever God has appointed changes not
its nature through the sins of men. Yet, if no contagion from men's sins had
infected the tabernacle, this cleansing would have been superfluous. But
although the sanctuary in itself may have contracted no defilement from the
guilt of the people, still, in regard to the sin and guilt of the people
themselves, it is justly accounted unclean. And thus sin is made more exceeding
sinful, inasmuch as men, even though their intention be to serve God, profane
His sacred name, if they do so carelessly or irreverently. It was at that time a
detestable sacrilege in all to defile the altar and sanctuary of God; and Moses
convicts the Israelites of this sacrilege when He commands the sanctuary to be
cleansed. Moreover, let us learn that men may so contaminate the sacred things
of God as that their nature should still remain unaltered and their dignity
inviolate. Wherefore Moses expressly states that the sanctuary is cleansed not
from its own uncleanness, but from that of the children of Israel. We must now
apply the substance of this type to our own use. By Baptism and the Lord's
Supper, God appears to us in his only-begotten Son: these are the pledges of our
holiness; yet such is our corruption that we never cease from profaning, as far
as in us lies, these instruments of the Spirit whereby God sanctifies us. Since,
however, we have now no victims to kill, we must mourn and humbly pray that
Christ, by the sprinkling of His blood, may blot out and cleanse these
defilements of ours, by which Baptism and the Lord's Supper are polluted. The
reason of the purification is also to be observed, viz., because the tabernacle
"dwelleth<i> </i>among them in the midst of their
uncleanness;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f247</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by which words Moses signifies that men
are so polluted and full of corruptions that they contaminate all that is holy
without the intervention of a means of purification; for he takes it for granted
that men cannot but bring some impurity with them. What he had said of the inner
sanctuary he extends to the altar and the whole of the
tabernacle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there shall be no
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The driving away of all men from
approaching the tabernacle during the act of atonement is a sort of punishment
by temporary banishment, that they may perceive themselves to be driven from
God's face, whilst the place is purified which had been defiled by their sins.
This was a melancholy sight, when all these for whose sake it was erected were
obliged to desert it; but in this way they were reminded that every part and
particle of our salvation depends on God's mercy only, when they saw themselves
excluded from the remedy designed for obtaining pardon, unless a new pardon
should come to their aid, since they had fallen away from the hope of
reconciliation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he hath made an end of
reconciling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The mode of expiation with
the other goat is now more clearly explained, viz., that it should be placed
before God, and that the priest should lay his hands on its head, and confess
the sins of the people, so that he may throw the curse on the goat itself. This,
as I have said, was the only bloodless
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnai&gt;maton</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>sacrifice; yet it is expressly called an
"offering,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f248</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with reference, however, to the slaying
of the former goat, and was, therefore, as to its efficacy for propitiation, by
no means to be separated from it. It was by no means reasonable that an innocent
animal should be substituted in the place of men, to be exposed to the curse of
God, except that believers might learn that they were in no wise competent to
bear His judgment, nor could be delivered from it otherwise than by the transfer
of their guilt and crime. For, since men feel that they are altogether
overwhelmed by the wrath of God, which impends over them all, they vainly
endeavor to lighten or shake off in various ways this intolerable burden; for no
absolution is to be hoped for save by the interposition of a satisfaction; and
it is not lawful to obtrude this according to man's fancy, or, in their foolish
arrogance, to seek in themselves for the price whereby their sins may be
compensated for. Another means, therefore, of making atonement to God was
revealed when Christ, "being made a curse for us,"<i> </i>transferred to Himself
the sins which alienated men from God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:19;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:13.) The confession tended to humiliate the people, and thus acted as a
stimulus to sincere repentance; since "the sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:17;) nor is it fit that any but the prostrate should be lifted up by God's
mercy, nor that any but those who voluntarily condemn themselves should be
absolved. The accumulation of words tends to this, "all the iniquities, all
their transgressions, all their sins," that believers may not lightly only and
as, a mere act of duty acknowledge themselves guilty before God, but rather that
they should groan under the weight, of their guilt. Since now in Christ no
special day in the year is prescribed in which the Church should confess its
sins in a solemn ceremony, let believers learn, whenever they meet together in
God's name, humbly to submit themselves to voluntary self-condemnation, and to
pray for pardon, as if the Spirit of God dictated a formulary for them; and so
let each in private: conform himself to this
rule.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he that let the goat
go.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since this goat was the outcast
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ka&gt;qapma</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>of God's wrath, and devoted to His curse, he who led it away is commanded to
wash his person and his clothes, as if he were a partaker in its defilement. By
this symbol the faithful were reminded how very<i> </i>detestable is their
iniquity, so that they might, be affected with increasing dread, whenever they
considered what they deserved. For when they saw a man forbidden to enter the
camp because he was polluted by simply touching the goat, they must needs
reflect how much wider was the alienation between God and themselves, when they
bore upon them an uncleanness not contracted elsewhere, but procured by their
own sin. The same may be said of him who burned the skin, the flesh, and the
dung of the bullock and the goat. We have elsewhere seen that these remnants
were carried out of the camp in token of abomination. And on this head Christ's
inestimable love towards us shines more brightly, who did not disdain to go out
of the city that He might be made an outcast (<i>rejectamentum</i>)<i> </i>for
us, and might undergo the curse due to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>

doubt that they are truly purged before God; and yet in a sacramental manner,
viz., that the external ceremony might be a most unmistakable sign of that
atonement, whereby, in the fullness of time, they were to be reconciled to God.
Wherefore Moses states at some length that this was to be the peculiar office of
the priest; and by this eulogy exalts the grace of the coming Mediator, so that

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord called unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these seven chapters Moses
will treat generally of the sacrifices. But since we read of many things here,
the use of which has passed away, and others, the grounds of which I do not
understand, I intend to content myself with a brief summary, from whence,
however, the reader may fully perceive that whatever has been left to us
relative to the legal sacrifices is even now profitable, provided we are not too
curious. Let those who choose to hunt for allegories receive the praise they
covet; my object is only to profit my readers, and it will suffice briefly to
sum up what I think useful to be known. Although in this chapter burnt-offerings
only are treated of, yet the rule which is laid down respecting them has a more
extensive application, since Moses teaches what animals God would have offered
to Him, so as that they may be acceptable, and also by whom and with what
ceremonies they are to be offered. He enumerates three kinds, of the herd, of
the flocks, and of fowls; for the case of the red heifer, from which the ashes
of atonement were made, was different and peculiar; and here the question is as
to the ordinary sacrifices, by which private individuals used either to atone
for their sins or to testify their piety. He commands, therefore, that the
cattle as well as the lambs and kids should be males, and also perfect and free
from all blemish. We see, then, that only clean animals were chosen for the
sacrifices, and again that all clean animals did not please God, but only
domestic ones, such as allow themselves to be directed by the hand and will of
men. For, though deer and roes are sometimes tamed, yet God did not admit them
to His altar. This, then, was the first rule of obedience, that men should not
offer promiscuously this or that victim, but bulls or bull-calves of their
herds, and male lambs or kids of their flocks. Freedom from blemish is required
for two reasons; for, since the sacrifices were types of Christ, it behooved
that in all of them should be represented that complete perfection of His
whereby His heavenly Father was to be propitiated; and, secondly, the Israelites
were reminded that all uncleanness was repudiated by God lest his service should
be polluted by their impurity. But whilst God exhorted them to study true
sincerity, so he abundantly taught them that unless they directed their faith to
Christ, whatsoever came from them would be rejected; for neither would the
purity of a brute animal have satisfied Him if it had not represented something
better. In the second place, it is prescribed that whosoever presented a
burnt-offering should lay his hand on its head, after he had come<i> </i>near
the door of the tabernacle. This ceremony was not only a sign of consecration,
but also of its being an
atonement,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f249</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since it was substituted for the man, as
is expressed in the words of Moses, "And it shall be accepted for him to make
atonement for him." (Ver. 4.) There is not, then, the least doubt but that they
transferred their guilt and whatever penalties they had deserved to the victims,
in order that they might be reconciled to God. Now, since this promise could not
have been at all delusive, it must be concluded that in the ancient sacrifices
there was a price of satisfaction which should release them from guilt and blame
in the judgment of God; yet still not as though these brute animals availed in
themselves unto expiation, except<i> </i>in so far as they were testimonies of
the grace to be manifested by Christ. Thus the ancients were reconciled to God
in a sacramental manner by the victims, just as we are now cleansed through
baptism. Hence it follows that these symbols were useful only as they were
exercises unto faith and repentance, so that the sinner might learn to fear
God's wrath, and to seek pardon in
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall kill the
bullock.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The ceremony of killing is
subjoined, viz., that the priest should prepare the victim itself, and pour its
blood upon the altar, for it was not allowable for a private person to kill the
victim with his own hands, but what the priest did in their name was transferred
to them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f250</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But this is worth remarking, that
although they brought the pledge of reconciliation from their home, yet that the
ministers of expiation were to be sought elsewhere, since no one was competent
for so illustrious an office, save he who was graced by the holy unction of God.
It was, therefore, plainly manifested that all mortals are unworthy of coming
near God to propitiate Him, and that the hands of all are in a manner polluted
or profane except those which God himself has purged. For the honor of
sacrificing came from nowhere else but from the grace of the Spirit, of which
the external anointing was a pledge. We now understand how it was that
individuals offered sacrifices to God, and yet that the priest alone performed
this office. The altar was sprinkled with the blood, that the people might know
that the blood poured from the victim did not fall on the ground, but was
consecrated to God, and breathed, as it were, a sweet savor; just as now the
blood of Christ appears before His face. I pass by the rest, since it does not
seem worth while to enlarge on the third kind of offering, <i>i.e., </i>of the
birds. Yet we must recollect that thus far Moses only speaks of the
burnt-offerings, whose flesh was burned; for this was not the case with all, as
we shall see hereafter. Although, then, it is twice said that "the<i>
</i>priests shall lay the parts, the head and the fat," etc., we must not
understand it as if he only commanded the fat and the head to be burned, but
that nothing was to be left the skin. Some think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rdp</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>pheder,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f251</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a dissevered head, nor do I
reject their opinion, provided we do not exclude the fat. Whatever was filthy in
the victim, God would have to be washed, that it might not contaminate it. The
question now arises why it was burned either wholly or partially. My own opinion
is, that by the fire the efficacy of the Spirit is represented, on which all the
profit of the sacrifices depends; for unless Christ had suffered in the Spirit,
He would not have been<i> </i>a propitiatory sacrifice. Fire, then, was as the
condiment which gave their true savor to the sacrifices, because the blood of
Christ was to be consecrated<i> </i>by the Spirit, that it might cleanse us from
all the stains of our sins. This God would have more fully represented in the
burnt-offerings, yet no victim was offered of which some part was not consumed
by fire.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when any will offer.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In this chapter Moses prescribes the rules for
those offerings to which the name of <i>minha </i>is peculiarly given. They were
not bloody sacrifices, nor offerings of animals, but only of cakes and oil. If
any one would offer plain flour, he is commanded to season it with frankincense
and oil, and also to choose fine flour, that the oblation may not be defiled by
the bran. Thus here, as in all the service of God, the rule is laid down that
nothing but what is pure should be offered; besides, by the oil its savor is
improved, and by the frankincense a fragrant odor is imparted to it. We know
that God is not attracted either by sweetness of taste nor by pleasant scents;
but it was useful to teach a rude people by these symbols, lest they should
corrupt God's service by their own foolish inventions. Moses afterwards
commands, that whatever is consecrated to God should be delivered into the hand
of the priest, as we have before seen that private persons were excluded from
this honor so that Christ's peculiar dignity should remain to Him, <i>i.e.,
</i>that by Him alone access should be sought to God, and that all men might
know that no worship pleases God except what He sanctifies. The substance of
this type is shewn by the words of the Apostle, when he says that "by him" we
now "offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our
lips giving thanks to His name."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:15.) But when the priest had burnt a handful of the flour with the oil and
frankincense, what remained was left for his own use; for, as we have elsewhere
seen, the holy of holies of the burnt-offerings were given to the priests. Other
kinds are then spoken of, viz., cakes, baken in the oven; then such as were
fried in a pan; and thirdly, on a gridiron: for God would have the <i>minha
</i>offered Him of every kind of cake, so that the Israelites might learn to
look to Him in all their food, since nothing is clean to us except what He
consecrates by His blessing. This is the reason why Moses accurately
distinguishes between the cakes which were cooked either in the oven, or the
frying-pan, or on the gridiron.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No meat-offering, which ye
shall bring.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God here forbids leavened
cakes to be offered to Him, by which rite the ancients were taught that God's
service is corrupted if any strange invention be mingled with it. Nor can it be
doubted but that. Christ alluded to this when He warned His disciples to
"beware<i> </i>of the leaven of the Pharisees,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:11;) understanding by that word the fictions whereby they had corrupted
religion. The eating of leaven was forbidden in the Passover for another reason,
viz., that they might remember their sudden departure, or rather flight, in
which there had been no time to prepare provisions for their journey. Although
Paul extends it even further, viz., that believers should abstain from all
"leaven<i> </i>of malice and wickedness."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:8.) It is clear, however, that in this general rule all
adventitious corruptions are condemned, whereby pure religion is polluted, as if
it were said that no offerings would be approved by God except such as were
genuine and free from all strange savor. With reference to the honey, the ground
of its use is more obscure, for I know not whether there is much dependence to
be placed on the subtle disquisitions of some respecting its
nature.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f252</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But although I scarcely dare to make any
assertion as to this, still I pass by conceits, and advance what seems to me
more probable. Cooked honey immediately becomes sour, and causes the bread with
which it is mixed to ferment; these two things, therefore, seem to be combined,
that neither honey nor leaven should be offered in the fire. As to what Moses
adds just afterwards, "Ye shall offer them among the first-fruits," I know not
whether it applies to the leaven, as some think; assuredly the exception seems
to be more simple, that the first-fruits of honey would indeed be acceptable to
God, provided it did not corrupt the offerings of the altar. But no doubt the
ancients understood the meaning of this precept, else it would have been
useless, and thus knew that nothing was legitimate in the sacrifices except what
God appointed. But let us, since the use of the ceremony is abolished, learn not
to intrude our own imaginations or inventions in God's service, but to follow
obediently the rule which he
prescribes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every oblation of thy
meat-offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reason for salting
the victims was very similar, viz., that God's service might not be without
savor; but the true seasoning which gives grace to sacrifices is found nowhere
except in God's word. Hence it follows that all modes of worship fabricated by
men are rejected as unsavory. For although they who profane God's worship by
superstitions think themselves very acute, yet all that most approves itself to
them under the cloak of wisdom is mere fatuity. Nevertheless, Christ deduces an
exhortation from this ceremony, viz., that believers, if they desire to please
God, should patiently endure to be refined and purified. "Every one," He
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"shall be salted with
fire,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and every sacrifice shall be
salted with salt."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;410949&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Mark
9:49.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In which words He signifies that, when we are
searched and tried by fire, we shall be acceptable sacrifices to God, and that
this is the seasoning of salt when our flesh with its affections shall have been
well macerated. Meanwhile, let us firmly hold to this, that our service of God
is not what it should be without, the savor which is to be sought in the word;
since in all the brains of men not one particle of salt is to be found. I pass
by other more subtle allegories, in which I see no other use than to gratify
curious ears. "The<i> </i>salt of the covenant" is used in a different sense
from "the<i> </i>covenant of salt," viz., as the salt which is employed in the
sacrifice according to the inviolable compact of God. Hence, too, is confirmed
what I have said before, that the keeping of God's covenant always occupies the
first place in this service.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if thou offer a
meat-offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This offering is
different from that of the first-fruits, since it was voluntary, whereas the
first-fruits were paid in obedience to the enactment of the Law. But if any one
chose to add anything to the first-fruits of his new corn, Moses lays down the
rule, that the ears should be dried in the fire, so that they might be more
easily pounded, and so might be burnt mixed with oil and frankincense; for so I
interpret his words, that he means the same thing by "ears of corn dried by the
fire," and "corn beaten out of full ears." He requires full ears, that the
people may select them, and not offer anything poor or stunted.</font><br></div>

different class, viz., to the sacrifices, which were testimonies of gratitude in
celebration of God's blessings; part of which was burnt with fire, part was
claimed by the priests, and the rest remained to the offerers themselves. As to
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yml&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shelomim, </i>I have briefly given my opinion
elsewhere;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f253</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the common translation of it is
certainly unsuitable, "the sacrifices of peace-offerings:" and the statement of
others is far-fetched, that they are called "sacrifices of perfections," because
it was unlawful for the unclean to touch them. Since, however, the Hebrews
include in the word "peace,"<i> </i>safety, and all good success, I have thought
that its plural number might aptly be translated "prosperities:" on which
account, David calls the libation which used to be made in this sacrifice, "the
cup of salvations:"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:13,) nor do I doubt but that by this outward sign he designates
thanksgiving. I admit indeed that this sacrifice was not only offered in
acknowledgment of gratitude, but also when they sought of God peace and good
success; yet still the epithet will always admirably suit it, because they
confessed by it that God was the author of all good things, so as to attribute
all their prosperity to Him. First, however, he commands all the sacrifices to
be brought to the tabernacle, which is what he means by "the<i> </i>face of
God;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f254</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> else would altars have been everywhere
erected in their cities and villages, and by this license God's service would
have been mangled, and religion undermined. Wherefore, in order to keep the
people in the unity of the faith, he bids them all be content with a single
altar. But He would be worshipped and honored in that place, which He had
dedicated to Himself, lest they should be scattered abroad after strange gods;
and then He prescribes the mode of offering, whether the victim were of the herd
or the flock. That such exact injunctions should be given as to trifles, might
seem to be an unnecessary particularity, and even a superfluous repetition,
inasmuch as the same thing is often inculcated, in precisely similar words: if
it were not that this earnestness reminded the people that something higher was
enwrapped in the ceremonies, whilst it restrained them from allowing themselves
wantonly to add or change the smallest point. This very scrupulous observance,
then, ought to have led them by the hand, as it were, to the things signified;
so that under the external image the spiritual truth might meet their eyes;
secondly, it ought to have held them bound, as it were, to the word of God, lest
they should do anything in sacred matters from the dictates of their own reason.
But now, since the use of sacrifices has ceased, we are <i>first </i>taught that
God's blessings are profaned, unless we diligently exercise ourselves in
manifesting our religion, as His infinite and constant liberality towards us
deserves; <i>secondly, </i>that unless our devotion is unmixed and paid to Him
alone, we impiously defraud Him of His right; <i>thirdly, </i>that as we pray in
Christ's name, so our vows are to be paid, and our thanksgivings to be rendered,
through His hand; <i>and fourthly, </i>that God's loving-kindness is not to be
celebrated in a negligent or perfunctory manner, but that we must labor to do
so, as in a matter of the utmost importance, with no common zeal and
attention.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the priest shall burn
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He justly assigns to the priest
the main duties of sacrificing, <i>i.e., </i>to sprinkle the blood, and to cast
the fat into the fire, since he alone was competent to make atonement. Moreover,
although there is a harsh metaphor contained in the word "food," yet it
admirably expresses what the Holy Spirit would teach, that the legal service
pleased God, just as the food which we eat is pleasing to us; whilst it at the
same time marks God's familiar communion with His people, as if He sat at the
same table with them. It is indeed sure that God, who breathes life into all,
and borrows nothing from any, does not want food; but His incomparable kindness
could not be better shewn forth, than by deigning to make Himself, as it were,
the messmate of His worshippers. In the same figure of speech the ingratitude of
the people is reproved by Malachi, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The<i> </i>table of the
Lord is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Malachi
1:12;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">not because God delighted in the fat of fed beasts,
or in bread; but because it was a gross and intolerable act of impiety to
neglect this extraordinary pledge of His grace. This similitude, however, ought
to be referred to the truth it represents, viz., that the exercise of faith, and
the proofs of our piety, are no less pleasing to God than as if He should be
feasted delicately and sumptuously; wherefore we ought to take<i> </i>the
greater care not to defraud Him of the things He takes delight in. It is not
very clear to me why God claims for Himself the fat in all the sacrifices, and
commands it to be burnt, unless that in this way He might accustom His servants
to temperance. We have already seen that the fat is certainly accounted the most
delicate part, where Moses applies this word to corn and wine; and this also is
plain from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
63:5, "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness." And when God
declares
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:11,) that He does not desire "the fat," He signifies that He does not require
for His own sake the choicest part of animals, but that the Israelites might
remember that they should partake soberly of all their food, as if they had
consecrated the best and first-fruits of it. If any one desire a more distinct
exposition of this, the offering of the fat taught them to pay more honor to the
service of God; and secondly, it instructed them in abstinence. The allegories,
suited only to tickle men's ears, must be sought from
others.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f255</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Isychius, after having pretended that
the fat represented spiritual affections, soon afterwards metamorphoses it into
gross appetites. Others suppose that Christ was designed by it. Others
understand by it that the grossness or fatness of our flesh must be refined by
the fire of the Spirit, that it may be mortified unto God. This simple meaning
satisfies me, that, when the Law permitted them to eat the sacred meats, an
exception was added, which left the best portion in God's hands; secondly, that
the part which might have been most attractive to the greedy, was consumed in
the fire as a restraint upon their gluttony. The eating of blood is here
prohibited, as also elsewhere, because it was consecrated to God in order to
make expiation; but there was another and higher reason why it was forbidden, of
which mention was made in Genesis 9, and which must be again handled in our
exposition of the Sixth Commandment.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">After Moses had treated of the offerings and other
sacrifices, which were testimonies of gratitude and exercises of piety, he now
descends to the sin-offering (<i>expiationem</i>)<i> </i>which held the chief
place amongst the sacrifices, inasmuch as, without reconciliation, there could
never be any intercourse between men and God; for since He deservedly abominates
the whole human race on account of the corruption of our nature, and because we
all continually provoke His wrath, the whole hope of salvation must needs be
founded on the remedies provided for propitiating Him. This principle, being
established, we must remember that Moses will henceforth speak of the expiatory
sacrifices which propitiate God to men by the removal of their guilt. He here
shews how God is to be appeased, where a man shall have sinned through ignorance
or inconsiderateness; wherein too a distinction is laid down between different
persons, since one kind of victim is required of a king, another of the priests,
and another of ordinary persons; whilst regard is had to the poor, that they may
not be burdened by so great an expense as the rich. But, since it will appear
from the context that all kinds of ignorance are not here included, we must see
what the word

rendering error rather than ignorance; for Moses does not refer to those
transgressions into which we are ensnared, when we are led astray by the
appearance of rectitude, so as to think ourselves without blame; but to those of
which we take no heed, and whereby our minds are not pricked; or to those sudden
falls, wherein the infirmity of the flesh so stifles the reason and the judgment
as to blind the sinner. It is of such that Paul speaks when he bids
us</font><br></div>

some refer it to sins of omission, but I interpret it more simply, "If<i> </i>he

whole supreme class.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f260</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is probable, however, that it only
refers to one. The more illustrious was his dignity, the more diligently and
zealously ought his life to be confirmed to the model of holiness; and therefore
the infirmity which was more tolerable in others, was more exceedingly
reprehensible in him. This is the reason why it was required that he should
atone for himself with a greater victim. But this in some measure related to all
the Levites, inasmuch as they were chosen to be of the sacred class; and it now
extends to all the ministers and pastors of the Church, not that they should
ransom themselves by the sacrifice of a calf, but that they should diligently
beware of every sin, and be more intent in their endeavors after holiness. The
clause "according to the sin of the people," might be also rendered <i>"unto
</i>the sin," etc., as though Moses had said that the priest through sin
corrupted the people by his bad example; for, since his life is the rule of
holiness and righteousness, so his faults give occasion to the errors of others.
The sense, however, that I have followed is simpler, <i>i.e., </i>that though
the transgression of the priest may be an ordinary one, yet in consideration of
his office it becomes more weighty, and deserving of greater
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the priest that is
anointed shall take.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is well known
that what is here prescribed as to the sprinkling of blood, and its pouring out,
as well as to the burning of the fat and the kidneys, is the same as in the
other sacrifices; and the comparison in the 10th verse sufficiently proves that,
the ordinary forms were observed in other particulars. But inasmuch as it might
seem absurd that the priest, who was himself guilty, should come before God to
perform the office of reconciliation, it was necessary to prescribe the details
more accurately, to obviate all doubt. Although, therefore, he was unworthy to
approach God, yet, since the law of the priesthood was inviolable, he was
admitted to the discharge of his duties; for it was not lawful that more
mediators should be appointed. In order, then, that more reverence should be
paid to the rites of the Law, and that men should seek after no other way of
reconciliation, God extended His grace to the fault of the priest. The blood was
sprinkled before the Lord, that the people might learn that through the sight of
the sacrifice sins were hidden and buried, so as to come no more into
remembrance before God; but the rest of the blood was poured before the altar,
because it was holy, and therefore ought by no means to be cast elsewhere like
anything profane.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if the whole
congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The very same sacrifice
which was enjoined on the priest is required of the people; since he who went
into the sanctuary in the name of all to present all the tribes before God,
represented the whole body. It seems indeed that the kind of ignorance here
spoken of is different from the former kind; since it was said "if<i> </i>the
thing be hid;" yet I think that these infirmities are comprised, in which it
often happens that men are blinded for a
time.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f261</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For many do not search into themselves,
and therefore slumber in their sins; whereas if they honestly examined their
doings, their conscience would straightway smite them. It might, then, happen
that the whole people should fail to be aware of their sin, whilst dealing with
themselves too gently and indulgently. The meaning therefore is, that although
no sense of sin should at first arouse them to repentance, yet, if afterwards
they should be awakened so as to begin to acknowledge their crime, God must be
propitiated by sacrifices; for otherwise the people might make a cloak for
themselves of their error.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When a ruler hath
sinned.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A peculiar atonement is also
appointed for the transgression of the rulers; and, although he speaks of the
ruler in the singular number, yet inasmuch as the law was not yet enacted that
one individual should bear rule, he undoubtedly designates the heads and
governors generally, because they who bear rule do more injury by their bad
example than private persons. If, then, any of the judges or governors had
sinned through error, he might indeed be set free by a lesser victim than the
priest or the whole people, yet there was individually this difference between
them, that they were to offer she-goats or lambs, and the ruler a he-goat; and
the object of this was that those in authority should more carefully keep
themselves pure from every<i> </i>transgression, whereas otherwise they are wont
to indulge themselves more freely, as if their rank and dignity allowed them
greater license. Where we have given as our translation, "If (the sin) shall

primary and genuine meaning of the word do violence to the signification of the

instead of "shall have felt that he has offended;" but since it appears from
many passages that

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

<i>hodang, </i>which they render transitively "to<i> </i>make known," may fitly
bear my translation, unless this is preferred, "if<i> </i>he shall have known,"
(<i>si</i> <i>cognoverit</i>)<i>. </i>The words which Moses continually repeats,
"the priest shall make an atonement for him, and his; iniquity shall be forgiven
him," some coldly restrict to external and civil cleansing, as if Moses only
removed his condemnation before men; but God rather offers pardon to sinners,
and assures them that He will be favorable to them, lest fear or doubt should
prevent them from freely calling upon Him. And assuredly those who do not
acknowledge that the legal rites were sacraments, are not acquainted with the
very<i> </i>rudiments of the faith. Now to all sacraments, at any rate to the
common sacraments of the Church, a spiritual promise is annexed: it follows,
therefore, that pardon was truly promised to the fathers, who reconciled
themselves to God by the offering of sacrifices, not because the slaying of
beasts expiated sins, but because it was a certain and infallible symbol, in
which pious minds might acquiesce, so as to dare to come before God with
tranquil confidence. In sum, as now in baptism sins are sacramentally washed
away, so under the Law also the sacrifices were means of expiation, though in a
different way; since baptism sets Christ before us as if He were present, whilst
under the Law He was only obscurely typified. Figuratively indeed what applies
to Christ only is transferred to the signs, for in Him alone was manifested to
us the fulfillment of all spiritual blessings, and He at length blotted out sins
by His one and perpetual sacrifice; but since the question here is not as to the
value of the legal ceremonies in themselves, let it suffice that they truly
testified of the grace of God, of which they were the types; and so let not that
profane imagination be listened to, that the sacrifices only politically and as
far as regarded men absolved those by whom they were offered from guilt and
condemnation.</font><br></div>

sacrifice the sins of the whole people or of each individual are to be expiated,
although he enumerates only two of the four classes which are mentioned in
Leviticus; for a special atonement is there enjoined both on the priest and the
ruler. But neither is the ceremony of sacrificing here described, since Moses
only wished to refresh their memories by the way as to the manner in which,
either publicly or privately, they were to be reconciled to God. This word
"error,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f264</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as we have said, extends to incogitancy,
which partakes of contempt of God, and arises from too great security, when men
inconsiderately fall into the sins to which their lusts invite them; for
deliberate impiety is afterwards brought into contrast with error, when men
designedly rush into violations of the law. But since nothing is more easy than
for men to err, this remedy was most necessary, lest they who had sinned should
fall into despair. Lest, then, the people or private individuals, when they saw
their guilt, should despair of pardon and throw away the pursuit of holiness,
God anticipates them, and shews them by what means He is to be propitiated, so
that the sins which had occurred should not interrupt His service. Since,
however, Moses here only repeats what has already been explained, there is no
need of dwelling largely upon it, except that in one point he seems to deliver a
law different from the former one; for he there commands two bullocks to be
slain for the reconciliation of the
people,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f265</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the one as a burnt-offering, the other
as a sin-offering; yet, if the second were not easily obtained, the permission
was given to substitute a goat. In Leviticus, therefore, the regular and perfect
rite was delivered; the permissive alteration is only added here; nor does Moses
contradict himself, though, for the sake of brevity, he only refers to one of
the two modes. At the end a clearer explanation is subjoined, viz., that the
same law should be common to all, since it was by no means expedient to
introduce any diversity.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if a soul

which Moses refers in the beginning of the chapter, seem to differ much from
each other; for the first, when a person concealed a matter which he knew, could
not arise from error, yet I include this concealment of which he treats under
the head of error, by supposing it to have been when a person should be induced
by shame or fear to connive at any crime or offense respecting which he might be
interrogated, and so, without any design of perjuring himself, but by blinding
himself, should withhold what he would have said, if he had duly examined the
matter. Yet these words must be more narrowly discussed, respecting the meaning
of which men are not well agreed. Some think that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>alah, </i>is put for "execration,"<i>
</i>as though it were said, if any shall have heard a misdoing or detestable
crime worthy of execration; yet their gloss is contradicted by what immediately
follows, "Whether he hath seen or known it." Others indeed interpret it to mean
an oath, yet improperly confine it to perjury, as if Moses stated that he was
guilty who had heard a man perjuring himself, and had not opposed him, but had
rather covered the perjury by his own connivance or silence. I rather subscribe,
then, to their opinion who expound it as meaning "adjuration;"<i> </i>for the
words will thus combine very well, "If any one, being summoned as a witness,
shall have heard the voice of adjuration, whereby he shall be required in God's
name to answer truly as to the matter proposed, and from favor, or good nature,
or any other false pretext, as if he were enveloped in a cloud of error, shall
conceal what, if he had paid diligent attention, he well knew, he shall be
guilty." We must then here render the disjunctive particle as the conditional.
Literally it is, "If any shall have heard the voice of adjuration, and (is)
himself a witness." But wherefore should he say, "if he hath been a witness,"
and then add, "or have known it," as if he referred to different things? What I
have said squares very well, that a person becomes himself guilty, who, when
summoned as a witness, does not answer to a matter of which he is cognizant.
Now, what does hearing the voice of adjuration mean, unless you understand that
he is adjured by the mouth of a judge? We must observe, too, that the three
kinds of sin which are first enumerated have a connection<i> </i>with each<i>
</i>other, since they speak of sinners who are infected by the uncleanness of
others; for, after Moses had commanded generally that offenses committed in
error should be expiated, he now adds what had not been stated explicitly
enough, that those also required atonement who had been polluted by the
defilements of others. Thus this first will accord very well with the other two,
<i>i.e., </i>that if any should make himself an accomplice in the offense of
another, by indirect perjury, he should be unclean until he had offered a
propitiation; for this is what the expression "bear his iniquity" conveys; as if
Moses had said that he contracts guilt who shall have concealed a crime,
respecting which he had been interrogated as a
witness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>

how uncleanness contracted by touching a dead body, or any other unclean thing,
was to be purged, and had prescribed<i> </i>an easy and inexpensive mode of
purification. This repetition appears, therefore, to be useless. But to impose a
heavier punishment on an offense which is extenuated by the pretext of error,
than where there is no allusion to error, is unjust. But we must remember that
not only is the uncleanness itself here punished, but; the inadvertence, from
whence it arose that he who was polluted omitted the purification. For it may be
that those who thus lie torpid in their sins pollute for a season the service of
God. No wonder, then, that a heavier punishment is inflicted, where error,
springing from supine and gross security, begets still more sins, that thus
believers may be aroused to greater vigilance. Let the reader, therefore,
recollect that the offense which is now adverted to did not consist in the mere
touching of a dead body, but in the thoughtlessness itself; for if all would
diligently meditate on the Law of God, forgetfulness would not so easily steal
over them, whereby the distinction between right and wrong is lost. The same is
the reason for the following ordinance, where Moses subjects to the same
punishment any one who shall have touched an unclean or defiled man: thus the
very contact of a woman at a particular period produces
pollution.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>

f267</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but in this very carelessness there is
enough of wrong, because sound religion would renew the recollection of the vow.
Consequently, where no anxiety (to fulfill it) is shewn, there is no serious
desire to do so. But this commandment was necessary, because it might often
happen that men who had pledged their faith in a vow, and had broken it in
thoughtlessness, would deem themselves released from every, and would in future
give themselves up to indulgence, whereas they who arrive at such a pitch of
licentiousness, harden themselves more and more, until at length they throw off
all reverence for God. God would therefore have vows kept faithfully, lest those
who<b> </b>despised them should thus rush into impiety. If then any one had
thoughtlessly broken faith, he is commanded to make atonement to God; not on
account of his levity, as some think, as if he had rashly promised what he might
not, but on account of his neglect, because he had not given diligence to
remember the vow at the proper time. Now if the Papists stupidly wrest this text
after their custom, in order to establish the obligation of all kinds of vows,
their confutation is easy; viz., that God requires this stedfastness only with
respect to lawful vows duly made. We have already understood from the teaching
of Moses, what is the rule of pious vow-making; whence we gather, that those
which profane God's name are by no means to be kept; for if we set out with
doing wrong, obstinacy in it is doubly wicked. In this passage, therefore,
"to<i> </i>do evil" is not to perform any improper action, but to undertake
something which would otherwise be disagreeable and burdensome to the flesh;
such as to diminish domestic expenditure, or to deprive one's self of luxuries,
or to determine upon abstinence from something which would gratify or profit
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>

we have already been considering, as to the removal of guilt by sacrifice; but
he begins to make a distinction between the poor and the rich, which distinction
applies also to what has gone before; hence it appears that the order is not
exactly observed by Moses, since the cases which he inserts seem to interrupt
the thread of his discourse; yet the fact remains clear, that whosoever have
fallen through error are unclean until they have offered an atonement. But what
had been before omitted is here inserted, that the poor and needy are not to be
pressed beyond the extent of their means; nay, the different grades of offering
are appointed, so that he to whom it was not convenient to offer two
turtle-doves, or pigeons, might be quit for a small measure of flour. Hence we
infer that God's only design was to shew the one true means of reconciliation to
the people, that they might have recourse to the Mediator and His sacrifice; for
the poor are here commanded to offer either two turtle-doves, or a small
quantity of meal, which would propitiate God towards them, just as much as would
the victim required of the rich. The

propitiations, as if purity and innocency alone recommended men to God. We must

that the ancient people were exercised in these ceremonies, to teach them that
God can only be appeased by the payment of a ransom.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The difference of the victim
clearly shews, that another kind of offense is here referred to; for God now
requires a male instead of a female. Before, He had been contented with an ewe
lamb or a female kid; but inasmuch as a ram is more valuable, it follows that
punishment is now awarded to a heavier offense. The heinousness of the fault
depends upon the quality of the act; <i>i.e., </i>when a person shall have
wronged not a mortal man merely, but God Himself, nor shall have transgressed
only one of the Commandments of the first Table, but shall not have paid a vow,
or shall have offered a defective victim, or shall have defrauded God of His
right in any oblation; since this is what is meant by the clause "in<i> </i>the
holy things of the Lord." In this expression Moses includes both vows
voluntarily made, as well as the legitimate oblations, such as tithes,
first-fruits, the offering of the first-born; since in all these things the
Israelites were strictly charged to deal most faithfully with God. If by chance
avarice had blinded any one, so that in pursuit of personal gain he paid God
less than he ought, his recklessness justly received a heavier punishment. Yet
it must be understood, that the offense here referred to is one in which no
fraud or evil deceit had place; for if any one had designedly and craftily
appropriated what was sacred, the impiety of this sacrilege was not so easily
expiated. But inasmuch as it often happens that the covetous and grasping are
too ready to spare themselves, God enjoins a sacrifice in such a case, where
private advantage has through thoughtlessness prevailed over religious feeling.
The words, "with thy estimation," some refer to Moses, others to the priest; but
I prefer taking it passively for the estimation prescribed by God; which is
called the estimation of the people, because they were bound to acquiesce in the
Law appointed by Him, and not arbitrarily to alter the value. Moses estimates
the ram at two shekels of the sanctuary, equivalent to four common
shekels,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

as I have recently stated, that they, who withheld anything of God's full right,
are said to have sinned "in the holy thing;" since they are commanded to make
restitution with the addition of a fifth part. Yet let my readers remember, that
those who are compelled to make restitution, are not such as have fraudulently
embezzled the sacred things, but those who under some vain pretext have
flattered themselves for a time, so as to be unaffected by any conviction of
their fault. The object therefore of this sacrifice, was to arouse the people to
attention, so that postponing their private advantage, they should freely pay
what was due to God. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f270</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Theirs is but foolish trifling who think
that Moses, having before spoken of sins (<i>peccata</i>),<i> </i>now prescribes
the mode of making expiation for delinquencies (<i>delicta</i>),<i> </i>since he
uses the same words indifferently on all occasions, and also designates all the
victims by the same name. But to make out a delinquency to be greater than a sin
is a piece of gross ignorance; nor does it need a long refutation, since it
manifestly appears that in this passage a special rule is delivered as to the
means of obtaining pardon when a person through thoughtlessness has not
reflected that he has omitted to discharge in full either his vows or
oblations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>

is there any absurdity in the repetition, to cut off all occasion for subterfuge
from the disobedient. Still I do not deny that the reason which is added at the
end, applies to all the modes of expiation of which he has been treating; viz.,
that although he may pretend ignorance who has fallen into sin inconsiderately,
or who has not intentionally sinned, or who through forgetfulness has contracted
any defilement, still he is guilty before God until he makes reconciliation.
When therefore he <i>again commands </i>that a ram without blemish, and of full
value should be offered, he once more shews how they must purge themselves who
have been too stingy in their oblations. Immediately after he adds a reason
common to all the other errors; as if he had said, that they are not absolved
before God who offer the excuse of ignorance as a cover for their

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now no longer treats of the
means of expiating errors when the sinner is guilty through thoughtlessness; but
he prescribes the mode of reconciliation,<i> </i>when any one shall have
wilfully and designedly offended God. And this is well worthy of notice, lest
those who may have been guilty of voluntary sin should doubt whether God will be
propitiated towards them, provided they make application to the one sacrifice of
Christ, in which consists the entire substance of the shadows of the Law. We
must indeed beware lest we indulge ourselves under the cover of God's clemency
and readiness to pardon, &#8212; for the lust of the flesh provokes us to sin
more than enough, without the addition of this snare, &#8212; nor is it less
than a blasphemous insult to God to take occasion and license for sin, from the
fact of His willingness to pardon. Let then the fear of God reign in us, which
will repress our wicked desires like a rein, so that we should not wilfully fall
into sin; and let His mercy rather engender the hatred and detestation of sin in
our hearts, than incite us to audacity. Yet, at the same time, we must prudently
take heed, lest if we imagine God to be inexorable to our voluntary sins, this
excessive severity should overthrow the hope of salvation even in those who are
the holiest. For even now-a-days there are some madmen who deny pardon to all
who may have chanted to fall through the infirmity of the flesh, since to morose
men this severity has its charms, and by this hallucination
Novatus</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f271</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> greatly troubled the Church of old. But
if we all honestly examine ourselves, it will plainly appear that those rigid
censors, who affect the reputation of sanctity by immoderate asperity, are the
grossest hypocrites. For if they would abandon their pride, and examine into
their lives, which of them would find himself free from concupiscence? and whose
conscience must not often smite him?</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is then
monstrous blindness to exalt men, clothed in human flesh, to such a pitch of
perfection, as that their conscience should not convict them of any fault or
blame. And nothing is more pestilent than this imposture of the devil, excluding
from the hope of pardon those who knowingly and willingly have sinned; since
there is not one even of God's best servants, in whom the corrupt affections of
the flesh do not sometimes prevail; for although they be neither adulterers, nor
thieves, nor murderers, yet there is none whom the last Commandment of the Law
&#8212; "Thou shalt not covet," &#8212; does not convict of sin. And assuredly
the more advance one has made in endeavors after purity, the more he feels and
acknowledges that he is still very far from reaching its goal. Therefore, unless
we would purposely close the gate of salvation against us, we must hold that God
is placable towards all, who trust that their sin is forgiven them by the
sacrifice of Christ; for God is neither changed, nor is our condition worse than
that of the fathers, whereas under the Law God appointed sacrifices for the
expiation even of voluntary offenses. Hence it follows, that although we are
convicted of voluntary sin, yet a remedy is set before us in the Gospel for
procuring pardon: else would these ancient figures be more than delusive, which
had no other object than to be testimonies and mirrors of the grace which was
finally manifested to us in Christ. If there ought to be a mutual agreement
between the external representation of grace under the Law, and the spiritual
effect which Christ brought in, it plainly appears that sins are no less
forgiven to us now, than to the ancient people; and thus that believers are
reminded by this symbol, that they are not to despair of reconciliation, whilst
they take no pleasure in their sins; but rather that they should boldly seek for
pardon in the perpetual sacrifice which constantly renders God favorable to all
the godly. And surely since repentance and faith are the sure pledges of God's
favor, it cannot be but that they should be received into His grace who are
endued with these two gifts. Besides, the remission of sins is an inestimable
treasure, which God has deposited in His Church, to be the peculiar blessing of
His children; as the Confession of Faith declares, "I believe in the Holy
Catholic Church, the forgiveness of sins." Nor would what Paul proclaims
concerning the embassy entrusted to him be consistent, unless Christ's
satisfaction daily propitiated God towards believers.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:20.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question here is not
about some trifling offense, but about the crime of unfaithfulness, doubled by
the addition of perjury. It is true that perfidy, or deceit, or violence, are
first mentioned, to mark the grossness of the sin; but the guilt lies chiefly in
the profanation of God's name when the injury done to man is sheltered under a
false oath. At any rate, he is admitted to pardon who has both iniquitously
deceived his brother and has impiously abused God's name. Hence it appears that
God spares wretched sinners although they may have contaminated themselves by
faithlessness, and have aggravated the crime committed against men by sacrilege,
having insulted God through their perjury. But although Moses only enumerates
transgressions of the Eighth Commandment, still he teaches, according to his
usual manner, by <i>synecdoche </i>what must be done in the case of other
offenses also. If, then, anything shall have been taken away by violence,<i>
</i>or by fraud, and perjury has been superadded, he commands not only that
satisfaction should be made to the neighbor who is defrauded, but that the price
of atonement should also be offered to God. And the reason for this is expressly
given, because not only has a mortal man been injured, but God has also been
offended, who would have men conduct themselves justly and reverently towards
each other; and then the crime is carried to extremity by the violation of God's
sacred name. The sacrifice is not indeed required from a thief or robber, or
from the denier of a deposit, or the appropriator of anything lost, unless they
have also perjured themselves; yet the words of Moses are not without their
weight: if any one, by the denial of a deposit, or by theft, or robbery, shall
have "committed<i> </i>a trespass against the Lord;" whereby he signifies, that
whenever an injury is inflicted on men, God in their person is offended, because
every transgression of the Law violates and perverts His
justice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We shall elsewhere see more about the
restitution to be made in case of theft or robbery, especially when a person has
been found guilty. This point, however, is alone referred to directly in this
passage, viz., that whoever injures or inflicts a loss upon his brother, incurs
guilt and condemnation before God; but if he proceeds to such a pitch of
obstinacy, as to cover his crime by falsely appealing to the sacred name of God,
he is polluted by double iniquity, so that compensation of the damage is not
sufficient, but he must also make atonement to God. But we must understand this
of those who, having escaped from the fear of punishment, voluntarily repent.
The notion of some commentators who alter the copula into the disjunctive
particle, and consider perjury to be one of the various sins referred to, I
reject as foreign to the meaning of Moses. Others explain it thus: "If<i>
</i>any shall have committed robbery or theft, or shall have sworn falsely about
a thing lawful in itself:" but I do not see why the words should be wrested
thus; besides, their mistake is refitted by the context itself, in which
restitution is coupled with the sacrifices, and this could not be applicable
unless perjury were conjoined also with fraud or violence. Nor does the
disjunctive particle which follows help them; for after he has commanded what
was taken away by force or deceit to be restored, because all the various points
could not be separately expressed, it is added, "Or all that about which he hath
sworn falsely," not as if the guilt of perjury had been contracted in any other
matters, but that he might cut away all means of subterfuge, which the
repetition also confirms; for, after having introduced the crime of swearing
falsely, he again, as if more clearly explaining what he had said, commands the
restitution of the principal, together with the fifth part. But what is it that
he commands to be restored except what the deceiver had kept back under cover of
his oath? Of this a clearer exposition will be found under the Eighth
Commandment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A satisfaction is therefore
enjoined to be made towards men together with the offering. Nor is it without
reason that God commands them to make up the loss on the day when the offering
is made, lest hypocrites should promise themselves impunity after having
enriched themselves by the property of another. It was indeed permitted them to
restore their property to others before they propitiated God by the sacrifice;
but God will not have His altar defiled, which would be the case if thieves or
robbers offered victims belonging to others. He would, therefore, have the hands
of those who sacrifice cleansed from pollution. And surely those who offer a
victim to God out of spoils unjustly obtained, in some measure implicate Him as
a participator in their crime. Hence may profitable instruction be drawn, viz.,
that hypocrites busy themselves in vain in reconciling God to themselves, unless
they honestly restore what they have unjustly taken. Meanwhile we must observe
the distinction in the words of Moses between the satisfaction made to men and
the sin-offering which propitiates God; for we gather from hence, as I have
said, that they obtain not pardon from God who desire to remain enriched by
their stolen property; and yet that God is not appeased by anything but
sacrifice. Clear proof of this latter point may be gathered from the whole Law,
which prescribes but one means of reconciling God, <i>i.e., </i>when the sinner
makes atonement for himself by offering a victim. Hence the diabolical figment
as to satisfactions is
refuted</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f272</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by which the Papists imagine that they
are redeemed from God's judgment; for although God shall have remitted the
guilt, they still think that the liability to punishment remains, until the
sinner shall have delivered himself by his own works. To this end they have
invented works of supererogation, to be meritorious in redeeming from
punishment; hence, too, purgatory has come into existence. But when you have
studied all the writings of Moses, and diligently weighed whatsoever is revealed
in the Law as to the means of appeasing God, you will find that the Jews were
everywhere brought back to sacrifices. Now, it is certain that whatever is
attributed to sacrifices is so much taken away from men's own works. But if it
were not God's intention to down His ancient people to outward ceremonies, it
follows that it is only by the one Mediator, through the outpouring of His
blood, that men are absolved from all liability either to guilt or punishment,
so as to be restored to favor by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the priest shall make an
atonement.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this form of expression
also, which frequently occurs, we must learn that the victim in itself was not
the price of redemption, but that expiation was founded on the priesthood. For
they have foolishly and falsely invented the notion that men work something
themselves in the
sacraments,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f273</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whereas their virtue and effect proceeds
from quite another quarter. The offering, therefore, properly speaking, is
passive rather than active as regards
man.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f274</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The force of this will be more clearly
understood from the delusion of the Papists. They are indeed compelled to
acknowledge that in the sacraments men are passive, in so far as they receive
the grace there offered to them; but they presently pervert this doctrine, by
inventing their <i>opus operatum, </i>as they call it. But, lest the people
should think that they bring from their own stores (<i>domo</i>)<i> </i>the
price of their redemption, Moses constantly inculcates that it is the peculiar
office of the priest, to appease God, and to blot out sin by expiation. It is
also worthy of observation that he adds, "before<i> </i>the Lord," for by this
clause the profane notion is refuted, that men are purged by the legal
sacrifices only civilly, as they say, <i>i.e., </i>before men, as if there were
no spiritual promise included in them. Now, if this were so, the fathers would
have been confirmed in the confidence of pardon by no external symbols, than
which nothing can be more absurd; but by this one clause all ambiguity is
removed, when Moses declares that they were absolved "before the
Lord."</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Command Aaron and his
sons.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He more distinctly explains what
might have appeared to be omitted; nor is it without reason that he carefully
enters into these full details, for since God prefers obedience to all
sacrifices, he was unwilling that anything should remain doubtful as to the
external rites, which were not otherwise of great importance; that they might
learn to observe precisely, and with the most exact care, whatever the Law
commanded, and that they should not obtrude anything of themselves, inasmuch as
the purity of the holy things was corrupted by the very smallest invention. He
would, therefore, leave nothing to the people's judgment, but directed them by a
fixed rule even in the most trifling matters. As to the burnt-offerings, he
commands that they should not be taken away from the altar till they were
consumed by the fire; but after they were put on, he commands them to be burnt
in a constant fire till the morrow. With this intent, he expressly says, that
the fire should be kept alight on the altar all the night, since the sacrifices
would not have been reduced to ashes without the application of fuel.
<i>Secondly, </i>he commands the priest, clothed in the linen garment, and
breeches, as he was wont to be in the performance of his sacred duties, to go to
the altar, and to take away the ashes and put them by the side, or at some part
of the altar; but when he shall have gone away from the altar, he bids him take
off his holy garments, and carry the ashes out of the camp to a clean place. But
what he had before briefly adverted to as to the supply of wood, he
immediately<i> </i>declares more fully to be, lest the fire should go out.
Again, he assigns to the priest the office of setting the wood in order every
morning. But, because in the
sacrifices</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f275</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of prosperities the Law commanded the
fat only to be burnt, Moses now adds, verse 12, that the fat was to be burnt on
the same fire. It is worthy of particular observation, that he finally subjoins
a precept as to so keeping up the fire that it may never go
out.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The intent of this perpetuity was, that the
offerings should be burnt with heavenly fire; for on the day that Aaron was
consecrated, the sacrifice<i> </i>was reduced to ashes not by human means but
miraculously, in token of approbation. True that God did not choose daily to
exert this power; but He interposed the hand and labor of men in such a manner
that the origin of the sacred fire should still be from heaven. The same thing
afterwards happened at the dedication of Solomon's temple, because that
alteration of the divine decree demanded a sign (<i>tesseram,</i>)<i> </i>lest
any should think that it was at the will of man that the splendor of the temple
should outvie the tabernacle. Finally, the sacrifice of Elijah was graced by the
same privilege when he restored the abolished legal service; and then also God
upheld what He had ordained in His Law, in opposition to all corrupt and
degenerate rites. Meanwhile, in order to prevent any adulterations, He chose to
have the fire continually burning on the altar day and night, nor was it
allowable to take it from elsewhere. There was, indeed, amongst the
Persians</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f276</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a perpetual fire, and at Rome also under
the guardianship of the Vestal
virgins;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f277</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and it may be, that in foolish mimicry
they transferred to themselves the custom which they had heard of being observed
by the Jews; for thus it is that, for the purpose of deceiving<i>
</i>unbelievers, the devil often falsely makes a pretense of something divine,
and imitates God just as an ape imitates man: but the purpose of God in
rejecting strange fire was to retain the people in His own genuine ordinance
prescribed by the Law, lest any inventions of men should insinuate themselves;
for the prohibition of strange fire was tantamount to forbidding men to
introduce anything of their own, or to add to the pure doctrine of the Law, or
to decline from its rule. Meanwhile, since God had once testified, as if by
stretching forth His hand from heaven (to receive
them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f278</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) that the sacrifices were acceptable to
Him, believers were confirmed in their confidence of this by the pledge of the
perpetual fire.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the Law of the
meat-offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have already seen that
there were various kinds of this offering; now, the cakes or wafers are
omitted,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f279</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and mention is only made of uncooked
flour, whereof God commands that the priest should burn on the altar as much as
his hand could hold. But this law was necessary in order that believers might
be<i> </i>fully assured that God was propitiated by the due offering of this
part, and that none might complain because the greater portion remained with the
priests. Lest, however, the dignity of the sacrifice should be impaired, it was
only permitted to the priests to make unleavened bread of it, which they were to
eat in the sanctuary, as we have seen elsewhere. The meat-offering of the
priests is excepted, which I conceive to be for two reasons, &#8212; first, that
the excellency and dignity of their gift, honored as it was by special
privilege, might stimulate the priests to greater efforts of piety, so as not to
exercise themselves in God's service in a common and perfunctory manner;
secondly, that they might be thus restrained from the affectation of offering it
too frequently. For if it only cost them a little flour, a door was opened to
vain ostentation; they would have never ceased offering their
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f280</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>minha, </i>the profit of which
returned to themselves; perhaps they might even have made a trade of it, as we
see the Popish sacrificers entice the simple populace to profuse expenditure in
offerings by the pomp of their fictitious devotion. Lest, therefore, they should
cause their immoderate oblations to minister both to their vainglory and
avarice, God willed that their meat-offering should be entirely
consumed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We everywhere see how carefully
God provided that the people should have no doubts about anything. And assuredly
true religion is distinguished from false imaginations by this peculiar mark,
that God Himself prescribes what is to be done. Nor can certainty, though
religion ought to be based upon it, be derived elsewhere than from His own
mouth. Now, because there was a difference between burnt-offerings and
sin-offerings, it would have been natural to kill them separately in different,
places, unless the error had been anticipated; but all doubt, is removed when
God assigns the same place to them both. Whence, too, we gather that one law
suffices for the proper worship of God, if men are not wise in their own
conceits, but depend on His mouth. For how came it to pass that, whilst these
two kinds of oblations differed from each other, the rule respecting them was
the same on this point, except because it so pleased God? This passage,
therefore, sufficiently reminds us with how great sober-mindedness and modesty
it becomes us to follow what is pointed out to us in God's word. A reason,
however, is at the same time added, which may invite reverence to be paid to the
sin-offerings, when especial sanctity is attributed to them, which, according to
the idiom of the Hebrew language, is called "holiness of holinesses." Moreover,
Moses begins to distinguish between

<i>asham, </i>which the Latins translate <i>peccatum, </i>and <i>delictum,
</i>though he had before used them indifferently to express the same thing. What
the difference was, I confess, I know not; I see the guesses of others, but
nothing certain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And no
sin-offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The exception is repeated
both with reference to the sacrifices mentioned in the fourth chapter, and also
to the solemn sacrifice, whereby the priest and the people were reconciled every
year: for private persons individually atoned for their sins at less expense,
and only the greater altar, which stood in the court, was sprinkled with blood;
but if the priest reconciled God to the whole people, or to himself, in order
that the intercession might be more efficacious, he entered the sanctuary to
pour out blood on the opposite side of the veil. God now again commands that
such victims should be entirely burnt. This passage, then, is nothing but a
confirmation of the others in which a like command is given. Hence the Apostle,
in an apt allusion, infers that the distinction of meats is abolished; for he
says that the minor altar, which under the Law was hidden, is now laid open to
us,

elsewhere</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f282</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> stated my reasons for calling this kind
of sacrifice "the sacrifice of prosperities." That they were offered not only in
token of gratitude, but when God's aid was implored, is plain both from this and
other passages; yet in all cases the Jews thus testified that they acknowledged
God as the author of all good things, whether they returned thanks for some
notable blessing, or sought by His aid to be delivered from dangers, or whether
they professed in general their piety, or paid the vows which they had made
simply and without condition; for the payment of a conditional vow was an act of
thanksgiving. At any rate, since in all they honored God with His due service,
they gave proof of their gratitude. Hence this name was justly given to these
sacrifices, because in them they either besought good success of Him, or
acknowledged that what they had already obtained was owing to His grace, or
asked for relief in adversity, or congratulated themselves on their welfare and
safety. Moses, however, distinguishes one kind, as it were, from the others:,
<i>i.e., </i>the sacrifice of thanksgiving, whereby they professedly returned
thanks for some notable deliverance, which was not; always
offered.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f283</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In this case he commands unleavened
cakes fried in oil, wafers seasoned with oil, and fine flour fried to be
offered, together with leavened bread; and also commands that the flesh of the
sacrifice should be eaten on the day of the oblation, so that none should be
left. In vows and free-will-offerings greater liberty is conceded, viz., that
they might eat the residue on the next day, provided they kept nothing till the
third day. In the passage which I have inserted from chapter 22, the words I
have translated "unto<i> </i>your acceptance," might also be rendered "unto<i>
</i>His good-will," (<i>in beneplacitum,</i>)<i> </i>for the gratuitous favor of
God is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ratson. </i>The meaning therefore is, if you would have your sacrifice
accepted by God, take care that none of the flesh should remain to the following
day. Others, however, understand it of man's good-will, as if it were said,
"at<i> </i>your own will," or "as<i> </i>it shall please you." And I admit,
indeed, that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ratson, </i>is sometimes used in this sense; but since in the same
chapter</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f284</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it can only be taken for God's favor or
acceptance,<i> </i>I have preferred avoiding a variation; yet I make no
objection if any one likes the other reading better. But if my readers weigh
well the <i>antithesis, </i>when it is presently added, that if the flesh should
remain beyond the proper
time</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f285</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the sacrifice would not be pleasing to
God, they will agree with me. There is, indeed, an apparent discrepancy<i>
</i>here, since in this way Moses would command the voluntary sacrifice to be
eaten on the same day, which, however, he does not do. If we prefer
understanding it of the liberal feelings of men, he will exhort the people
cheerfully<i> </i>to offer their victims in thanksgiving. I have, however, shewn
the meaning which I approve of, and thus it will be easy to reconcile<i>
</i>these things, for God's goodwill does not require this
similarity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f286</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nor is it necessary to observe the same
mode of offering that they may be grateful; but they are said to offer "unto
their acceptance," when they intermix no corruption, but offer purely and duly.
If the cause of this distinction is asked, it is no clearer to me than is the
variety between the bread and wafers or cakes. It is certain, indeed, that God
had a reason for dealing more strictly or more indulgently; but to inquire
now-a-days as to things unknown, and which conduce not at all to piety, is
neither right nor expedient.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if the sacrifice of his
offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have observed a little above
that it is not a conditional but a simple vow which is here meant; because, if a
person were under the obligation of a
vow,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f287</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> his payment was an act of thanksgiving,
and thus his sacrifice was comprised under the first head. But it would not be
without absurdity that similar things should be distinguished as if they
differed. But inasmuch as many made gratuitous vows, Moses combines this kind of
sacrifice with the free-will-offering, as standing in the same rank. It has also
been stated that the consecrated meats were not kept too long, lest they should
become tainted or putrified, and thus religion should fall into contempt.
Perhaps, too, vainglory was thus provided against; for if it had been allowable
to eat the meats salted, many would have made ostentatious offerings without
expense. God, therefore, imposed a restraint, that they might offer their
sacrifices more sparingly and reverently. The penalty is added, that; the
sacrifice would not be acceptable to God, but rather abominable; and hence all
who ate of them would be guilty. Moreover, when Moses says that polluted
sacrifices would not be "imputed," we may infer that those which are duly
offered come into account before God, so that He reckons them as things expended
for Himself. Still we must not, imagine them to be merits which lay Him under
obligation; but because He deigns to deal so liberally with us, that no duty
which we pay Him is useless.</font><br></div>

is,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f288</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that if any unclean person shall have
touched the consecrated meat, he should be cut off from the people. The cruelty

nothing more than to be cast out of the camp. But it is not wonderful that God
should have thus severely dealt with those who knowingly and wilfully
contaminated what was holy; for if any one had sinned in error, he was not to
receive this sentence, but only he who had betrayed his open contempt of God by
impious profanation of sacred things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto the children of

was consecrated to God, and was burnt on the altar, God forbade His people to
eat fat even in their ordinary meals, in order that they might cultivate piety

who were far away from the temple should still accustom themselves in their
daily meals to the service of God. Nor am I ignorant of the
allegories</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

itself from man's inventions to vitiate the sacrifices. In the day, he says,
that God appointed the sacrifices to be offered to Him on Mount Sinai, He
omitted nothing which was to be observed, lest men should dare to introduce
anything except what He prescribed. And surely, when He had thus carefully
embraced all the ceremonies, we may easily infer from hence how earnestly we
should avoid all temerity and audacity in invention. The design, therefore, of
Moses was in this brief admonition to exhort the people to soberness, lest they

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord
spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He partly here adverts to those
precepts of which he had treated more distinctly and fully in Leviticus, and
partly gathers into one place what he had before spoken of in various places and
more obscurely. For as yet he had delivered no certain regulations as to the
accessories to the meat-offering of oil and wine; but what he had before
appropriated to particular cases he now commands to be observed generally, and
what he had treated of more accurately he now lightly passes over; for he does
not enter into full particulars, but only forbids that sacrifices should be
offered without flour, a libation of wine, and oil. We have seen elsewhere that
in the sacrifices and oblations, wherein God consulted the rude condition of the
people, He took as it were the character of a man, as if He feasted there
familiarly with them. In this sense He elsewhere calls the sacrifices His
meat,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f291</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not because He, who is the life in
Himself and inspires the life of all, requires the supports of life, but
because, unless He descends to men, He cannot lift up their minds to things
above. Still, inasmuch as there was danger on the other side lest the people
should introduce many inane and superfluous pomps, as we see that in their
sacred feasts the Gentiles were foolishly and immoderately luxurious, as if
their delicacies gave pleasure to God, the measure of each particular thing is
prescribed, that they may not dare to invent anything arbitrarily. The
conjecture is probable that what had been before delivered with sufficient
clearness is here again recalled to their memory. But since this reason is not
expressly given, it will be enough to hold fast what has been frequently stated,
that although the ceremonies might be of trifling importance, still it was
necessary that the lawful should be carefully distinguished from the
unauthorized, in order that the licentiousness of men might be anticipated, who
would otherwise have failed not to mingle their own leaven. The sum of this
passage is, that both in the solemn sacrifices which the Law demands, as well as
in the free-will-offerings, they should observe that proportion of which we have
treated elsewhere.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if a stranger sojourn with
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not mean all strangers, but
only those who, descending from heathen nations, had professedly turned to God,
and thus had been received into the body of the Church; for the uncleanness of
those who remained in uncircumcision excluded them from the legal service. I
conceive that there were two reasons why God would have one and the same form
observed;<i> first, </i>that the proselytes who had been lately incorporated
might more cheerfully devote themselves to the exercises of piety, when they saw
themselves placed in the same position as the children of Abraham; and
<i>secondly, </i>lest if any distinction should be made, corrupt mixtures should
immediately creep in. Lest, therefore, the purity of God's worship should be
gradually corrupted by absurd imitation, the gate was shut against that variety
which usually draws men aside in different directions.</font><br></div>

that victim by which God was at length to be reconciled. We know in how great
liberties the world indulges itself in the service of God; for whilst it lightly
and contemptuously obtrudes mere trifling upon Him as if He were a child, it
still fancies that its duty is properly discharged. Hence it is that it claims
reward for any rubbish (<i>sordibus,</i>)<i> </i>and exults in mere mockeries of
God, as if it were laying Him under obligation. A notable example of this stupid
security is seen now-a-days in the Papacy, when they mock God with no less
audacity than as if they were dealing with a block of wood. To omit innumerable
other cases, what can be more monstrous than this arrogance of theirs, when, as
they mutter their prayers, their minds wander not only into frivolous but even
into unholy imaginations, and yet they pretend that the final intention, as they
call it, is meritorious and approved by

shall run away now to his cups, now to dicing, or other pastimes, still, as if
his task were performed, he will boast that he has offered worship to God. In
order, therefore, to obviate this fault, God commands that sacrifices free from
all blemish should be presented to Him. Hence that sharp expostulation of His in

"Offer<i> </i>it now (he says) to thy governor, will he &#8212; accept thy
person?" not because God cared for the fatness or the juiciness of the animals,
but because it thus was made plain that true piety was neglected, nay,
altogether despised. We perceive, then, that all defective sacrifices were
rejected, that the Israelites might learn sincerely and seriously to consecrate
themselves entirely to God, and not to play childishly with Him, as is often the
case. Elsewhere we have seen indeed that all uncleanness is repudiated by God;
but we must remember that two things are required for legitimate worship;
<i>first, </i>that he who approaches God should be purged from every stain, and
<i>secondly, </i>that he should offer nothing except what is pure and free from
all imperfection. What Solomon says, that "the sacrifice<i> </i>of the wicked is
an abomination to the Lord,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
15:8,) is true, although it be fat and splendid. But in order that the things
which are offered by the good should be pleasing to God, another point must also
be attended to, viz., that the offering should not be poor, and stingy, and
deficient; and again, by this symbol, as I have already said, they were directed
to Christ, besides whom no integrity will anywhere be found which will satisfy
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>

their oblations to be approved by God, they must beware that there be no defect
in them. Still, if any one chooses to think that God's gratuitous favor is
expressed by the word "good pleasure," I willingly admit it, since our services
only please God in so far as in His paternal indulgence He deigns to award to
them the value of which they are by no means worthy. Nevertheless let us learn
meanwhile that we must not play with God, but that He must be so worshipped in
integrity and sincerity of heart as that our sacrifices may correspond with His
good pleasure. For hence arises the careless profanation of His worship, because
we do not sufficiently consider what is due to His perfection. It is indeed
certain that nothing can proceed from us which is pure in every respect; but let
us at least aspire at what befits us, and let us mourn that our desires fall so
far short of their aim, in order that Christ may by His grace supply what is
wanting in US; for it is unquestionable that, provided our sacrifices are the
fruits of true regeneration, He washes out their blemishes with His own
blood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Either a bullock, or a lamb, that
hath anything superfluous.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>An exception
is here stated as to free-will-offerings; for in them God does not refuse a
diminutive animal, or one which has a member either contracted, or of excessive
size. And doubtless a greater license ought to be given, when a person is not
under the obligation either of a vow or any other necessity. Still we must
remember that no victim is acceptable to God, which labors under any notable
defect.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>

this sort should be offered to Him, although they might be purchased from
foreigners. The Hebrews, however, has invented a different meaning, viz., that
not even from foreigners were such sacrifices to be received, as it was unlawful
for the children of the Church themselves to offer. But inasmuch as the Law
altogether prohibited the unclean nations from making sacred oblations, another
solution of this difficulty was still to be
discovered.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f295</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They suppose, therefore, that those are
called "strangers," who observe the precepts of the children of Noah, <i>i.e.,
</i>who honor God, and do not pollute themselves by incest, abstain from the
effusion of human blood, and from theft, and who do not worship idols. But the
context does not accord with this, for Moses adds at the end that this kind of
sacrifice would not be accepted by God from the Jews themselves, which will not
agree with their being offered by the Gentiles. This, then, seems to me to be a
confirmation of the previous injunction, introduced by way of precaution; for it
might have seemed that the offering would have been permissible, if they had
purchased the animal, even though it were defective; whereas God declares that
what they were not allowed to present from their own stalls, was no more
approved of by Him, if it had been purchased, because defectiveness is always
displeasing to Him. Nor do I restrict this, as they do, to the foregoing clause,
as if it only referred to castrated animals, and such as were wounded in the
testicles, but I include with it also warts and eruptions, and other blemishes.
In order that the prohibition may have more weight, he again calls the
sacrifices<i> </i>"the bread of God," not because God, who is the fountain of
life, has need of food, or eats of corruptible meat, since He is the eternal
Spirit; but that men may more diligently take care duly to perform their sacred
rites, wherein they familiarly draw nigh to God. Now, if no one would dare to
present stale or corrupted food to an earthly prince, much less tolerable is it
to contaminate God's table with anything blemished.</font><br></div>

the sanctity of the altar should be polluted by any impure oblation. Still the
dog seems to be rejected in comparison with other animals out of contempt; for
it was just as wrong to kill a pig as a dog, yet might the price of a pig be
offered. The dog, therefore, is rejected not only as an unclean animal, but also

transferred from the sacrifices to the ordinary food, but also because the
offering would have been a fraudulent one. We have seen that the sacrifices were
called the bread of God, in order that men should be more liberal with
respect<i> </i>to them, and not offer meagre victims; but to kill a young animal
fresh from the womb would have been a sign of contempt; although regard was also
had to humanity, lest, by eating of such sacrifices,<i> </i>they should grow
accustomed to cruelty. The eighth day is appointed, on which the lawfulness of
the offering should commence. I am afraid that the reason which some assign for
this is too subtle, viz., that an animal is made perfect in seven days, because
God completed the work of creation in seven days. Besides, on this ground the
seventh day would be the fittest for sacrifice, because in six days God
completed all His work, and the seventh was hallowed for His service<i>. </i>It
is enough for me that regard was had to maturity of age, just as in the case of
circumcision.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<i>shachat, </i>which he uses, is a general one; but since throughout the

32, the context requires that we should consider it to be an inculcation of
purity in God's service. If any prefer to extend it further, I will not contest
the point; and thus this sentence will be a supplement to the Sixth Commandment.
I have, however, followed what appears most probable, and the reader of sound
judgment will, I hope, agree with me. Meanwhile, I confess that all barbarity
and cruelty was thus prohibited in the sacrifices,<i> </i>and in them the rule
was laid down, that men should not be cruel in reference to their daily food. It
is a sight by no means pleasant to gentle minds to see the dam killed together
with her young; and, if it were a common custom, men would easily grow callous
as to blood-shedding in general. God would therefore not have the exercises of
religion disconnected from the duties of humanity; and the tendency of the
precept is, that God's altar should not be a Cyclopean
slaughter-house.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not seethe a

command reminds us that a serious matter is spoken of, whereas it would be a
light and almost frivolous one, if, as some suppose, it is merely the
prohibition of a somewhat unwholesome food. But the Jews, not considering its
intent, and affecting sanctity, as they do, in trifling puerilities, dare not
taste of cheese together with kid, or lamb's flesh, until they have well cleaned
their teeth. I have no doubt, however, but that this prohibition relates to the
sacrifices, for in the first passage quoted, it is added in connection with the
offering of the first-fruits; and in the second, we read as follows: "The first
of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy
God. Nor shalt thou seethe a kid in his mother's milk;" and so also in the third
passage: "Ye<i> </i>shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself, etc., for
thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God; nor shalt thou seethe a kid in
his mother's milk." I allow indeed that Moses sometimes mixes together precepts
respecting different things; but this running context shews that this precept is
delivered among the ceremonies, and must therefore be reckoned to be a part of
the legal service. Whence I conclude, that the people are not only interdicted
from eating this sort of food, as if they were to partake of flesh steeped in
blood; but that they should not pollute the sacrifices by the carnal mixture. It
is however probable, that meat seasoned with milk was accounted a delicacy; but
inasmuch as they might grow cruel, if they ate of a lamb or kid in its mother's
milk, God forbade to be offered to Himself, what was not allowable even in their
common meals. The exposition of some, that kids were excluded from their tables
until they were weaned, is not agreeable to reason; because they then begin to
have a goatish flavor. But the reason is a very appropriate one, <i>i.e.,
</i>that God would not admit a monstrous thing in His sacrifices, that the flesh
of the young should be cooked in its mother's milk, and thus, as it were, in its
own blood.</font><br></div>

supplements would partly agree with, and be applicable to, the First
Commandment; but since express mention is everywhere made in them of idols, this
place seems to be better suited to them. After Moses has taught what was
necessary to be observed, he adds a political law about breaking down altars and
overthrowing images, in order that the people may take the more diligent heed.
These passages, however, differ from the foregoing; for in condemning thus far
the superstitions which are vicious in themselves, God prescribed what He would
have observed even to the end of the world. He now confirms that instruction by
temporary enactments, that He may keep His ancient people up to their duty. For
we have now-a-days no scruples in retaining the temples, which have been
polluted by idols, and applying them to a better use; since we are not bound by
what was added consequently (<i>propter consequentiam</i>),<i> </i>as they say,
to the Law. I admit indeed that whatever tends to foster superstition should be
removed, provided we are not too rigorously superstitious in insisting
peremptorily on what is in itself indifferent. The sum amounts to this, that to
shew more clearly how greatly God detests idolatry, He would have the memory of
all those things abolished which had once been dedicated to idols. The <i>second
</i>passage more fully unfolds what Moses had briefly adverted to in the first;
for under the word "image," he included all those tokens of idolatry which he
afterwards enumerates, and of which he commands the whole land to be so cleared
that no relics of them should remain. From the words, when ye have come into the
land "to possess it,"<i>
</i>Augustin</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f297</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> sensibly infers, that there is no
command for private individuals to destroy the instruments of idolatry; but that
the people are armed and furnished with this authority to take the charge of
regulating the public interests, when they have obtained possession of the land.
The <i>third </i>passage is more brief, only enumerating three kinds; the
<i>fourth </i>adds "graven images," (<i>sculptilia</i>.)<i> </i>The <i>fifth
</i>omits the groves, and puts in their place images or representations made of
molten materials; and here we must observe what we have before adverted to, that
the name of statue (<i>statuoe</i>)<i> </i>is sometimes taken in a good sense;
and therefore the Jews think that what was permitted to the fathers before the
Law is now forbidden. To us, however, it seems more probable, that the statues
now condemned are not such as Jacob erected only as a monument, but such as they
pretended to be a likeness of God. Some translate the word
"titles,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> others "pictures," with what propriety I
leave to the judgment of my readers. He adds
<i>"image,</i>"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f299</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a word which, though not in itself
sinful, is still deservedly rejected in connection with the worship of God. Man
is the image of God; for Moses uses this same word, when relating the creation
of man. But to represent God by any figure, before which He is worshipped, is
nothing less than to corrupt His glory, and so to metamorphose Him. By speaking
of molten images, he admits neither sculptures nor pictures; but since they are
generally cast in the precious metals, the people were expressly to beware of
keeping gods of gold or silver for ornament.</font><br></div>

belong alike to the First and Second Commandment, still it was fit to postpone
them to this place; because in them God applied a remedy to all external and
manifest superstitions, which might easily have insinuated themselves had they
not been anticipated in good time. All will run eagerly into idolatry, even
though there be none to impel us from without; but where the ungodly act upon us
also like fans, and this must needs be the case, when the people of God entangle
themselves in their society, this disease is increasingly inflamed. And truly
the closer our familiarity is with them, it is like a yoke, whereby they draw
others with them. In order then that the people, when they entered the land,
might preserve themselves pure and thoroughly devoted to God, care must be taken
lest they should contract pollution from other nations; and therefore God would
have all the inhabitants of Canaan utterly destroyed, lest they should entice
His elect people to their errors and the worship of false gods. He here
interdicts two kinds of covenant with them, lest there should be any public or
private alliance between them; and then commands that all should be slain
without mercy. As regards the public covenant, it was forbidden for a special
cause, that the sons of Abraham should mix themselves with the reprobate;
because they would have thus deprived themselves of the lawful inheritance which
God had destined for them; nor would the face of the land have been renewed by
the removal of all defilements. Since then in His just judgment God had long ago
determined to destroy these nations, it was not lawful for the children of
Abraham to rescind the divine decree, or to make any alteration in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If therefore any one should insist too
literally on this passage to prove the unlawfulness of making any contract with
the ungodly, because God forbade it of old, he will not reason soundly, since
God does not now command us to execute vengeance by putting all the wicked to
death; nor is a certain country assigned to the Church in which it may dwell
apart and have dominion. Still I do not deny that what was enjoined upon the
ancient people, in some degree has reference to us; nay, we must carefully
remark what I lately adverted to, that those, who voluntarily unite themselves
with the ungodly, impose as it were a yoke on themselves to draw them to
destruction. And in fact Paul embraced in this comparison all the grounds upon
which unbelievers insinuate themselves into familiarity with us, to ensnare us
by their corrupting influence.

away from Him by their allurements; for they will always be attempting, by all

desire faithfully to serve God, there ought to be a perpetual quarrel between us
and them. God then would have us not only separate ourselves from open communion
with them, but since we are too much given to depravity, He also commands us to
fly from all the snares which might gradually induce us to participate in their
sins. But inasmuch as Paul justly reminds us, that if we are not permitted to
have any dealings with unbelievers, we must "needs go out of the world,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:10,) it is proper for us to distinguish between the contracts
which associate us with them and those which do not at all diminish our
liberty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As long as we live among unbelievers,
we cannot escape those dealings with them which relate to the ordinary affairs
of life; but if we approach nearer, so that a greater intimacy should arise, we
open the door as it were to Satan. Such are alliances between kings and nations,
and marriages amongst private persons; and therefore Moses laid down rules
respecting them both for the ancient people. And although our condition
now-a-days is more free, still we are warned that all temptations are to be
avoided which might give occasion to this evil. It is notorious that men are too
apt to be led away by the blandishments of their wives; and also, that men in
their power compel their wives to obedience. Those, therefore, who mix with
idolaters, knowingly and wilfully devote themselves to idols. The same thing
happens as to alliances; for men are ashamed in them to betray any marks of
disrespect. Thus, to please the king of Syria, Ahaz raised an altar in the
temple like that at Damascus.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:10.) Thus while the Jews desired to gratify the Assyrians, they
imitated their superstitions. In a word, it, is a most uncommon case that the
religion of those should remain unaffected who seek to curry favor with the
ungodly. But that they may cleave more earnestly to their duty, the danger I
have spoken of is declared; otherwise such rejoinders as these would have been
straightway in their mouths: "Although<i> </i>my wife is altogether averse from
true piety, still I will stand firm; although my husband is not subject to God,
yet I will never decline from the true course; although religion is not dear to
our allies, still it shall not cease to be sacredly held in honor amongst
ourselves." God</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f302</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> therefore interferes betimes, and
declares that they will not be so magnanimous in resistance, when once they have
opened the window to the evil. He adds, too, another evil, <i>i.e., </i>that the
sacred land would be thus profaned; for, although the Israelites should be
separated from the impieties of the Gentiles, still it was not excusable to
allow them to have altars in that land in which God had chosen a sanctuary for
Himself. Yet at the same time Moses warns them that it could scarcely be but
that this association would involve the Israelites also. When he says, then,
"lest they go a whoring after their gods, and one call thee," he means that the
Israelites would be like panders, if under cover of their covenant, and for the
sake of preserving their good-will, they gave the Gentiles permission to
exercise their superstitions; and also that this would be a snare to grosser
sin; since whilst they feared to give offense, they would not refuse to go to
their feasts, and thus would be partakers of their guilt. Literally, it is,
"Lest<i> </i>perhaps thou strike a covenant, and they go a whoring after their
gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and call thee," which words may be thus
paraphrased, so as to depend on the foregoing prohibition: "Lest<i> </i>it
should happen, after you shall have made a covenant, that they should go a
whoring," etc.; or thus, "By<i> </i>no means make a covenant, because they will
go a whoring after their idols, and when they shall offer sacrifices will call
thee." The meaning, however, will amount to the same; for he mentions the two
worst results of their unlawful covenant, <i>i.e., </i>that these unbelieving
nations will pollute the land, and under pretext of kindness will corrupt God's
people. But in order that they may be more earnest and courageous in their duty,
the promise is added, that they shall be victorious over these nations. This was
almost incredible, that wanderers and exiles as they were, they should easily
and quickly be enabled to gain possession of so many lands; therefore God takes
away all doubt, and thus commands the Israelites to obey His dominion at the end
of this war, which they shall feel that they have waged successfully under His
auspices. Wherefore he convicts them of ingratitude if they shall dare to relax
any of that severity which He requires; as if He had said, Since these nations
far excel you in numbers, and strength, and warlike equipments, it will plainly
appear that you have not conquered them by your own power; it will therefore be
more than iniquitous that the war, which shall be concluded under my guidance
alone, and by my hand, should be finished in opposition to my will, and that you
should be the disposers of that victory which I have gratuitously conferred upon
you. The discrepancy is easily reconciled, that Moses should only enumerate six
nations in Exodus, and add a seventh in Deuteronomy; for often he only names the
Canaanites or Amorites, yet comprising by <i>synecdoche </i>all the
rest.</font><br></div>

was cruelty in this command, usurp too great authority in respect to Him who is
the judge of all. The objection is specious that the people of God were
unreasonably imbued with inhumanity, so that, advancing with murderous atrocity,
they should spare neither sex nor age. But we must first remember what we shall
see hereafter, <i>i.e., </i>that when God had destined the land for His people,
He was at liberty utterly to destroy the former inhabitants, so that its
possession might be free for them. We must then go further, and say that He
desired the just demonstration of His vengeance to appear upon these nations.
Four hundred years before He had justly punished their many sins, yet had He
suspended His sentence and patiently borne with them, if haply they might
repent. That sentence</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f303</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is well known, "The iniquity of the
Amorites is not yet full."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:16.) After God had shewn His mercy for four centuries, and this clemency had
increased both their audacity and madness, so that they had not ceased to
provoke His wrath, surely it was no act of cruelty to compensate for the delay
by the grievousness of the punishment. And hence appears the foul and detestable
perversity of the human intellect. We are indignant if He does not smile at
once; if He delays punishment our zeal accuses Him of slackness and want of
energy; yet, when He comes forth as the avenger of guilt, we either call Him
cruel, or at least complain of His severity. Yet His justice will always absolve
Him; and our calumnies and detractions will recoil upon our own heads. He
commanded seven nations to be utterly destroyed; that is to say, after they had
added sin to sin for 400 years, so that their accumulation was immense, and
experience had taught that they were obstinate and incurable. It will therefore
be said elsewhere, that the land "spewed them out,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;031828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
18:28,) as if it had eased itself, when burdened by their filthiness. If impiety
is intolerable to the lifeless element, why should we wonder that God in His
character of Judge exercised extreme severity? But if God's wrath was just, He
might surely choose whatever ministers and executioners of it He pleased; and
when He had given this commission to His people, it was not unreasonable that He
should forbid them to pity those whom He had appointed for destruction. For what
can be more preposterous than for men to vie with God in clemency? and when it
pleases the Master to be severe, for the servants to assume to themselves the
right of shewing mercy? Therefore God often reproves the Israelites for being
improperly merciful. And hence it came to pass that the people, whom they ought
to have destroyed, became as thorns and briars to prick them.

23:13, and throughout the book of Judges.) Away, then, with all temerity,
whereby we would presumptuously restrict God's power to the puny measure of our
reason; and rather let us learn reverently to regard those works of His, whose
cause is concealed from us, than wantonly criticise them. Especially when He
declares to us the just grounds of His vengeance, let us learn to subscribe to
His decrees with the humility and modesty that becomes us, rather than to oppose
them in vain, and indeed to our own confusion.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt consume all
the people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is plain from the second
part of the verse wherefore He commands the people of Canaan to be destroyed,
when He forbids their gods to be worshipped. This precept, therefore,
corresponds with the others, where He dooms in like manner these nations to
utter destruction. I now pass over what I have explained elsewhere, <i>i.e.,
</i>that the vengeance which God exercised against these obstinate and ten-times
lost people cannot be ascribed to cruelty. For since 400 years ago it had been
said to Abraham that their iniquity was not yet full, they could not be treated
with severity equal to their deserts, when they had so licentiously and wickedly
abused God's long-suffering. But we must take notice of God's design in so
particularly enjoining on the Israelites utterly to destroy whatever should be
found there; for besides that He had once doomed them all to the destruction
they merited, He would have the land also, in which His name was to be invoked,
purged from all pollutions. Now, if any of the old inhabitants had survived,
they would soon have endeavored to revive their corruptions, and since the
Israelites were otherwise more disposed than enough to superstition, they would
easily have been attracted to the worship of idols. This, then, is the reason
why God forbids them to shew these people any humanity or clemency, as I have
reminded you to be clear from the context; for these things stand in connection,
that they should not spare the nations nor worship their gods. The reason which
is subjoined, "for<i> </i>it will be a snare or stumblingblock to you," must be
extended to the whole context, viz., that it would be fatal to the Jews if they
should spare the nations which would allure them to
impiety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt say in thine
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since it was a matter of great
difficulty to destroy such a multitude of men, and despair itself would drive
them to madness, so that it would be frivolous for the Israelites to cut off all
hope of mercy, God anticipates their fear, and exhorts them to the strenuous
execution of His sentence. From whence we gather some useful instruction;
whenever God commands anything which exceeds our power, we must still obey and
boldly break through whatever obstacles present themselves to impede us. In all
arduous matters, therefore, let this doctrine come to our aid, that whatever is
contrary to God's will may easily be annihilated by His almighty power. But
since terror, presented to our eyes, immediately so lays hold of all our senses
that we lie as it were torpid, God recalls to the recollection of the Israelites
what abundant grounds of confidence He had supplied them with. For all the
miracles He had wrought were so many proofs of His invincible power; and hence
they should conclude that nothing was to be dreaded, provided God should go
before them, and that, therefore, being assured of victory, they should not
descend to any treaties.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moreover, the Lord thy God will
send the hornet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the destruction
of their enemies might seem long, if they were only to be slain by their hands
and weapons, and again, because it was scarcely credible that, without defending
themselves, they would voluntarily stretch forth their own throats, God promises
that in another way also He would supply the means of their conquest. Therefore,
lest the Israelites, imagining that their enemies would be prompt and vigorous
in resistance, should be alarmed or affrighted, God declares that other forces
should be at hand, for that hornets or other poisonous insects should destroy
all the fugitives. The same declaration is found in Exodus 23; and what God had
promised, Joshua relates that He performed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;062412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
24:12.) But inasmuch as these nations were not to be destroyed in a moment, lest
the people should therefore grow weary or become inactive, God anticipates this,
and reminds them that this delay would be advantageous, for when all the
inhabitants were exterminated, the wild beasts would occupy the empty land. The
prolongation of the war, therefore, ought not to trouble them, for by it God
provided for His people's welfare, since, if the men were speedily destroyed,
they should have to contend with wild beasts. But though the passage which I
have quoted from Exodus is similar in terms, yet I have designedly placed it
under another head; for God here refers to the extermination of the Gentile
nations with another object, <i>i.e., </i>lest any of the ancient pollutions
should remain in the land, and lest the Israelites should mingle with the
ungodly, by whose arts they might at length be drawn away to spurious
religions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The graven images of their
gods.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again impresses upon them the
object of the destruction of the nations, but he goes further than before. He
had before forbidden them to worship their gods. He now commands them to consume
their graven images with fire, for since the people were prone to superstition,
such snares might easily have alienated them from God's pure worship. Nor does
he command them merely to melt the gold and silver so as to alter its shape, but
he altogether interdicts its use, since it would be a contagious plague; for he
shews how greatly God abominates idols, inasmuch as whosoever should touch the
materials of which they were molten, would contract pollution and become
accursed. This great severity might indeed seem to condemn the metals which were
created for man's use, as if they were impure, and as if the perfectness of
natural things was liable to be corrupted by man. But in this way idolaters
would contaminate the sun and moon, when falsely regarding them as objects of
corrupt worship; and it must be answered that the gold and silver itself was by
no means polluted by this impious abuse; but that, although free from all stain
in itself, it was polluted in respect to the people. Such was the uncleanness of
animals, not that they had in themselves any pollution, but because God had
interdicted their being eaten. The pollution therefore which is now mentioned
arises from a similar prohibition; for otherwise the ignorant people could not
be restrained, and hence God would have that to be abominable which in itself
was pure. Still this was a political precept, and only given temporarily to the
ancient people; yet we gather from it how detestable idolatry is, which even
infects the works of God themselves with its own filthiness.</font><br></div>

Amalekites were the first who made a hostile attack upon the people, and
endeavored to interrupt their journey; and Moses also related the sentence of
God against them, the execution of which he now enjoins upon the people. God
then swore that there should be perpetual war against them throughout all ages;
and, that His threatening might not be frustrated, He appoints His people to
take vengeance upon their great cruelty and impiety. For when the Israelites
were inflicting no injury nor loss upon them, it was an act of injustice to make
war upon peaceful persons proceeding, without doing any wrong, to another land.
But humanity was still more grossly violated by them, inasmuch as they did not
spare their own kindred, and thus cast away the feelings of nature. It is plain
from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
36:12, that the Amalekites were the descendants of Esau; and hence it follows
that they were both sprung from the same ancestor, Isaac. It is true that this
command seems but little in accordance with religion, that the people should
retaliate an injury done to them. I reply, that they are not stimulated to
vindictive feelings in these words, but that they are commanded to punish the
sins of Amalek with the same severity as those of the other nations. God
appears, indeed, to influence them by private motives when He recounts the
cruelty shewn by the Amalekites; but we must judge of the intention of the
Legislator with reference to His nature, for we know that no angry or hateful
passions can be approved by God; and hence it is easy to conclude that the
command was such as the people might obey with well-regulated zeal. The first
origin of the crime is specified, viz., because they "feared not God," for this
must not be taken in its ordinary meaning, but as expressing that they rebelled
against God as it were deliberately. For the promise given to Abraham and Isaac
could not be unknown to them; but, since Esau, the founder of their race, had
fallen from the right of primogeniture, it came to pass that they attempted to
bring God's covenant to nought out of wicked and sacrilegious jealousy; and this
is the reason why He unites them with the reprobate nations unto the same
destruction. The word

His people from all connection and alliance with the Canaanitish nations, so He

they might admit (into the

altogether rejects; because they not only refused the common rites of humanity
to the people, but also took arms against them, and even hired Balaam to curse
them. They were the descendants of Lot, and ought to have embraced the children
of Abraham as brethren. It was, then, inexcusable barbarity in them to make a
violent attack upon those who had voluntarily offered them peace; who had
promised by their messengers that they would make their way without injury or
wrong; and who finally had besought that a passage might be granted them,
provided they honestly paid the price of bread and water; although doubtless God
took vengeance rather on their impiety than their cruelty, since they had not
only endeavored to make His goodness of none effect, but also to annihilate His
faithfulness. Since, therefore, it was not their fault that the Church did not
perish, and the effect of His promise fail, whereon the salvation of man was
based, and this they had done knowingly and wilfully, no wonder that they were
excluded from the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>

hired.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f306</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although there was a common
reason why both nations should not be admitted, yet the number of the verb seems
to be changed designedly, because Balac king of Moab hired Balaam; yet, inasmuch
as they conspired together, the same crime is justly imputed to the Ammonites.
Herein indeed their detestable impiety especially betrayed itself, that by
hiring a mercenary man, to launch the thunders of his curse against the people,
they sought to overwhelm God by magical incantations. Nor did they err through
ignorance, since they obstinately persevered in their madness until Balaam was
confounded from heaven. And on this ground it is expressly stated that he was
not "hearkend unto," but that rather his curses and prayers were "turned into a
blessing." Hence it appears how awful is the vengeance which awaits all who of
deliberate malice oppose God's grace and the welfare of the Church. Thus
now-a-days no stone is left unturned by the defenders of the Papacy, whereby
they may disturb the course of heavenly doctrine, nay, whereby they may
altogether silence the Gospel if they
could.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since another reason for this rejection
is plainly signified, it is foolish in some to attribute this sentence upon them
to their origin, as if the Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from the Church
because they sprang from an incestuous
connection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not abhor an
Edomite.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In order that the punishment
denounced against the Moabites and Ammonites should be more strongly marked, he
commands the Edomites and Egyptians to be admitted in the third generation; the
former, because they derived their origin from the same ancestor, Isaac, since
they were the descendants of Esau; the latter, because they had been their
hosts. For hence it was manifest that the Ammonites and Moabites had been
dis-honored on account of their guilt, when not even aliens were thus dealt
with. Now, although Esau had cut himself off from the prerogative of believers,
yet the door was again opened to his children, provided they returned to their
source and origin, and in the humility of faith admitted the primogeniture of
Jacob, who had been chosen when their father was passed by or degraded. But what
is meant by this inequality of punishment, when the crime was identical? for
Edom appeared in arms against Israel before Moab, and compelled them to take
their journey by another way. It did not contend with hired imprecations for
Israel's destruction, but since, when humbly entreated on the score of their old
relationship, it had not only refused them a passage, but had advanced against
them with a great army, it should have been dealt with no less severity than
Amalek or Ammon. Besides, being connected to them by a closer of blood, the
Edomites were less excusable in their hostility. I find, then, no reason why God
shewed greater clemency to them than the others whom He treated more severely;
except that He wished to shew that it depends on His own will to chastise more
lightly in some the same sins on which He takes more severe vengeance in others;
and, inasmuch as all are deserving of utter destruction, He justly retains in
His own hand the free right of sparing whom He will. We must here adore His
judgments, into the depths of which we cannot penetrate. Nor is this inequality
a ground for the noisy cavils of the ungodly, as if He were inconsistent with
Himself, and acted in contradiction to the rules of His Law; since in so doing
He does not judge in diverse ways, but, condemning all alike, indulges whom He
pleases, or remits a part of their punishment. A question may also arise as to
the Egyptians, why God lays His people under an obligation to them, because they
sojourned in their land. For it was barbarous and inhospitable cruelty in them
to oppress the wretched fugitives who had trusted to their good faith. But God
here refers to their first reception; as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
52:4, where, comparing the Egyptians with the Assyrians, He says that the latter
oppressed them like robbers, whilst the former had ruled over them not without a
cause, because the people had gone down thither of their own accord. Although,
therefore, the Israelites had been unworthily oppressed by their fierce tyranny,
still God would have their old kindness acknowledged; since their dearth and
famine had been relieved, and the refugees were kindly received, when the
inhabitants of Canaan were perishing of hunger.</font><br></div>

against idolaters, to which apostates had been before condemned; and thus either
transgression is declared a capital crime. Hence we gather that it is accounted
before God no less weighty a sin to violate His worship by gross and impure
superstitions, than openly and professedly to fall away from religion
altogether. Thus in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262039&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:39, He bids farewell to the Jews,<i> </i>and as it were emancipates them,
that they may go every one after his idols, when they are no longer contented
with Him alone. Whilst God, however, is so rigid an exactor of punishment, He
would not have judgment pronounced precipitately. These are tokens of severity,
that a woman as well as a man is to be slain; that the whole people should unite
in stoning them; that the evil should be removed from the midst of the land,
lest the abomination should continue unpunished. On the other hand moderation is
to be observed, since diligent inquiry is to be made, nor is sentence to be
pronounced unless the matter is fully proved; and again, that the trial may be
lawful, the accusation of one man is not to convict the accused. God therefore
would not have the judges, under pretext of zeal, shed blood inconsiderately;
but only, after mature inquiry, the criminal was to be punished in proportion to
his transgression. By <i>synecdoche </i>he speaks of their cities under the name
of "gates,"<i> </i>and alludes to the land having been "given"<i> </i>them, that
they might not shew their want of gratitude to God by profaning it. He marks too
the heinous nature of the offense, by calling it the "transgressing<i> </i>of
God's covenant;" as much as to say that all who go aside unto idols are
covenant-breakers. For the thief, and the fornicator, and the drunkard, and such
like transgress the Law indeed, but still are not placed in this category. In
fine, it is not simple impiety which is here punished, but the perfidy whereby
true religion is forsaken, after men have devoted themselves to God, and
professed themselves to be of the number of His people. The repetition of the
words "that man or that woman," more fully confirms what I have said, viz., that
although the weakness of the female sex may extenuate their guilt, yet must they
not be pardoned in such a case as this, where God's worship is directly
violated. Although mention is only made of the sun, and moon, and stars, the
same thing applies to images also; nay, inasmuch as it is baser to transfer
God's honor to dead stones or stocks, than to those constellations in which
something divine shines forth, so much more detestable are they who plunge
themselves into such stupidity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>

f307</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>diligently.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Although this moderation here refers only to the present matter, yet should
it always be maintained in judicial proceedings, lest innocent persons should be
treated with undue severity. Again, we must remember what I have said elsewhere,
that judges are here not only restrained from precipitate condemnation, but also
stimulated to beware of passing over, in idleness or negligence, anything that
was necessary to be known. For they often fail in their duty, because they
wilfully connive at guilt; and thus that which would be manifest if they would
be at the pains to make more diligent inquiry, does not come to light. God,
then, would not have them slumber nor take no notice of sinister reports, but
rather inquire diligently as to things which may have come to their cars, so
that no crime may remain unpunished. The same is the case as to witnesses; for
whilst it would be unjust to pronounce sentence on the testimony of one man,
still, if two or three will not suffice, there would be no end to litigation.
Fitly, then, has God prescribed to judges both that they shall not be rashly
credulous, and yet that they shall be content with the lawful number of
witnesses; but this point will be more largely treated of elsewhere in
commenting both on the Sixth and Ninth
Commandments.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The hands of the witnesses
shall be first.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was not without
reason that God would have criminals put to death by the hand of those by whose
testimony they were condemned. The ancient people did not employ public
executioners, that there might be more solemnity, modesty, and reverence in the
infliction of punishments. This office he peculiarly enjoins upon the witnesses,
because the tongue of many is too hasty, not to say worse of it, so that they do
not hesitate to stab people verbally, when they would not dare to lay a finger
upon them. This, then, was an excellent remedy for the repression of light
accusations, not to admit the testimony of any, whose hand was not prepared to
execute the sentence. Stoning was indeed a sad and horrible kind of punishment;
but it is probable that God made choice of it because it required the
application of many hands. If hanging had not been in use, God would have
commanded in vain that the corpse of a man who had been hanged should be taken
down from the tree before sunset.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
21:23.) There were, therefore, other kinds of capital punishment; but when the
land was to be purged, as by a propitiation, by the death of the sinner, he was
to be stoned by the hands of the whole people, since it would have been cruel
for him to be slain by a lingering death, which would have been the case if they
had stoned him one after another. The reason why the people were commanded to
cast the stones with one consent was, that they might give proof of their zeal,
and manifest their great indignation that God's worship had been
violated.</font><br></div>

reverence, He forbids its being taken in vain, especially in oaths. Whence we
infer on the other hand an affirmative commandment, that every oath should be a
testimony of true piety, whereby the majesty of God Himself should obtain its
proper glory. Moreover, it is clear that not only when we swear by God, His name
is to be reverently honored, but whenever mention of it is made. Thus in these
words He maintains His holiness not only in His word, but also in His works,
against all profane contempt of it. We shall soon see that to swear by God's
name is a species or part of religious worship, and this is manifest too from
the words of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:23; for when he predicts that all nations shall devote themselves to pure

f308</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Now, if the bowing of the knees
be a token of adoration, this swearing which is connected with it is equivalent
to an acknowledgment that He is God. Since, then, reason dictates that the

by God's <i>name, </i>and by the adverb

Jehovah,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f309</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if God's majesty were confined to
letters or syllables; but, whereas His essence is invisible, His name is set
before us as an image, in so far as God manifests Himself to us, and is
distinctly made known to us by His own marks, just as men are each by his own
name. On this ground Christ teaches that God's name is comprehended<i> </i>in
the heavens,<i> </i>the earth, the temple, the altar,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400534&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:34,) because His glory is conspicuous in them. Consequently, God's name is
profaned whenever any detraction is made from His supreme wisdom, infinite
power, justice, truth, clemency, and rectitude. If a shorter definition be
preferred, let us say that His name is what Paul calls
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;

only when any one abuses it by perjury, but when it is lightly and
disrespectfully adduced in proof of frivolous and trifling matters: I speak with
respect to oaths. In this, however, man's ingratitude is very gross, that when
God grants them His name, as if at their entreaty, to put an end to their
strifes and to be a pledge of their truth, still it flies promiscuously from
their mouths not without manifest disrespect. God will again condemn perjury in
the Fifth Commandment of the Second Table, viz., in so far as it offends against
and violates charity by injuring our neighbors. The aim and object of this
Commandment is different,<i> i.e.,</i> that the honor due to God may be
unsullied; that we should only speak of Him religiously; that becoming
veneration of Him should be maintained among us. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aw&ccedil;l</font><font face="Palatino">,

shall see it used elsewhere; but since it often is equivalent to<i>

chinam, </i>which means gratuitously, or in vain, this exposition seems to be
most appropriate. In this, too, fuller and richer instruction is contained,
viz., that men should not drag in His name in light matters, as in sport or
derision of Him, which cannot be done without insulting and profaning it. And
thus the holiness of God's name, which preserves us in His fear and in true
piety, is contrasted with the particle

licentiousness in this respect, and to excuse or at least diminish the sin, the
slipperiness of the tongue is pleaded, its punishment is here denounced: that if
God's name is rashly exposed to reproach or contempt, He will avenge it. The
more hardened, therefore, in their licentiousness they may be, the less will be
their impunity; so far is depraved habit from diminishing the

the duties of the Second Table, and had previously forbidden men to deal
fraudulently with their neighbors, he still adds this sentence by way of
confirmation. It may, however, be inferred from the second clause of the verse
that He directly had regard to the glory of God when he says, <i>"Thou </i>shalt
not profane the name of thy God." For raging greediness after gain causes the
avaricious and rapacious man not only to defraud men, but to become insolent to
God Himself. Moses, therefore, although he is professedly condemning the
falsehood and deceit whereby our neighbors are injured, at the same time takes
occasion to introduce the declaration that we must beware lest, whilst
covetousness impels us to do wrong, injury should be done not only to men but to
God Himself also. The word used here, however, is not
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shau, </i>as before, but
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rq&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sheker, </i>which properly signifies deceitfulness; and therefore I have said
that it enjoins us to beware lest any one by his perjury should do any injury to
his neighbor; nevertheless, that this prohibition has direct reference to the
Third Commandment, since Moses especially insists on this point, that God's name
is profaned by perjury, and thus he not only inculcates integrity, but also has
regard to religion, that God's majesty may not be violated. The expression is
worthy of notice, "Thou shalt not <i>pollute </i>the name of God," because God,
who is eternal and immutable truth, cannot be more grossly insulted than by
being summoned as a witness to falsehood, which is assuredly a shameful and
wicked pollution. This was not regarded by the heathen, who, although they
pretended to reverence God's name in their oaths, yet made no scruple of
deceiving, if he whom they had promised deserved it. Thyestes in the poet says,
"I never have pledged my faith, nor do I pledge it to any faithless
person;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f310</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since his brother was a villain, he
considered that he lay under no valid obligation to him. This is as if God's
majesty were dependent upon men's deservings, so that it was allowable to call
Him to witness whilst we deal deceitfully. Let this, then, be our firm
conclusion, that in our oaths God is first to be regarded, whose holy name is
more precious than a hundred worlds.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make no mention of the name of

but that this declaration should be connected with the Third Commandment. Moses
explains that God's name is taken in vain and abused, if men swear by other
gods; for it is not lawful to refer the judgment of things unknown to any other
than the one true God. Consequently, the glory of the Deity is transferred to
those by whose name men swear. Therefore by the Prophet God pronounces a severe
denunciation, that He will destroy all those that swear by His name, and also by
Malcham,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;360105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
1:5,) since thus the Jews mixed Him up with their idol, and so profaned His
holiness. In sum, since by swearing we profess that He is our God, whom we
declare to be both the knower of our hearts and the judge of our souls, the true
God justly claims this honor for Himself alone, inasmuch as the glory of His
name is detracted from, not only if we speak less reverently than we should of
Him, but also if we associate with Him such as may usurp a part of His rights.
And this more clearly appears from the two passages which we have adduced from
Deuteronomy, wherein the people are commanded to swear by the name of the one
God, which is equivalent to rendering to His sacred name in our outward
profession of service the unmixed reverence which it
deserves.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou shalt vow a
vow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The rule of vowing also pertains to
the keeping of the Third Commandment, since, by vowing, men exercise themselves
in the sanctification of God's name, and to promise anything to God is a kind of
swearing. For what between men is called a covenant or agreement, with respect
to God is a vow; and therefore it may be fitly called a sacred engagement, which
not only is made with God as its witness, but which is contracted with God
Himself. We have elsewhere cursorily touched upon certain oaths, such as that of
the Nazarites; but since that consecration was a part of God's worship, I have
placed it under the First Commandment. Nor indeed did Moses there treat directly
of the obligation itself of the vow, but of that exercise of piety which
stimulated the people to the pursuit of purity, sanctity, and sobriety. I have
followed the same course as to the free-will-offerings, which were certainly for
the most part votive, but I have considered what was the main thing in them
without much troubling myself as to what was accessory. But now under another
head Moses confirms what he taught before, that God's name was not to be taken
in vain; therefore he commands them to pay their vows, by withholding which the
glory of God's name is diminished, whilst He is Himself defrauded of His right,
and the promise ratified before Him is set at nought. Moreover, it is to be
observed that all the vows which were ever acceptable to God were testimonies of
gratitude, lest the recollection of His benefits should fail, forgetfulness of
which is too apt to steal over us. When, therefore, the saints were conscious of
tardiness or listlessness in proclaiming His goodness, they made use of this aid
and spur, as it were, to correct their sloth. Thus, when they asked anything of
importance from God, they were often accustomed to bind themselves by some
promise as a manifestation of their thankfulness. Such are the vows which Moses
commands to be solemnly and faithfully paid, that they might not cheat God when
they had escaped from peril or had obtained what they wished, whereas in their
anxiety they had been humbly suppliant. For we know with what facility or rather
levity many are hurried into making vows, who afterwards, with the same
fickleness, think little of breaking their
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On this point, then, God justly rescues
His name from contempt, and to this end demands that what has been promised to
Him should be paid. But inasmuch as superstitious persons apply this, or rather
wrest it indiscriminately to all vows, their error must be refuted, so that we
may understand the genuine meaning of Moses. The Papists would have all vows
kept without exception, because it is written, "Thou shalt not slack to pay
whatever hath passed your lips." But a definition of vows must first be given,
or at least we must see what vows are lawful and approved by God; for if all
vows must be effectually kept, however rashly made, of old under the Law it
would have been right to kill their sons and daughters, to erect altars to
idols, and thus under this pretext the whole Law of God would have been entirely
brought to nought. Wherefore a distinction between vows must be laid down,
unless we wish to confound right and wrong. This then is the first point, that
nothing can be properly vowed to God, except what we know to be pleasing to Him;
for if "to obey is better than sacrifice,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22,) nothing surely can be more absurd than to indulge ourselves in
the liberty of serving God, each according to his own fancy. If a Jew had vowed
that he would sacrifice a dog, it would have been sacrilege to pay that vow,
since it was forbidden by God's Law. But inasmuch as there is an intermediate
degree between that which God has expressly prescribed and forbidden, it might
be objected that it was allowable to make a vow in respect to things which are
called indifferent. My reply to this is, that since the principle ought always
to be maintained by the godly, that nothing is to be done without faith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:23,)it must ever be considered whether a thing is agreeable to God's word,
otherwise our zeal is
preposterous.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f312</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">God formerly did not forbid many
things which He still was not willing to have offered to Him in worship; and so
now-a-days, although it would be lawful not to taste meat all our lifelong,
still if any one should vow perpetual abstinence with respect to it, he would
act superstitiously; since he would inconsiderately obtrude upon God what we
gather from His word that He does not approve. Wherefore if all our vows are not
reduced to this rule, there will be nothing in them right and sure. Another very
gross error in the Papists may also be condemned, viz., that they foolishly
promise God more than they can pay. Assuredly it is more than blind arrogance,
nay, diabolical madness, that a mortal man should wish to present as if it were
his, what he has not received; as if any one should vow that he would not eat
during his whole life, or should renounce sleep and the necessary supports of
life, by common consent he would be convicted of madness. No gift, then, can be
acceptable to God, except what He in His goodness has conferred upon us. But
what is done in the Papacy? Monks, and nuns, and priests, bind themselves to
perpetual celibacy, and do not consider that continency is a special gift; and
thus whilst none of them has regard to the measure of his ability, they
wretchedly abandon themselves to ruin, or envelop themselves in deadly snares.
Besides, every one should consider his vocation. A monk will vow himself to his
abbot, and throw off the paternal yoke: another, who was adapted for the
transaction of public business, will abandon his children under cover of the
monastic vow, and thus acquire immunity, Hence it appears, that whether a vow
should be kept or not, is to be estimated from the character of him that vows.
But a more gross and more common error is committed in respect to the object of
vows. I said above that the godly never made vows to God, except in testimony of
gratitude; whereas almost all the vows of the superstitious are so many
fictitious acts of worship, having no other aim than to propitiate God by the
expiation of sin, or to acquire favor meritoriously. I will not pursue at length
those more detestable hallucinations whereby they defile themselves and their
vows, when they substitute their idols in God's place; as for instance, when a
man vows</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f313</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> an altar to Christopher or Barbara. To
sanction this barbarous impiety, this passage of Moses is alleged, which
certainly contains something quite different, viz., that those who vow to any
other being, pervert the worship of God; and in which also Moses takes it for
granted that a vow is not accounted legitimate, except what is made to God
Himself in accordance with the rules of religion and the prescription of the
Law. Thus in this exordium the doctrine is laid down, that guilt is incurred
unless what is promised is paid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if thou shalt forbear to
vow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms what he said, that they
would be guilty before God who have broken their promises to Him, because no
necessity compelled them to promise, and consequently that their guilt was
doubled, inasmuch as they chose rather to sin when it was at their option not to
vow. Thus Peter, reproving the faithlessness of Ananias and Sapphira,
says,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f314</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Who<i> </i>hath
compelled you to lie to the Holy Ghost? was not the field your own, which you
might have retained? but now to defraud God of part of the price, is impious
hypocrisy."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
5:4.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile God indirectly inculcates
sobriety in vowing, when He discharges them from it as a duty; as if He had
reminded them, that there was no reason why they should incur guilt by idly
promising what He does not require. And surely nothing is wiser than to be very
sparing of vows; since those who run into them inconsiderately, either presently
repent of them, or else pay them in a servile manner, as if it were a task to
which they are driven by force, and not without annoyance and disgust, and thus
destroy the grace of the act. As to the words, "that<i> </i>which is gone out of
thy lips," they do not refer to the ceremony, on which the Jew's as usual too
unscrupulously insist; but He puts a restraint by them on vowing, to which we
are of ourselves but too much inclined. Whence it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
66:13, 14,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I<i> </i>will go into
thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay these my vows, which my lips have
uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in
trouble;"</font><br><font face="Palatino">although the Prophet intimates that in
his sore straits he had always retained his composure and presence of mind, so
as expressly to implore God's help, and to manifest his constancy and confidence
by making vows, still it is signified at the same time that he did not
precipitately utter empty words, but spoke with serious reflection. And indeed
since the tongue of many is too voluble, and goes before their heart, the main
obligation of vows is not to be sought in the act of their utterance; but, to
make them truly complete, a mutual agreement is required between the heart and
tongue. The same expression will often occur again; and its repetition shews
that it is meant to remove the scruples of the weak,
lest</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f315</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as soon as any desire to vow shall have
entered their minds, they should fancy that it imposes a religious obligation.

priest was appointed who
should</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f316</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> first recite the words; by which
ceremony they were reminded that nothing is duly offered to God except He
Himself should dictate it, as it were. I allow that this reason was but little
considered by them; nevertheless, by their example, God would condemn all
levity, or inconsiderate fervor in sacred offerings.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this chapter Moses shews in
what manner and at what price what once has been offered is to be redeemed,
supposing that the vows cannot be conveniently paid. Now it is to be observed,
that among the ancient people there were two modes of consecration, the one by
<i>anathema, </i>which the Hebrews call
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem, </i>the other for the use of the temple, and other exercises of
religion. The <i>anathema
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> might be made of unclean animals, and
other unholy things, as we may see in respect to the city of Jericho, and
similar instances; but it was not properly allowable to make vows, except of a
clean man or animal, or something else which might be appropriated in the
service of God. Thus of their flocks they vowed goats and sheep; of their herds,
oxen or calves, that they might experience God's goodness in their fecundity. If
a person was aggrieved at being without offspring, in asking it of God he
offered in his vow his son, or daughter; on which ground Samuel, before he was
conceived in the womb, was dedicated to God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 1:22.) If any one had a weakly child born to him, or if one of his
children was very ill, or if he himself was in any difficulty, it was customary
to have resort to vows, that God might protect what was dedicated to Him. Nor
can it be doubted but that many abused this and fell into foolish practices; but
God tolerated these errors as long as they were not opposed to His Law.
Moreover, since it often happens that those who are under the obligation of a
vow change their minds, and are not very eager and ready to pay it, nay,
discharge it with much pain and unwillingness; God permitted that what was
promised might be redeemed at a certain price, in order that their offerings
might be voluntary. By the imposition of this ransom, which was of the nature of
a fine, rashness was punished, and future inconsideration prevented, so that
they might consider well what they were about before they made their vow, and
that it might not be disagreeable to them to stand by their promises. Besides,
it is to be remarked, that these vows were confirmed, not because they were
altogether pleasing to God, but lest the people should accustom themselves to
impious contempt of Him, if the deceiver might with impunity refuse God what he
had promised, Moses first treats of persons; and estimates a male at fifty
shekels of the sanctuary from twenty-five years of age to sixty; since this is
the best time of life in which a man's work is profitable. A woman he estimates
at thirty shekels; since for the most part less profit is made by a woman than a
man; and although it might occur that some women would be much more valuable
than men, since sometimes women are found to be industrious, prudent, discreet,
and strong to labor, whilst men are idle, dull, lazy, and weak, still a general
law must needs be given, for the examination would have been too difficult if
each individual was to be estimated according to their good qualities. God then
does not pay exact attention to the merits of each, but is contented with the
common calculation. He then lays down rules as to an earlier age, viz., from
five to twenty, and rates the male at twenty shekels, the female at ten. He
afterwards descends to infants, and appoints the price of a male from one month
to five years, at five shekels, and a female at three. Fourthly, he estimates
those who are more than sixty, the male at fifteen shekels, the female at ten;
since old age debilitates the vigor both of mind and body, and gradually
destroys it. In the fifth place, an exception is made lest the poor should be
burdened beyond their slender means, that the priest should diminish the price
as much as he saw fit. Still this diminution had reference also to the rich, if
the person to be redeemed was not worth the ordinary price, though it appears
that God here especially makes a provision for the poor from the words,
"according</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f318</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to what the hand of him that vowed shall
attain;" by which clause
Moses</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f319</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is wont to express poverty, or want,
because the poor and needy are not supplied with sufficient for their
desires.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if it be any unclean
beast.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now, in the second place,
treats of brute animals; which God commands to be sacrificed to Him, if they are
suitable for it, and does not suffer the vow to be altered. But if they be
imperfect or unclean, He lays down the rule for their redemption. But the
question here arises, How it can be allowable to vow what God had forbidden to
be offered to Him, and so had prohibited from being brought into the temple, as
being unclean? Surely if it had entered into any one's mind to sacrifice an
unclean animal, the superstition would be rejected, nay, there would be need of
expiation. But here, in my opinion, another kind of offering is adverted to,
which did not vitiate the sacrifices and service of God by being contrary to the
injunctions of His Law. There was therefore nothing strange in His accepting
such a vow, though He punishes its levity by a pecuniary fine. Besides, suppose
a strong and well-tried horse was in danger, his master made a vow that if it
were saved he would be bound to pay its price; and so also in the other cases.
To vow was nothing else than to commit to God's faithfulness and protection
whatever they wished to be preserved. Hence the too great commonness of vows,
which still it was necessary to discharge in some way, lest God's sacred name
should be exposed to ridicule. This estimation God left to the arbitration of
the priest. But if an animal might be offered in sacrifice, no redemption was
allowed; and if any one had substituted another animal, or paid the price of it,
he was punished for his fraud, for both (<i>i.e., </i>the animal, and its
substitute or price) were consecrated to God. The estimation, which is imposed
upon one who had vowed, is irreversible, since God simply commands the
Israelites to stand by the judgment of the priest, and to abide by the taxation,
as it is called, enjoined upon them as a fixed rule; and, besides, they were to
add a fifth part, as an additional fine, to the price appointed by the
priest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when a man shall sanctify
his house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A third kind of vows follows,
viz., the consecration of houses and lands; under which head also an alternative
is appointed, so that religion may not be despised, and still the just
possessors should not be driven from their houses, or the lands be rendered
useless from the want of cultivation. Those persons vowed their houses, who
sought of God for themselves and families that they might inhabit them in
health, and safety, and in general prosperity; and he who wished to obtain
fertility for his fields, vowed one of ten or twenty acres. Undoubtedly
superstitious prayers were sometimes mixed up with this exercise of piety, as if
they might acquire favor for themselves by making a bargain with God. Still,
inasmuch as the thing was not wrong in itself, God indulgently bore with the
errors which could not be very easily corrected, lest, in His hatred of them, He
might altogether abolish what was useful and laudable. Hence the redemption both
of house and land was permitted. But if any one had committed fraud in selling a
piece of land that was vowed, a heavier punishment is added, <i>i.e., </i>that
he should go without it for ever. We shall speak more fully elsewhere of the
year of jubilee.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f320</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At present this must be observed, that,
lest the partition of land made by Joshua should ever be altered, since God had
clearly shewn that it was done by His authority, God recalled each of the tribes
every fiftieth year to their original share, and thus entirely restored the
possessors whom poverty had driven out. In proportion, then, to the closeness or
remoteness of that year, since possession would be so much the shorter or
longer, land was cheap or dear. God does not here measure the fields by the pole
or chain, but estimates them simply, as among a rude people, by the seed; viz.,
if a field in sowing takes a
homer</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f321</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of barley, it shall remain in the hands
of its possessor if he pays fifty shekels of the sanctuary. We have elsewhere
seen that these were double the ordinary shekel. But since vows were often made
in the middle or towards the end of the jubilee, a distinction is stated; and
God commands the priests to take the time into consideration, and the nearer the
jubilee-year may be to diminish so much of the price. Where, however, a fraud
had taken place, God would not have the honest purchaser ejected; but, when the
jubilee was over, He assigned the field, which had been held for a time in
sacrilege, to the priests for ever. Moses compares this consecration to an
<i>anathema, </i>which the Hebrews call
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f322</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>a word whose radical meaning is
<i>destroying </i>or <i>abolishing; </i>for which reason the Latins take a
"devoted"<i> </i>thing in a bad sense, as what is destined to final destruction.
The law is then extended to lands which had been sold, and which, in the year of
jubilee, returned to their former owners; because the first allotment of the
land was then wholly restored. For these fields God commands a price to be paid,
upon a calculation of the time, so that only the produce and not the fee should
be taken into account.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, since people have
improperly and in foolish mimicry imitated the vows which God permitted to the
Jews under the Law, so the Pope, in providing for their redemption, has dared in
his diabolical arrogance to rival God. The <i>titulus
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f323</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is well-known in the Third Book of
Decretals; <i>"De</i> <i>voto, et ejus redemptione;" </i>wherein its concocter,
whoever he was, has so sought to impose upon the world with his shameless
nonsense, as not to hesitate to heap together directly contradictory sentences;
and even if there were no contradictions there, still nothing is laid down
except how votive pilgrimages are to be redeemed, which plainly appear from
Christ's declaration to be wrong since the preaching of the gospel.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:21.) And assuredly it was a marvellous fascination of the devil, that what was
said under the Law as to the payment of vows at Jerusalem, should be transferred
to Christians, when Christ had pronounced that the time had come when the true
worshippers without distinction of place should worship God everywhere in spirit
and in truth. If the hired
wranglers</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f324</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the Pope object that the same rule
obtains in the redemption of vows, since a remedy or mitigation must not be
denied, if any should be too burdensome or grievous, I answer, that men act
wickedly, when they wrest to themselves what God has reserved for His own
discretion; for neither under the Law of old was it allowable for a mortal man
to alter a vow, unless by His permission. If again they object, that the
judgment was given to the priests, here their folly is twice refuted; since they
cannot shew that they have been appointed judges; nor can they escape from the
accusation of temerity, since without any command they pronounce as to this
redemption of vows, whereas the priests of old advanced nothing except from
God's mouth, and according to the fixed rule here laid
down.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The exception as to the firstlings and the
tithes sufficiently proves that some vows were illicit, and such as God
repudiates; and therefore that they must not be made indiscriminately, for it
would have been a mere work of supererogation to vow to God what He had already
made His own; as we have shewn
elsewhere,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> where I have inserted this passage. With
respect to what is said of the <i>anathema, </i>it must not be understood
generally, since it was not lawful to subject a man to it, unless he were worthy
of death. This, then, must be restricted to their enemies, whom they were
otherwise at liberty to destroy; a notorious example of which was the city of
Jericho, with its inhabitants and spoils. Now, since whatever was brought under
this <i>anathema </i>was devoted and accursed, God would have it destroyed, nor
does He allow of any compensation. Wherefore they anathematized their fields I
do not understand, unless perhaps they wished to expiate some crime whereby
pollution was contracted.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses
spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses teaches in this chapter
that the vows which were made by persons who were not free, were not held good
before God; and although no mention is made of male children, still, as their
condition was the same, it seems that by <i>synecdoche </i>they must be included
with the daughters and wives, unless perhaps God chose to pay regard to the
weaker sex. But since He permits females, who were not under their father's
power, to make vows in spite of their sex, nor does He make it to be an excuse
for levity or thoughtlessness, it seems that the object proposed was, that the
right of the father over his children as well as of the husband over the wife,
should be maintained inviolate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a man vow a
vow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Wishing to modify the general law,
lest any one should think that there was any contradiction in this exception, he
begins by repeating the law itself, that every one should faithfully pay
whatever he had vowed; as much as to say,<i> </i>that this stands good, but that
he only refers to such as are their own masters; and that women or girls who are
under the power of another, were not free to make vows without the concurrence
of their fathers' or husbands' consent. This preface, however, must be
understood, as I have already pointed out, of lawful vows, whereby neither is
religion corrupted nor the holiness of God's name profaned. And assuredly,
unless what we offer is acceptable to God, there can be no obligation on the
conscience. Moreover, since there is here a distinction made between males and
females, it may be probably conjectured that boys of ten years old, although
still united with their family, are bound by their promises; and therefore I
will not pertinaciously contend about this, because it is better to leave
undecided whatever is doubtful, and <i>disputable, </i>as it is commonly called,
on either side.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a woman also
vow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now proceeds<i> </i>to the point
of which he proposed to treat, <i>i.e., </i>that vows made by persons who are
not their own masters do not hold good; and he mentions two cases. For, in the
<i>first </i>place, he teaches that if a daughter, whilst living with her
father, has vowed anything without his knowledge, it is of no force. He lays
down the same rule, if the father, hearing the vow, has disallowed it; but if he
has held his peace, it is declared that his silence is equivalent to consent.
Hence we gather that all those who are possessed of power do not do their duty
unless they frankly and discreetly express their opposition whenever anything
displeases them; since their connivance is a kind of tacit approbation. In the
<i>second </i>place, he treats of married women, whose vows, made in the absence
or with the disapproval of their husbands, he commands to be of none effect; but
if the husbands have known of them, and been silent, he obliges their
performance. For many deceptions might have thus arisen; since it is usual with
many when they wish to gratify their wives, to conceal their opinion for the
time, but, when the period of actual performance arrives, to elude what may have
been promised. But unless they use their privilege in proper time, God would
have them bear the punishment of their servile indulgence and dissimulation; but
because women are often urged to deceive by their levity and inconstancy, this
danger is also anticipated. It may also
happen</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that a woman, when subject to her
husband, may make a vow in the precipitate fervor of her zeal, and when he is
dead, may retract it under the specious pretext that she was not then free and
her own mistress; the same thing may occur when a divorced woman shall bind
herself, and then when she has married, shall appear to herself to be released.
Since instances of this wicked change of mind are too frequent, no wonder that
this special precaution should be added, to prevent frauds. Wherefore God
declares that the period when the vow was made is to be considered, so that they
are no less liable than as if their condition had remained the same. He
therefore condemns to the performance of their vow those women who have been
emancipated from their fathers' authority by marriage, and also who have been
set free by death or divorce; yet it appears from the last verse of the chapter,
that two exceptions, modifying the general law, are here peculiarly treated
of.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if her father disallow
her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The expression is remarkable,
"And<i> </i>the Lord shall forgive her," whereby Moses gently reproves the
foolish thoughtlessness of the girl; and soon afterwards the same thing is
spoken of married women. And surely their rashness is worthy of reprehension, if
unmindful of their condition, they, as it were, shake off the yoke and hastily
commit themselves. God therefore hints that they are not without blame; but lest
they should be tormented by secret remorse, He removes every scruple, declaring
that He will forgive, if the performance of the vow shall have been prevented in
any other quarter. When the dissent of the father or the husband is required on
the same day, it is tantamount to saying that what they have once approved of
cannot be disallowed. Further, to "hold his peace"<i> </i>to a wife or daughter,
signifies that he does not oppose, but give by silence a token of
consent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But every vow of a
widow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have stated why widows are
expressly named, viz., lest a woman should think that by a second marriage she
would escape, as being no longer free, and again under the yoke; since by such
subtle excuses people often extricate themselves. No other subject is referred
to down to the end of the last verse but one; for they have made a very gross
mistake, who interpret it as applying to a family and its
master.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f327</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The subject itself certainly does not
admit of such an explanation; and the words of Moses forbid it: so that it is
the more surprising that persons skilled in the Hebrew language have not seen
the matter clearly.</font><br></div>

clearly appears that the object of the Third Commandment was that God's holy
name should be honored with the respect and veneration which it deserves, since
the insult whereby it is violated is condemned to capital punishment. By the
expression "cursing," Moses<i> </i>designates all profane and impure words which
tend to brand it with dishonor; as if any one should accuse God either of
injustice or cruelty; or should assail Him with blasphemies; or designedly
detract from His glory either in anger or wantonness, since many, when
exasperated, launch forth horrible blasphemies, whilst others make a parade of
their audacity by scoffing at Him. The second verb, which is twice repeated in
the next verse,

<i>nakab,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f328</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means in Hebrew to hollow out or
perforate, and metaphorically to unfold, thus the Latins say that what is
thoroughly brought out is "enucleated." The source of the metaphor as applied to
contumely is not very dissimilar. The translation "he who shall have expressed,"
which some give, is lame; to me the word "transfix" seems to be very suitable in
the present passage, nor are the Latin phrases <i>proscindere </i>or <i>lacerate
</i>very different. As to the meaning there is tolerable agreement, <i>i.e.,
</i>that God would not have His holy name disrespectfully traduced; and
assuredly it is insupportably impious when the tongue of mortal man, which was
created<i> </i>to celebrate the praises of God, is employed in insulting Him.
The kind of death is also appointed, when He commands the offender to be stoned
by the whole people, so that all may learn from the sight that such a monster
should be annihilated as contaminating the earth. God also would prove the zeal
of His people, by calling them all forth in defense of His glory, and arming
them for vengeance. Moreover, He did not subject to this punishment the Jews
only, who professed to be His worshippers, but also strangers who were dwelling
in the land in the exercise of their business; viz., that they might more
severely punish the crime in His own servants who were less
excusable.</font><br></div>

Commandment is that believers should exercise themselves in the worship of God;
for we know how prone men are to fall into indifference, unless they have some
props to lean on or some stimulants to arouse them in maintaining their care and
zeal for religion. Under the Second Commandment we have already indeed made some
remarks on the outward profession of piety, and under the First also brief
mention has been made of some festivals, inasmuch as in the passover and the
offering of the first-fruits the people devoted themselves to God, as if by a
solemn repetition of the covenant. Many also of the ceremonies which we have
explained had an affinity to the Sabbath. Yet it is not without good cause that
God has appointed a special place to the Sabbath as well as to the other
festivals; and although there is a connection between the observance of the
Sabbath and the tabernacle with its sacrifices, and the priesthood itself, still
it was advisedly done that the festivals should be separately appointed, that by
their aid the people might be the more encouraged to maintain the unity of the
faith and to preserve the harmony of the Church. Meanwhile, the mutual
connection between the sanctuary and the Sabbath is evident from what has been
already said. God indeed would have it to be a notable symbol of distinction
between the Jews and heathen nations. Whence, too, the devil, in order to
asperse pure and holy religion with infamy, has often traduced the Jewish
Sabbath through froward tongues. But the better to shew what there is peculiar
in this Commandment, and what is its difference from the First, we must remember
the spiritual substance of the type; for not only did God prescribe certain days
for the holding of assemblies, in which the people might give attention to
sacrifices, prayers, and the celebration of His praise; but He placed before
their eyes as the perfection of sanctity that they should all cease from their
works. Surely God has no delight in idleness and sloth, and therefore there was
no importance in the simple cessation of the labors of their hands and feet;
nay, it would have been a childish superstition to rest with no other view than
to occupy their repose in the service of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Wherefore, lest we should make any
mistake in the meaning of this Commandment, it is well to remember its analogy
and conformity with the thing it signifies; <i>i.e., </i>that the Jews might
know that their lives could not be approved by God unless, by ceasing from their
own works, they should divest themselves of their reason, counsels, and all the
feelings and affections of the flesh. For they were not forbidden without
exception from the performance of every work, since they were required both to
circumcise their children, and to bring the victims into the court, and to offer
them in sacrifice on that day; but they were only called away from their own
works, that, as if dead to themselves and to the world, they might wholly devote
themselves to God. Wherefore, since God declares elsewhere by Moses, and again
by Ezekiel, that the Sabbath is a sign between Him and the Jews that He
sanctifies them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;263113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
31:13;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:12,) we must see what is the sum of this sanctification, viz., the death of
the flesh, when men deny themselves and renounce their earthly nature, so that
they may be ruled and guided by the Spirit of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although this is sufficiently plain, still
it will be worth while to confirm it by further statements. And first of all,
that this was a ceremonial precept, Paul clearly teaches, calling it a shadow of
these things, the body of which is only Christ.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:17.) But if the outward rest was nothing but a ceremony, the substance of
which must be sought in Christ, it now remains to be considered how Christ
actually exhibited what was then prefigured; and this the same Apostle declares,
when he states that "our old man is crucified with Christ,"<i> </i>and that we
are buried with Him, that His resurrection may be to us newness of life.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4.) It is to be gathered without doubt from many passages, that the keeping of
the Sabbath was a serious matter, since God inculcates no other commandment more
frequently, nor more strictly requires obedience to any; and again, when He
complains that He is despised, and that the Jews have fallen into extreme
ungodliness, He simply says that His "Sabbaths are polluted," as if religion
principally consisted in their observance.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:24;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:21; 22:8; 23:38.) Moreover, if there had not been some peculiar excellency in
the Sabbath,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f330</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it might have appeared to be an act of
atrocious injustice to command a man to be put to death for cutting wood upon
it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
15:32.) Wherefore it must be concluded that the substance of the Sabbath, which
Paul declares to be in Christ, must have been no ordinary good thing. Nor does
its excellency require much eulogium, since spiritual rest is nothing else than
the truly desirable and blessed death of man, which contains in it the life of
God, even as Paul glories that he is as it were dead, because Christ liveth in
him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:20.) The Apostle in the epistle to the Hebrews argues more subtilely, that
true rest is brought to us by the Gospel, and that it is rejected by
unbelievers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:3;) for although he mixes up some allegorical matter with it, he still retains
the genuine reason of the Commandment, viz., that we should rest from our works
"even as God from His."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:10.) On this ground Isaiah, when he reproves the hypocrites for insisting only
on the external ceremony of rest, accuses them of "finding their own pleasure"
on the Sabbath,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:13;) as much as to say, that the legitimate use of the Sabbath must be
supposed to be self-renunciation, since he is in fact accounted to cease from
his works who is not led by his own will nor indulges his own wishes, but who
suffers himself to be directed by the Spirit of God. And this emptying out of
self must proceed so far that the Sabbath is violated even by good works, so
long as we regard them as our own; for rightly does Augustin remark in the last
chapter of the 22d book, <i>De Civitate Dei,
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f331</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212; </i>"For even our good works
themselves, since they are understood to be rather His than ours, are thus
imputed to us for the attaining of that Sabbath, when we <i>are still and see
that He is God; </i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f332</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for, if we attribute them to
ourselves, they will be servile, whereas we are told as to the Sabbath,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not do any servile
work in it."</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">Next it is asked, why God
rather assigned every <i>seventh day </i>to the Sabbath rather than the <i>sixth
</i>or <i>tenth. </i>Because the number seven often represents perfection in
Scripture, some have thought that believers were thus reminded that they must
strive after perfect holiness with all their might, and not devote themselves to
God by halves only. Others elicit a different meaning from it, although not a
contrary one, that believers were taught that although they<i> </i>might be
sanctified and laboring in all sincerity to cease from their own life, still
some remainders of the flesh would continue in them, and therefore that through
the whole course of their life they must aspire to that holiness which no mortal
attains. I do not, however, doubt but that God created the world in six days and
rested on the seventh, that He might give a manifestation of the perfect
excellency of His works, and thus, proposing Himself as the model for our
imitation, He signifies that He calls His own people to the true goal of
felicity. Although a promise is included in this Commandment, yet will we
observe upon it separately, and as if by the way. He promises indeed that as He
blessed the seventh day and set it apart, so He will bless believers to sanctify
them. But the main point is the command, and the recital of the blessing is
equivalent to an exhortation to obedience, since otherwise it would be
inappropriately placed here amongst the Commandments of the Law. When I said
that the ordinance of rest was a type of a spiritual and far higher mystery, and
hence that this Commandment must be accounted ceremonial, I must not be supposed
to mean that it had no other different objects also. And certainly God took the
seventh day for His own and hallowed it, when the creation of the world was
finished, that He might keep His servants altogether free from every care, for
the consideration of the beauty, excellence, and fitness of His works. There is
indeed no moment which should be allowed to pass in which we are not attentive
to the consideration of the wisdom, power, goodness, and justice of God in His
admirable creation and government of the world; but, since our minds are fickle,
and apt therefore to be forgetful or distracted, God, in His indulgence
providing against our infirmities, separates one day from the rest, and commands
that it should be free from all earthly business and cares, so that nothing may
stand in the way of that holy occupation. On this ground He did not merely wish
that people should rest at home, but that they should meet in the sanctuary,
there to engage themselves in prayer and sacrifices, and to make progress in
religious knowledge through the interpretation of the Law. In this respect we
have an equal necessity for the Sabbath with the ancient people, so that on one
day we may be free, and thus the better prepared to learn and to testify our
faith. A third object of the Sabbath is also stated by Moses, but an accidental
one as it were, viz., that it may be a day of relaxation for servants. Since
this pertains to the rule of charity, it has not properly any place in the First
Table, and is therefore added by Moses as an extrinsic advantage, as will be
seen a little further on.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember the
Sabbath-day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>keep
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is used in Deuteronomy with the same meaning.
Hence we infer that it is no trifling matter here in question, since God
enforces the sanctity of the Sabbath by these two words, and exhorts the Jews to
its scrupulous observance, thus condemning carelessness about it as a
transgression. Moreover, when He says, "Six<i> </i>days shalt thou labor," He
indirectly reproves their ingratitude, if it should be irksome and disagreeable
to them, to devote one day out of the seven to God, when He in His generosity
gives up six to themselves. For he does not, as some have foolishly thought,
make a demand here for six days' labor; but by His very kindness entices them to
obedience, since He only claims a seventh part (of their time) for Himself
&#8212; as if He had said, Since you cannot be instant in seeking me with all
your affection and attention, at any rate give up to me some little undistracted
time. Therefore, He says, "all thy work," whereby He signifies that they have
plenty of time, exclusive of the Sabbath, for all their
business.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not do any
work.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That is, whatever could have been
finished yesterday, or postponed till to-morrow. (For
instance,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f333</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) it was not lawful for judges to give a
hearing to two litigants; but if any one had violently assaulted his neighbor,
it was allowable to prevent the injury, and to give relief to the unoffending
person; because the necessity of the case admitted of no delay. It was not
lawful to cook food for your guests; but if an ox or an ass had fallen into a
pit it was to be taken out, because aid would have been too late on the morrow.
For this reason Christ. declares that "the<i> </i>Sabbath was made for man, and
not man for the Sabbath,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;410227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
2:27,) since God does not require more than was useful or necessary for keeping
the people in the exercise of piety. Thus it would have been wicked to send out
an ox to pasture; but if an ox that tossed had got out, it was right to bring it
back to its stall, lest it should kill or injure those whom it
met.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy man-servant and thy
maid-servant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although it is added in
Deuteronomy that God had respect to equity, when He commands a relaxation from
labor to be given to the men and maid-servants, and the Israelites are called
upon to remember that they were once servants, that they may be more disposed to
act humanely, still we must bear in mind what I have stated, that the direct
object here was the honoring of the One God. We know that the whole race of
Abraham were consecrated to God, and that their servants were a kind of adjunct
to them, so that they were circumcised in common with themselves. And assuredly
it is very absurd that a man should encourage a profane contempt of God in the
family over which he presides, and in which he would be recognised as master.
The case of "strangers" was different, who were obliged to rest on the Sabbath,
although they remained uncircumcised;<i> </i>for he does not only refer to the
foreigners, who had subscribed to the Law, but also to the uncircumcised. If any
should object that they were improperly made partakers of the sacred sign
whereby God had bound His elect people to Himself, the reply is easy, that this
was not done for their sakes, but lest anything opposed to the Sabbath should
happen beneath the eyes of the Israelites; as we may understand more clearly
from the case of the oxen and asses. Surely God would never have required
spiritual service of brute animals; yet He ordained their repose as a lesson, so
that wherever the Israelites turned their eyes, they might be incited to the
observation of the Sabbath. Nor can we wonder at this, when in the general
mournings which were appointed for the deprecation of God's wrath, a fast was
imposed upon the brutes, that wretched men being admonished by the sight, might
feel the burden of their guilt the more, and by their voluntary serf-accusation
might prevent the judgment of God, and might be seriously dissatisfied with
themselves on account of those sins, whose punishment they saw to be imposed to
a certain degree upon innocent animals. Besides, if the very least liberty had
been conceded to them, they would have done many things to evade the Law in
their days of rest, by employing strangers and the cattle in their
work.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>

blessings which enhance the value of the Sabbath, although it is a portion of
the Second Table. And we know that this rude people required to be attracted by
every possible means to present cheerfully to God the worship due to Him. The
sum therefore is, that they were thus to testify not only their <i>piety
</i>towards God, but also their kindness towards their servants. I have already
shewn that their authority as masters was to be exercised in moderation by them,
if they were mindful of their former condition:, since they also had been
servants in Egypt. If any one should suppose that the argument does not hold
good, because; they were oppressed by cruel and dreadful tyranny, the reply is

dignity and excellency of the mystery, when God deemed an apparently light
transgression of it worthy of death. Still this was an act of by no means
excusable contempt, to overthrow professedly, as it were, what God would have to
be a mark of distinction between His people and heathen nations. The passages
which follow have the same tendency, which it would have been superfluous to
repeat, unless because the people were thus reminded that it was a matter of the
utmost importance. By prohibiting them from lighting a fire, He anticipates all
the glosses which they would have been ready enough to invent; for they would
have alleged that if the pot had been put on the fire the day before, the
Sabbath would not have been violated by lighting the fire. What, then, would
have been more allowable than anything else God excludes, viz., that they should
not employ themselves in the preparation of their food, or undertake any other
earthly work, however venial. When He calls it a "perpetual" or eternal
"covenant,"<i> </i>the Jews rest on it as a ground of their obstinacy, and
wantonly rave against Christ as a covenant-breaker, because He abrogated the
Sabbath. I will not contend with them as to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lwg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnolam, </i>which sometimes means a long time, and not perpetuity: I will
simply insist on the thing itself. Whatever<i> </i>was spoken of under the Law
as eternal, I maintain to have had reference to the new state of things which
came to pass at the coming of Christ; and thus the eternity of the Law must not
be extended beyond the fullness of time, when the truth of its shadows was
manifested, and God's covenant assumed a different form. If the Jews cry out
that what is perpetual, and what is temporary, are contraries to each other, we
must deny it in various respects, since assuredly what was peculiar to the Law
could not continue to exist beyond the day of Jesus Christ. Besides, the
Sabbath, although its external observation is not now in use, still remains
eternal in its reality, like circumcision. Thus the stability of both was best
confirmed by their abrogation; since, if God now required the same of
Christians, it would be putting a veil over the death and resurrection of His
Son; and hence the more carefully the Jews persevere in the keeping the
festival, the more do they derogate from its sanctity. But they calumniate us
falsely, as if we disregarded the Sabbath; because there is nothing which more
completely confirms its reality and substance than the abolition of its external
use. To this point also may my readers apply what I have written on Genesis
17,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f339</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> lest I should weary them in vain by my
prolixity; and again, in treating of the sacrifices, I have adverted to some
things which relate to the same doctrine. When, in Exodus 34, God especially
commands them to rest "in<i> </i>earing-time and
harvest,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f340</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is not as if He would let loose the
rein for the rest of the year; but He rather draws it tighter, since no
necessity must interrupt this sacred observance. Else it might have seemed a
just pretext, if, on account of continued rains, or other ungenial weather,
ploughing should be difficult, husbandmen were to be released from the
obligation of the law, lest their resting should have produced sterility. The
same opinion might have prevailed as to the ingathering of the harvest, lest it
should have been spoilt on the ground. God, however, allows of no dispensation;
but the Sabbath is to be observed, though at the risk of general
loss.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And six years shalt thou
sow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Another Sabbatical institution
(<i>Sabbathismus</i>)<i> </i>follows, viz., that of years, in reference to the
cultivation of the land; for as men and cattle rested on every seventh day, so
God prescribed that the earth should rest on the seventh year. According to the
fertility or barrenness of the soil, fields are fallowed every third or fourth
year, lest they should become altogether unproductive through exhaustion. Indeed
a soil can hardly be found of such fecundity as to be fitted for continual
productiveness. Some relaxation is therefore given, until the land recovers its
vigor; but this only pertains to wheat, barley, pease, beans, and other pulse,
and seeds. As to meadows and vineyards the state of things is different, since,
when meadows are mown every year, the fertility of the soil is not weakened;
whilst vines degenerate unless they are cultivated. It was a sign of
extraordinary and exceeding fertility that the land of Canaan could bear six
years' sowing following, without being worn out. God honored it with this
privilege in favor of His people; nor did He indeed ordain the rest from
necessity, since on the sixth year He doubled the power of His blessing; but in
order that the sanctity of the Sabbath might be everywhere conspicuous, and that
thus the children of Israel, as they looked upon the land, might be the more
encouraged to its observance. The nature of the rest was that they should not
sow anything, nor prune their vineyards in the sacred year; and if anything
should spring up from the scattered seeds of last harvest, it was the common
property of the inhabitants of the land and strangers, although He peculiarly
bestowed whatever grew of itself, whether corn or grapes, upon the poor, as a
kind of gratuitous present for the relief of their wants. And this kindness and
liberality was a kind of incidental adjunct to the performance of the religious
duty. It was not indeed mainly or chiefly God's purpose to give relief to the
poor, but, as we said before, there was nothing strange in it that the
offices<i> </i>of charity should be consequent upon God's
service.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If ungodly men should foolishly object
that there is no connection between the senseless soil and a spiritual mystery,
we have already answered, that although the Sabbath was deposited with believers
only as a pledge of an inestimable blessing, still tokens of it appeared both in
the flocks and herds, as well as in dead creatures, in order to renew the
recollection of it, lest the people should grow cold, and their devotion should
become languid. But if they mockingly persist that the Jews were finely dealt
with,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f341</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when in their highest privilege they had
asses and oxen, as well as the fields themselves, for companions; I answer, why
do they not apply the same scoff to a commoner matter? For since the doctrine of
salvation is committed to paper or parchment before it comes to us, why do they
not laugh with all their might at the obedience of our faith? since in our silly
credulity we embrace the promises transmitted to us by a stinking skin or some
other filthy material? God would have the observation of the Sabbath engraved on
all creatures, that wherever the Jews turned their eyes they might be kept up to
it. Why, then, should not the earth be a conspicuous and impressive sign
(<i>character</i>)<i> </i>for the rude inculcation of this doctrine? When it is
said, "What<i> </i>they leave the beasts of the field shall eat," the injunction
does not extend to wild and noxious animals which they might drive away from
their property; but God merely commands that whatever the earth produced should
be exposed promiscuously for the food both of man and beast. And this affords an
indirect answer to a question that might occur for God shews that the grass
would not be lost, although there should be no hay-making; for the grass would
be instead of hay for the beasts, so that they might feed abundantly in the
fields and meadows.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Another question, however,
arises from the passage in Leviticus, where God permits the owners of the land
and their families to gather for food whatever shall then grow of itself. But
there was nothing to prevent them, like the strangers, and anybody else, from
eating of the fruits which were common to all, provided they did not defraud the
poor by their
covetousness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f342</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The same thing is soon afterwards
added in the description of the Jubilee; for although that year, which completed
seven times seven years, was more holy than the rest, still God allows all to
eat in it the fruits grown of themselves. He speaks more restrictedly in Exodus,
in order to inculcate greater liberality upon them; but in Leviticus He shews
that there is no danger of any of the produce of the land being lost, because
permission is given both for themselves and their servants and cattle, besides
the hireling and the stranger, to partake of it. Where He says, "that<i>
</i>which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest," I understand it of the land
which they usually reaped; as also a little further on He calls their peculiar
right of ownership in their vines "their separation."
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f343</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although, therefore, the possessor might
boast that the property was his own, and consequently that the harvest should be
left entirely to himself, God reminds them that its fruits were nevertheless
common to all during the Sabbatical year. The word "harvest," therefore, is
applied to the land which was sown, and "separation"<i> </i>to the private
vineyard, or its fruit. The old interpreter has translated them "the grapes of
first-fruits." If it is preferred to adopt this sense, Moses would expressly
declare<i> </i>that no oblation of them conferred<i> </i>on the owners of the
property a right to claim as their own what grew in their vineyard (during the
year;)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f344</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> else it would have been a good excuse to
offer to God the first-fruits of the vintage, and under this pretext for the
Jews to contend that they had consecrated the whole produce in the first-fruits.
But God anticipates this gloss, by shewing that what was said respecting the
ordinary cultivation was improperly turned aside to the extraordinary year of
rest. But since the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryzan</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nazir, </i>means "separation," I do not see why we should change what accords
very well. Still commentators differ as to the meaning of this word; some
understand it "relinquishing," because every owner resigned his private
property, so that the vintage might be common. Others explain it as expressing
that they had abstained from its cultivation for that year. My own opinion,
however, as I have said, is simply that the peculiar right of the possessor is
called his "separation;"<i> </i>so that it was not lawful for others to touch
the vintage except in the Sabbatical year. Thus separation is opposed to common
fields free to the public.</font><br></div>

precepts, unless their distrust of Him is corrected, and will be always
ingenious in laying hold of pretexts for disobedience. The difficulty, however,
in this matter was a specious excuse for the Jews; for famine might have
destroyed them in these two years, since in the seventh year they neither sowed
nor reaped; and for reaping they were obliged to wait till the end of the eighth
year. Now, whence were they to get seed enough to sow after the land had rested
for a whole year? It is not without reason, then, that God delivers them from
this doubt, promising them that He will give such abundance in the sixth year as
shall suffice for the two following ones. The phrase must be observed, that God
would "command His blessing" in an especial manner, and beyond the usual course,
so that the land should be twice or thrice more fertile. Hence is suggested to
us no ordinary ground of confidence in asking for our daily bread. But this was
a special promise, that food should not fail the Jews on account of the
Sabbatical year; a manifestation of which God had already given in the desert,
when supplied a double portion of manna to those who gathered it on the day
before the Sabbath. Now-a-days this inconvenience is avoided by the industry of
farmers, who so divide their acres that the land should never lie fallow
altogether, but that one part should supply the deficiency of another. This
distribution did not obtain with the Jews. Therefore God relieved them from the
fear of famine down to the harvest of the eighth year; although He seems at the
same time to accustom them to frugality, lest they should waste in intemperance
and luxury what He afforded in sufficient abundance to last for two years. To
this precept He alludes, when He declares by the Prophets that the land
"enjoyed<i> </i>her Sabbaths," when it had vomited forth its inhabitants,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

the most illustrious Sabbath, since the state of the people, both as to their

had regard to the public good, gave relief to the poor, so that their liberty
should not be destroyed, and preserved also the order laid down by Himself;
still there is no question but that He thus added an additional stimulus to
incite the Jews to honor the Sabbath. For it was a kind of imposing memorial of
the sacred rest, to see slaves emancipated and become suddenly free; houses and
lands returning to their former possessors who had sold them; and in fine all
things assuming a new face. They called this year <i>Jobel, </i>from the sound
of the ram's horn, whereby liberty and the restitution of property were
proclaimed; but as I have said, its main feature was the solemnity which shewed
them to be separated from other nations to be a peculiar and holy nation to God;

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the feasts of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The other festivals which Moses
here enumerates have an affinity to the Sabbath. In the first place the Passover
is put, the mystery of which I have annexed, not without reason, to the First
Commandment, for its institution was there explained, inasmuch as it acted as a
restraint on the people from falling away to strange gods. In that rite they
were initiated to the service of God, that they might abandon all the
superstitions of the Gentiles, and acquiesce in the pure instruction of the Law.
The Passover, therefore, in itself was a supplement to the First Commandment;
yet the day recurring from year to year is fitly enumerated amongst the other
festivals. And surely it is plain that the Fourth Commandment had no other
object or use except to exercise the people in the service of God; but since the
killing of the lamb represented the grace of adoption whereby God had bound them
to Himself, it was necessary to annex it to the First Commandment. Let my
readers therefore now be content with the other part, i.e., that its annual
celebration was a help to the perpetual recollection by the Israelites of their
redemption.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye be come to the
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now lays down rules as to
the second day of festival, which was dedicated to the offering of the
first-fruits. The ceremony is described that they should deliver a handful into
the hand of the priest; though some think that the measure is signified which
was the tenth part of an <i>Ephah. </i>The word <i>Omer
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f345</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means both. But in this passage
the expression "handful" is most appropriate, since it represented in a lively
manner the beginning of the harvest; inasmuch as it was not lawful to taste even
of parched grain before the offering of the firstfruits. The priest lifted it up
before the altar, but with a waving motion; for thus the Hebrews distinguish
between the two modes,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f346</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmwrt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>therumah, </i>which was lifted up, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpwnt</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
thenuphah, </i>which is mentioned here, and which was waved towards the four
points of the compass, and then a sacrifice and libation were made. We know that
heathen nations</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f347</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> thus invented gods and goddesses
presiding over the fruits, so that the earth was the great and common mother of
gods and men. Into this error the Jews would have straightway fallen, or would
have gorged themselves without thinking about God, unless they had been reminded
by this ceremony that the Father of their subsistence was in heaven, whose
minister the earth was for providing their food. For since the whole harvest was
consecrated in the single handful, it was as if they had shewn that whatever the
earth produced altogether belonged to God. But thus the admirable goodness of
God was conspicuous, when, in claiming what was His own, He did not at all
diminish the food of the people; afterwards they received, as if from His hand,
whatever each individual had stored at home, just as though it had come out of
His sanctuary. Paul's statement is well known, "For if the first-fruit be holy,
the lump is also holy,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:16,) wherein he alludes to this ancient ceremony of the Law. The word which
they translate "unto<i> </i>your
acceptance,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f348</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is the same which interpreters elsewhere
render "good pleasure," and refer to the people, as if it were said, "at<i>
</i>your own will," or <i>"ad libitum," </i>as it is barbarously said. But I
have before shewn that it must be understood of the favor and good-will of God,
although it is transferred in a passive sense to the people, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:4,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ratson, </i>or the favor of the chosen people, means the gratuitous love
wherewith God regards His Church. But Moses signifies that the fruits of the
earth cannot otherwise be eaten with a clear conscience, because they would not
feel that God accepted them, and looked upon them with paternal affection. The
ceremony, now abolished, still remains in full force amongst us as regards its
substance, for nothing but the acknowledgment of God's bounty, which springs
from faith and thanksgiving, sanctifies whatever we receive of His
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next to the first-fruits comes the feast
of seven weeks, which the Greeks have rendered Pentecost, having reference to
the same object; for after they had offered the first-fruits from the standing
harvest, they added another token of gratitude in the shape of the loaves and
the greater sacrifice. It must however be observed, that the two loaves are
required of every family, and that they consist of two-tenths; but that the
sacrifices of seven lambs, one bullock, and two rams, and also of a goat and two
lambs, is enjoined upon the whole people. This is in fact the legitimate
acknowledgment of God's liberality, because the waving of the sheaf, as being
performed in haste, was but a trifling one; since we have seen that before they
touched the grain, God required that the first-fruits should be offered to Him,
until at leisure and in a more convenient season they might more fully discharge
their duty. Thus what we have above observed respecting the first-fruits, was
only a preparation for the day of Pentecost, on which the holy oblation was not
ears of wheat, but loaves made of the new
wheat.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the seventh month, in the
first day of the month.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I<i> </i>wonder
how it ever entered the mind of the
Jews</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f349</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that in the feast of trumpets the
deliverance of Isaac was commemorated, when a goat was substituted to be slain
in his stead;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f350</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but they have invented this with their
wonted audacity. Surely it is as baseless as it is unreasonable. Others more
rightly suppose that it was a preparation for the approaching feast of
atonement, on account of the slight interval of time; for since this day is
distinguished by no peculiar mark, it is probable that it ought not to be
separated from the other which follows soon afterwards, viz., on the tenth day.
Unless, perhaps, it is more probable that they were thus called together once a
year by the sound of trumpets, first of all, that they might learn that all
their sacred assemblies were appointed by the voice of God; and secondly, that
this His voice was thus renewed, that they might always be ready to obey Him.
And this seems to signify by the expression, "a<i> </i>memorial of blowing of
trumpets;" as if He had said that the trumpets sounded in their ears once a
year, that they might be attentive to God's voice throughout their lives, and
ever willing to follow whithersoever He should command them to go. Others think
that the trumpets sounded at the beginning of the month, that they might prepare
themselves for the three festivals, and also because this month was remarkable
both in the Sabbatical year and in the Jubilee. But what, if when God displaced
this month from being the beginning of the year to stand seventh, He chose to
leave it some traces of its original dignity? for by general consent it is
admitted that, until the people came out of Egypt, this was the first month.
Some even think that the world was created in it, which is not without probable
show of reason. And the Jews now also, in political matters and in things which
relate to this earthly life, retain this original computation in accordance with
unbroken custom: it is only in sacred matters that they commence the year in
March. This indeed seems to me the probable reason why, on the day now referred
to, God renewed the memory of His dominion by a solemn proclamation, and
assigned this seventh month both to the Jubilee and the Sabbatical
year.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f351</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The solemnity was completed in one day,
differing very little from an ordinary Sabbath, except by the trumpet-blowing
and the sacrifice,<i> </i>as is described in Numbers 29. For Moses there speaks
of more than he does here; he there<i> </i>enumerates a calf, a ram, seven
lambs, a goat for a sin-offering, with its accompaniments, besides the
burnt-offering of the new moon, and commands an offering to be made by fire of
them all. Here he speaks generally in a single
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>

accusation by means of expiation;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrpk</font><font face="Palatino">,
therefore, are atonements (<i>libationes</i>)<i> </i>for appeasing God; and the
word is used in the plural number, because they were not under the imputation of
a single kind of guilt, but had need of manifold reconciliations on account of
their many and various transgressions. This was indeed done both publicly<i>
</i>and privately throughout the rest of the year, for all the victims they
offered were so many satisfactions in order to obtain pardon and to reconcile
God. Still to these daily exercises was added also a yearly feast-day as a
special memorial, and as a sharper spur to repentance: for it was fit that they
should be stirred up to pious grief by solemn fasting and sacrifices, inasmuch
as they had provoked God's wrath against themselves through the whole year.
Therefore on this feast-day they were cited before His tribunal, in order that,
placing themselves there, they should acknowledge that they deserved this
judgment, and yet prayed that they might escape punishment; and this was the
object of the fast. Meanwhile they learnt from the sacrifices that they were
restored to His favor, since simple confession would have been only a ground for
despair. Thus, therefore, God required of them sorrow and other indications of
penitence, that on His part He might testify that He was duly appeased so as to
be propitious to them. The expression, "ye<i> </i>shall afflict your souls,"
here refers to the fast, which was required as an outward profession of
repentance. And assuredly there was no weight in the fast of itself, since God
plainly shews through Isaiah that He makes no account of hypocrites, who trust
that they appease him by fasting,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:3;) but being withdrawn from mere luxurious food and all delicacies, they
were reminded of their misery, so that being cast down by grief and humbled,
they might more ardently and zealously seek for the remedy. For remission of
sins is promised to none but those who, affected with serious sorrow, feel
themselves to be lost and miserable, and acknowledge<i> </i>and confess what
they have deserved. In this way a door is opened for imploring God's mercy.
Still it is not to be supposed that those who are thus dissatisfied with
themselves deserve pardon by their preparation for
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f352</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But since it would be contrary to God's
nature to embrace men with His favor who are plunged in their iniquities and
obstinate in sin; and again, since it would be most unreasonable that by His
clemency license to sin should be given under the pretext of impunity, it is
needful that penitence should precede our reconciliation to God. Whence also it
appears that He so pardons sinners as still to hate their sins, since He only
absolves those who voluntarily condemn themselves, nor admits any into His favor
except those who forsake their sins; not that any one perfectly renounces
himself or his sins, but through indulgence that penitence is acceptable to
God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f353</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which might justly be rejected on the
ground of its deficiencies. Whereby also what I have just said is confirmed,
that it is not on account of the merit of our penitence that God acquits us of
our sins; as if we redeemed ourselves from guilt and punishment by weeping,
sorrowing, and confession, whereas in the best of us all penitence will always
be found to be weak and imperfect. Wherefore the cause and the honor of our
pardon must only be ascribed to the gratuitous goodness of God. Hence I have
said that in their fast the Israelites professed their guilt and condemnation,
whilst they were expiated by the sacrifice, since there is no other means of
satisfaction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For whatsoever soul it be
that shall not be afflicted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence let
us learn how greatly the sacrifice of an afflicted and humbled heart pleases
God; since He commands so severe a punishment to be inflicted for the contempt
of this ceremony. And surely this would have been a proof of most gross
indifference, if, when God was inspiring men with the dread of His wrath, and
inviting them to tears, they should rest in security and ease, and give
themselves up to luxuries. On this account He declares with a terrible oath in
Isaiah, that will never pardon the Jews, to whom the hour of repentance never
came, but, when he reprovingly called upon them by His prophets to make haste
"to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth,"
merrily feasted and drank together, and said, "Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
22:12-14.) And no wonder, since this is the extreme height of impiety, to
stupify our consciences in brutal contumacy, and to rob God of His judicial
power. As long as the sinner is so far affected, and pricked by a sense of sins,
as anxiously to sigh for a remedy, there is some hope of his recovery; whilst he
who shakes off fear as well as shame, is in altogether a desperate state. Now,
since it was not without reason that God exercised His ancient people under the
Law with external rudiments, it was an act of profane and intolerable
carelessness to omit what was so necessary; and of still greater hardness of
heart purposely, as it were, to despise it, so that no one need wonder at the
severity of the punishment. In Numbers 29 the number of the victims is stated;
but I pass over this point, as not requiring to be
expounded.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fifteenth day of this
seventh month.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is shewn in the end of
the chapter why God instituted the Feast of Tabernacles, viz, that the children
of Israel might remember that they dwelt in tents in the desert, when they had
no certain dwelling-place,<i> </i>but, as it were, passed a wandering life. The
Passover shewed how they were marvellously rescued from immediate death by the
hand of God; but by this other day God magnified the continuous and daily flow
of His grace; for it would not have been enough to acknowledge His power in
their actual departure, and to give Him thanks for their momentary deliverance,
unless they reflected altogether on the progress of their perfect deliverance,
which they had experienced during forty years. In allusion to this the Prophet
Zechariah, when he is speaking of the second redemption, enjoins upon all the
nations which should be converted to God's worship, that they should go up every
year to celebrate this day.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;381416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
14:16.) And why this rather than the other festivals? because their return from
Babylon by a long and difficult journey, endangered by the violent assaults of
enemies, would be equally memorable with the passage of the people from Egypt
into the Promised Land. Hence we gather that, though the ceremony is now
abolished, yet its use still exists in spirit and in truth, in order that the
incomparable power and mercy of God should be constantly kept<i> </i>before our
eyes, when He has delivered us from darkness and from the deep abyss of death,
and has translated us into the heavenly life. But it behooved that the ancient
people in their ignorance should be thus exercised, that all from youth to old
age, going forth from their homes, should be brought, as it were, into the
actual circumstances, and in that spectacle should perceive what would have else
never sufficiently penetrated their minds; whilst at the same time they were
instructed for the time to come, that even in the land of Canaan they were to be
sojourners, since this is the condition prescribed to all the pious, and
children of God, that they should be strangers on earth, if they desire to be
inheritors of heaven. Especially, however, God would stir them up to gratitude,
that they might more highly estimate their quiet occupation of the Promised
Land, and the comfort of their houses, when they recollected that they were
brought hither by His hand out of the desert, and from the most wretched
destitution of all things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b>

offered sacrifices, of which a fuller account was elsewhere given. What,
therefore, Moses distinctly treats of in the book of Numbers, I have preferred
to introduce in another place, where I have spoken of the sacrifices in general.

interpreters, therefore, preserve the first etymology, translating it, "it is
the retaining or prohibition of God;"<i> </i>but since this meaning is somewhat
obscure, I have not hesitated to take it, as in other passages, for a solemnity;
for, without controversy, it sometimes means feast days, sometimes assemblies or
conventions. Let my readers, however, make choice of whichever sense they
prefer. After Moses has prescribed concerning the rest and the offerings, he
adds a caution, that there should be no diminution of the ordinary service; for
else they might, have transferred fraudulently the sacrifices, which they were
already obliged to offer, to the feast days, and thus, as the saying is, have
endeavored to whitewash two walls out of the same pot. Wherefore, at the
beginning of verse 39, the particle

between the peculiar service of this solemnity and the common rites which were

which the Law required every day, still they were not to fail in this
observance; and hence, that they must comply severally with both the general and
special command, if they would properly do their duty. Moreover, by reference to
the time, he shews that they ought to be cheerful in its performance, because
they would then incur but little loss, as the fruits would all be harvested; and
this is what he refers to when he says, "when ye have gathered in the fruit of
the land;" as if he had said, that he had regard to their convenience, since
otherwise they would have been at leisure at home; and thus he takes away all
excuse (for neglect.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.</b>

an eagle does her brood; but it was also an act of thanksgiving, because He had

been reasonable that they should go into the booths in sorrow and sadness, since
they represented visibly to them both the former and present goodness of God,

first place, it is to be observed that the principal ones, to which the greater
honor appertained, are here mentioned. Secondly, because the three holidays in
the seventh month were almost continuous, (it is
probable</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

lest they should be absent from their homes the whole month; for at the
beginning of the month the trumpets sounded, on the tenth day was the solemn
fast, and on the fifteenth they began to dwell in the booths. If the necessity
of remaining in Jerusalem had been imposed on all, so long a stay would have
been burdensome. But, if they chose to be present from the beginning to the end,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Observe the month
Abib.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For what purpose God instituted
the Passover, has already been shewn in the exposition of the First Commandment;
for since it was a symbol of redemption, and in that ceremony the people
exercised themselves in the pure worship of the One God, so as to acknowledge
Him to be their only Father, and to distinguish Him from all idols, I thought
that the actual slaying of the lamb should be introduced amongst the Supplements
to the First Commandment. It only remains for us to speak here of what relates
to the Sabbath. This then was the first solemn day, on which God would have His
people rest and go up to Jerusalem, forsaking all their business. But mention is
here made not only of the Paschal Lamb, but He also commands sheep and oxen to
be slain in the place which He should choose. In these words He signifies that
on that day a holy convocation was to be held; which is soon after more clearly
expressed, for I have already given the two intermediate verses in the
institution of the Passover itself, He therefore prohibits their slaying the
Passover apart in their own cities, but would have them all meet in the same
sanctuary. It has been elsewhere said that one altar was prescribed for them, as
if God would gather them under one banner for the preservation of concord and
the unity of the faith. What is added respecting the solemnity of the seventh
day is very appropriate to this
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seven weeks shalt thou
number.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It must be observed that the
Passover fell in a part of the year when the harvests were beginning to ripen;
and consequently the first-fruits, of which I treated under the First
Commandment, were then offered. Seven weeks afterwards they celebrated another
feast-day, which was called Pentecost, <i>i.e., </i>the fiftieth, by the Greeks.
There was just this number of days between the departure of the people and the
publication of the Law. Another offering of first-fruits was then made, in which
each one, according to his ability, and in proportion to the produce of the
year, consecrated a gift to God of the harvested fruits. In order that they
might be more ready and cheerful in their liberality, God's blessing is set
before them, as if Moses had commanded the people to testify their gratitude;
since whatever springs from the earth, is the mere bounty of God
Himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt
require.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>On another ground he exhorts
and excites them to willingness, because the service of God brings this
rejoicing; for there is nothing which ought more to stimulate us to obedience,
that when we know that God rather consults our good than seeks to obtain any
advantage from us. Ungodly men, indeed, rejoice also, nay, they are wanton and
intemperate in their joy; but since that joy is not only transient, but their
laughter is turned into weeping and gnashing of teeth, it is not without cause
that Moses here magnifies it as a peculiar blessing, to rejoice before God; as
if a father should invite his children to delight themselves together with him.
But by this external exercise, believers were reminded that there is no real or
desirable joy, unless in reference to God. And surely, however the wicked may
exult in their pleasures, and abandon themselves to gratifcations, still, since
tranquillity of conscience, which alone brings true rejoicing, is wanting to
them, they do not enjoy the merriment into which they plunge themselves.
Finally, Moses amplifies by a comparison the good which they enjoyed in the
service of God, when he says, "And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman
in Egypt;" for that their present condition might be more pleasant to them, he
heightened its sweetness by the recollection of their most miserable captivity.
I have here neglected
Cicero's</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f360</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> very subtle distinction between the
words <i>gaudium </i>and <i>laetitia, </i>for unless I take both of them in a
good sense, I could not translate the Hebrew words, whereby God would express
how indulgently He deals with His children. Meanwhile, this passage contains an
exhortation to render thanks to God our
deliverer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt observe the feast of
tabernacles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Its first day was called
the day of In-gathering, (<i>collectionum</i>,)because the produce of the whole
year was then stored in their
granaries</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f361</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and provision cellars. Since, therefore,
they then rested from their rural labors, it was a convenient time of year for
the celebration of the festivals; for in order that they might more willingly go
up to Jerusalem, it was arranged by God, that it should be done with but little
expense and sacrifice of their domestic interests. Where our translation is,
"When Jehovah shall have blessed thee," it stands literally, "Because he shall
bless thee,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f362</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the sense is nearly the same; for
Moses assures them that, provided they devote their minds diligently and
faithfully to the service of God, they shall never want grounds for rejoicing,
since He will never interrupt the flow of His blessing. The end, therefore, of
the fifteenth verse, is not a mere command, but also a promise; as if he had
said, that, if they were not ungrateful, there was no fear but that God would
continually supply new cause for gladness; and these two clauses are to be taken
in connection, "God will bless thee, and, therefore, thou shalt only rejoice;"
for in this passage I willingly interpret thus
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f363
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ak. </i>It is indeed absurd to take it <i>adversatively. </i>It will not,
therefore, be improper to explain it <i>exclusively, </i>as if he said, that,
there should be no sorrow or anxiety, which should hinder them from the
performance of their pious duty; those who render it <i>"surely," </i>approach
also to this meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Three times in a
year.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have previously said that
although the other feast-days were not to be neglected, still, because God would
make some allowance for the infirmity of His people, the necessity of going up
to Jerusalem five times a year was not imposed upon them. Again, because only
half of the seventh month contained three feast-days, i.e., from the first to
the fifteenth, for the same reason it is only required of the males that they
should leave their houses and celebrate the sacred convocations; for thus the
females are spared, to whom traveling is not so convenient. Besides, through the
fecundity promised them by God, they were almost always either pregnant or
nursing. It is also certain that the boys and young men were excepted under the
age of twenty, since God includes under the term males only those who were
comprised in the census. If any object that in God's spiritual worship there is
no difference between males and females; the reply is easy, that the fathers of
families presented themselves there in the names of their wives and children: so
that the profession was extended to the other sex, and to those of tender age.
To this David seems to allude, when he
says:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f364</font></sup><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thy people shall come

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
110:3;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for, speaking of the free-will-offerings of the
people, he seeks an example of it, after the manner of the prophets, from the
legal worship. Lest the Jews should object that there was danger of hostile
invasion, if the land should be stripped of its defenses by the gathering
together of all the men into one place, God anticipates this doubt in Exodus 34,
promising that He will provide that no one shall desire to assail their forsaken
homes; for to this the sentence refers:
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cast out the nations
before thee, and enlarge thy borders, so that no man shall desire thy
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">," ver. 24.  Whence also we gather, that
God's worship was not entirely established until all the neighboring nations
were subdued, and He had placed His sanctuary in Mount Zion. Not that it was
allowable for the people to omit the feast-days before that time; but that
experience itself might teach them that God was wroth with them, whilst He
deprived them of this special blessing; for fear and alarm arose only from their
own fault. But let believers collect from hence the useful doctrine that,
whenever they are following God, they will be safe under His protection, since
it is in His power to repel the assaults of enemies, and everything that can
harm them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall not

f365</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I<i> </i>know not how it could have
entered the minds of some to suppose that God here promised that all should be
rich who should present themselves three times (a year) before His sanctuary:
whereas it is plain from the words of Moses that He requires from every one some
gift in token of their gratitude. And
perhaps</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f366</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> what historians relate respecting the
Persians, that none should dare to address the king without a gift, was a more
ancient custom, and common to other nations. God would indeed have a gift
presented Him by each individual, as a symbol or earnest of their subjection;
and, although this legal rite has ceased, yet its substance is to be retained,
viz., that those only are true servants of God who do not boastfully make a mere
empty profession, but effectually testify that they acknowledge Him as their
King.</font><br></div>

It is impossible not to be here reminded of Calvin's acquiescence in the
punishment of Servetus. In the principle he lays down, we have, as it were, his
final apology for the part he took in that matter. Any discussion of the
much-vexed question would here be out of place, but it may not be altogether
amiss to introduce the few following calm reflections from the pen of a very
able modern historian, M. de Felice &#8212; " 1. Servetus was not an ordinary
heretic; he was audaciously Pantheistic, and outraged the doctrine of all the
great Christian communions, by saying that God in three persons was a Cerberus
&#8212; a monster with three heads. 2. He had already been condemned to death by
the (Roman) Catholic Doctors at Vienna in Dauphine. 3. The matter was
adjudicated, not by Calvin, but by the magistrates of Geneva; and, if it be
objected that his opinion must have influenced their decision, it must be
remembered that the Councils of the other Reformed Cantons of Switzerland
unanimously approved of the sentence. 4. It was of supreme importance that the
Reformation should clearly separate its cause from that of an Infidel like
Servetus. The (Roman) Catholic Church, which now-a-days accuses Calvin of having
participated in his condemnation, would, in the sixteenth century, have much
more harshly accused him, if he had sought for his acquittal." &#8212;

"<i>Calvine </i>here hath a singular opinion by himself concerning the time of
erecting the tabernacle, with the parts and members thereof, which begin here to
be described; for he thinketh that the tabernacle was built and set up before
Moses had brought the first tables; and his reasons are these: &#8212; 1. There
is mention made of the tabernacle, 33-7<i>,</i> immediately after Moses was come
down with the tables in his hand, which he broke; and therefore the tabernacle
being presently after spoken of, must be made before. <i>Answer. </i>This was
not the great tabernacle which was afterwards made for God's service, for that
tabernacle was not set without the Host, as this was, but in the midst:
<i>Lippoman. </i>But it was Moses's tabernacle, whither the people had access to
consult with God. <i>Jun. </i>2. In this chapter it is said, verse 16, ' Thou
shalt put in the ark the testimony, which I shall give thee;' therefore he
received the testament before he made the ark, wherein he was to put it.
<i>Answer. </i>This followeth not, that the ark was therefore made first, but
that the form thereof was described first how it should be made, which was in
the Mount; after which form it was made after that Moses had received the tables
of the testimony. 3. When Moses cometh to exhort the people to build the
tabernacle, he maketh no mention at all of their apostasy and idolatry;
therefore it is evident, that they were yet sound, they had not yet committed
that sin, seeing they do so cheerfully consecrate their best things to the
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino">"<i>Answer.</i> &#8212; l. The people had
already received correction for their fault; and Moses, in sign of God's
indignation against them, had removed his tent from among them, 33-7; therefore
it cannot be said that no mention is made of their falling away. 2. The people,
such especially as were touched with remorse for their sin, did so much the more
shew themselves cheerful in God's service, as a sign of true repentance. 3. And
Moses having entreated the Lord for His people, would not be still harping upon
the same string, in upbraiding them with their fault, lest he might altogether
have discouraged them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>"Wherefore, </i>it is
very clear that the tabernacle was not erected and set up before the receiving
of the tables, but after; for these reasons: &#8212; 1. Because Moses is here
bidden to make the tabernacle according to all which the Lord should show him in
the Mount; but the form thereof was first showed him in the Mount, when he
continued there forty days and nights, in the end whereof he received the
tables, Deut. 9:10; therefore the tabernacle could not be made before the
fashion thereof was shewed to Moses. <i>Calvine </i>here answereth that divers
times before this Moses was in the Mount with God, when the fashion of the
tabernacle might be shewed him. But it is evident, 24:18, that this was done in
the forty days and nights, when Moses was entered into the cloud, and there so
long continued. 2. It is expressly said that the tabernacle was reared up in the
second year, and the first month, the first day, xl. 17. It was not then
dedicated and set in order only, as <i>Calvine </i>answereth, but then first set
up. And in the second year, in the second month, upon the twentieth day, they
removed from Sinai, which was about a month and a half after; but if the
tabernacle were built before Moses received the tables, he after the finishing
thereof was twice with the Lord, each time forty days; which could not be,
seeing about forty or fifty days after the tabernacle was erected, the whole
camp removed, as is said. 3. Besides, by this means a great part of Exodus shall
be transposed; all that followeth from chap. 35. to the end, concerning the
making and setting up of the tabernacle, should be in order placed before the
32, 33, and 34, chapters; this being admitted, that the tabernacle was first
erected, before Moses had the tables delivered to him. Therefore, rather the
order of the story is this: <i>first, </i>there is the description of the
tabernacle to chap. 30; <i>then  </i>followeth the let and impediment to the
building of it, the people's trans- gression, chap. 32-33; <i>thirdly, </i>the
execution of God's commandment, and framing of the tabernacle, chap. 35:40;
<i>fourthly, </i>the erection and setting of it up, chap. xl <i>Lyranus."</i>

Hengstenberg<i>,. Dissertations on the Pentateuch, </i>vol. 2. pp. 504-505,
briefly, but most satisfactorily, enumerates the objects of the Ceremonial Law
in reply to the deistical writers, who, like De Wette, <i>"</i>can<i> </i>find
out no rational basis for it<i>,</i>" and can form no other notion of these
pedantic regulations, this gnat-straining, as he calls it, than as the
production of a later priestcraft. <i>"</i>The<i> </i>best apology Hengstenberg
says)of the Ceremonial Law lies in pointing out its objects, and these,
therefore, we present to refute the charges brought against it: &#8212;
<i>First, </i>It served to cherish the religious sentiment. The Israelite was
reminded by it in all his relations, even the most insignificant and external,
of God; the thought of God was introduced into the very midst of the popular
life. <i>Secondly, </i>It required the recognition of sin, and thus called forth
the first thing essential for the reception of redemption, a sense of the need
of redemption. The people must be burdened and heavy-laden, in order that the
Lord might say to them, <i>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy, laden,
and I will give you rest. </i>The Law was, and was intended to be, a heavy yoke,
and therefore would awaken a longing after the Redeemer. Everywhere it
proclaimed, <i>Touch not, taste not, handle not! </i>and thus was a perpetual
remembrancer of sin. <i>Thirdly, </i>It served to separate Israel from the
heathen; it erected between the two a wall of separation, by which communication
was prevented. Compare
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14. Not yet strong enough to conquer heathenism, the people were, so to speak,
shut up, to be withdrawn from its influence, to preserve them for the time in
which, armed with power from on high, they might commence an offensive war
against it. The preliminary limitation effected by the Ceremonial Law served as
the means of the future illimitedness. <i>Fourthly, </i>Many things in the
Ceremonial Law served, by impressions on the senses, to awaken reverence for
holy things among a sensual people. The bad consequence of denying this is, that
it will then be necessary to impose a symbolic meaning on institutions, in which
evidently nothing of the kind is to be found. <i>Fifthly, </i>One principal
object of the Ceremonial Law lay in its symbolic meaning. The people, enthralled
in visible objects, were not yet capable of vitally appropriating supersensual
truth in words, the form most suited to their nature. It was needful for the
truth to condescend, to come down to their power of apprehension, to prepare
itself a body from visible things, in order to free the people from the bondage
of the visible. This form was common to the Israelitish religion with that of
the heathen, and therein lies its best apology. Would we rather not speak at all
to the dumb than make use of signs? The Ceremonial Law was not the opposite to
the worship of God in spirit and in truth, but only an imperfect form of the
same, a necessary preparation for it. The accommodation was only formal, one
which did not alter the essence, but only presented it in large capital letters
to children who could not yet read a small running-hand." - <i>Ryland's

<i>Gregorius </i>in <i>Gloss. Ord. "</i>The<i> </i>two cherubim are the two
Testaments. One of them stands on one end of the mercy-seat, and the other on
the other; because what the Old Testament begins to promise in prophecy
respecting the Incarnation of Christ, the New relates to be perfectly fulfilled.
They are made of very pure gold, because both Testaments are written with pure
and simple truth.They stretch out their wings and cover the oracles; because we
(who are God's oracles) are protected from imminent errors by the study of
sacred Scripture; and whilst we earnestly look at it, we are covered by its
wings from the mistakes of ignorance. They look towards one another with their
faces turned to the mercy-seat, because the Testaments differ in nothing, and
look mutually to each other; for what the one promises the other exhibits. And
they see the mercy-seat, <i>i.e., </i>the Mediator between God and men, placed
between them; for they would turn away their faces from each other, if the one
promised what the other denied." &#8212; See also <i>Bede </i>in <i>Gloss. Ord.,

"Particular stress is laid on the contrast, which the condition of the
Israelitish nation at that time presents to the splendor and speedy completion
of the tent. That tent was certainly splendid, but, in point of fact,
exceedingly simple in its construction. If we compare it with the monuments of
Egyptian architecture, its relative simplicity must strike us in a much greater
degree. As to the materials that were required for it, it admits of proof that
the Israelites might well have been possessed of them at that time. The
wilderness even might supply them with many of these things. With respect to
other things, the metals, precious stones, etc, we must keep in view the
condition of a people that had just come out of Egypt. History describes that
country as having mercantile transactions with Asia, even from the earliest
times. The people had acquired property, in part at least, in Egypt; the
description in Exodus 32, leaves us no doubt as to the possessions, and even
wealth, that they had gained there. They had not gone out of Egypt empty-handed,
but richly provided with silver and gold, 12:36. &#8212; "Havernick, Introd. to

<i>Fr</i>. The more common solution of this difficulty appears to be that
suggested by Maimonides, viz., that besides the 1000 cubits allotted to the
suburbs, 2000 more were added for fields and vineyards. Rosenmuller, however,
demurs to this interpretation, which he does not consider the text will bear. I
have translated <i>C</i>. word for word, but I believe his figures are wrong. It
is probable that his theory is the same as that of Corn. a Lapide, which he thus
more clearly propounds, "God seems here to comprise the city and its suburbs in
a circle, so that the center should be the city, and the circumference should
end at the distance of 1000 cubits on every side of the city walls. This circle
He divides into four triangles, each of which is <i>isosceles, i e., </i>it, has
its two sides equal, which are drawn from the center to the circumference. God,
therefore, here commands, that the suburbs on every side should be extended a
thousand cubits, and that the east side should be contained in two lines (each,
of course, of 1000 cubits) drawn from the city to the circumference of the
suburbs, which two lines comprehend that east side in the shape of a triangle;"
and so also with the other sides, "so that the two lines drawn to the
circumference of each side, which are the two equal sides of the triangle,
should together contain 2000
cubits."</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft200</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

"It is interesting to notice here, (says Bonar, in <i>loco,</i>)<i> </i>that
Outram, Witzius, and others, seem to have proved that in patriarchal ages every
man might offer his own sacrifice. The patriarchal ages were taught that every
man must take Christ for himself personally. In the Mosaic economy, however,
this is altered; there is another truth to be shewn forth. Any one
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 30:17) might kill the animal &#8212; any common Levite, or even the
offerer himself &#8212; for there may be many executioners of God's wrath. Earth
and hell were used in executing the Father's purpose toward the Prince of Life.
But there is only one appointed way for dispensing mercy, and therefore only
priests must engage in that act that signified the bestowal of pardon." He
appears, however, to be singular in his opinion that any but a Levite might kill
the
victim.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft251</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This word only occurs here, and in ver. 12, and chap. 8:20. <i>S.M.</i> says
that the Jewish expositors declare it to mean that fat, or network of fat which
is found upon the liver, and with which the severance (<i>locus
de-collationis</i>)<i> </i>of the head was covered, when the head was put upon
the fire. It is not easy to discover who may have said that it meant a
dissevered head. &#8212; <i>W</i>. "Some translate it (says Poole, <i>in
loco</i>)<i> </i>the <i>body, </i>or the <i>trunk of the body, </i>(whence,
perhaps, <i>C</i>.'s error.) So the ancient Hebrews quoted in Fagius; so
Vatablus, Grotius, Malvenda, Mercerus in

They appear, indeed, to have been manifold. "R. Salomon (says Corn. a Lapide,
<i>in loco</i>)<i> </i>understands by honey, sweet fruits, such as figs and
dates. Philo, <i>lib. de Vict., </i>thinks that honey was forbidden in the
sacrifices, because the bee is an impure animal, generated by the putrid
carcases of oxen." Oleaster gives as a reason that honey burns with an offensive
smell; and many commentators, because it was constantly offered in the Gentile
sacrifices.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft253</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Abundance of these may be found collected by Lorinus. Bonar says, "Observe that
all these portions of the animal are the richest; and also deep-seated, near the
heart. In an offering of thanks and fellowship, nothing was more appropriate
than to enjoin that the pieces presented should be those seated <i>deep within."
</i>The marginal deduction of Corn. a Lapide, is not very dissimilar: "Mystice,
adeps est devotio et intentio, quae in omni opere ad Deum est
dirigenda."</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft256</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>S.M.</i> says the word means, "a sin into which the perplexed mind has been
driven under the impulse of some passion, through thoughtlessness, imprudence,
or error, when inattentive to the dictates of reason and of the Spirit." &#8212;

The reference is to Book 3 of the Decretals of Gregory IX. He was Pope from 1227
to 1241; and these decretals form the fifth division of the Papal Canon Law. A
section of Book 3, technically styled Titulus 34, is headed "Concerning a vow
and its redemption;" and all the eleven chapters of this Titulus relate to the
commutation of vows to go on pilgrimage, or on a crusade. The portion especially
alluded to by <i>C</i>. in the above remarks was obviously ch. 7, which consists
of extracts from an answer of Pope Innocent III. to a Suffragan of the
Archbishop of Sens, who had taken a crusader's vow for the purpose of obtaining
access to the Count of Champagne, then in Palestine, and wanted to know whether
the Pope would sanction his staying at home, since he had heard that the Count
was dead. The Pope replies, that as the cause which had induced him to make his
vow no longer existed, he might stay in his diocese; but that he should send to
the holy land a sum equal to what would have been the cost of his going,
staying, and returning. The notes to the same chapter quote other parts of
Innocent's rescript, in which that Pope said, "Since the Word of God is now
fulfilled, saying, The hour shall come and now is, when neither in this mountain
nor in Jerusalem shall ye worship, etc., it may be seen, that not less in your
own Church than in the Eastern country, you may advance the deliverance of that
country by your pious prayers." &#8212; <i>Corpus Juris Canon. Lugd.  </i>1522,
