PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>VOLUME THIRD</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The derangement as to the order of the chapters first
occurs in this Volume. It is commonly thought that chapters 21, 24, and 27, were
delivered in the time of Zedekiah; while chapters 20, 22, 23, 25, and 26,
contain Prophecies delivered in the previous reign of Jehoiakim. The early
Versions and the <i>Targum </i>retain the same order with the <i>Hebrew,
</i>only there are derangements of another kind both in the <i>Septuagint
</i>and the <i>Arabic, </i>which commence at verse 14 of chapter 25, and
continue to the end of chapter 51: It hence appears that the disorder had taken
place early, before the Versions were made.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are a few particulars to which the Editor
wishes to draw the attention of Literary Readers, some of which have been
already noticed in the Notes appended to previous Volumes, though not perhaps so
fully specified as to attract attention; and there is one subject which belongs
especially to this Volume.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first thing is in reference to a Hebrew idiom;
and that with regard to the pronoun relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
who, which, whom. There is a peculiarity as to the use of this which has been
overlooked, as far as the writer knows, by Grammarians. It precedes in Hebrew,
as in other languages, the verb by which it is governed; but when it is not
governed in a transitive sense, a personal pronoun follows the verb with a
preposition prefixed to it, as, for instance, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:2,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;To<i> </i>whom the
word of the Lord came;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">which is literally, &#8220;Whom the word of the Lord
came to him.&#8221; &#8220;To him&#8221; and &#8220;whom&#8221;<i> </i>are the
same. It is an idiom, and the same exists in <i>Welsh, </i>which in many of its
peculiarities corresponds exactly with the Hebrew. This passage, and others of a
similar kind, are literally the same in that language, &#8220;Yr<i> </i>hwn y
daeth gair yr Arglwydd atto;&#8221;<i> </i>and the last word,
&#8220;atto,&#8221; the preposition being prefixed to the pronoun, and made, as
it were, one word, corresponds exactly with the Hebrew.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:10, these words &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Which (God&#8217;s
house) is called by my Name,&#8221; literally, &#8220;which<i> </i>my Name is
called on it;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">which means, <i>&#8220;on </i>which my Name is
called.&#8221; The following are similar examples: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Unto whom they
offer incense&#8221;<i> </i>literally, &#8220;whom they offer incense to
them,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
11:12;)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Against whom I
have pronounced;&#8221; literally, &#8220;whom I have pronounced against
them,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
18:8;)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Upon<i> </i>whose
roofs they have burned incense;&#8221;<i> </i>literally, &#8220;which<i>
</i>they have burned incense on their <i>roofs,</i>&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
19:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In all these instances the <i>Welsh </i>is literally
the <i>Hebrew. </i>The last example is rather remarkable, but the <i>Welsh
</i>is exactly the same, &#8220;y<i> </i>rhai yr arogldarthasant ar eu
pennau.&#8221; The verb, also, is similar, derived from the noun which means
incense, &#8220;they have incensed;&#8221; but the verb in <i>English </i>is not
so used. There is hardly a noun or a verb in <i>Hebrew </i>which the <i>Welsh
</i>cannot literally express &#8212; a peculiarity which neither <i>Latin
</i>nor <i>Greek </i>possesses, and perhaps no modern language. See also

<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be especially observed, as the point will
be hereafter referred to, that when the relative pronoun is governed by the verb
in a transitive sense, without a preposition, there is then no personal pronoun
added after the verb, either affixed to it or separately. This seems to be an
invariable rule, &#8212;</font><br></div>

deed or action, then the motive or what led to the deed &#8212; first, the later
event, then the former &#8212; first, what is most evident and visible, then
what is less ostensible and hidden. In all these instances, the order is the
reverse of what is commonly found in other writers.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Similar instances are found in the New Testament.
What is palpable and evident is stated first, then what leads to it, or the
source from which it comes; as when St. Paul mentions &#8220;rioting&#8221;
first, and then &#8220;drunkenness,&#8221; which leads to it; and
&#8220;strife&#8221;<i> </i>first, and then &#8220;envying,&#8221; from which it
proceeds.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:13.) In a like manner he puts &#8220;joy,&#8221; the higher and the most
manifest feeling, before &#8220;peace,&#8221; which is the source of it.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:13) In
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490623&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians

to. There are many passages which can be satisfactorily explained on no other
principle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b> THE ORDER IN WHICH SUBJECTS ARE OFTEN

then the &#8220;curse&#8221; is first described, and afterwards the
&#8220;blessing.&#8221; This mode of treating subjects is indeed so common that
it would be useless to multiply examples; and there are not a few instances of
the same kind in the New Testament.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE2B</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The THIRD subject is THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PASSAGE IN
THIS VOLUME, IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER, WHICH WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE NEXT.
&#8212; The two passages are
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:6, and 33:16. The doctrine involved is important; but our business is to
ascertain the real meaning according to the current diction of the language.
These passages are not rendered alike in our Version, nor in the same sense; and
yet it is evident from the context that the meaning of both passages must be the
same, though the words are in some measure different. However we may differ from
<i>Blayney, </i>he yet seems to have been at least so far right, as he renders
them both in the same sense. His versions are the following:
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And this is the
Name by which Jehovah shall call him, Our Righteousness.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
23:6.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And this is he
whom Jehovah shall call, Our Righteousness.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
23:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a Note on the last verse, it is said,
&#8220;This<i> </i>is the strict grammatical translation of the words of the
text.&#8221; There is no doubt but that it may be so rendered; and here is an
instance of what has been already observed as to the relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">.
It has often after the verb a personal pronoun with a preposition prefixed: and
as the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arq</font><font face="Palatino">,
whenever it means to name, has the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
after it, so it has here. The relative and the pronoun in this case always refer
to the same thing or person. Since this is the idiom of the language, it becomes
evident that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl</font><font face="Palatino">
in this verse, is a masculine according to Chaldee dialect, as <i>Blayney
</i>regards it, or a misprint for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wl</font><font face="Palatino">
according to three MSS.; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
with which it is connected, has,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hz</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8220;this&#8221; for its antecedent; and &#8220;this&#8221; is clearly the
&#8220;king&#8221; mentioned in the previous verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The matter then is so far clear as to construction of
this part of the verse; but whether &#8220;Jehovah&#8221;<i> </i>is the
nominative to the verb is another question; and this we shall presently
consider.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words in the other passage,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:6, are somewhat different. The word &#8220;Name&#8221; is in it; but it has
no personal pronoun with a
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
prefixed, which is ever the case when
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arq</font><font face="Palatino">
means to name, and when the word &#8220;name&#8221; is omitted. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:31;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;013518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
35:18;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;092328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 23:28;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;131107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 11:7;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
30:17. But when &#8220;name&#8221; is<i> </i>connected with the verb in this
sense, the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino"> is
not found. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:9; 29:35;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;130409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 4:9. This accounts for the absence of the pronoun with a
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
prefixed coming after the verb in this passage, which is found in the other in
which the word &#8220;name&#8221; is omitted. The
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
then here refers to the &#8220;name,&#8221; and stands as it were in its place;
and the literal rendering, if we adopt <i>Blayney&#8217;s </i>arrangement of the
words, would be as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And this <i>is </i>His
Name, which Jehovah shall call
it,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Our
Righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now there is a grammatical objection to this
rendering; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
as before mentioned, when governed by a verb in the objective <i>case, </i>is
never followed by a personal pronoun after the verb, either postfixed or
separately. But here the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino"> in
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">warqy</font><font face="Palatino">
is made a pronoun, wholly contrary to the usage of the language in such a case
as the present. The other passage may admit of <i>Blayney&#8217;s
</i>construction; but his version here is, as I conceive, inadmissible, being
ungrammatical; the verb is in the plural number and not in the singular, with an
affixed pronoun, therefore Jehovah cannot be its nominative
case.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may then be asked, how is the passage to be

is connected<i> </i>with

there is no preposition used; and as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">

after the verb; but this is necessary in the other passage, for the word
&#8220;name&#8221; is not given. Here we see a perfect consistency in the two
passages, though differently worded. Then the true version of this passage I
conceive to be the following, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And this is His
Name, which they shall
call,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jehovah our
Righteousness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in our language it might be rendered, &#8220;by
which they shall call <i>him&#8221; </i>The pronoun &#8220;they&#8221; refers to
Judah and Israel, at the beginning of the verse. As then
&#8220;Jehovah&#8221;<i> </i>cannot be here the nominative case to
&#8220;call,&#8221;<i> </i>there is no grammatical necessity to make it so in
the other passage, though there is nothing contrary to the usage of the language
in such a construction. The other passage may be rendered literally thus,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And this is
<i>He</i>, whom it shall be called on
Him,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jehovah our
Righteousness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words in the idiom of our language may be thus
correctly expressed, &#8220;who shall be called.&#8221; But however awkward and
even unintelligible the literal rendering may be in English, yet it is in
<i>Welsh </i>both expressive and elegant. The phrase is word for word the same,
and thoroughly idiomatic, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The paraphrase of the <i>Targum </i>is substantially
the same as to both places, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It appears then from all the Early Versions, except
the <i>Septuagint </i>as to the first passage, and from the <i>Targum, </i>that
&#8220;Jehovah&#8221;<i> </i>is not connected with the verb to call, but with
&#8220;righteousness;&#8221; and this, as we have seen, comports with what the
usage of the language requires. There can therefore be no reasonable doubt as to
the real meaning of these two passages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the peculiar idioms of the Hebrew language, the
<i>Septuagint </i>version of Jeremiah and of the minor prophets, is by no means
so satisfactory as the <i>Vulgate </i>and the <i>Syriac </i>versions. This is
what the Editor can testify after a minute examination.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah relates here what sort of reward he had
received for his prophecy, &#8212; that he had been smitten and cast into
prison, not by the king or by his courtiers, but by a priest who had the care of
the Temple. It was a grievous and bitter trial when God&#8217;s servant found
that he was thus cruelly treated by one of the sacred order, who was of the same
tribe, and his colleague; for the priests who were then in office had not been
without right appointed, for God had chosen them. As, then, their authority was
founded on the Law and on God&#8217;s inviolable decree, Jeremiah might well
have been much terrified; for this thought might have occurred to him, &#8212;
&#8220;What can be the purpose of God? for he has set priests of the tribe of
Levi over his Temple and over his whole people. Why, then, does he not rule them
by his Spirit? Why does he not render them fit for their
office?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why does he suffer his Temple, and the sacred office
which he so highly commends to us in his Law, to be thus profaned? or why, at
least, does he not stretch forth his hand to defend me, who am also a priest,
and sincerely engaged in my calling?&#8221; For we know that God commands in his
Law, as a proof that the priests had supreme power, that whosoever disobeyed
them should be put to death.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
17:12.) &#8220;Since, then, it was God&#8217;s will to endue the priests with so
much authority and power, why therefore did he not guide them by his grace, that
they might faithfully execute the office committed to
them?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor was Jeremiah alone moved and shaken by this
trial, but all who then truly worshipped God. Small, indeed, was the number of
the godly; but there was surely no one who was not astonished at such a
spectacle as this.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Pashur was not the chief priest, though he was of the
first order of priests; and it is probable that Immer, his father, was the high
priest, and that he was his vicar, acting in his stead as the ruler of the
Temple.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
However this may have been, he was no doubt superior, not only to the Levites,
but also to the other priests of his order. Now this person, being of the same
order and family, rose up against Jeremiah, and not only condemned in words a
fellow-priest, but treated him outrageously, for he smote the Prophet. This was
unworthy of his station, and contrary to the rights of sacred fellowship; for if
the cause of Jeremiah was bad, yet a priest ought to have pursued a milder
course; he might have cast him into prison, that if found guilty, he might
afterwards be condemned. But to smite him was not the act of a priest, but of a
tyrant, of a ruffian, or of a furious man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence learn in what a disorder things were at
that time; for in a well-ordered community the judge does not leap from his
tribunal in order to strike a man, though he might deserve a hundred deaths, as
regard ought to be had to what is lawful. Now, if a judge, whom God has armed
with the sword, ought not thus to give vent to his wrath and without discretion
use the sword, it is surely a thing wholly inconsistent with the office of a
priest. Then the state of things must have been then in very great disorder,
when a priest thus disgraced himself. And from his precipitant rage we may also
gather that good men were then very few. He had been chosen to preside over the
Temple; he must then have excelled others not only as to his station, but also
in public esteem and in the possession of some kind of virtues. But we see how
he was led away by the evil spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things we ought carefully to consider, for it
happens sometimes that great commotions arise in the Church of God, and those
who ought to be moderators are often carried away by a blind and, as it were, a
furious zeal. We may then stumble, and our faith may wholly fail us, except such
an example as this affords us aid, which shews clearly that the faithful were
formerly tried and had their faith exercised by similar contests. It is not then
uselessly said that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pashur smote
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Had he struck one of the
common people, it would have been more endurable, though in that case it would
have been an act wholly unworthy of his office; but when he treated insolently
the servant of God, and one who had for a long time discharged the prophetic
office, it was far less excusable. This circumstance, then, ought to be noticed
by us, that the priest dared to strike the Prophet of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows that Jeremiah was cast by him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we must notice this, that he
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the words of Jeremiah before he became
infuriated against him. He ought, doubtless, to have been moved by such a
prophecy; but he became mad and so audacious as to smite God&#8217;s Prophet. It
hence appears how great is the stupidity of those who have once become so
hardened as to despise God; for even the worst of men are terrified when
God&#8217;s judgment is announced. But Pashur heard Jeremiah proclaiming the
evil that was near at hand; and yet the denunciation had no other effect on him
but to render him worse. As, then, he thus violently assailed God&#8217;s
Prophet, after having heard his words, it is evident that he was blinded by a
rage wholly diabolical. We also see that the despisers of God blend light with
darkness, for Pashur covered his impiety with a cloak, and hence cast Jeremiah
into prison; for in this way he shewed that he wished to know the state of the
case, as he brought him out of prison the following day. Thus the ungodly ever
try to make coverings for their impiety; but they never succeed. The hypocrisy
of Pashur was very gross when he cast Jeremiah into prison, in order that he
might afterwards call him to defend his cause, for he had already smitten him.
This great insolence, then, took away every <i>pretense </i>for justice. It was
therefore extremely frivolous for Pashur to have recourse afterwards to some
form of trial for deciding the case.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tkphm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mephicat, </i>is rendered by some, fetter; and by others, stocks; and they
think it to be a piece of wood, with one hole to confine the neck, and another
the feet. But I know not whether this is suitable here, for Jeremiah says that
it was in the higher gate of Benjamin. This certainly could not be properly said
of fetters, or of chains, or of stocks. It then follows that it was a
prison.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He mentions the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gate of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as it belonged to that tribe;
for we know that a part of Jerusalem was inhabited by the Benjamites. They had
two gates, and this was the higher gate towards the east. He says that it was
opposite </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for besides the court there
were many small courts, as it is well known, around the Temple. It follows:

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">No doubt Pashur called other priests to examine the
case. It was, indeed, a specious pretense, for he seemed as though he did not
wish to condemn the holy Prophet hastily, or without hearing his defense. But
Jeremiah only says briefly that he was brought out of prison: we at the same
time gather that he was not dismissed, for he was summoned before Pashur to give
a reason for his prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here the Prophet shews that he was not cast down
or disheartened, though he had been most contemptuously treated; he bore
patiently the buffetings and stripes he had received, and also his
incarceration. We know that such outrages are so bitter to ingenuous minds, that
they can hardly sustain them. But Jeremiah teaches us, by his own example, that
our constancy and firmness ought not to be weakened though the whole world
loaded or almost overwhelmed us with reproaches. We ought, then, to understand
that courage of mind ought not to fail or be weakened in God&#8217;s servants,
however wickedly and contumeliously they may be treated by the world. For
Jeremiah, when he came out of prison, spoke more boldly than before; nor was he
beyond the reach of danger. Courage increases when one obtains the victory, and
he can then safely and securely insult his enemies; but Jeremiah was yet a
captive, though he had been brought out of prison, and he might have been
afterwards cast there again and treated more cruelly than before. But neither
the wrong he had received, nor the fear of new contumely, deterred him from
denouncing God&#8217;s judgment on the ungodly priest. Such magnanimity becomes
all God&#8217;s servants, so that they ought not to feel shame, nor grow soft,
nor be disheartened, when the world treats them with indignity and reproach;<i>
</i>nor ought they to fear any dangers, but advance courageously in the
discharge of their office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must in the second place be noticed, &#8212; that
God&#8217;s Prophet here closes his eyes to the splendor of the priestly office,
which otherwise might have hindered him to denounce God&#8217;s judgment,. And
this ought to be carefully observed; for we know the ungodly he hid under masks,
as the case is in the present day with the Pope and all his filthy clergy: for
what do they allege but the name of Catholic Church and perpetual priesthood and
apostolical dignity? Doubtless, Pashur was of the priestly order; but what the
Papacy is, the Scripture neither mentions nor teaches, except that it condemns
it as altogether filthy and abominable. And the Levitical priesthood, as I have
said, was founded on God&#8217;s Law; and yet Jeremiah, guided by the command of
God, hesitated not severely to reprove the priest and to treat him as he
deserved. It is, therefore, then only that we tightly and faithfully discharge
the prophetic office<i>, </i>when we shew no respect of persons, and disregard
those external masks by which the ungodly deceive the simple, and are haughty
towards God while they falsely pretend his
name.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE3</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah has called thy name not
Pashur, but terror on every side</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some
render the words, &#8220;Because there will be terror to thee on every
side;<i>&#8221; </i>but incorrectly, for in the next verse a reason is given
which explains what the Prophet means. Jeremiah<i> </i>no doubt had a regard to
the meaning of the word Pashur, otherwise it would have been unmeaning and even
foolish to say, &#8220;Thy name shall be called not Pashur, but terror on every
side.&#8221; Interpreters have expounded the word Pashur as meaning an
increasing prince, or one who extends power, deriving it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;p</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>peshe</i>,<i> </i>to increase, and transitively, to extend; and they add to
it the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sher, </i>which means a prince; and so they render it, a prince extending
power, or a prince who increases. But as there is some doubt as to the points, I
know not whether this etymology can be maintained. I am more inclined to derive
the word from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">j&ccedil;p</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>peshech, </i>to cut or break. It is indeed but once found in this sense in
Scripture, but often in the Chaldee language. However this may be, it is taken
in this sense once by Jeremiah in the third Chapter of
Lamentations.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And hence by a metaphor it means to open;
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aleph, </i>may be deemed quiescent in the second word, so that it means one
who breaks or opens the light. The words which follow &#8212; &#8220;terror on
every side&#8221; &#8212; induce and compel me to give this interpretation. He
does not say that he would be a terror on every side; but that terrors
surrounded him,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bybsm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesabib, </i>so that there was no escape. As then the name of Pashur was
honorable, signifying to open light, he mentions this, (it is indeed a metaphor,
by which breaking means opening:) as then he had this name, which means to bring
forth light, Jeremiah says, &#8220;Thou shalt be called a terror on every
side;&#8221; that is, a terror that so surrounds all that no escape is
possible.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see that the contrast is most suitable
between the opening of light and that terror which spread on every side, so that
there is no opening and no escape; and the explanation follows:</font><br></div>

<div><a name="p14"></a><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah explains more at
large why he said that Pashur would be terror on every side, even because he and
his friends would be in fear; for he would find himself overwhelmed by
God&#8217;s vengeance, and would become a spectacle to all others. In short,
Jeremiah means, that such would be God&#8217;s vengeance as would fill Pashur
and all others with fear; for Pashur himself would be constrained to acknowledge
God&#8217;s hand without being able to escape, and all others would also
perceive</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the same. He then became a
spectacle to<i> </i>himself and to others, because he could not, however
hardened he might have been, do otherwise than feel God&#8217;s vengeance; and
this became also apparent to all others.</font><br></div>

hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. He repeats what he had said;
for Pashur wished to be deemed the patron of the whole land, and especially of
the city Jerusalem. As, then, he had undertaken the cause of the people, as
though he was the patron and defender of them all, Jeremiah says, that all the
Jews would be taken captives, and not only so, but that something more grievous
was nigh at hand, for when the king of Babylon led them into exile, he would
also smite them with the sword, not indeed all; but we know that he severely
punished the king, his children, and the chief men, so that the lower orders on
account of their obscurity alone escaped; and those of this class who did
escape, because they were not noble nor renowned, were indebted to their own
humble condition. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, but amplifies what
he had said in order to confirm it. At the same time there is no doubt but that
Pashur was more exasperated when he heard these grievous threatenings; but it
was right thus to inflame more and more the fury of all the ungodly. Though,
then, they may a hundred times raise a clamor, we must not desist from freely
and boldly declaring the truth. This is the reason why the Prophet now more
fully describes the future calamity of the city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will give

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of this city and all its labor

is still more grievous, for what had been acquired with great labor was to be
given to plunder; for when any one becomes rich without labor, that is, when
riches come to one by inheritance, without any trouble or toil, he is not so
distressed when he happens to be deprived of his wealth; but he who has through
a whole life of labor obtained what he expects would be for the support of life,
this person grieves much more and becomes really distressed with anguish, when
enemies come and deprive and plunder him of all he possesses. There is therefore
no doubt but that &#8220;labor&#8221; is here mentioned, as in other parts of

<div><font face="Palatino">Now Jeremiah declares that Pashur himself would be a
proof, that he had truly foretold the destruction of the city and the desolation
of the whole land. He had indeed before exposed his vanity; but he now brings
the man himself before the public; for it was necessary to exhibit a remarkable
instance, that all might know that God&#8217;s judgment ought to have been
dreaded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though that impostor flattered the people, yet
Jeremiah says, that he and all his domestics would be led into captivity; that
is, that the whole family would be as it were a spectacle, so that all the Jews
might see that Pashur would be brought to nothing. &#8220;Let<i> </i>all the
Jews then know,&#8221; he seems to have said, &#8220;that he is a false
prophet.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what follows might have raised a question; for
Jeremiah declares as a punishment, that Pashur dying in Babylon would be buried
there; but he had said before, &#8220;I<i> </i>will give their carcasses for
meat to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the earth;&#8221;<i> </i>and
now it is not consistent in the Prophet to represent that as a punishment which
is reckoned as one of God&#8217;s favors. In answer to this, let it be
especially noticed, that God does not always punish the ungodly alike, or in the
same way. He would have some to be cast away unburied, as they were unworthy of
that common lot of humanity; but he would have others buried, but for a
different, purpose; for there is weight in the particle <i>there, </i>for
Babylon is put in contrast with the holy land. Whosoever were buried in the land
of Canaan, had even in their death a pledge of the eternal inheritance; for as
it is well known, God wished them while they lived so to enjoy the land, that
they might look forward to heaven. Hence burial in the land of Canaan was as it
were a visible mark or symbol of God&#8217;s adoption, as though all the
children of Abraham were gathered into his bosom until they arose into a blessed
and immortal life. Hence Pashur, by being buried in Babylon, became an outcast
from God&#8217;s Church; for it was in a manner a repudiation, as though God
would thus openly put on him a mark of infamy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected and said, that the same thing
happened to Daniel, and to some of the best servants of God, and that Jeremiah
himself was buried in Egypt, which was far worse; the answer we give is this,
&#8212; that temporal punishments which happen to the elect and God&#8217;s
children for their good do in a manner change their nature as to them; though,
indeed, it must be held, that all punishments are evidences of the wrath and
curse of God. Whatever evils then happen to us in this life ought to be regarded
as the fruits of sin, as though God thereby shewed himself openly to be
displeased with us. This is one thing. Then, when poverty, famine, diseases, and
exile, and even death itself, are viewed in themselves, we must always say that
they are the curses of God, that is, when they are regarded, as I have said, in
their own nature. But God consecrates these punishments as to his own children,
so they turn to their benefit, and thereby cease to be curses. Whenever then God
declares, &#8220;Thou shalt be unburied,&#8221; it is no wonder that this
dishonor should be deemed an evidence of his wrath and a proof of his curse. And
farther, whenever he formerly said thus, &#8220;Thou shalt be buried out of the
holy land,&#8221; it was also an evidence of his curse, that is, with regard to
the reprobate. At the same time God turned to good whatever might otherwise be a
curse to his elect; and hence Paul says, that all things turn out for good and
benefit to the faithful, who love God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, then, we understand why the Prophet says, that
Pashur would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>buried
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in Babylon; nor is there a doubt but that there
was more disgrace in that burial, than if his body was cast out and devoured by
wild beasts; for God intended to render him conspicuous, that all might for a
long time turn their eyes to him, according to what is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Slay<i> </i>them
not, O God, for thy people may forget them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then intended that the life and death of Pashur
should be a memorial, in order that the minds of the people might be more
impressed. At the same time, were the word burial taken in a wider sense, there
would be nothing wrong, as though it was said, &#8220;There<i> </i>shall his
carcass lie until it becomes putrified.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then Jeremiah adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou and thy friends to whom thou
hast prophesied
falsely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage teaches us that a
just reward is rendered to the ungodly who wish to be deceived, when they
sustain a twofold judgment from God. Behold, then, what all the wicked who seek
flatterers that promise them wonderful things, gain for themselves! they thus
earn for themselves a heavier vengeance. The more they strive to put afar off
God&#8217;s judgment, the more, no doubt, they increase and inflame it. This is
the reason why the Prophet denounces a special judgment on the friends of
Pashur, to whom he had prophesied; they had wilfully laid hold on those false
promises by which he had flattered them, so that they boldly despised God.
Since, then, they wished of their own accord to be thus deceived, it was right
that these deceptions through which they slandered the prophetic threatenings,
and which they usually set up as a shield against them, should bring on them a
heavier punishment. It then follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that these words were not spoken through
the prophetic Spirit, but that Jeremiah had uttered them inconsiderately through
the influence of a hasty impulse; as even the most eminent are sometimes carried
away by a hasty temper. They then suppose the Prophet, being overcome by a
temptation of this kind, made this complaint, to God, &#8220;What! Lord, I have
followed thee as a leader; but thou hast promised to me what I do not find: I
seem, then, to myself to be deceived.&#8221;<i> </i>Others give even a harsher
explanation, &#8212; that the Prophet had been deceived, according to what is
said elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>the Lord
have deceived that Prophet.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
14:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is no doubt but that his language is
ironical, when he says that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He assumes the character of his enemies, who boasted that he presumptuously
prophesied of the calamity and ruin of the city, as no such thing would take
place. The Prophet here declares that God was the author of his doctrine, and
that nothing could be alleged against him which would not be against God
himself; as though he had said that the Jews contended in vain, under the notion
that they contended with a mortal man; for they openly carried on war with God,
and like the giants furiously assailed heaven itself. He then says that he was
deceived,<i> </i>not that he thought so; for he was fully satisfied as to
himself; nor had he only the Spirit of God as a witness to his calling, but also
possessed in his heart a firm conviction of the truth he delivered. But as I
have already said, he relates the words of those who, by opposing his teaching,
denied that he was God&#8217;s servant, and gave him no credit as though he was
only an impostor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this mode of speaking is much more striking than
if he had said in plain terms, &#8220;Lord, I am not deceived, for I have only
obeyed thy command, and have received from thee whatever I have made public; nor
have I presumptuously obtruded myself, nor adulterated the truth of which thou
hast made me the herald: I have, then, faithfully discharged my office.&#8221;
If the Prophet had thus spoken, there would have been much less force in his
words than by exposing in the manner he does here the blasphemies of those who
dared to accuse God, and make him guilty by arraigning his servant as a false
prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand why he spoke ironically, and
freely expostulated with God, because he had been deceived by him; it was that
the Jews might know that they vomited forth reproaches, not against a mortal
man, but against God himself, who would become the avenger of so great an
insult.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to ask whether it became the Prophet to
make God thus his associate, the answer would be this, &#8212; that his cause
was so connected with God&#8217;s cause, that the union was inseparable; for
Jeremiah speaks not here as a private individual, much less as one of the common
people; but as he knew that his calling was approved by God, he hesitated not to
connect God with himself, so that the reproach might belong to both. God,
indeed, could not be separated from his own truth; for nothing would be left to
him, were he regarded as apart from his word. Hence a mere fiction is every idea
which men form of God in their minds, when they neglect that mirror in which he
has made himself known, Nay more, we ought to know that whatever power, majesty,
and glory there is in God, so shines forth in his word, that he does not appear
as God, except his word remains safe and uncorrupted. As, then, the Prophet had
been furnished with a sure commission, it is no wonder that he so boldly derides
his enemies and says, that God was a deceiver, if he had been deceived. To the
same purpose is what Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If an angel come
down from heaven and teach you another Gospel, let him be accursed.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
1:8)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Certainly Paul was inferior to the angels, and we
know that he was not so presumptuous as to draw down angels from heaven, and to
make them subservient to himself; no, by no means; but he did not regard what
they might be; but as he had the truth of the Gospel, of which he was the
herald, sealed in his heart, he hesitated not to raise that word above all
angels. So now Jeremiah says, that God was a deceiver, if he was deceived: how
so? because God would deny himself, if he destroyed the truth of his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive that the Prophet did not
exceed what was right, when he dared to elevate himself, so as to become in a
manner the associate of God, that is, as to the truth of which God was the
author and he the minister.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But from this passage a useful doctrine may be
gathered. All who go forth to teach ought to be so sure of their calling, as not
to hesitate to appeal to God&#8217;s tribunal whenever any dispute happens. It
is indeed true, that even the best servants of God may in some things be
mistaken, or be doubtful in their judgment; but as to their calling and doctrine
there ought to be that certainty which Jeremiah exhibits to us here by his own
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast constrained
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By saying that he had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he meant this, &#8212; &#8220;O<i> </i>God, if I am an impostor, thou hast
made me so; if I have deceived, thou hast led me; for I have derived from thee
all that I have; it hence follows, that thou art in fault, and less excusable
than I am, if there be anything wrong in me.&#8221;<i> </i>Afterwards, as I have
said, he enlarges on this, &#8212; that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>constrained
</i></font><font face="Palatino">him; for he had not coveted the prophetic
office, but being constrained, undertook it; for he could not have rejected or
cast off the burden laid on him. He then expresses two things, &#8212; that he
had brought no fancies of his own, nor invented anything of what he had said,
but had been the instrument of God&#8217;s Spirit, and delivered what he had
received as from hand to hand: this is one thing. And then he adds, &#8212; that
had he his free choice, he would not have undertaken the prophetic office; for
he had been drawn as it were by constraint to obey God in this respect. We now
then perceive the meaning of Jeremiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any to ask, whether it could be deemed
commendable in the Prophet thus constrainedly to undertake his office; to this
the plain answer is, &#8212; that a general rule is not here laid down, as
though it were necessary for all to be thus unwillingly drawn. But though
Jeremiah might not have been faultless in this respect., yet he might have
justly testified this before men. And we have seen at the beginning, that when
God appointed him a teacher to his Church, he refused as far as he could the
honor,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ah! Lord,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I know not how to
speak.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
1:6)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though then he was constrained by God&#8217;s
authority, and as it were, led by force, and though he may have shewed in this
respect that he was not free from fault or weakness; yet he might have rightly
pleaded this against his enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a scorn continually, and was
derided by all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet no doubt
tried here to find out whether any portion of the people was still reclaimable;
for to hear that God was charged with falsehood, that the Prophet&#8217;s office
was rendered void by the wilfulness and audacity of men, was much calculated to
rouse their minds. When, therefore, they heard this, they must surely have been
terrified, if they had a particle of true religion or of right knowledge. Hence
the Prophet wished to make the trial, whether there were any remaining who were
capable of being reclaimed. But his object also was to shew, that their
wickedness was inexpiable, if they continued wickedly and proudly to oppose his
doctrine.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE8</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we ought carefully to notice this; for this
passage has not only been written, that we may be instructed in the fear of God;
but the Holy Spirit continually proclaims against all despisers, and openly
accuses them, that they offer to God the atrocious insult of charging him with
falsehood and deception. Let us then know that a dreadful judgment is here
denounced on all those profane men who despise God&#8217;s word and treat it
with derision; for the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Jeremiah openly proclaims, as
I have said, before God&#8217;s tribunal, that God is made by them a liar. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says here that he found no fruit from his
labors, but on the contrary, he saw that all his efforts and endeavors had an
opposite effect; for they exasperated all the Jews, inflamed their rage, and
drove them into a greater licentiousness in sinning. Hence he says, that he
purposed to give up the office assigned to him, but that by a secret impulse he
was constrained to persevere, and that thus he was not at liberty to desist from
the course which he had begun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the verse is variously explained;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the time I spoke, I cried
violence aloud and proclaimed devastation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Thus some take the words, as though Jeremiah said, that since he began to
teach he uttered complaints; for he saw that he was violently assailed and was
exposed to all kinds of wrongs: but this view appears to me too frigid. Others
come nearer to the truth who consider him as saying, that he had not ceased to
cry against outrages and plunders, when he saw that all kinds of wickedness
prevailed among the people; as though he had said, &#8220;I<i> </i>could not
mildly and peaceably teach them, for their disposition and temper prevented me,
but their wickedness compelled me to treat them with severity, as all
God&#8217;s servants ought wisely to consider what the state of the Church
requires.&#8221; If indeed we should in tranquil times cry aloud, it would be
mad affectation; and this is what is done by many, who without thought and
without any reason always make a great cry; but when we see Satan reigning, we
ought not then to withhold nor to act as in a truce; but as it is an open war it
is necessary to cry aloud. They who take this view, then, understand that
Jeremiah cried aloud, because he saw that the people were refractory, and also
saw that things were so bad that they could not be restored to a right state
without the greatest sharpness and vehemence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I rather think that the Prophet had another kind
of trial, &#8212; that he brought down a greater vengeance of God by his cries,
as though he had said, &#8220;To<i> </i>what purpose should I furnish God with
weapons by my preaching? since I do nothing but increase his wrath, which will
at length fulminate and consume the whole land together with the people.&#8221;
He then says, that he cried violence and devastation aloud, for impiety itself
is a sort of hostile violence by which God is provoked. The meaning is, that the
Prophet saw no other fruit to his labor, but that men were rendered more
insolent, and from being thieves became robbers, and from being disdainful
became ruffians, so that they increasingly kindled God&#8217;s wrath, and more
fully abandoned themselves. This was indeed a most severe and dangerous trial;
it is therefore no wonder that the Prophet says, that it came to his mind to
turn aside from his office as a teacher.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage is especially worthy of being
observed; for not only teachers are influenced by this feeling, but all the
godly without exception. For when we see that men are, as it were, made worse
through God&#8217;s word, we begin to doubt whether it be expedient to bury
every remembrance of God and to extinguish his word, rather than to increase the
licentiousness of men, they being already inclined enough to commit sin. We
indeed see at this day that the doctrine of the Gospel does not restore all to
obedience; but many give themselves a more unbridled license, as though the yoke
of discipline was wholly removed. There was some fear under the Papacy, there
was some sort of obedience and subjection; and now the liberty of the Gospel,
what is it to many but brute license, so that they sin with impunity and blend
heaven and earth together. There are also others who, on observing so many
controversies, do, under that pretext, throw aside every concern for religion,
and every attention to it. There are some fanatics who allow themselves to doubt
and even to deny the existence of God. As then we see that the effect of the
truth is not such as might be wished, those who are otherwise firm must needs be
shaken or made to totter. Therefore, this passage ought the more to be noticed;
for Jeremiah confesses that he was sore troubled when he saw that the word of
God was a derision, and hence he wished to withdraw from the course of his
calling. Let us know that whenever such a thing comes into our minds we ought
manfully to resist it; and, therefore, the two things here mentioned ought to be
connected, for when he said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will no more mention him, nor speak in his
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the word of God was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like a burning
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how God restrained his servant, lest he
should fall headlong, or succumb under his temptation; for he would have been
suddenly drawn in as it were into a deep gulf, had he not been preserved by God.
Therefore, whenever temptations of this kind present themselves to us, let us
pray God to restrain and to support us; or if we have already fallen, let us
pray him to raise us up and to strengthen us by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the way is shewn by which God aided his servant:
The word of God became </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a
burning fire in his heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and it was
also </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>closed up in his
bones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that he was led by an ardent
zeal, and could not be himself without going onward in the course of his office.
He concludes by saying, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was
wearied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or could hardly bear himself,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
forbearing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that
it was not in his power either to abstain from teaching or to do what God
commanded; for a burning ardor forced him to go on; and yet he had no doubt in
his view those despisers with whom he had to do. It is the same then as though
he had said, that he had found out what it was to have the whole world against
him, but that God prevailed. Now this was said, because profane men take
occasion to be secure and indifferent, when they imagine that Prophets and
teachers are unfeeling men, &#8212; &#8220;O, what do we care for fanatics, who
do not possess common feelings? and it is no wonder, since they are stupid and
insensible, that they are thus angry and violent, disregard all others, and feel
nothing that is human.&#8221; As, then, they imagine that men are sticks, when
they speak of God&#8217;s servants as being without discretion, the Prophet
seems to say, &#8220;Surely ye are deceived, for I am not so much an iron, but
that I am influenced by strong and many feelings; nay, I have learnt and I know
how great is my weakness, nor do I dissemble but that I am subject to fear, to
sorrow, and to other passions; but God has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prevailed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There is then no reason for you to think that I speak so boldly, because I
feel nothing human; but I have done so after a hard struggle, after all those
things came into my mind, which are calculated to weaken the courage of my
heart; yet God stretched forth his hand to me, and not only so, but I was
constrained, lest I should arrogate anything to myself, or boast of my heroic
courage. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I did not
prevail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, but when I submitted
myself to God and desired to give up my calling, I was constrained, and God
dealt powerfully with me, for his word became as<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a burning fire
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in my heart, so that at length, through the
strong influence of the Spirit, I was constrained to proceed in the discharge of
my office.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I said, I will mention
him no more, nor speak in his name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>not<i> </i>that the Prophet wished himself or others to forget God, but
because he thought that he lost all his labor, and that he in vain made a stir,
since he cried aloud without any benefit, and not only so, but he more and more
exasperated the wicked; as an ulcer, the more it is pressed, the more putrid
matter it emits; so the impiety of the people was more and more discovered, when
the Prophet reproved sins which were before
hid.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now then learn by the example of the Prophet,
that whenever Satan or our flesh raises an objection and says, that we ought to
desist from preaching celestial truth because it produces not its proper and
legitimate fruits, it is nevertheless a good odor before God, though fatal to
the ungodly. Though then the truth of the Gospel proves the savor of death to
many, yet our labor is not on that account of no value before God; for we know
that we offer to God an acceptable sacrifice; and though our labor be useless as
to men, it is yet fruitful as to the glory of God; and while we are the odor of
death unto death to those who perish, yet to God, even in this respect, our
labor is acceptable.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us also beware lest we withdraw ourselves from
God; but even when many things happen to impede our course, let us overcome them
by the power of the Spirit. At the same time let us fear, lest through our sloth
we bury our ardor of which the Prophet speaks. We see what happened to Jonah; he
had so far fallen as to forsake entirely his office, by extinguishing, as much
as he could, the judgment of God; and when he became a fugitive, he thought
himself beyond danger, as though he was removed from God&#8217;s presence.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;320103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jonah
1:3.) God indeed saw him, but yet his word was not in him as a burning fire. As
then so great a man through his own sloth extinguished, as far as he could, the
light of the Holy Spirit, how much more ought we to fear, lest the same thing
should happen to us? Let us then rouse the sparks of this fervor, until it
inflame us, so that we may faithfully devote ourselves altogether to the service
of God; and if at any time we become slothful, let us stimulate ourselves, and
may the power of the Holy Spirit be so revived, that we may to the end pursue
the course of our office and never stand still, but assail even the whole world,
knowing that God commands us and requires from us what others disapprove and
condemn.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah proceeds with the same subject, and before
God accuses his enemies, &#8212; that they disgracefully contended<i> </i>with
him, though he deserved no such treatment, for he had endeavored to secure as
far as he could their safety. He then says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard the slander of
many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or as it may be rendered,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
great</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but the former rendering is more
suitable, for it immediately follows, that there was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>terror on every
side</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though all with one consent
assailed him. He then says, that he was surrounded with terror on every side,
because he saw that the whole mass was opposed and hostile to him, and that he
stood alone. He says, also, that his enemies laid in wait for him, and sought
occasions to destroy him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Report ye, and we will report to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he assumes their person and
relates what they consulted to do. He, no doubt, introduces here the chief men
and the priests as the speakers, who were contriving means to form an accusation
against the holy man; for we know what is commonly done in conspiracies of this
kind; worthless men run here and there and hunt for every little thing; then
they bring their report, and from this the accusation is formed. As, then, it
did not comport with the dignity of the chief men and of the priests, to run
here and there and to inquire of such as they might meet with what Jeremiah had
said, they sat still and sent others, and said, &#8220;Go and report to us, and
we shall then report to the king.&#8221; For the word &#8220;king&#8221; must be
here understood, as the pronoun is put without an antecedent; come then and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>report, and we will report to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We now perceive what Jeremiah
complained of, even that he had not only many enemies who calumniated him, but
that he had also those who wished insidiously to entrap him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds what was still worse, &#8212; that he was
thus unjustly treated, not only by strangers or those who were openly his
enemies, but by his own friends or relations; for the Hebrews called domestics
and those connected by relationship,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the<i> </i>man of
my peace,<i> </i>in whom I trusted,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">is an expression used in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
41:9; but it is a phrase which often occurs. In short, Jeremiah means, that he
was not only in a manner overwhelmed by a vast number of enemies, but that he
was also without any friends, for they treacherously betrayed him. He says that
they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watched his
side</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or halting. Some render it
&#8220;breaking;&#8221; but halting or debility is the most suitable; and the
metaphor is most appropriate; it is taken from the side, and they who halt or
through weakness totter, incline now on this side, then on that side. So
Jeremiah says, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watched
</i></font><font face="Palatino">him;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if by chance he go
astray</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he again speaks in their name,
&#8220;Let<i> </i>us then watch whether he will halt or go astray from the road;
and then we shall prevail against him.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may, in short, gather from these words, that this
holy servant of God was not only harassed openly by professed enemies, but that
he was also insidiously watched, and perfidiously, too, by men who pretended to
be his friends, while yet they were his worst enemies. If, then, deceitful men
at this time assail us by secret means, and others oppose us openly, let us know
that nothing new has happened to us; for in these two ways God tried Jeremiah.
We also see that it was a common thing with the ungodly to lay hold on some
pretext for calumny; for as soon as the Prophets opened their mouth, they could
have said nothing but what was immediately misrepresented; and hence Micah
complained that he was assailed by a similar artifice, for when the spoke with
severity, they all cried out that he raised a tumult among the people, and
sought nothing but new things, so that by disturbing the state of the city and
kingdom, he would bring all things to ruin.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
2:6.) If, then, God suffers us to be tried by such intrigues, let us bear such
indignity with resigned and calm minds; for no Prophet has been exempt from this
kind of trouble and annoyance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They said further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us take our revenge on
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though, indeed, they had a cause
for revenge! for what had Jeremiah done? In what had he offended them? Though,
then, they had suffered no wrong, they yet would take revenge! But it is no
wonder that the ungodly and the despisers of God spoke thus; for we know that
they thought themselves grievously injured whenever their wounds were touched;
for they considered reproofs, however just and necessary, to be reproaches.
Hence then it was, that their rage kindled in them a desire for revenge, though
yet no wrong had been done to them.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

the plottings formed against him. However, then, might perfidious friends on one
hand try privately to entrap him, and open enemies might on the other hand
publicly oppose him, he yet doubted not but that God would be a sufficient
protection to him. And we ought to act exactly in the same manner, whenever
Satan rouses the wicked against us to oppose us either by secret artifices or by
open cruelty; God alone must be, as they say, our brazen wall. But we must first
know that he stands on our side; for the power of God can avail nothing to
animate us, except we be firmly persuaded of this truth, that he is on our side.
And how this confidence can be obtained, we shall presently

furnished; for they possessed great power, and were also endued with guiles and

concluded, that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;

fight with the world and the devil and his slaves, this ought in the first place
to come to our minds, that God stands on our side to defend our cause and to
protect our safety. This being settled, we may then boldly defy both the
artifices and the violence of all enemies; for it cannot be but that God will
scatter, lay prostrate, overwhelm, and reduce to nothing all those who fight
against him.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shews here briefly how he dared to allege
God&#8217;s name and help against his enemies; for hypocrites often boast that
God is their helper, but they falsely pretend his name. The proof, then, by
which the Prophet shews that he did not falsely or presumptuously pretend what
he had stated, &#8212; that God was to him like a strong giant, who could easily
lay prostrate all the wicked, ought to be well weighed; and it was this &#8212;
that he dared to make God the witness and judge of his integrity. Hence if we
desire to have God&#8217;s name to plead for the purpose of repelling all those
artifices which are contrived against us by the devil, we must learn to offer
ourselves to be tried by him, so that he may really examine our thoughts and
feelings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, in the first place, let us bear in mind what the
Prophet teaches, &#8212; that nothing is hid from God; for hypocrites will not
hesitate to go so far as to offer themselves to be tried by God; but they do not
yet duly consider what is said here, that nothing is hid from him. There are
many recesses in the heart of man, and we know that all things there have many
wrappings and coverings; but God in the meantime is a heart-discerner,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kardiognw&gt;sthv,</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>who proves the heart and reins. Under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the Hebrews include all the hidden thoughts and feelings. We must then
remember this as the first thing, that the Prophet acknowledges that there can
be no disguise as to God, and that men gain nothing by acting fallaciously, for
he penetrates into the inmost thoughts and discerns between the thoughts and the
feelings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteous are tried
</i></font><font face="Palatino">by God. There is to be understood here a
contrast, because men&#8217;s judgment is commonly superficial; for when there
is an appearance of integrity, there is an immediate acquittal, though the heart
may be deceitful and full of all perfidy. The Prophet then means, that when we
come to God&#8217;s tribunal no one is there acquitted but he who brings a pure
heart and real integrity. He then rises to a higher confidence, and says, that
he should </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see the vengeance
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see whence the Prophet derived his confidence,
even because he had thoroughly examined himself, and that before God; he had not
appealed to earthly witnesses only, nor had he, as it were, ascended a public
theater to solicit the favor of the people; but he knew that he was approved by
God, because he was sincere and honest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then he justly adds, at the same time, that he
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made known his cause
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or his complaint to God. There is to be
understood here again a contrast; for they who are carried away by the popular
breath do not acquiesce in God&#8217;s judgment. Ambition, like a violent wind,
always carries men along so that they cannot stop themselves; hence it is that
neither the testimony of conscience nor the judgment of God has much weight with
them. But the Prophet says, that he had made known his cause to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one objects and says, that hypocrites do the
same, to this I answer, that though some imitation may appear in them, there is
nothing real or genuine; for though they may boast that God is their witness,
and that he approves of their cause, it is only what they speak vainly before
men; for there is not one of them who deals thus privately with God. As long,
then, as they are given to ostentation, they do not make known their cause to
God, however they may appeal to him, refer to his tribunal, and declare that
they have no other end in view but to promote his glory. They, then, who
boastingly sound forth these things before the world for their own advantage, do
not yet make known their cause to God, but by frivolous and vain boasting
pretend his name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is it to make known our cause to God? It
is to do this when no one is witness, and when God alone appears before us. When
we dare in our prayers to address God thus, &#8212; &#8220;O Lord, thou knowest
my integrity, thou knowest that there is nothing hid which I do now lay before
thee,&#8221; then it is that we truly make known our cause to God; for in this
case there is no regard had for men, but we are satisfied with the judgment of
God alone. This was the case with the Prophet when he said, that he had made
known his cause to God; and it must have been so, for we have seen that all
ranks of men were opposed to him. As then he was under the necessity of fleeing
to the only true God, he justly says, that he had referred his cause to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that he should see the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vengeance
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God, he alludes to that wished-for revenge
before mentioned, for his enemies had said, &#8220;Let us take our revenge on
him.&#8221; The Prophet says,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall see thy
vengeance</i></font><font face="Palatino">, O<i> </i>Lord.&#8221; By saying that
he should <i>see </i>it, he speaks as though he had his hands tied; for thus the
faithful, of their own accord, restrain themselves,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because
</i></font><font face="Palatino">they know that they are forbidden by
God&#8217;s command to revenge themselves on their enemies. As, then, there is a
difference between doing and seeing, the Prophet here makes a distinction
between himself and the audaciously wicked; for he would not himself take
vengeance according to the violence of his wrath, but that he should only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see
</i></font><font face="Palatino">it; and then he calls it the vengeance of God,
for men rob God of his right whenever they revenge themselves according to their
own will. Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Give place to
wrath.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
12:19)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While exhorting the faithful to forbearance, he uses
this reason, that otherwise no place is given to God&#8217;s judgment; for
whenever we take revenge, we anticipate God, as though every one of us ascended
God&#8217;s tribunal, and arrogated to ourselves his office. We now, then,
perceive what this mode of speaking means.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must at the same time notice, that God&#8217;s
vengeance is not to be imprecated, except on the reprobate and irreclaimable.
For the Prophet no doubt pitied his enemies, and wished, if they were
reclaimable, that God would be propitious and merciful to them, according to
what we have before seen. What, then, the revenge intimates of which he speaks
is, that he knew by the prophetic spirit that they were wholly irreclaimable;
and as his mind was under the influence of right zeal, he could imprecate on
them the vengeance of God. If any one now, after the example of the Prophet,
should wish all his enemies destroyed, and would have God armed against them, he
would act very presumptuously, for it does not belong to us to determine before
the time who the reprobate and the irreclaimable are; until this be found out by
us, we ought to pray for all without exception, and every one ought also to
consider by what zeal he is influenced, lest we should be under the power of
turbulent feelings, as is commonly the case, and lest also our zeal be hasty and
inconsiderate. In short, except it be certain to us that our zeal is guided by
the spirit of uprightness and wisdom, we should never pray for vengeance on our
enemies. He afterwards adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet breaks out into an open expression
of joy, and not only gives thanks himself to God, that he had been freed from
the intrigues and violence of the wicked, but he also summons others, and
encourages them to sing praises to God; as though he had said, that his
deliverance was such a favor, that not only he should be thankful to God for it,
but that all should join to celebrate it, according to what is said by Paul in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:11, that thanks might be given by many to God. The Prophet no
doubt had experienced God&#8217;s help, yea, that help which he had before so
highly extolled. As, then, he had really found that God was victorious, and that
his safety had been defended against all the ungodly by God&#8217;s invincible
power, he in full confidence expressed his thanks, and wished all God&#8217;s

distress preceding, we should never sufficiently acknowledge the power of God in
preserving us. Thus Jeremiah confesses that he was for a time miserable and
oppressed, but that he was at length delivered, even when the ungodly and wicked
thought themselves victorious. Now follows an outcry, which seems to be of a
very different character, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It seems, as I have said, that the Prophet was
inconsistent with himself; from joy and thanksgiving he immediately passed into
curses and execrations; what could have been less appropriate? If we say that he
was tried by a new temptation, yet this seems by no means satisfactory, though
it is in this way that interpreters commonly untie the knot. But it seems to me
a levity unworthy of the holy man to pass suddenly from thanksgiving to God into
imprecations, as though he had forgotten himself. I, therefore, doubt not but
that the Prophet here relates how grievously he had been harassed by his own
thoughts. The whole of this passage, then, is connected with thanksgiving, for
he amplifies the deliverance which he has just mentioned, that is, that he had
been brought back, as it were, from the lower regions. Thus he recites, in the
latter passage, what had before happened to him, as though he had said,
&#8220;When<i> </i>I now declare that I have been rescued by God from the hand
of the wicked, I cannot sufficiently express the greatness of that favor, until
I make it more clearly known to all the godly how great and how dreadful agonies
I suffered, so that I cursed my birth-day, and abhorred everything that ought to
have stimulated me to give praise to God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, the Prophet teaches us here that he was not
only opposed by enemies, but also distressed inwardly in his mind, so that he
was carried away contrary to reason and judgment, by turbulent emotions which
even led him to give utterance to vile blasphemies. For what is here said cannot
be extenuated; but the Prophet most grievously sinned when he became thus
calumnious towards God; for a man must be in a state of despair when he curses
the day in which he was born. Men are, indeed, wont to celebrate their
birth-day; and it was a custom which formerly prevailed, to acknowledge yearly
that they owed it to God&#8217;s invaluable goodness that they were brought
forth into vital light. As then it is a reason for thanksgiving, it is evident
that when we turn to a curse what ought to rouse us to praise God, we are no
longer in a right mind, nor possessed of reason, but that we are seized as it
were with a sacrilegious madness; and yet into this state had the Prophet
fallen.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may then here learn with what care ought every one
of us to watch himself, lest we be carried away by a violent feeling, so as to
become intemperate and unruly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time I allow, and it is what we ought
carefully to notice, that the origin of his zeal was right. For though the
Prophet indirectly blamed God, we ought yet to consider the source of his
complaint; he did not curse his birth-day because he was afflicted with
diseases, or because he could not endure poverty and want, or because he
suffered some private evils; no, nothing of this kind was the case with the
Prophet; but the reason was, because he saw that all his labor was lost, which
he spent for the purpose of securing the wellbeing of the people; and further,
because he found the truth of God loaded with calumnies and reproaches. When,
therefore, he saw the ungodly thus insolently resisting him, and that all
religion was treated with ridicule, he felt deeply moved. Hence it was that the
holy man was touched with so much anguish. And we hence clearly see, that. the
source of his zeal was right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are here reminded how much vigilance we ought
to exercise over ourselves; for in most instances, when we become weary of life,
and desire death, and hate the world, with the light and all the blessings of
God, how is it that we are thus influenced, except that disdain reigns within
us, or that we cannot with resignation bear reproaches, or that poverty is too
grievous to us, or that some troubles press on us too heavily? It is not that we
are influenced by a zeal for God. Since, then, the Prophet, who had no regard to
himself nor had any private reason either of gain or of loss, became yet. thus
exasperated and so very vehement, nay, seized with so violent a feeling, we
ought surely to exercise the more care to restrain our feelings; and though many
things may daily happen to us, which may produce weariness, or overwhelm us with
so much disdain as to render all things hateful to us, we ought yet to contend
against such feelings; and if we cannot, at the first effort, repress and subdue
them, we ought, at least, according to the example of the Prophet, to learn to
correct them by degrees, until God cheers and comforts us, so that we may
rejoice and sing a song of thanksgiving.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as virulent
tongues now surround us, and the devil has many mercenaries, who have nothing
else in view but to prevent by clamors whatever is rightly derived from thee,
and has proceeded from thy mouth, &#8212; O grant, that we may firmly oppose
such intrigues, and also stand with resolute minds against all their violent
artifices, and proceed in the course of thy holy calling, until we shall at
length surely know that they who trust in thee, and faithfully devote themselves
to thy service, are never left without thy help; and that, having at last
finished our warfare, we may be gathered into that blessed rest which has been
obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
SEVENTY-EIGHT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said yesterday that the Prophet&#8217;s confused
state of mind is described in this passage; for he would have no doubt himself
confessed, that he was carried away by an intemperate feeling, so as not to be
himself; for it is to cast reproach on God when any one curses his own
birth-day. And he goes farther than this, for he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed be the man who declared to
my father, that a male child was born</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here he not only fights against God, but is also ungrateful towards men; for
what but thanks did he deserve who first told his father that he had a son born
to him? It was then an ingratitude in no way excusable<i>. </i>And hence we also
learn that the Prophet had no control over his feelings, but was wholly led away
by a blind impulse, which made him to utter very inconsiderate words; for in
this sentence there is no piety nor humanity; but as I have said, the Prophet
was ungrateful to men as well as to God; and his hyperbolical language also more
fully expresses how intemperate his feelings were,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who declared to my father that a
male child was born</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He seems here, as
though he avowedly despised God&#8217;s favor, for we know that males are
preferred to females. But the Prophet mentions here the word male, as though he
wished to complain of what he ought to have been thankful for.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who with joy made him
joyful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see, as it is commonly said,
how he mingles heaven and earth; for had it been in his power, when this frenzy
possessed his mind, he would have certainly disturbed all the elements. But more
grievous and more inordinate is what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let that man be like the cities
which God destroyed without repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Why did he imprecate on an innocent man the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah? and then he speaks not of temporal punishment, but devotes the man to
endless perdition, for that is the import of the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he repented
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;May<i> </i>God be angry with him, without shewing any mercy, but manifest
himself as wholly implacable, as he dealt with Sodom, which he at once destroyed
without leaving it any hope.&#8221; Had he spoken of an inveterate enemy, he
ought to have kept within those bounds prescribed to all God&#8217;s children;
but he had nothing against the man who brought the news to his father. We hence
see how he was led away as it were by an insane impulse. But let us hence learn
to restrain, in due time, our feelings, which will pass over all bounds if we
indulge them; for they will break out then as it were into fury, as the case was
with the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him hear a cry in the
morning, and a tumult at noon-tide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
he devotes an innocent man to perpetual inquietude. And mention is made of the
dawn, for we know that terrors occur during darkness in the night. If anything
happens in the day-time, we inquire what it is, and we are not so frightened;
but when there is any noise in the night, fear takes full possession of us.
There is then something monstrous in what the Prophet expresses here. Hence,
also, we more fully learn how very hot was his indignation, that he thus wished
perpetual torments to an innocent man.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the

<div><font face="Palatino">After having denounced his imprecations on his
birth-day, and on the messenger who had wished to convey joy to his father,
Jeremiah now expostulates with God. It hence appears how great was his madness;
for thus must we speak. But if Jeremiah spared not God, how should he spare a
mortal man? There is then no doubt but that he raged furiously against God, for
his expostulation is that of a man wholly desperate; he asks, why he was not
slain from the womb, as though he did not regard it as a kindness that he came
alive into light. But this life, though exposed to many sorrows, ought yet to be
counted as an evidence of God&#8217;s inestimable favor. As the Prophet, then,
not only despised this goodness of God, but contended with God himself, because
he had been created a man and brought into light, how great was his
ingratitude!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My mother might have been my
grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, &#8220;This light and
life I value not; why then did I not die in my mother&#8217;s womb? and why did
she conceive me?&#8221; Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why came I forth from the womb
that I might see trouble and sorrow, and that my days. might be consumed in,
reproach? </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he gives a reason why he was
wearied of life; but he could not have been cleared on this account, nor ought
he to be so at this day; for what just cause can we have to contend with God?
Jeremiah was created to sorrow and trouble: this is the condition of all; why,
then, should God be blamed? his days were spent in reproach: there was nothing
new in his case; for many who have received an honorable testimony from God had
suffered many wrongs and reproaches. Why, then, did he not look to them as
examples, that he might bear with patience and resignation what had happened to
other holy men? but he seemed as though he wished to appear as it were in
public, that he might proclaim his disgrace, not only to his own age, but to
every age to the end of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time we must remember the object he had
in view; for the Prophet, as we have said, was not seized with this intemperate
spirit after he had given thanks to God, and exulted as a conqueror, but before;
and in order to amplify the grace of God in delivering him as it were from hell
itself, into which he had plunged himself, he mentioned what had passed through
his mind. The drift of the whole description seems to be this, &#8212; &#8220;I
was lost, and my mind could conceive nothing but what was bitter, and with a
full mouth I vomited forth poison and blasphemies against God.&#8221; What the
Prophet then had here in view, was to render more conspicuous the kindness of
God in bringing him to light from so deep an abyss.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A similar mode of speaking is found in the third
chapter of Job. But Job had not the reason which, as we have said, Jeremiah had;
for Jeremiah was not influenced by any private grief when carried away by all
insane impulse to speak against God. Whence, then, was his great grief? even
because he saw he was despised by the people, and that the whole of religion was
esteemed by them as nothing: in short, he saw that the state of things was quite
hopeless. He was, then, inflamed with zeal for God&#8217;s glory; and he also
was extremely grieved at the irreclaimable wickedness of the people; but Job had
only a respect to his own sufferings. There was, therefore, a great difference
between Job and Jeremiah; and yet we know that both were endowed, as it were,
with angelic virtue, for Job is named as one of three just men, who seemed to
have been elevated above all mankind; and Jeremiah, if a comparison be made, was
in this instance more excusable than Job; and yet we see that they were both
inflamed with so unreasonable a grief, that they spared neither God nor
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn to check our feelings, that they
may not break out thus unreasonably. Let us at the same time know that
God&#8217;s servants, though they may excel in firmness, are yet not wholly
divested of their corruptions. And should it happen at any time to us to feel
such emotions within us, let not such a temptation discourage us; but as far as
we can and as God gives us grace, let us strive to resist it, until the firmness
of our faith at length gains the ascendency, as we see was the case with
Jeremiah. For when overwhelmed with such a confusion of mind as to lie down as
it were dead in hell itself, he was yet restored, as we have seen, to such a
soundness of mind, that he afterwards courageously executed his own office, and
also gloried, according to what we observed yesterday, in the help of God. Let
us proceed, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah relates how he received the king&#8217;s
messengers, who sought from him an answer, whether he could bring any comfort in
a state of things so perplexed and almost hopeless, he then says, that two had
been sent to him; one was Pashur, not the priest mentioned in the last chapter,
for he was the son of Immer but this was the son of Melchiah; and the other was
Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah. But he shews that the king and his
counsellors were disappointed of their hope, for they expected a favor-able
answer, as though God would be propitious to Jerusalem; but the Prophet answered
as he was commanded by God, that it was all over with the city, the kingdom, and
the whole nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We shall also see from other passages that Zedekiah
was not one of the worst; though he did not really fear God and was led away by
false counsels, there was yet in him some regard for religion, so that he did
not avowedly despise God as Epicureans do. Many such are found even at this day
in the world, who think it enough to cherish a half-buried fear of God, and to
retain some little regard for religion; but it is very fading, and disappears on
even the least occasion. So it was with Zedekiah; he was as it were neutral, for
he neither seriously worshipped God nor yet despised him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it was, that he sent messengers to Jeremiah. He
knew that while God was displeased with them no safety could be hoped for; but
he did not understand the way of appeasing God, nor had he any real desire to be
reconciled to him; as the case is with hypocrites, who, though they wish God to
be kind to them, yet when God&#8217;s mercy<i> </i>is offered to them, either
openly reject it, or are unwilling to embrace it, because they cannot bear to
surrender themselves to God. Such was the state of mind in which Zedekiah was;
and hence it was, that he asked the Prophet to consult God. But we must also
observe that this was an honorable message; and it hence more fully appears that
Zedekiah was not one of those furious tyrants, who like the giants seek to fight
with God. For by sending two messengers to the Prophet, and employing him as an
advocate to seek some favor from God, he proved that religion was not wholly
suppressed and extinguished in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence also it may be seen how bold and courageous
was the Prophet; for he was not softened by the honor paid to him, but gave such
answer as was calculated to exasperate the king, and to drive him into great
rage. But we ought especially to notice, that they did not flatter the Prophet
so as to induce him to give a false answer, but wished God to be consulted. It
hence appears that they were convinced of Jeremiah&#8217;s integrity, that he
would say nothing rashly or from himself, but would be a faithful interpreter
and herald of heavenly oracles. And yet we see, and shall hereafter see in
several passages, that the king was very incensed against God&#8217;s Prophet.
But hypocrites, though they are forced to reverence God, are yet carried here
and there, and maintain no consistency, especially when they perceive that God
is against them; for they are not turned by threatenings. They cannot,
therefore, but make tumult, and strive like refractory horses to shake off their
rider. Such an instance we find in Zedekiah; for he acknowledged Jeremiah as
God&#8217;s faithful servant; for he did not say, &#8220;Tell a lie for us, or
in our favor but, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inquire of God
for us.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If Jehovah will deal with us
according to all his wondrous
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We again see that Zedekiah had
some sense of religion; but it was very evanescent; for he was not influenced by
any real impression, being like hypocrites who wish, as it has been said, to
have peace with God, provided it be on their own terms. But as they are
unwilling wholly to surrender themselves to God, they take a circuituous course,
and seek to allure God to themselves, at least they come not to him except
through various windings, and not in a direct way. Hence Zedekiah refers here to
God&#8217;s miraculous works which had been wrought in behalf of the Israelites
in all ages; as though he had said, &#8220;God has hitherto dealt; in a
wonderful manner with his chosen people, and whenever he brought help to our
fathers, he manifested wonderful proofs of his power; will he not deal with us
at this day in the same manner?&#8221; He assumes the principle, that
God&#8217;s covenant remained inviolable; and this was quite true, but the
application was false; for Zedekiah and the whole people ought to have kept
faith with God. For if they wished God to be propitious to them, why did they
not in return worship and serve him as their God? But as they were
covenant-breakers, how foolishly and vainly did they allege God&#8217;s
covenant, which they themselves had rendered void? But it is usual with
hypocrites to apply to themselves every favor which God shews to his own
children; for they falsely assume the name as a covering, and say, that they are
members of the Church because God had adopted them. This was the reason why
Zedekiah asked whether God would do according to his wonderful works, as though
he had said, &#8220;Surely<i> </i>God is ever like himself, and we are his
people; and as he has so often delivered his Church, and in such various ways,
his power has always been wonderfully displayed; why, then, will he not deal
with us in the same manner?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last, adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may ascend from
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is, that the King Nebuchadnezzar
may raise the siege and leave us free.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the answer of Jeremiah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say ye to
Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; he did not go to the
king himself, but by way of contempt delivered the message to be borne by the
messengers. The Prophet no doubt did this designedly, and through the impulse of
the Holy Spirit. He did not, indeed, proudly despise his king; but it was
necessary for him by his magnanimity to cast down the pride of the king, so that
he might know that he had to do with the living God, whom he had very insolently
treated. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say ye to Zedekiah, Thus
saith Jehovah, the God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.
He adds the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
Israel, </i></font><font face="Palatino">that Zedekiah might know that the
wonderful works, in reliance on which he still thought that their condition was
safe, did not belong to him and the people; as though the Prophet had said,
&#8220;Though God did not help thee and thy people, he would not yet be
inconsistent with himself, or depart from his covenant; but he would remain ever
the God of Israel, though he destroyed thee and all thy
people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold
I</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; it was said before,
Nebuchadnezzar is come to make war with us: now he says, &#8220;I<i> </i>am
God;&#8221; as though he had said, &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar may be conquered, he
may change his counsel, he may leave you through weariness; but know ye that
Nebuchadnezzar fights under my authority.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

instruments which are in your hands, and with which ye fight against the king of
Babylon and against the Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as
though he had said, &#8220;However furnished ye may be with weapons and forces,
and whatever may be necessary to defend the city, I forbid the use of these
weapons, that is, I will cause that they will avail you nothing.&#8221; Some, as
I have said, render the word, &#8220;I will turn them against you.&#8221; But
the meaning seems more suitable to the etymology of the word, when we say, that
the weapons which the Jews had would avail them nothing, because God would
prevent them from producing any effect.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

state at that time, for the city was besieged by the Chaldeans; there was a wall
between them, and the Jews thought that they could repel the attacks of their
enemies. But God says, &#8220;the<i> </i>Chaldeans are this day shut out by the
wall, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but I will gather
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">He proceeds with the subject; and though he
afterwards is more diffuse, he yet confirms here what we have just seen, &#8212;
even that God was the leader of the war, and that the Chaldeans were, as it
were, his hired soldiers, whom he guided by his own hand, and to whom he would
give the signal to fight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I, myself
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will fight against
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He put this in opposition to the
wonderful works which Zedekiah had mentioned. God, indeed, had formerly been in
a wonderful way present with his Church, not only once, but a thousand times;
but he says now, &#8220;whatever power I have, it shall be exercised now against
you; expect, therefore, no aid from me, but know that I am armed, and shall
wholly destroy you.&#8221; He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with an extended hand and a

&#8220;your<i> </i>fathers found wonderful works done for their safety; but you
shall by experience learn how great is my power to destroy you.&#8221; In short,
he means that all God&#8217;s power would be a cause of terror to the Jews, and
that therefore they could not escape, as there is nothing more dreadful than to
have God&#8217;s hand opposed to us. To the same purpose is what follows,

great
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God intimates in these words that
he would be implacable, and that hence Zedekiah was mistaken when he thought
that the end of their evils was nigh at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He might indeed have said briefly, &#8220;I<i>
</i>will fight with an extended hand and with wrath;&#8221; but he mentioned
wrath three times in various words. Hence what I have said appears evident, that
Zedekiah was deprived of every hope, lest he should deceive himself, as though
he would somehow propitiate God, who had already given up the city to final
destruction. But we shall see that the Prophet had not ceased from the discharge
of his office, and that he had allowed some room for repentance. But he made
expressly this answer, for the king could not have been otherwise awakened. We
shall see how he explained himself; but this beginning was as it were a
thunderclap to lay prostrate the pride of the king and of the people. They had
become first torpid in their evils, and then such was their contumacy that they
sought to subject God to themselves. As then their stupidity and their obstinacy
were so great, the Prophet could not, with any hope of success, have exhorted
them to repent and offered them the mercy of God; it was therefore necessary for
them to be so smitten as to perceive that they were wholly lost, and that God
was so angry with them that they could not be saved by any human means. But we
must defer the rest till to-morrow.</font><br></div>

favor which has been for a time hidden from us, until with resigned minds we

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the same discourse, even that
God had resolved to destroy Jerusalem and the people, at least for a time. But
he points out here what he intended to do, even that he would consume them by
pestilence and famine, as long as they continued in the city; as though he had
said, &#8220;Though<i> </i>these Chaldeans may not immediately take the city by
means of a siege, yet its destruction shall be worse, for famine shall rage
within and consume them.&#8221; We now perceive the design of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must keep in mind what I reminded you of
yesterday, &#8212; that God assumes to himself what might have been ascribed to
the Chaldeans, for he makes himself the author of all these calamities;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
smite</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants of this city,
both man and beast; by a great pestilence shall they
die</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was the first kind of
punishment; before the enemy rushed into the city the pestilence had consumed
many of the people. Now there is a circumstance mentioned which shews how
dreadful would be their state, for not only men would perish, but even brute
animals. It was no wonder that God&#8217;s vengeance extended to horses, and
oxen, and asses; for we know that all these were created for the use of man.
Hence when God manifested his wrath as to these animals, His object was to fill
men with greater terrors; for they thus saw oxen and asses, though innocent,
involved in the same punishment with themselves. For how can we suppose that
horses and asses deserved to perish by diseases, or through want of daily food?
But God sets forth such a spectacle as this, that he may more effectually touch
men; for they thus see that the whole world is exposed to a curse through their
sins. They are indeed constrained to know how great their sinfulness is; for on
this account it is that the earth becomes dry and barren, that the elements
above and below perform not their offices, so that the sterility of the ground
deprives animals of their food, and the infection of the air kills them. But on
this subject we have spoken elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
afterwards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, when the pestilence
had in a great measure consumed them; I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will
give</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or deliver, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zedekiah the king of Judah, and
his servants, into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He intimates that though
they might suffer with courage their wants, it, would be of no avail to them. It
often happens that a siege is raised, when the obstinacy of the besieged is so
great, that they overcome famine and thirst, and struggle against extreme want;
for they who besiege them are led to think that they contend with furious wild
beasts, and so depart from them. But God declares here that the event would be
different as to the Jews, for after having been nearly consumed, they would
still be delivered up into the power of their enemies. Thus he shows that, their
endurance would be useless. It is indeed, a most deplorable thing, that when we
have endured many grievous and distressing evils, the enemy should at length
gain the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ascendency</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and possess over us the power of life and death. But God shows here that
such a calamity awaited the Jews;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
deliver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zedekiah the king of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>He doubtless intended to
show how foolish their confidence was, when they thought that they were safe
under the shadow of their king: &#8220;The king himself,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;shall<i> </i>not exempt himself from danger; what then will it avail you
to have a king?&#8221; And the king is expressly mentioned, that the Jews might
not deceive themselves with the foolish notion, that they had a sufficient
safeguard in their king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, his counsellors or
courtiers; for servants were those called who were the chief men and ministers
of the king, &#8220;and his ministers.&#8221; There was a great deal of pride in
these courtiers, and they were very hostile to the Prophets; for being blinded
by their own foolish wisdom, they despised what the Prophets taught and all
their warnings. For this reason the Prophet says that they would be delivered
into the hand of the king of Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is further said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The last copulative is to be
taken exegetically, <i>even,</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yra&ccedil;nhAtaw</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>veat enesharim, </i>&#8220;even the residue;&#8221; for he refers to none but
the people, but intimates what the people would be, even a small number, a
remnant. Then the words are to be thus rendered, &#8220;even those who shall
remain in the city.&#8221; But Jerusalem, when this discourse was delivered, was
in a flourishing state, and had a large number of inhabitants, he therefore
shews, that after God diminished and reduced the people to a small number, there
would not yet be an end to their evils, but that a worse thing would still
happen to them, for their life would be put in the power of their enemies; he
therefore says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even those who
shall remain in the city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he alludes
to the last verse, for he had said that many would perish through want; nor does
he refer only to famine, but, also to the sword and to the pestilence, for he
says, even those who shall remain
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the pestilence, and from the
sword, and from the famine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The famine,
as it is usual, produced pestilence; and then when their enemies attacked the
city with their warlike instruments, many must have been killed, as they could
not repulse their enemies from the walls without a conflict. Then God shows that
the Jews would have to contend with want, pestilence, and the sword, until they
were overcome, and the city taken by the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the hands of their enemies,
into the hand of those who seek their life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This repetition is not superfluous, for God intimates what is more fully and
clearly expressed by Isaiah, &#8212; that the Chaldeans would not be satisfied
with plunder, that they would make no account of silver and gold, for they would
burn with rage, and their object would be to shed blood.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
13:17.) So the meaning is here, when he mentions those who would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek their
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for they would be led by deadly
hatred, so that their anger and cruelty would not be appeased until they
destroyed them. Thus he shows that it would be a bloody victory, for the Jews
would not only be led captives, because their conquerors would not think it
worth their while to drag them away as worthless slaves, but their object would

<div><font face="Palatino">God here declares that he proposed to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>people the way of life and the
way of death</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in order that they might surely
know that all who remained in the city would soon meet with death, and that
those who willingly surrendered to their enemies would have their life spared.
Moses says in another sense that he set before them the way of life and the way
of death; he spoke of the Law, which contains promises of God&#8217;s favor, and
threatenings to transgressors. But the Prophet means here another thing, that
is, that there was no hope of safety except the Jews submitted their neck to the
yoke, and surrendered of themselves to their enemies; for if they pertinaciously
defended themselves, God would be their enemy, for he had led the Chaldeans to
assail them, and directed their counsels and their forces. He indeed confirms
what he had said before, but at the same time he more particularly describes
what was to be, that the Jews might lay aside their perverseness, and
acknowledge that they could not escape the correction which they
deserved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of what is said is, that as the Chaldeans
fought under the authority of God, they would be victorious; it was then in vain
for the Jews to resist, as they could not escape, unless they overcame God
himself, which was impossible. He leaves then but one hope to them, that is,
humbly to acknowledge God&#8217;s just judgment by submitting of themselves to a
temporal punishment, and by enduring exile with a resigned mind. This then is
the meaning, and it is not different discourse, but the Prophet confirms what he
had said before, and at the same time applies God&#8217;s threatenings to the
state of the people, so that they might humble themselves, and not think it of
any use to resist God in their obstinacy, as they would at length be constrained
to succumb.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt say to this people, Thus
saith Jehovah, Behold I set before you the way of life and the way of
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Which was the way of death?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abides in this city,
shall die by the sword, or by famine, or by
pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was incredible to the
Jews, and they were no doubt inflamed with rage when they heard that they were
to perish in the holy city which God protected; for there he had his sanctuary,
and there his rest was. But the Prophet had already dissipated all these
delusions; he could, therefore, boldly threaten them, though they still alleged
their vain pretences: he had shewed reasons enough why they could hope for
nothing less than exile from God, for they had so many times, and so
obstinately, and in such various ways provoked him. This, then, he says, is the
<i>way of death, </i>it is by remaining in the city. And he mentions several
kinds of evils, and shews that God was armed not only with a hostile sword, but
would also employ famine and pestilence, so that he would kill some with the
sword, consume some with famine, and destroy some with pestilence. Hence he
shews that they would be so assailed on every side, that it would be in vain to
attempt to escape; for when they shunned the sword, pestilence would meet them;
and when they were preserved from the pestilence, the famine would consume
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he who went out to the
Chaldeans, who besieged the city, </i></font><font face="Palatino">etc., that
is, who willingly surrendered himself; for it was a sign of obedience when the
Jews with a resigned mind received correction; and it was also an evidence of
repentance, for they thus confessed that they were worthy of the heaviest
punishment. This is the reason why the Prophet represents it as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the way of life
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to go out willingly, and to make a surrender of
themselves of their own accord to their enemies. And by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who besiege
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;kyl[
&#181;yrxh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etserim olicam, </i>he wished to
anticipate objections which any one of the people might have alleged, &#8212;
&#8220;How can I dare thus to<i> </i>expose myself? for the Chaldeans besiege
us, and it will be all over with me as to my life if I go forth as a suppliant
to them.&#8221; By no means, says the Prophet, for though they carry on a deadly
war with the city<i>, </i>yet every one who of his own accord goes forth to them
shall be safe, and shall find them ready to shew mercy. God would not have
promised this had he not the Chaldeans in his own power, so that he could turn
their minds as he pleased.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuphel, </i>it means strictly to fall; but I consider that it signifies here
to dwell, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012527&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
25:27<i>, </i>where it is said that Ishmael dwelt in the sight of, or over
against his brethren. They who render it &#8220;died&#8221; touch neither heaven
nor earth. Some read, &#8220;his lot fell among his brethren;&#8221;<i> </i>but
this is an unnatural rendering. There is, then, no doubt but that the verb means
often to lie down, and hence to dwell; and yet I allow that the Prophet alludes
to subjection; for we must remember what must have been their condition when
they went over to the Chaldeans; they must have been subjected to great
reproach. It was then no small humiliation; but yet we may properly render the
verb to dwell.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who went out to the
Chaldeans and dwelt with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, who suffered himself to
be led into exile, or who migrated according to their will from his own country
to a foreign land &#8212; <i>he,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his life shall be for a
prey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, he shall save his life,
as when any one finds a prey and takes it as his own by stealth; for prey is to
be taken here as an accidental gain. Whosoever, then, he says, shall not deem it
too grievous a thing to submit to the Chaldeans, shall at least save his
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, God intimates that the wickedness of the
people had advanced so far, that it was not right to forgive them. What, then,
was to be done by them? to submit with resignation and humility to a temporal
punishment, and thus to cease to shut up the door of God&#8217;s mercy. He,
however, teaches them at the same time that no salvation could be hoped for by
them until they were chastised. And hence we may learn a useful doctrine, and
that is, that whenever we provoke God&#8217;s wrath by our perverseness, we
cannot be exempt from all punishment; and that we ought not to be impatient,
especially when he punishes us moderately; and that provided we obtain eternal
mercy, we ought submissively to bear paternal corrections. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He again confirms what he had said, that it would be
the way of death if the Jews remained fixed in the city, for this would be to
struggle against God; for God is said to

</i></font><font face="Palatino">his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>face for

punish that nation. To set the face is the same as to be resolute. Then God says
that what he had resolved respecting the destruction of Jerusalem could not be
changed. Now, what must at length be the issue when any one thinks that he can,
against the will of God, escape death? As they who violently stumble against a

city itself was doomed to destruction. It is, indeed, a most grievous thing when
a city is wholly demolished: cities are often taken, and the conqueror removes
the inhabitants here and there, while it remains still a habitable place; but
God declares here that he would act more severely towards the city of Jerusalem,

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet tells us that he was sent to the king
and his counsellors. Hitherto he has been addressing the king and the whole
people indiscriminately; but here a special message is committed to him to be
delivered at the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>palace
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the king; and he was to say that judgment
was nigh him and his counsellors. But he is not now threatened as before, for
there is a condition interposed: he exhorts them to repent, and indirectly
promises them pardon, for in vain would he have spoken to them of repentance had
he not given them some hopes of pardon and deliverance. He is not yet
inconsistent with himself, for though the king was to be driven into exile, he
might yet obtain some favor, after having submitted to a paternal correction.
Though, then, the Prophet here exhorts the king and his counsellors to repent,
he does yet shew that they were not to be wholly free from punishment, and yet
he promises some mitigation.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage reminds us that we ought not to rush
headlong into despair when some great evil is suspended over us, and when God
shews that we cannot wholly escape punishment. For there is nothing more
unreasonable than that the fear by which God restores us to himself should be
the cause of despair, so that we repent not; for though God&#8217;s wrath be not
wholly removed, yet it is a great thing that it is mitigated, which is an
alleviation accompanying the evil itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, the Prophet intimates that God&#8217;s
wrath might be alleviated, though not wholly pacified, provided the king and his
counsellors began to act rightly and justly. But he mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not for honor&#8217;s sake, but,
on the contrary, by way of reproach; nor does he refer to David, as some
unmeaningly assert, because he ruled justly and was a most excellent and upright
king; but the Prophet had regard to God&#8217;s covenant. For we know that they
deceived themselves when they thought that they were to be exempt from trouble
through a peculiar privilege, because God had chosen that family, and promised
that the kingdom would be perpetual. Thus hypocrites appropriate to their own
advantage whatever God has promised; and at the same time they boast, though
without faith and repentance, that God is bound to them. Such, then, was the
presumption of the king and his counsellors; for they who were David&#8217;s
descendants doubted not but that they were exempt from the common lot of men,
and that they were, as they say, sacred beings. Hence the Prophet says, in
contempt, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The house of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>that is, &#8220;let these vain
boastings now cease, for God will not spare you,<i> </i>though you may a hundred
times boast that you are the descendants of David.&#8221; And at the same time
he upbraids them with having become wholly degenerate, for God had made a
covenant with David on the condition that he served him faithfully; but his
posterity were become perfidious and apostates. Therefore the Prophet brought
before them the name of David, in order that he might the more reproach them,
because they were become wholly unlike their father, having departed from his
piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judge ye
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There was no doubt a great
liberty taken by the king and his courtiers in committing plunder, for the
Prophet would not have here recommended justice to them had they not wholly
neglected what was just and right. As, then, there was no care to administer
justice, the Prophet bade them to recognize what was due to God and to his
people. But it was a most grievous trial to all the godly to see that the sacred
house, in which the living image of God ought to have shone forth brightly, was
become a house of spoils, where robbers dwelt, who with impunity plundered all
around them. When, therefore, the state of things is in such a disorder that the
very judges, whom God has set over his Church, are like robbers, let us know
that such a thing happened formerly; nor is there a doubt but that God thus took
vengeance on the impiety and wickedness of the people, for he would have never
suffered that house to be so contaminated and so filled with so many crimes, had
not the people been unworthy of a good and faithful king and of upright
counsellors. Let us, then, know that the Prophet exhorted the king and his
counsellors to execute justice, because they had forgotten their office, and
were become like rapacious wolves.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">q&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oshek, </i>should mean to oppress by calumny and malice, or by fraudulent
means; but it is to be taken otherwise here. Some distinguish between the two
words

<i>oshek, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lzg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gesal, </i>and say that the first means to retain a deposit or wages, or
anything that belongs to another, and that the latter signifies to take a thing
by force, to plunder. But this difference, as it appears, is not observed by the
Prophet, for he says, &#8220;Free<i> </i>ye the plundered or the spoiled.&#8221;
From whose hand? from &#8220;the<i> </i>hand of the oppressor.&#8221; As, then,
these two words correspond, I doubt not but that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lzg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gesal, </i>means both to take by force and to plunder; and that though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">q&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oshek, </i>means often fraudulently to oppress, yet not always. However this
may be, God intimates that neither the king nor his counsellors had any care for
the poor, so as to repress violence, and robbery, and plunder. Then the very
judges themselves were the associates of robbers, for they allowed them with
impunity to rob and plunder without affording any aid to helpless men when they
were thus wickedly harassed. There is, however, no doubt but that God would have
them to perform their duties towards all, both rich and poor, without exception;
but as injustice in this particular was especially<i> </i>seen, this is the
reason why by stating a part for the whole he specified only one
thing.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE25</font></sup><br></div>

except the king and his courtiers repented, it was all over with them. There is
then a contrast to be understood here between that paternal correction of which
he had spoken, and the destruction of which the Prophet now speaks. God&#8217;s
indignation had been already kindled, nor could it be immediately extinguished;
and though they had to suffer, yet the issue would have been happy and according
to their wishes: but he here declares that there would be an irreconcilable war
with God, except they labored to return to his favor. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the wickedness of

his discourse, he spoke of them as being absent, or as though God, after having

<div><font face="Palatino">Though the whole nation was corrupt in the time of
the Prophet, yet Jerusalem was the head and seat of all evils, especially as
there was there more licentiousness; and then they thought that the Prophets had
no liberty there, as though the citizens were, by a peculiar privilege, exempt
from all reproof; and, lastly, the very situation of the city gave them courage,
for when they regarded the height of their walls, their towers, and fortresses,
they thought themselves beyond the reach of danger. Hence was the security which
the Prophet now condemns; and, therefore, he calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitant of the
valley</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jerusalem, we know, was situated on small hills: the
Mount Sion had two tops; and then there were hills contiguous, especially
towards Lebanon; there was, however, a plain on every side. And then if we
except Mount Sion, Jerusalem was in a valley; for it was surrounded, we know, by
mountains. There were mountains around it, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
125:2. Now, its very situation gave confidence to the citizens, as access to it
was difficult. They, therefore, thought that enemies could not come into that
valley, which kept them inclosed, as in a fortified place. This is the reason
why the Prophet called not the city by its own name, but said that it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dwelt in the
valley</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and afterwards he called it a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rock in the

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rw&ccedil;ym</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mishur, </i>means a level ground. The whole region was then a continued plain
as far as the mountains. Jerusalem itself had also, as we have said, its small
hills; it was therefore, as it were, a

Plain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see for what purpose the Prophet used this
circumlocution, even because the Jews gloried in the position of their city, as
though it was impregnable; and also, because the vicinity of the mountains, as
well as the plain, gave them great advantages. And we know how disposed men are
to take to a false security when there is apparently no danger; but on the
contrary, they think of various defences and aids from which they expect to
derive help. It is, therefore, this false boasting that the Prophet condemns,
when he calls Jerusalem the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabitant of the
valley</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then says, that it was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rock in the

<div><font face="Palatino">What follows makes this more clear,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who say, Who shall come down

<i>ichet, </i>some take in the sense of tearing, &#8220;Who shall make a breach

<i>chetat; </i>but it is rather from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tjn</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
nechat, to </i>descend; for the first meaning would be too strained. The Prophet
speaks according to the opinion of the people, who thought themselves
sufficiently fortified against all the attacks of their enemies. It may have
been, indeed, that they did not speak thus openly; but the Prophet had regard to
the hidden thoughts of their hearts, when he ascribed to them this boasting,
&#8212; that they dwelt in an impregnable place,<i> </i>as the access to it was
formidable; for they spoke boldly, &#8220;Who shall descend to
us?</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
will enter our houses?&#8221; as though they had their nest in the clouds. They
intimated that their state would be safe, because their enemies would not dare
to come nigh them, or would be disgracefully repelled if they dared, as it would
be enough for them to close their gates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God, on the contrary, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or against thee, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will visit
</i></font><font face="Palatino">thee. There is, indeed, a change of number; for
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for he had begun by saying,
&#8220;Ye<i> </i>who say,&#8221;

<i>eamrim. </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit upon

doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;I<i> </i>will deal with you according to what
you have done, as your works deserve.&#8221; Merit is to be taken for reward.
Then God threatens that he would render to the Jews what they merited, because
they had not ceased to provoke his wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will kindle a fire in its
forest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some take
&#8220;forest&#8221;<i> </i>metaphorically for the neighboring towns; but this
seems foreign to the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. I do not, indeed, deny but that
there is a metaphor in the words; but then the word forest is not to be applied
to towns and villages, but to the buildings of the city itself, according to a
mode of speaking elsewhere used by the Prophets. As their houses were built of a
large quantity of wood, of tall and most choice trees, the Prophet compares this
mass of wood to a forest. We may, however, give a simpler explanation, and I
know not whether it be more suitable that the Prophet points out Lebanon. He
then means by the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forest
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the city the trees of Lebanon, which we know
were particularly fine, for their loftiness were everywhere known; and we know
also that they were very large. As, then, a part of their false glory was Mount
Lebanon, the Prophet distinctly intimates that it would serve as a help to burn
the city itself; for when God burned Jerusalem, he would take from the vicinity
materials for the purpose.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE28</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as we understand the meaning of the Prophet, let
us learn how to apply this passage. We have said elsewhere that nothing is more
hateful to God than false confidence; when men, relying on their own resources,
promise to themselves a happy and a safe condition, they become torpid in their
own security. Thus it comes, that they despise God, and never flee to him; they
scorn his judgments, and at length are carried away by a mad impulse to every
kind of insolence. This is the reason why the Prophets so often and so sharply
reprove secure men, for they become presumptuous towards God when they are
touched by no regard for him, and with no fear of him. They then not only
dishonor God by transferring the hope of their safety to mere means or such
helps as they foolishly depend on, but they also think that they are not under
the authority of God. Hence it is, that they promise themselves impunity, and
thus become wholly hardened in their sins. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is again bidden to reprove the king and
his counsellors; but the exhortation is at the same time extended to the whole
people. It was necessary to begin with the head, that the common people might
know that it was not a matter to be trifled with, as God would not spare, no,
not even the king himself, and his courtiers; for a greater terror seized the
lower orders, when they saw the highest laid prostrate. That what is here taught
might then penetrate more effectually into the hearts of all, the Prophet is bid
to address the king himself and his courtiers: he is afterwards bidden to
include also the whole body of the people. And hence it appears, that there was
some hope of favor yet remaining, provided the king and the whole people
received the admonitions of the Prophet; provided their repentance and
conversion were sincere, God was still ready to forgive them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time observe, as I have already
said, that they could not escape the calamity that was at hand; but exile would
have been much milder, and also their return would have been more certain, and
they would have found in various ways that they had not been rejected by God,
though for a time chastised. As then we now say, that a hope of pardon was set
before them, this is not to be so understood as that they could avert the
destruction of the city; for it had once for all been determined by God to drive
the people into a temporary exile, and also to put all end for a time to their
sacrifices; for this dreadful desolation was to be a proof that the people had
been extremely ungrateful to God, and especially that their obstinacy could not
be endured in having so long despised the Prophets and the commands of God.
However the hope of mitigation as to their punishment was given them, provided
they were touched by a right feeling, so as to endeavor to return into favor
with God. But as Jeremiah effected nothing by so many admonitions, they were
rendered more inexcusable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the design of what is here said, even that
the Jews, having been so often proved guilty, might cease to complain that they
suffered anything undeservedly; for they had been often admonished, yea, almost
in numberless instances, and God had offered mercy, provided they were
reclaimable. I come now to the words &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, Go
down</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the house of the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see that the Prophet was endued
with so great a courage that the dignity of the king&#8217;s name did not daunt
him, so as to prevent him to perform what was commanded him. We have seen
elsewhere similar instances; but whenever such cases occur, they deserve to be
noticed. <i>First, </i>the servants of God ought boldly to discharge their
office, and not to flatter the great and the rich, nor remit anything of their
own authority when they meet with dignity and greatness. <i>Secondly, </i>let
those who seem to be more eminent than others learn, that whatever eminence they
may possess cannot avail them, but that they ought to submit to prophetic
instruction. We have before seen that the Prophet was sent to reprove and rebuke
even the highest, and to shew no respect of persons.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:10.) So now, here he shews that he had, as it were, the whole world under his
feet, for in executing his office, he reproved the king himself and all his
princes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he speaks of the king as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sitting on the throne of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but not, as I have already said,
for the sake of honor, but for the purpose of enhancing his guilt; for he
occupied a sacred throne, of which he was wholly unworthy. For though God is
said to sit in the midst of the gods, because by him kings rule, we yet know
that the throne of David was more eminent than any other; for it was a priestly
kingdom and a type of that celestial kingdom which was afterwards fully revealed
in Christ. As, then, the kings of Judah, the descendants of David, were types of
Christ, less tolerable was their impiety, when, unmindful of their vocation,
they had departed from the piety of their father David and became wholly
degenerated. So the Prophet, by mentioning the house of Israel and the house of
Jacob, no doubt condemned the Jews, because they had become unlike the holy
patriarch. We now, then, understand the object of the Prophet when he says,
&#8220;Hear<i> </i>the word of Jehovah, thou king of Judah, who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sittest on the throne of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that his reproof might have its just weight, the
Prophet carefully shews that he brought nothing but what had been committed to
him from above; this is the reason why he repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>&#8220;Thus<i> </i>saith Jehovah,
Go down, speak, and say.&#8221;<i> </i>From the king he comes to the courtiers,
and from them to the whole people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by the king&#8217;s servants
the Scripture means, all those ministers who were his counsellors, who were
appointed to administer justice and who exercised authority. But we must<b>
</b>notice, that at last he addresses the whole people. We hence see that what
he taught belonged in common to all, though he began with the king and his
counsellors, that the common people might not think that they would be
unpunished if they despised the doctrine to which even kings were to
submit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do judgment and
justice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This belonged especially to the
king and his judges and governors; for private individuals, we know, had no
power to protect their property; for though
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every
</i></font><font face="Palatino">one ought to resist wrongs and evil doings, yet
this was the special duty of the judges whom God had armed with the sword for
this purpose. To </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means to render to every<i>
</i>one according to his right; but when the two words, judgment and justice,
are connected together, by justice we are to understand equity, so that every
one has his own right; and by judgment is to be understood the execution of due
punishment; for it is not enough for the judge to decide what is right, except
he restrains the wicked when they audaciously resist. To do judgment, then, is
to defend the weak and the innocent, as it were, with an armed
hand.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE30</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rescue the spoiled from the hand
of the oppressor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He repeats what we
observed in the last chapter; and here under one thing he includes the duty of
judges, even that they are ever to oppose what is wrong and to check the
audacity of the wicked, for they can never be induced willingly to conduct
themselves with moderation and quietness. As, then, they are to be restrained by
force, he says, &#8220;Rescue the spoiled from the hand of the oppressor.&#8221;
Of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwzg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gesul, </i>we have spoken before; but by this form of speaking God intimates
that it is not enough for the judge to abstain from tyranny and cruelty, and not
to stimulate the wicked nor favor them, except he also acknowledges that he has
been appointed by God for this end &#8212; to rescue the spoiled from the hand
of the oppressor, and not to hesitate to face hatred and danger in the discharge
of his office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now adds other things which he had not
mentioned in the preceding chapter;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>defraud
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the stranger and the orphan and
the widow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is what is often said in
Scripture, that it is not right to defraud any one; for God would exempt all
from wrong, and not only strangers, orphans, and widows; but as orphans have<i>
</i>no knowledge or wisdom, they are exposed, as it were, to plunder; and also
widows, because they are in themselves helpless; and strangers, because they
have no friends to undertake their cause; hence God, in an especial<i>
</i>mannel, requires a regard to be had to strangers, orphans, and widows. There
is also another reason; for when their right is rendered to strangers, orphans,
and widows, equity no doubt shines forth more conspicuously. When any one brings
friends with him, and employs them in the defense of his cause, the judge is
thereby influenced; and he who is a native will have his relations and neighbors
to support his cause; and he who is rich and possessing power will also
influence the judge, so that he dares not do anything notoriously wrong; but
when the stranger, or the orphan, or the widow comes before the judge, he can
with impunity oppress them all. Hence if he judges rightly, it is no doubt a
conspicuous proof of his integrity and uprightness. This, then, is the reason
why God everywhere enumerates these cases when he speaks of right and equitable
judgments. He further adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exercise no violence, nor shed
innocent blood in this place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These
things also were matters belonging to the judges. But it was a horribly
monstrous thing for the throne of David to have been so defiled as to have
become, as it were, a den of robbers. Wherever there is any pretense to justice,
there ought to be there some fear or shame; but as we have said, that tribunal
was in a peculiar manner sacred to God. As, then, the king and his counsellors
were become like robbers, and as they so occupied the throne of David that all
impiety prevailed, and they hesitated not to plunder on every side, as though
they lived in a house of plunder; this was, as I have said, a sad and shameful
spectacle.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE32</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought the more carefully to notice this
passage, that we may learn to strengthen ourselves against bad examples, lest
the impiety of men should overturn our faith; when we see in God&#8217;s Church
things in such a disorder, that those who glory in the name of God are become
like robbers, we must beware lest we become, on this account, alienated from
true religion. We must, indeed, detest such monsters, but we must take care lest
God&#8217;s word, through men&#8217;s wickedness, should lose its value in our
esteem. We ought, then, to remember the admonition of Christ, to hear the
Scribes and Pharisees who sat in Moses&#8217; seat.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:2.) Thus it behoved the Jews to venerate that royal throne, on which God had
inscribed certain marks of his glory. Though they saw that it was polluted by
the crimes and evil deeds of men, yet they ought to have retained some regard
for it on account of that expression, &#8220;This is my rest for
ever.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we yet see that the king was sharply and severely
reproved, as he deserved. Hence most foolishly does the Pope at the present day
seek to exempt himself from all reproof, because he occupies the apostolic
throne.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Were we to grant what is claimed, (though that is frivolous and childish,) that
the Roman throne is apostolic, (which I think has never been occupied by Peter,)
surely the throne of David was much more venerable than the chair of Peter? and
yet the descendants of David who succeeded him, being types and representatives
of Christ, were not on that account, as we here see, exempt from
reproof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It might, however, be asked, why the Prophet said
that he was sent to the whole people, when his doctrine was addressed only to
the king and the public judges? for it belonged not to the people or to private
individuals. But I have said already that it was easy for the common people to
gather how God&#8217;s judgment ought to have been dreaded, for they had heard
that punishment was denounced even on the house of David, which was yet
considered sacred. When, therefore, they saw that those were summoned before
God&#8217;s tribunal who were, in a manner, not subject to laws, what were they
to think but that every one of them ought to have thought of himself, and to
examine his own life? for they must at length be called to give an account,
since the king himself and his counsellors had been summoned to do so. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet expresses more clearly what I have
already stated, that if the Jews from the heart repented, there was yet a place
for mercy; for he promises them that God would be reconcilable, if they sought
to be reconciled to him; he allures them to repentance<i> </i>by words of
kindness. We may, indeed, read
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ayk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kiam, </i>as one word, and render it, &#8220;But rather;&#8221; but I follow
others who give this version, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
if by doing ye will do this word, then ye shall enter
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in, etc.; and thus they turn the copulative
into an adverb of time, which is often the
case.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE34</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Still the other meaning is not unsuitable, when the future verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w&ccedil;[t</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>toshu, </i>is taken in a hortative sense; for we know that the future tense
in Hebrew is often to be understood as an imperative. As to the general meaning,
there is not much difference; for what the Prophet designed to shew was this,
that God would be reconciled to the Jews, if they were not wholly disobedient.
&#8220;Only,&#8221; he says, &#8220;obey my word, and your safety shall be
secured.&#8221; Not that impunity was to be expected, as I have said before,
but, as they would have found, their reconciliation to God would not have been
in vain, for their punishment would have been mitigated; in that case their
exile would have been rendered more endurable, for God would have doubtless made
their adversaries kind to them; in short, mercy would have been shewn to them in
many ways. Moreover, the Prophet shews that he called them not in vain to
repent; for he sets before them God&#8217;s favor in mitigating their
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall enter through the gates
of this house, both your kings and their counsellors;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but the number is afterwards changed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, every king.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, seems, at the first view,
to have retracted what he had said respecting exile; but the two things are to
be connected together, that there was some hope remaining, if the Jews accepted
the favor of God, and then that the punishment, once decreed, was to be borne by
them. These two things do not disagree. For God had resolved to drive the Jews
into exile; but all Judea would not doubtless have been reduced to solitude, as
that happened through their irreclaimable obstinacy, according to what we read
at the end of this Book; for they might have otherwise dwelt still in their own
country. This is one thing; and then their condition after their exile would
have been better and far more happy. But even at that time, the crown was
trodden under foot, and all the dignity and power of the family of David were
nearly abolished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, the Prophet says, &#8220;Enter shall
kings in chariots and on horses,&#8221;<i> </i>and also &#8220;the<i> </i>people
and he and his counsellors,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the gates of this
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;&#8221; </i>he does not mean that they
would so escape as that God would not chastise them for their sins, as he had
declared, but that there would still be some form of a kingdom, and that exile
would be short, and also that there would be at length a restoration, so that
the descendants of David would return to their former state, and that the city
itself would be restored so as to abound in wealth as in all other blessings.
Such is the promise. The Prophet further adds what would otherwise take place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they will not
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this place shall become a
desolation. But this threatening shall be considered tomorrow.</font><br></div>

so defend us through the whole course of life against all the assaults of our
enemies, that we, ever relying on thine aid, and possessing our souls in
patience, may at length be translated into that blessed glory and rest, which he
has purchased for us by his own blood: &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
EIGHTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We explained yesterday the declaration of the
Prophet, &#8212; that the kingdom would again be restored by the Lord, if the
king and his servants and the whole people repented. He now introduces a
commination, &#8212; that if they heard not, it was all over with the palace and
the city. But the word house, or palace is often repeated; for though the
defenses of the city gave courage to the people, yet what made them especially
proud was the confidence they felt that the kingdom had been promised to be for
ever. Hence, they thought, that the royal dignity could not possibly fall as
long as the sun and moon continued in the heavens.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198938&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:38.) This false confidence is what the Prophet now meets, and he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye will not hear these
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. He changes the number: he
had said before </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this

</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hzh rbdh

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrbdh
ta</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> at edeberim. </i>But the singular number
includes the whole of his doctrine; yet he now uses the plural number, because
he had exhorted them to change their life.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE36</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that they might not think that they were for no
good reason terrified, he declares that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sworn by
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We indeed know that when God
makes an oath, either when he promises anything, or when he denounces punishment
on sinners, it is done on account of men&#8217;s sloth and dullness. For our
hearts through unbelief will hardly receive a simple truth, unless God removes
the impediments; and this is the design of making an oath, when God does not
only speak, but in order to render us more certain of our salvation, he confirms
his promise by introducing his own name as a pledge. The reason is similar as to
threatenings; for so great is the false security of sinners, that they are deaf
until God, as it were, with force penetrates into their hearts. Hence he says,
that God made an oath by himself; for it seemed incredible to the Jews, that the
family which had been set apart by God from the world, would ever perish. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the preceding declaration, and explains
more at large what had been stated sufficiently clear; for the false boasting of
the Jews could hardly be restrained, as they still thought that the kingdom in
the family of David would be permanent and exempt from any danger of a
change.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But interpreters differ as to the meaning of the
words. I will not repeat their views, nor is it <i>necessary: </i>I will only
state what seems to me to be the real meaning. All others indeed give a
different explanation; but the Prophet, I doubt not, means the same thing as we
have observed in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:12; where he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go to Shiloh, and
see what is the state of that place, for the ark of the covenant had a long time
dwelt there.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though, then, they thought that place sacred, yet it
was reduced to desolation; and thus it must have become a dreadful spectacle to
the whole people. For the same reason now, as it seems to me, the Prophet
compares Lebanon to Mount Gilead; for what some say, that Gilead was the chief
city of the ten tribes, has nothing in it. But we must remember the state of
things at that time; the kingdom of Israel was wholly demolished when our
Prophet spoke these words. Judea had indeed been much reduced by many
calamities; but still some kind of a kingdom remained. Then by Mount Gilead the
Prophet doubtless meant, by stating a part for the whole, the kingdom of Israel,
but for a purpose different from that assigned by interpreters, even because the
whole land of Israel was then laid waste; for all the inhabitants had been led
into exile, and all the spoils had been removed, and nothing had escaped the
rapacity and cruelty of their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, the land of Israel had been reduced unto
desolation, God says now, that Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah would not be
of greater value in his sight than the whole country of the ten tribes had been,
which was doubtless larger in extent and in wealth. And this meaning may be
easily gathered from the words of the passage; he does not say, &#8220;Thou art
like Gilead the head of Lebanon;&#8221; but,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gilead to me art thou the head of
Lebanon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he calls Jerusalem Lebanon,
because it was, as it were, the queen of that land; for by Mount Lebanon he
designated whatever was precious in that country, for the reason we mentioned
yesterday. As to Gilead, I do not consider that the Prophet refers especially<i>
</i>to the city, but by stating a part for the whole, he includes the whole
country, and for this reason, because Mount Gilead was full of many fruitful
trees, and particularly of the balsam and the rosin tree, and of many
odoriferous herbs and aromatics, which at this day are from thence brought to
different parts of the world. And hence we found it asked in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
8:22,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Is there no rosin
in Gilead?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">is there no medicine
found there to heal the Church?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why was mention made then of Mount Gilead? even
<i>because </i>there grew the best aromatics, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>especially
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the balsam tree, and also many odoriferous
trees and most precious fruits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, &#8220;What dost thou think
thyself to be? or, for what reason dost thou trust so much in thyself? I did not
spare Mount Gilead and that extensive country which was much superior to thee;
what means then this foolish presumption, that thou persuadest thyself that all
danger is far off? Thou shalt be to me as Gilead. Think of my judgment on Mount
Gilead, and of the dreadful desolation of the land of Israel; the same which you
may now see there shall happen to thee.&#8221; We now perceive in what sense the
Prophet says, that before God the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>head of
Lebanon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, Jerusalem itself,
which ruled over Lebanon, would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>become like
Gilead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE37</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I make thee not a
desert</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God again makes an oath; for it
is, we know, an elliptical mode of expression, when the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>am,</i> is only used, for an imprecation is to be understood, &#8212;
&#8220;Let me not be thought a God;&#8221; or, &#8220;Let my power be deemed
nothing;&#8221; or, &#8220;Let me not be hereafter counted true and
faithful.&#8221; However this may be, God makes an oath, that the city<i>
</i>would become a desert, as those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cities which are not
inhabited</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Thus the whole context
appears consistent, &#8212; that Jerusalem would be at length like the land of
Israel, for he would no more spare Lebanon than Mount Gilead. It afterwards

<div><font face="Palatino">He expresses the manner, for he had only said before,
that the ruin of the city Jerusalem was nigh at hand; he adds, that

</i></font><font face="Palatino">would come and those well armed with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>warlike

destroyers would not come of themselves or through an impulse of their own, but
through the secret operation of God; for if the Jews had thought that they had
to do only with the Chaldeans, there would have been nothing to call forth the
exercise of a religious principle; but the Prophet distinctly declares, that the
Chaldeans would be the ministers of God, for they would be roused and led by
him, according to what is often taught by the Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, these two things ought to be noticed,
&#8212; first, that God had in readiness many ways by which he could punish the
Jews. For the contempt of the ungodly arises, because they dream that God is
unarmed and has not always the execution, as they say, ready at hand. Hence the
Prophet shews that the Chaldeans would be ready as soon as God hissed for them,
or gave them a sign. This is one thing. Secondly, it ought to be observed, that
he reminds them that the Chaldeans would be the scourge of God, that the Jews
might not think that they contended with mortals, but might know that they were
summoned to render an account of their life, because they had too long been
rebellious against God and his Prophets. This is what we must understand by the

Mount Lebanon and to the forest of Jerusalem, which was mentioned yesterday. The
word forest may, however, be applied to the buildings; for the Jews built their
chambers for the most part of cedar wood, as it is well known; we may then apply
this to their splendid and sumptuous houses; but we may also take it without a
figure and apply it to the trees of Mount Lebanon. But the chief ornament of the
country were the noble trees on that Mount; hence, by cedars, the Prophet no

were as to their own ruin, in disregarding in so refractory a manner the
judgment of God. The words no doubt embrace two contrasts; he compares mortal
men with God, and those many nations with him alone. The Jews could not bear God
as their judge, and were still refractory and strove by their perverseness to
overcome him. Then the Prophet says, that as they would not endure to be judged
by God, judges would come who would pronounce on them a free impartial sentence;
and who were they to be? the heathens. And then, as the Jews would not obey the
one true God, the Prophet sets many nations in contrast with the one true

no doubt, indirectly condemns, not only the sloth, but also the insensibility
which had so demented the Jews, that they never duly reflected on God&#8217;s
judgment, nor were ever touched by the curses of the Law. He then shews that
there would be more understanding and wisdom in the Gentiles, for on seeing
Jerusalem overthrown and wholly demolished, they would know that this had not
happened by chance, but was an evidence of vengeance from heaven. We thus see
that he upbraided the Jews with their own stupidity, as they did not consider
the judgment of God; but he ascribed to the nations wisdom and the spirit of
inquiry; for they would ask, &#8220;Why<i> </i>has Jehovah done thus to this
city?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The nations,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will<i>

example of dreadful vengeance, and this will be the subject of their inquiry;
but while God now of his own free will foretell this to you,<i> </i>ye close
your ears; surely there would be no need of much inquiry in a matter so clear,
were you not deaf and blind, and indeed obstinate, for God of his own accord
warns you beforehand. What, then, can this be, that God forewarns you and ye
refuse to hear him, except that the devil bewitches you?&#8221;</font><br></div>

city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for its ruin was more remarkable
on account of its greatness. When a small town is destroyed, hardly any account
is made of the event; but when a city falls, which was everywhere celebrated for
its largeness, and also for the extraordinary benefits conferred on it by God,
it excites the wonder of all, as though it had fallen from the
clouds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that there would be not only a
spirit of inquiry among the nations, but that every one would become

Jeremiah declares that all the nations would become the judges of the people, he
no doubt intended to condemn the false confidence in which they proudly
indulged. At the same time, he says, &#8220;they have forsaken the covenant of
Jehovah their God,&#8221; in order that he might take away the plea of
ignorance. For they had not only deprived the eternal God of his own right and
authority, but they had become doubly wicked, because God had made himself
familiarly known to them. As, then, true religion had been fully revealed to
them in the Law, hence their perverseness and wicked and base ingratitude

<div><font face="Palatino">They explain this verse of Jehoiakim and Jeconiah,
but I consider it rather a general declaration, for the Prophet wished briefly
to shew how miserable would be the condition of the people, as it would be
better and more desirable at once to die than to protract life in continual
languor. Of the kings he wilt afterwards speak, but reason compels us to extend
these words to the whole people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When a people flee away, being not able to resist
their enemies, they may look for a restoration. In that case all dread death
more than exile and all other calamities which are endured in this life, for
they who remain alive may somehow emerge from their ills and troubles, or at
least they may have them alleviated; but death cuts off all hopes. But the
Prophet says here that death would be better than exile; and why? Because it
would have been better at once to die than to protract a life of misery,
weariness, and reproach, and at last to be destroyed. By saying, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Weep ye not for the dead, nor
bewail
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is the same as though he had
said, &#8220;If<i> </i>the destruction of this city be lamented, much more ought
they to be lamented who shall remain alive than those who shall die, for death
will be as it were a rest, it will be a harbor to end all evils; but life will
be nothing else than a continual succession of miseries.&#8221; We hence
conclude that this ought not to be confined to the two kings, but viewed as

miserable Jews. Thus death would have been far better for them than to be in
this manner long tormented and to have no relaxation. He then takes away the
hope of a return, that he might shew that their exile would be as it were a
dying languor, corroding them as a worm, so that to die a hundred times would
have been more desirable than to remain in such a hard and miserable bondage. It

<div><font face="Palatino">What he had before said generally he now applies
distinctly and especially to the person of the king, that the people in general
might know that they could not escape that punishment from which even the king
would not be exempt. They, no doubt, when they heard that such a hard and bitter
lot would happen to a king, regarded it as a thing incredible; but Jeremiah
intended to shew in his person that what we have just seen was nigh them all,
that is, that it would be better for them at once to die than to pine away for a
long time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time notice, that what these two
verses contain respecting the king is not said as though it applied to him
alone, but rather that every one might apply it to himself what the Prophet said
of the king alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word Shallum, it is thought that Jehoiakim
was so called, who had also the name of Jeconiah, and who had of his own accord
given up the kingdom and died in exile. But as he is called the son of Josiah, a
doubt has arisen. But if we duly consider what sacred history relates, the
probable conjecture is, that he was not his son but his grandson, for the chosen
successor of his father was Jehoiakim, called also Eliakim. Yet Matthew calls
him the son of Josiah, and that he was born to him together with his brethren.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
1:11.) But we know that it was a common thing with the Hebrews to call
descendants sons, especially when the family of David was spoken of; that the
order of succession might be preserved, those who next followed their
predecessors were called sons. Thus, according to this custom, Elialdm might
have been deemed his son, who was really his brother. As, then, he was the
successor of Josiah, he is called his son.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE42</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is yet no doubt but that God shews here that a
pious king would not be a patronizer either to his own son, or to his grandson,
or to others; for hypocrites are wont to form a defense for themselves from the
holiness of their fathers. And as king Josiah had faithfully served God, his
sons thought that God was in a manner bound to themselves, as though all this
had not proceeded from the mere bounty of God, that Josiah had been so sincerely
religious. But hypocrites, as I have just said, seek ever to render God bound to
them. Hence the Prophet checks this false confidence, and declares that though
Josiah was approved of God, yet his memory would not be of such an account as to
shield his posterity from punishment. God, indeed, promises in his Law to be
merciful to the thousandth generation, even to them who love him,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:6) but the ungodly very absurdly lay hold on this, as though they held God
bound to them; for they thus imagine that they can deprive him of his power, and
judgment, and authority over the world. The meaning then is, that Shallum in
vain promised safety to himself because he had descended from the holy king
Josiah, who had been a patron of eminent piety, for this could not be the means
of lessening his punishment, inasmuch as he had degenerated from his father,
whom he ought to have imitated, knowing that he was approved by God. And this
also was the reason for the repetition, for he not only calls him the son of
Josiah, but also adds, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reigned instead of his
</i></font><font face="Palatino">father Josiah. Though, then, he succeeded<i>
</i>so pious a king, he yet became degenerated and departed from the example of
his father.</font><br></div>

fE43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As, then, the king was precluded
from returning, what would become of the common people and the dregs of society?
Could their condition be better? How then could the Jews dare flatter themselves
when they perceived so dreadful an evidence of God&#8217;s wrath in the king
himself, on whom depended their safety? A confirmation follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he shall die in the place to
which they shall have led him away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
intimates that he was to be by force carried away; he doubtless did not
surrender himself until he saw that he was under the necessity of yielding. Then
the Prophet in effect says that he would be a miserable exile, driven into
banishment against his own will. It is then added, that he
would</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> see no more the land of his

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet begins here to shew that it could not be
otherwise but that the king&#8217;s palace as well as Jerusalem must be
destroyed, for their wickedness had arrived to the highest pitch; but he now, as
it will appear presently, reprehends the father of Jeconiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that the city<i> </i>was full of
robberies, and especially the palace of the king. Yet I do not think that the
Prophet speaks only of the king, but also of the courtiers and chief men. We
must also bear in mind what I said yesterday, that the common people were not
absolved while the king was condemned. But as dignity and honor among the people
belonged both to the king and the princes, the Prophet exposes them publicly,
that, it might be made evident how deplorable the state of things was throughout
the whole community. We must at the same time add, that the chief among them
were first summoned to judgment, not only because every one had privately
offended, but because they had by their bad examples corrupted the whole body of
the people; and also, because they had taken more liberty, as they feared
nothing. We indeed know that the rich exercise tyranny, because they deem
themselves exempt from all laws. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet here
denounces, in a special manner, a curse on the king and the chief
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>built

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he designates
cruelty, frauds, and robberies; he, in short, includes under these words all
kinds of iniquity. The way in which these things were done is stated; they
wronged their neighbors, by demanding and extorting labors without rewarding
them. Here, indeed, the Prophet only refers to one kind of injustice; but it may
hence be easily concluded, how unjustly and wickedly they ruled who were then in
authority; for they employed their neighbors, as though they were slaves, in
building houses and palaces, for they denied them their wages. But nothing can
be more cruel than to deprive the poor of the fruit of their labor, who from
their labor derive their daily support. It is, indeed, commanded in the Law,
that the wages of the laborer should not sleep with us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
19:13) for that would be the same as to kill
him.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There is also another indignity; when a robber kills a man, his object is the
spoil; but he who extorts labor from a poor man, and sucks, so to speak, his
blood, afterwards sends him away naked and needy; this is more atrocious than by
violence to kill him. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet. But as he
continues the same subject, I shall defer any further remarks till

<div><font face="Palatino">In the last Lecture we began to explain the reproof
given by the Prophet to King Jehoiakim for his cruelty and oppression; for in
building his splendid palaces, he constrained the people to labor for nothing.
This was the crime which the Prophet pointed out when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He! he builds unjustly, and his
chambers by iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>literally,
&#8220;not<i> </i>in judgement.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As Jehoiakim might have objected and said, that this
was lawful for him, for kings think that the whole world has been created for
their sake, the Prophet called his attention to the common rights of men, for
all the Israelites were his relations; as though he had said, &#8220;Though<i>
</i>thou excellest in dignity, yet thou art one of the race of Abraham, and
taken from the midst of thy brethren; there is, therefore, no reason for thee to
take so much liberty as though they were to be thy vassals.&#8221; We hence see
the design of the Prophet, when he condemned the cruelty of King Jehoiakim, who
in building magnificent palaces treated the people arbitrarily and unjustly, and
extorted more labor than what was right. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the last words, &#8220;and<i> </i>painted
with red;<i>&#8221; </i>but vermilion is a kind of red. They, indeed, mention
three kinds of red, &#8212; deep<i> </i>red, brownish, and the third mixed with
various colors; but vermilion is a brighter color. As to the main point there is
no difficulty; the Prophet reproves the ambition and pride of King Jehoiakim,
that he was not content with the moderation of his fathers, but indulged in
extravagant display, and built for himself a palace<i> </i>as it were in the
clouds, as though he did not wish to have a dwelling on the earth. Splendor in
houses cannot in itself be condemned; but, as it can hardly be, nay, as it
seldom happens, but that such insatiable ambition proceeds<i> </i>from pride,
hence the Prophets vehemently denounced sumptuous houses; and they pronounced a
curse on such displays, because they had a regard to the motive and the end.
Such was the design of the Prophet in this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore thus introduces King Jehoiakim,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who says, I will build for myself
a large house and chambers of respirations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>That he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said
</i></font><font face="Palatino">this proved the foolish ambition with which
Jehoiakim had been inebriated, so that he regarded as nothing whatever was
splendid before in Jerusalem. There were palaces, we know, very sumptuous there;
and we also know that the king of Judah lived in great splendor. For though the
palaces of Solomon were not then standing in their original grandeur, yet what
remained was abundantly sufficient to satisfy a man who was not filled with
pride. It hence<i> </i>appears that a fondness for excess prevailed in
Jehoiakim, for he despised the royal palace, and whatever remained after the
death of Solomon. For God, we know, had blessed with prosperity Hezekiah, and
Josiah, and other kings; but they had continued within proper bounds. Since,
then, such haughtiness had crept into the heart of Jehoiakim, it is evident,
that he was filled with vain pride, nay, was drunk with folly. This was the
reason why the Prophet severely reproved him for saying, &#8220;I will build for
myself a large house and chambers of respirations,&#8221; or of
perflations.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE44A</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he perforates for himself
windows</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was a proof of luxury, when
men began to indulge in superfluities. In old times the windows were small; for
use only was regarded by frugal men; but afterwards a sort of madness possessed
the minds of many, so that they sought to be suspended as it were in the air.
And hence they began to have wider windows. The thing in itself, as I have said,
is not what God condemns; but we must ever remember, as I have reminded you,
that men never go to excesses in external things, except when their hearts are
infected with pride, so that they do not regard what is useful, what is
becoming, but are carried away by fondness for excess.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then
added,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> and it is covered with
cedar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the house is covered
with cedar boards. For in my judgment the Prophet means here the wainscotting,
when he says that the house was covered with cedar; as though he had said, that
King Jehoiakim esteemed the squared and polished stones as nothing, unless a
covering was added of cedar boards to ornament the
walls.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And for the same purpose was the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>painting with
vermilion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for justly might paintings be
deemed excessive superfluities. As, then, it was a part of luxury to adorn the
walls with various paintings, as though men wished to change the simple nature
of things, the Prophet here is indignant against King Jehoiakim. Nor is it to be
doubted, but that God had regard also to the circumstances of the times; for God
had already warned him and all the Jews respecting their future calamities.
This, then, was in a manner to treat with mockery the threatenings of God. And
we know how intolerable was this regarded by him; for he thus declares by
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Live do I, never

<div><font face="Palatino">for when he had exhorted them to put on sackcloth and
ashes, they said, &#8220;Let<i> </i>us eat and drink, tomorrow we shall
die.&#8221; Similar, then, was the perverseness of King Jehoiakim; for he ought
to have seen the coming calamity which was set as it were before his eyes; but
he, like one infatuated, increased the royal splendor, so that the wealth of
David and of Solomon appeared as nothing compared with what he had expended. It

give way to their own gratifications; and this is commonly the case<i> </i>with
all; for we see that kings especially indulge in excesses, when there is no war,

the least particle of wisdom, might have known that he had many dangers to
dread. Now, when he applied all his thoughts to the painting of his walls, and

royal dignity and grandeur through the whole course of his life. Some
interpreters, then, think that the Prophet answers here what Jehoiakim might,
have objected: &#8220;What!<i> </i>did not my father also make a royal
display?&#8221; Thus they explain the words, as though the Prophet made at first
a concession, but that by adding a correction, he shewed that the excuse of
Jehoiakim was frivolous: &#8220;I<i> </i>allow that thy father was royally
adorned, but he executed judgment and justice; why dost thou not imitate thy
father in his virtues? God forgave what was superfluous or excessive, for
through his great indulgence he bears with many things in kings; but thou art
far different from thy father, for thou extortest labor from thy poor subjects,
and buildest thy palaces by means of extortion and plunder. There is, therefore,
no reason for thee to seek for thyself a covering from thy father, for thou art
wholly fallen away from his integrity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others elicit an entirely different meaning, &#8212;
that Josiah had prolonged his life, and conciliated the favor of God by ruling
with justice. So, then, they connect the words thus: &#8220;Did<i> </i>not thy
father eat and drink,&#8221; that is, <i>&#8220;</i>did he not live happily,
because God had blessed him? Inquire the cause, and you will find it to be this
&#8212; he faithfully discharged his duties, for he executed judgment and
justice. As, then, thou seest that the equity and moderation which thy father
had practiced, was the cause of his happy life, why dost not thou also imitate
him?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet seems to me to mean simply this,
&#8220;Thy<i> </i>father doubtless lived happily, and nothing was wanting to him
while he executed judgment and justice.&#8221; For thus appears better the
contrast between the tyranny of Jehoiakim, and the uprightness of his father
Josiah; as though he had said, &#8220;Thou deemest now thy state better than
that of thy father, because thou surpassest him in luxury and
splendor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then thou exultest in vain things, thou seemest to
thyself to be happier than thy father: but thy father was contented with his
lot; nay, if his condition be duly regarded, God honored him with every
abundance and variety of blessings;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he did eat and
drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>

fE48</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the foolish ambition of Jehoiakim
is here laughed to scorn; for he seemed not to think himself a king unless he
conducted himself like a madman. Such is the case with kings at this day; they
are ashamed to appear humane, and devise means only to exercise tyranny; and
they also contrive how they may depart as far as possible from the common usage
and practice of men. As then kings are so ingenious in their own follies, which
seem to be like veils, lest anything humane should be perceived in them, the
Prophet justly inveighs here against Jehoiakim;
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It was
well</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,&#8221; </i>he says, &#8220;with thy
father; and yet he acted kindly and courteously towards his people; nor had he
such haughtiness as to despise the common habits of men. Since then he was
happy, if thou regardcst what belongs to real happiness, why dost thou please
thyself so much? What hast thou that is better or more excellent than what he
had!&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the object of the Prophet was to
shew, that it is the only true glory and the chief honor of kings, when they
discharge their duties, and that the image of God shines forth in them, when
they execute judgment and justice; and that when they ambitiously seek through a
blind zeal to be the slaves of pride, it is a vain attempt, and contributes
nothing towards that happy life which they foolishly imagine. To the same
purpose he adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

under one thing the whole duty of rulers, and says that King Josiah was upright,
just, and equitable, that he not only abstained from wrongs, but also assisted
the innocent whom he saw oppressed, and of his own accord interposed to prevent
any to molest them. He then under one thing comprehends everything that belongs
to the office of a just and upright judge. For it is the first thing for judges
to abstain from all rapacity and violence; and the second thing is to extend a

fE50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Prophet shews again whence
proceeded the liberty which King Jehoiakim took in luxury and superfluous
display, as well as in plunder, cruelty, and oppression, even because he had
cast away every care and concern for religion; for where a real knowledge of God
exists, men must necessarily have regard to uprightness and moderation. He then
who thus acts cruelly towards his neighbors, clearly shews that every thought of
religion and every care for it is rooted out of his heart. In short, the Prophet
means that Jehoiakim was not only unjust towards men, but was also guilty of
impiety; for except he had become a profane despiser of God, he would not have
thus unjustly oppressed his neighbors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage deserves to be noticed, as it shews
that piety leads men to all the duties of love. Where God then is known,
kindness to man also appears. So also on the other hand we may conclude, that
all regard for God is extinguished, and all fear of him is abolished, when men
wilfully do wrong to one another, and when they seek to oppress or defraud one
another. There is therefore no doubt but that gross impiety will be found where
the offices of love are neglected. For when Jeremiah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commended
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the piety of Josiah on this account, because he
executed judgment and justice, he doubtless condemned Jehoiakim, as though he
had said, that he was an abandoned and irreclaimable apostate; for had he
retained a spark of religion, he would have acted more justly and humanely
towards his people. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet expresses more clearly how much
Jehoiakim differed from Josiah his father. He indeed shews that he was wholly
unlike him, because Josiah had endeavored to observe what was equitable, while
he set all his thoughts on fraud, plunder, and cruelty; for by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eye
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he means all the faculties of his soul and
body. One of the main senses of the body, as it is well known, is the sight.
Hence the Prophet includes here whatever is external and internal in men, when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thine
eye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, all thy bodily senses are
set on covetousness, and also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thine
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, all thy thoughts,
feelings, designs, meditations, and purposes are employed in the same way. He
intimates, in short, that Jehoiakim was corrupt both in body and mind, so that
having cast aside every fear of God, he abandoned himself to avarice as well as
to plunder and all acts of oppression.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thine
eye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[xb</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

any sinful lust. He adds cruelty, for it, cannot be but that all are bloody who
give loose reins to their lusts. He mentions in the third place
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rapacity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">q&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

signifies rapacity. What follows in the last place is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>oppression</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or disquietude. As
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;wr</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

the Prophet indeed is, that Jehoiakim was not only intent on taking possession

could. It is lastly added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to

what has gone before, that Jehoiakim employed all his thoughts, and was wholly

a foolish and even a sottish lust for glory, so that he cast aside every care
for uprightness, the Prophet declares that disgrace was prepared for him; and
hence he compares him after his death to an ass.</font><br></div>

Josiah for honor&#8217;s sake, but for the purpose of touching him to the quick,
because he had degenerated from the piety of his father. But as he hoped that
the religion of Josiah would be to him a sort of covering, the Prophet derides
and checks this vain confidence. &#8220;Thou gloriest in being the son of King
Josiah, but thy holy father will avail thee nothing, for thou seemest avowedly
to shew that thou art wholly different from him. Though then thou art, descended
from Josiah, and though God has raised thee to the royal throne, yet there is no
reason for thee to be confident as to thy safety; for these benefits of God will
not preserve thee from that ignominious treatment which thou

of imitation the words of the mourners. That people, we know, were very vehement
in expressing their sorrow. And this ought to be borne in mind, because some
being persuaded that nothing is related by the Prophets but what ought to be
taken as an example, do therefore think that these modes of lamentation were
approved by God. But we have before seen what the Prophet said in

22:4,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Enter<i>

<div><font face="Palatino">yet we know that kings had been forbidden to make
such ostentations; but God did not scrupulously refer to what was lawful or
right in speaking of royal splendor; so also when he spoke of funeral rites. We
ought not then to make a law of what the Prophet says, as though it were right
and proper to bewail the dead with howling. There is indeed no doubt, but these
excesses which the Prophet mentions were not only foolish, but also wholly
condemnable; for we often vie with one another in our lamentations; and when men
intemperately express their grief in funerals, they excite themselves into a
sort of madness in crying and bewailing, and then when they compose themselves
and simulate grief, they act a part as in a theater. But the Prophet here speaks
only according to the common practice of the age, when he says, &#8220;They<i>
</i>shall not bewail him,&#8221; etc.; that is, he states what was usually done,
when one embraced another, when a sister said, &#8220;Ah,<i> </i>my
brother!&#8221; and when a brother said, &#8220;Ah,<i> </i>my sister!&#8221; or,
when the people said, &#8220;Ah,<i> </i>lord, O king, where is thy glory! where
is thy honor! where thy crown! where thy scepter! where thy throne! &#8220; Very
foolish then were the lamentations which the Prophet mentions here. But as I
have already said, it is enough for us to know, that he refers to these rites,
then commonly practiced, without expressing his approbation of
them.</font><br></div>

before said, that it was justly deemed one of God&#8217;s curses when a carcass
was cast away unburied; for God would have burial a proof to distinguish us from
brute animals even after death, as we in life excel them, and as our condition
is much nobler than that of the brute creation. Burial is also a pledge as it
were of immortality; for when man&#8217;s body is laid hid in the earth, it is,
as it were, a mirror of a future life. Since then burial is an evidence of
God&#8217;s grace and favor towards mankind, it is on the other hand a sign of a
curse, when burial is denied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it has been elsewhere said, that temporal
punishments ought not always to be viewed alike; for God has suffered sometimes
his faithful servants to be unburied, according to what we read in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
79:2, 3, that their bodies were cast forth in the fields, that they were exposed
to be eaten by the beasts of the earth and by the birds of heaven. Those spoken
of were the true and sincere worshippers of God. But we know that the good and
the bad have temporal punishments in common; and this is true as to famine and
nakedness, pestilence and war. The destruction of the city Jerusalem was a just
punishment on the wicked; and yet Daniel and Jeremiah were driven into exile
together with the wicked, and suffered great hardships; and, in short, they were
so mixed with the ungodly, that their external condition was in nothing
different. So, then, the state of things in the world is often in such disorder,
that we cannot distinguish between the good and the bad by outward
circumstances. But still it is right ever to hold this truth, that when burial
is denied to a man, it is a sign of God&#8217;s curse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, the Prophet says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall be buried with the
burial of an ass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He mentions the ass
because it is a mean animal; he might have named a horse or an ox, but as the
ass is a meaner and more contemptible animal, it is the same thing as though he
had said, &#8220;Jehoiakim<i> </i>shall be cast away with the dogs.&#8221; This
prophecy no doubt grievously wounded not only the mind of the king himself, but
also that of the whole people; for as yet his throne stood, and all highly
regarded the family of David, and thought the kingdom sacred, as it was under
the guardianship and protection of God. But the Prophet hesitated not to
denounce what was afterwards confirmed by the event; for Jehoiakim was buried
with the burial of an ass, as he was cast forth far beyond the gates of
Jerusalem. Here the Prophet amplifies the disgrace by which the King Jehoiakim
would be branded, for he might have been left dead in a journey; but he
expresses what is more grievous than the casting forth;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Drawn
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; that is, Jehoiakim shall
not only be cast forth, but also drawn as an ass or a dog, lest his foetor
should infect the city; as though he was unworthy not only of a grave, but also
of being seen by men.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE54</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is to be especially noticed, for we hence
conclude how great his perverseness was in despising the threatenings of God,
since the Prophet could not otherwise storm the mind of the king, and terrify
the people, than by exaggerating the indignity that was to happen to him. For if
there had been any teachable spirit in the king and the people, the Prophet
would have been content with making a simple statement, &#8220;Jehoiakim shall
not be buried;&#8221;<i> </i>that is, God will punish him even when dead; the
curse of God will not only be upon him while living, but he will also take
vengeance on him after his death. He was not content with this kind of
statement; but </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall be

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be cast far
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and further still, his carcass

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah triumphs over the Jews, and derides their
presumption in thinking that they would be safe, though God was against them. He
then shews that they were deceived in promising to themselves impunity; but he
bids them to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ascend Mount
Lebanon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry aloud on Mount
Bashan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that they might know that there
would be no aid for them when God&#8217;s judgment came. But the whole verse is
ironical; for they would in vain cry and howl. Indeed, the Prophet thus treated
them, because he saw that they were wholly irreclaimable. They were not worthy
then that he should give them counsel, or faithfully warn them. He was therefore
under the necessity ironically to deride their madness in promising safety to
themselves, while they were continuing to provoke God&#8217;s vengeance against
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But at the same time he accommodates what he says to
their intentions; for there is no doubt but that they ever cast their eyes
either on Egypt or on Assyria for any aid they might want. Hence he says,

fE55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We learn from the end of the
verse that the Prophet said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend, and
cry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by way of derision. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lovers
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he means the Egyptians and the Assyrians, and
other neighboring nations; for the Jews, when they feared any danger, were wont
to flee to their neighbors, and God was in the meantime neglected by them; and
for this reason they were called lovers. God had espoused the people as his own,
and hence he often called them his wife, and he speaks here in the feminine
gender; and thus the people are compared to a wife, and God assumes the
character of a husband. When, therefore, the people, according to their
self-will and humor, wandered here and there, this levity was called adultery;
for the simplicity of faith is our spiritual chastity; for as a wife who regards
her husband alone, keeps conjugal fidelity and chaste conduct, so when we
continue to cleave to God alone, we are, in a spiritual sense, chaste as he
requires us to be; but when we seek our safety from this and that quarter, we
violate the fidelity which we owe to God. As soon, then, as we cast our thoughts
here and there, it is to act like a woman who seeks vagrant and unlawful
connections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the reason why the Prophet compares the
Egyptians and Assyrians to lovers, for he intimates that the people of Israel
did in this manner commit adultery, as it has been stated in other places. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God shews that the people were worthy of the
reward he had mentioned, even to mourn and to seek aid on every side without
finding any. It, indeed, often happens that the excessive severity of a husband
alienates his wife from his society; and when a husband, through want of
thought, attends to other things and neglects his domestic affairs, and thus his
wife goes astray; or when he connives at things when he sees his wife exposed to
dangerous allurements and flatteries, the fault is in part to be ascribed to
him. But God shews here that he had performed the duties of a good and faithful
husband, and also that it was not his fault that the people did not perform
their part.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I spoke to
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says; that is, thou canst not
say that thou hast gone astray through ignorance; for they who are proved guilty
are wont to flee to this kind of excuse, &#8212; &#8220;I did not think; had I
been warned, I would have attended to good advice; but on slippery ground it is
easy to fall, especially when no one stretches forth his hand to give any
help.&#8221; But God takes away here every pretext of this kind, and says, that
he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>as though he had said, &#8220;I<i> </i>warned thee in time; thou hast not
then sinned through ignorance or want of thought.&#8221; In short, God condemns
here the perverseness of the people, that they knowingly and wilfully abandoned
themselves to every kind of wickedness. Now this passage deserves special
notice; for we see that it is a twofold crime, when God in due time speaks to us
and calls us to the right way, and we refuse to hear; for our wickedness is
inexcusable when we suffer not ourselves to be corrected<i> </i>by
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I spoke to thee, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in thy
tranquillity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this circumstance also
their crime is aggravated; for God not only by his Prophets made known to his
people what was right, but had also, by his blessing, conciliated them to
himself. For when a husband counsels his wife, and is at the same time austere
or peevish, his wife will disregard whatever she may hear, for her mind will be
preoccupied with dislike; but when a husband treats his wife kindly, and proves
by his benevolence the love he entertains for her, and at the same time shews
prudence in his conduct towards her, she must necessarily be of a very bad
disposition if she is not moved by such advice, kindness, and benevolence on the
part of her husband. Now, God shews here that he had sent Prophets in order to
keep his people in the faithful discharge of their duties, and that he had also
been kind and bountiful to them, that thereby they might be sweetly drawn to
obey him. Therefore, by the word &#8220;tranquillity,&#8221; the Prophet sets
forth God&#8217;s kindness and bounty towards his
people.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE56</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, true what Moses says, that men are
like mettlesome and wanton horses when they become fat.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:15.) So fatness and tranquillity have such effect as to render us more
refractory. Yet this cannot avail for an excuse when God kindly invites us, and
connects with his doctrine kind and paternal benevolence, and confirms it by the
effects when we are teachable and yield him willing obedience. Thus the Prophet
closed the mouths of the Jews, for they would have sought probably to make this
objection, &#8212; that vengeance was too vehemently denounced on them, and that
God suddenly assailed them; but he shews that when in tranquillity and
prosperity they might have acknowledged God&#8217;s paternal kindness, they had
yet been rebellious and had abused the indulgence of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I spoke to thee, he says, in thy tranquillity,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thou didst say, I will not
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is not, indeed, probable that
the Jews had spoken so insolently as to say openly and in such plain words, that
they would not be obedient; but the Prophet regards their life and not their
words. Though, then, the Jews did not express these words, &#8212; that they
would not obey God; yet such language might have been clearly inferred from
their conduct, for they were so perverse as not to render obedience to God and
to his counsels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, in the third place, that it had been the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>custom
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>people from their childhood not
to hear the voice </i></font><font face="Palatino">of God. It is the height of
impiety when we are not only refractory for one day or a short time, but when we
pursue wickedness continually. God in the meantime intimates that he had from
the beginning been solicitous for the safety of his people, but in vain. It
sometimes happens that he who has become hardened in his vices, begins to be
taught after the thirtieth or fortieth: year, but he is not very<i> </i>pliable;
for men become hard by long usage; we see that old men are less teachable than
the young; and why? because age in a manner makes them sturdy, so that they
cannot bear to be turned and ruled. But God shews here, that such was the
wickedness of his people, that they had been rebellious from their childhood; as
though he had said, &#8220;Thou<i> </i>canst not make this excuse, that thou
hast been for a long time without a teacher that thou hast been without any
wisdom and understanding, and that on this account thou hast become hardened in
evils; no, because I have found thee wholly unteachable from thy very<i>
</i>childhood; it was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy custom,

<div><font face="Palatino">As the main fault was in the chief men, therefore God
shews, that there would be no defense found in their prudence and wealth, when
things came to an extremity: and it was a usual thing for the common people,
when reproved, to refer to their rulers as their shield: nor is there a doubt
but that the Jews made this objection to God&#8217;s Prophets, &#8212;
&#8220;What do you mean? that God has suffered us to be unhappily governed by
bad princes? then he has exposed us as a prey to wolves: now if he punishes us,
it seems an unjust thing for us to suffer for the fault of others.&#8221; At the
same time, they who thus spoke were secure and despised God, because they
thought that their safety was secured by their chief men.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wind shall eat

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means that all would be consumed by
the wind. Sometimes, indeed, men are said to feed on the wind, that is, when
they entertain vain confidences. So the wind means in other places vain hopes,
as they say; but it is in another sense that the Prophet speaks, when he says
that pastors would be eaten up by the wind, that is, that they would vanish away
like the smoke. Thus God shews that their presumption, and frauds, and false
imaginations, were nothing but smoke and
emptiness.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE58</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then speaks of their

that they would be impregnable as long as the throne of David stood; and then we
know that the common people were easily deceived by external splendor, when they
saw that the priests as well as the prophets and the king&#8217;s counsellors
were endued with craftiness, and swelling with great pride; and hence they
disregarded what the prophets threatened. Now, the second ground of confidence
was their alliance with the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and other neighboring
nations. Therefore God, after having said, that all their pastors would be
destroyed, adds, that the Egyptians and others would be driven into
captivity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,

wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the Jews had not sinned
only in one thing, but had added evils to evils, so that they had provoked

however, would not be that which availed to repentance, but extorted; for the
reprobate, willing or unwilling, are often constrained to acknowledge their
shame. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms the same thing in other words;
and hence it appears how difficult it is to shake off from men their false
confidence, when they give themselves up to earthly things. As soon, then, as
false confidence strikes its roots into the hearts of men, they cannot be moved
either by any threatenings or by any dangers; even though death itself were
hanging over them, they yet remain unconcerned: and hence Isaiah upbraids them
and says, That they had made a covenant with death.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15.) This was the reason why the Prophet here multiplied words and used
greater vehemence; it was for the purpose of correcting that perverseness which
prevailed among the Jews; for they thought themselves beyond the reach of those
darts which God&#8217;s hands would throw.</font><br></div>

this figuratively of the cedar houses in which they dwelt; that is, that they
ornamented their houses or palaces, as we have seen, with boards of cedar. But I
take the words more simply, &#8212; That they considered Lebanon as an
impregnable stronghold, and that he compares them to birds which choose the
highest cedars to make their nests in. The meaning is, that the Jews were so
blinded by their pride, that they thought that they had Lebanon as a safe
refuge, and also that they imagined that they had nests as it were in its
cedars. But there is no doubt but that the Prophet, in mentioning this one
particular, meant to include all those false and vain confidences with which the
Jews were inebriated. But he speaks by way of concession, as though he had said,
that the Jews were not terrified by God&#8217;s threatenings, because they cast
their eyes on Lebanon and on its lofty cedars.</font><br></div>

thinking that they would have a quiet station on Lebanon, and by having their
nests in the cedars, for God would bring on them sudden pains like those of
women, who, while laughing and full of mirth, are in a moment seized with the
pangs of childbearing. Jeremiah now says, that a similar thing would happen to
the Jews. I touch but lightly on this point, while yet it is worthy of long and
careful meditation. Let us then know, that nothing is more intolerable to God
than when we promise to ourselves a quiet rest while he proclaims war against
us, and while we, as it were designedly, daily provoke him. It follows &#8212;

elsewhere, that the Jews were so fascinated as to think that, God was bound to
them; and at the same time they allowed themselves every liberty in sinning,
under the pretense that God had promised that the kingdom of David would remain
as long as the sun and moon continued in the heavens,

consider that many were Abraham&#8217;s children according to the flesh, who
were not his lawful children before God. As to the king himself, he never

Jehoiachin. The Prophet then calls him Coniah by way of contempt, as though he

the severe vengeance which God would take on Jeconiah. And though he was in his
thirty-seventh year brought out of prison, and admitted unto the royal table,
among other princes, he yet died in exile; and perhaps it would have been better
for him to continue in prison till his death than to have been corrupted by
allurements when he became one of the princes, for he thus defiled himself.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again changes the person, and yet not
inelegantly, for he speaks here as one indignant, and after having addressed a
few words to King Jeconiah, he turns aside from him and declares what God would
do. Thus, when we think one hardly worthy to be addressed, we change our
discourse; and after having spoken a few words to him, we take another mode of
speaking. In the same manner, the Prophet spoke very indignantly when he
addressed Jehoiakim, and then he declared how God would deal with him: he passed
by him as though he was deaf or unworthy of being noticed. We thus see the
design of the Prophet in the change he makes in this passage.</font><br></div>

king and his mother would die in a foreign land, and he now confirms the same
thing; for the foolish notion, that the king of Babylon would be at length
propitious to them, could not but with great difficulty be eradicated from their
minds: nor is there a doubt but that such thoughts as these were entertained,
&#8212; &#8220;When Nebuchadnezzar shall see us coming suppliantly to him, he
will be turned to mercy, for what more does he require? He does not mean to fix
here his royal palace; it; will satisfy him to have the people tributary to him;
and when he shall find that I am a man of no courage, he will prefer having me a
king, rather than to appoint a new one.&#8221; Such, then, was the reasoning
which the king had with his courtiers. Hence this vain persuasion is what the
Prophet now demolishes: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
raise up their mind </i></font><font face="Palatino">to the land, that is, they
think of a free return at length into their own country; for to raise up the

<div><font face="Palatino">As the Prophet was hardly able to convince the Jews
of what he had foretold, he confirms the same thing; but he speaks here as of
what was incredible. He assumes the character of one greatly wondering, that
others might cease to wonder. He then asks, whether it was possible that
Jeconiah should be driven into exile and there miserably perish? We now see the
design of the Prophet, that as the Jews thought that the kingdom would be
perpetual, it was necessary to shake off such a notion, so that they might know
that God had not in vain threatened what we have already noticed. But there is
in these questions a kind of irony, for the Prophet might have made a positive
assertion in plain words; but from regard to others, he hesitates through
wonder, or seems to doubt as of a thing that was monstrous.</font><br></div>

left out by way of contempt; still, as the Jews were so blinded by the royal
dignity that they could not believe the prophecy, he asks respecting it as of a
thing incredible. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is he a
vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>etc., he adds. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cali, </i>we know, is taken for any kind of vessel; for the ancients called
all kinds of furniture vessels. He asks, then,

he a vessel in which there is no delight? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He
had before said that he was a despised statue.

And we know that it is a hard lot when one is driven far away from his own
country. There is, then, no doubt but that the Prophet enhances the grievousness
of the evil when he speaks of an unknown country: for Zedekiah, who was put on
the throne, was his uncle; and of his posterity the first was Salathiel, born in
exile. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet more fully confirms what I have lately
referred to; and the repetition was not superfluous in exclaiming
&#8220;earth&#8221; three times, for as the hardness of iron is overcome by the
repeated strokes of the hammer, so the Prophet repeated the word
&#8220;earth,&#8221;<i> </i>that he might subdue that perverseness in which the
Jews had so hardened themselves that no threats of God moved them. He did not
adopt this vehemence,<i> </i>as rhetoricians do who aim to appear eloquent; but
it was necessity that constrained him thus to assail that refractory people, who
would have otherwise turned a deaf ear to what we have observed and read. By
this preface, then, the Prophet especially shews that he spoke of God&#8217;s
dreadful judgment, and also reminded the Jews of the certainty of this prophecy,
though they were persuaded that the kingdom would never fall. Hence in this
repetition we see that there is an implied reproof, as though he had said that
they were indeed deaf, but that it was to no purpose, for they would be
constrained to see the fulfillment of what they did not then believe.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Earth, earth, earth,
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he
says.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">  fE67</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, Write ye this
man solitary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or childless. Some think
that these words were addressed to angels or to prophets; but I regard not such
a notion as well founded: this mode of speaking seems rather to me to have been
taken from common practice, for decrees which were to continue in force for a
long time were usually written. When an edict was proclaimed, and was to be in
force only for a few days, it was not commonly recorded in the public monuments;
but when a law was enacted, which was to be binding on posterity, it was written
in the public tablets. Then the Prophet intimates that this judgment of God
could not be rendered void, nor would be momentary like decrees which in a few
days are disregarded and soon forgotten, but that it would be certain and
permanent. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Write
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this man
childless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This bereavement is set in
opposition to the promise of God, that there would be perpetual successors to
David on his throne as long as the sun and moon were in the heavens. (Psalm
139:37.) And the Prophet shews here that this promise as to Jeconiah would not
be fulfilled.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE68</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds, Write ye
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this man as one who will not
prosper in his days; nay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>seems to me to be emphatic here,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no one of his seed shall prosper;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and then he adds an explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sitting on the throne of David,
and ruling any more in Judah.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, it is no wonder that the Jews regarded this
judgment of God with abhorrence, as though it was something monstrous, for God
seemed to them to be inconsistent with himself, for he had testified that his
covenant would never be rendered void, and had appealed to the sun and moon as
witnesses. Hence, when the posterity of David failed, at least when his throne
was subverted, and no one appeared as his successor, the truth of the promise
seemed to have failed, which was very strange. But it was possible for God, who
doeth wonders, to execute such punishment on Jeconiah and on such as were like
him, and yet in a secret and incomprehensible manner to bring things about, so
that the covenant which he had made should not wholly fail. The grace of God,
then, was hidden for a time, but never extinguished; for at length a rod did
grow up from the stem of Jesse, as it is said by Isaiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However, the words seem to imply otherwise, for
Jeconiah is said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>solitary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unprosperous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and lastly, the Prophet declares that no one of his seed would sit on the
royal throne. But we must bear in mind that these words are to be confined to a
temporary punishment, and extend only to the coming of Christ, though the
posterity of David, as we shall hereafter see, did begin to arise in Zerubbabel,
but this was only an obscure and a small prelude. We must, therefore, come to
the time of Christ if we would reconcile these two things which seem repugnant,
&#8212; that Jeconiah became childless, and that a successor from the seed of
David never failed; it was so, because this childlessness was only for a time;
and this interruption of God&#8217;s grace was something like death; but in
course of time it appeared that God was mindful of his covenant, even at a time
when he seemed to have forgotten it. And this prophecy, therefore, ought; to be
connected with that of Ezekiel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Remove ye, remove,
remove the crown until he</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">comes
whose it is.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
21:26, 27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There, also, Ezekiel repeats the word
&#8220;remove&#8221;<i> </i>three times, as though he had said that there would
be no kingdom of David, not only for a few months or years, but through a series
of many ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no wonder, then, that the Prophet declares
here that Jeconiah would be childless, for such a sad calamity for so many ages,
as the throne of David trodden under foot with scorn and contempt, might have
overwhelmed the faithful with despair. This, then, was the reason why he said
that he would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>childless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and also that his whole posterity would be under a curse. But we must bear
in mind that exception, which is expressed by another Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;until he comes
whose the crown is.&#8221;<i>

21:27)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it was reserved for the head of Christ, though
for a long time it had been exposed to dishonor and to the reproaches of all
nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is useful to know this, for we are taught that
God is ever so consistent with himself, that his covenant, which he has made
with Christ and with all his members, never fails, and that yet he punishes
hypocrites even unto death. If any one, during a long period, had sought for the
Church in the world, there was none in appearance; yet God shewed that he was
faithful to his promises, for suddenly there arose a people regenerated by the
Gospel, so that his covenant was not dead, but as it were for a time buried. The
truth of God, then, was proved by the event; and yet he took a dreadful
vengeance on the ingratitude of men when he thus blinded the whole world, now
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet promises the restoration of the
Church; but he reminds hypocrites that there was no reason for them on that
account to flatter themselves, especially the king, his councillors, and the
priests. Then this prophecy is a mixture of promises and threatenings, for God
promises that he would be propitious to the miserable Jews, after having
chastised them, so that the seed of Abraham might not be entirely cut off: he
yet deprives hypocrites of vain confidence, so that they might not falsely apply
to themselves the hope of salvation, from which they had excluded themselves by
their impiety. And this is what ought to be noticed, for as soon as God&#8217;s
mercy is offered, hypocrites apply to themselves whatever God promises, and
become more and more insolent, as though they held him bound to them; for
impunity leads them to take more liberty to sin. Hence it is that they boast
that they are safe, for they consider themselves to be the people of God. The
Prophet, therefore, teaches here that whatever God promises belongs to his
elect, that it does not appertain indiscriminately to all, nor ought to be
extended to hypocrites who falsely pretend his name, but that it peculiarly
belongs to the elect, though they may be small in number, and though they may be
despised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo to the pastors who
destroy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. Here are contrary things
&#8212; a pastor and a destroyer! But he concedes to them the name which was
honorable; and yet he derides their false boasting, for they thought that they
could hide their crimes under this shade, falsely claimed. Though then he calls
them pastors, he yet removes the mask, and thus shews that they in vain boasted
while they assumed the name of pastors. &#8220;Ye are pastors,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;&#8220;and ye are destroyers!
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who dissipate
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or scatter
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the flock of my
pastures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE70</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here God shews the reason why he was so grievously
displeased with these pastors; for by exercising tyranny over the people, they
not only injured men, but also injured and dishonored God, who had received
under his own protection his chosen people. It is indeed true that they deserved
such a scattering; for we have already seen in many places, that the people
could by no means be excused when they were deceived by wicked and unfaithful
leaders; for in this way was rendered to them all their past reward for having
provoked God&#8217;s wrath against themselves, from the least to the greatest.
But the impiety of wicked pastors was not on this account excusable; for they
ought to have considered for what purpose this burden was laid on them, and also
by whom they had been appointed. God then intimates that great injury was done
to him, when the people were thus so ignominiously scattered. He was himself the
chief pastor; he had put as it were in his own place the king and his
counsellors and also the priests. Justly then does he now condemn them, because
they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed the flock
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God, according to what is said in another
place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;That they had
destroyed his
vineyard.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
12:10;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
5:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, when God calls the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the flock of his
pastures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does not regard what they
deserved, or what they were, but he, on the contrary, sets forth the favor
bestowed on the seed of Abraham. He has respect then here to his gratuitous
adoption, though the Jews had rendered themselves unworthy of such a
benefit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, the God of
Israel, to the pastors who feed my people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In the same sense he calls them now his people, as he had called them before
the flock of his pastures. They had alienated themselves from God, and he had
already by his own decree repudiated them; and God might in one respect have
deemed them aliens; and yet in respect of the covenant he acknowledged them as
his own; and hence he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now then confirms what we
have already noticed, that these pastors were not only thieves and robbers, but
also sacrilegious; for they not only had exercised cruelty towards the flock,
but as far as they could injured and dishonored God himself, who had undertaken
the care of that people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is here a twofold concession, he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pastors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and they are said to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feed
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the people. He had said before that they
destroyed and scattered the flock, and now he says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fed
</i></font><font face="Palatino">them; but in what sense we well know, for by
this kind of irony he meant to reprove them; they boasted that they were
pastors, and they thought that their crimes would by such a covering be buried
in the sight of God, as in the sight of men. In a similar manner when we speak
in the present day of the Pope and his mitred bishops and filthy clergy, we use
expressions which are commonly employed. But Antichrist is everything but a
father, and we know how far they are from being really bishops who assume the
title; and as to the clergy, the name is sacred, but they are very far from
being God&#8217;s heritage. We indeed make no account of these empty titles. But
it is a great aggravation of their guilt, that they being devils, should assume
angelic names, that they being wolves and robbers, and sacrilegious, should
falsely pretend God&#8217;s name, and recommend themselves by spurious titles,
as though they were pastors, bishops, abbots, and prelates, and what
not.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So then our Prophet calls those whom he condemns, by
way of taunt,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pastors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, were called for this end, to do this work. But he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My flock have ye scattered, and
driven away, and not
visited</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Surely it was not to feed, to
have no care for the sheep. To <i>visit </i>is to be extended here to every part
of the duty of overseeing, as though he had said, that the flock had been by
them neglected, betrayed, and deserted. We hence see that they had wholly
neglected their pastoral office. But the other two things are still worse, for
they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scattered
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>driven away
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the flock. Their sloth in neglecting the flock
was not to be tolerated; but it was still more intolerable when they exercised
so much cruelty as to scatter the flock as though they were deadly enemies; and
yet these are the things for which Jeremiah condemns them. We hence see that
there was an implied taunt, when he conceded to them the office of
feeding.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then denounces judgment on them, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will visit upon you the
wickedness of your doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God
declares that he would punish the pastors, to whom was justly ascribed the
scattering of the people. For though no one was exempt from blame, as it has
been before stated; yet the main fault belonged to these pastors. This then is
the reason why God declares that he would take vengeance; for he would not have
his flock scattered with impunity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will gather
</i></font><font face="Palatino">my flock. As they had driven the people away,
so God promises that it would be his care to gather them. And yet he ascribes to
himself what he had imputed to them &#8212; that he had driven away his flock,
but in a different sense; the pastors had scattered the flock, not only by their
sloth, but also by their cruelty, for they became rapacious wolves; but God had
punished the people, for they all had fully deserved such a scattering. We hence
see that the ungodly execute God&#8217;s judgment; but they are not on this
account excusable as though they were God&#8217;s ministers, for they have
nothing less in view. Nor can God be involved in their sin, while he thus
employs them to execute<i> </i>his purpose. In short, the scattering of the
people was a just punishment from God, for they had all departed from the faith,
they had broken the sacred bond of the covenant, by which God had bound them to
himself. It was also the fault of the pastors, because they avariciously and
cruelly tyrannized over them. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pastors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as I have said, were not only the priests, but also the king and his
counsellors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
gather</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, not the flock, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant of the
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God intimates here that he would
be so merciful as to receive unto favor, not all indiscriminately, but a small
number, constituting the elect. And hence Paul carefully distinguished between
the people and the remnant of grace, or the gratuitous remnant; for Christ
appeared by his coming to have abolished the covenant by which God had adopted
the children of Abraham, but Paul does not admit this. Now, if any one objects
and says that the greater part of the people had been cut off, this he allows;
but he says that the covenant remains valid in the remnant, and produces also
examples, such as that of which we now speak. God then has ever been the
preserver of his Church; and thus his gratuitous adoption, by which he had
chosen the seed of Abraham, never fails. But this adoption is effectual only as
to the remnant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remnant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the fewness of those whom God had resolved to gather is not only intimated,
but also the vengeance, which as to time had gone before; for God seemed to have
destroyed the Jews when they were driven away into various lands, as they had no
name remaining, the kingdom and the priesthood were abolished. It was therefore
a certain kind of death, as I have before said; but God here declares that there
would be some remnant, according to what is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:22, that God saved a few as it were from the consumption; for he refers there
to the very few that remained alive, when they thought that all was over with
the whole people, that there was no hope of restoration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
gather</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the residue of my sheep from all
the lands to which I shall have driven them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He again confirms what I have stated, that there would be no place for mercy
until he had cleansed his Church from its many filthy pollutions. The scattering
then of the people into various lands was the purgation of the Church, according
to what God says, that he would separate the refuse and the chaff from the wheat
in chastising his people; for as the chaff and the refuse are blown here and
there when the wheat is winnowed, and the wheat only remains and is afterwards
laid up in the granary; so when God drove his people away into various lands, he
then purged his Church. If any one objects and says, &#8220;Then the remnant
were dealt with like the refuse;&#8221; it is true as to the individuals, but
God refers here to himself, when he calls them his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>own,
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who were yet unworthy of such an
honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bring them back to their
folds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they might be
fruitful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, bring forth and
increase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and be
multiplied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By folds he no doubt means
the land of Canaan; for there was then no wealth in the world which the Jews
would have preferred to the inheritance promised to them; the whole world was to
them an exile. For God had chosen that land in which they dwelt, and had
consecrated it to himself, and he gave it to them as an earnest or a pledge of
the eternal inheritance. Rightly then does he now call that land folds, for they
lived there under his guardianship and protection. The temple was as it were the
pastoral staff; they knew that God dwelt there, that being protected by his
power they might continue in safety. Since then there was safety for them under
God&#8217;s protection in the land of Canaan, he calls it their fold. Then he
says, that they may <i>be
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fruitful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be
multiplied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for among other blessings
their increase was not the least. He afterwards adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

for it would not be enough that the sheep should be restored to their folds,

therefore has need of a shepherd to rule and guide it. God then intimates by
these words, that after he had collected his flock into the fold it would be the
object of his constant care; for he would appoint pastors, who would discharge
their office in a far different way from wolves and sacrilegious robbers. He

EIGHTY-FIFTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said in our yesterday&#8217;s Lecture, that when
the Lord promised to give pastors, he pointed out by this mode of speaking the
continuance of his favor; as though he had said, that he would not only be the
Redeemer of his people, but would also take care of the safety of those whom he
delivered from exile. The two things are indeed necessary, for it would have
profited them nothing to have the hand of God stretched forth once in their
behalf, except he continued his favors to them to the end. The sum of the whole,
then, is this, that the Jews, after being restored to their own country, would
be under God&#8217;s protection, so that their safety would be secured, and be
permanent and not momentary.</font><br></div>

is not enough for him to rule and guide the sheep, except He also defends them
against all violence, the incursions of robbers and wolves. Now, this
tranquillity is set in contrast with the disquietude with which the Jews had
been for a long time harassed; for we know that they had been tossed with great
anxieties, owing to the continual incursions of their enemies. As, then, they
were trembling continually when they heard rumors of war, God promises them here
a better condition, as we shall hereafter see more clearly. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what he had before said of the
renewal of the Church; for it would not have been in itself sufficiently strong
to say &#8220;I have promised pastors who shall faithfully perform their
duty,&#8221; except the only true Pastor had been set before them, on whom
God&#8217;s covenant was founded, and from whom was to be expected the
accomplishment of the promises which were hoped for. And it was usual with all
the prophets, whenever they gave the people the hope of salvation, to bring
forward the coming of the Messiah, for in him have God&#8217;s promises always
been, yea, and amen.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:20.) This, indeed, appears now, under the Gospel, more clear than
formerly; but the faith of the Fathers could not have been complete except they
directed their thoughts to the Messiah. As, then, neither the love of God could
have been made certain to the Fathers, nor the testimony of his kindness and
paternal favor be confirmed without Christ, this is the reason why the prophets
were wont to set Christ before their eyes whenever they sought to inspire the
miserable with a good hope, who otherwise must have been overwhelmed with sorrow
and driven into despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, therefore, so often occurs in the prophets is
deserving of special notice, so that we may know that God&#8217;s promises will
become ineffectual to us, or be suspended, or even vanish away, except we raise
all our thoughts to Christ, and seek in him what would not be otherwise certain
and sure to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to this principle the Prophet now says,
that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>days would come in which
God would raise up to David a righteous
branch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had spoken generally of
pastors; but the Jews might have still been in doubt, and hesitated to believe
that any such thing could be hoped for; hence God calls here their attention to
the Messiah; as though he had said, that no hope of salvation could be
entertained except through the Mediator who had been promised to them, and that
therefore they were not sufficiently wise except they turned their minds to him.
Moreover, as the accomplishment of salvation was to be expected through the
Mediator, God shews that the promise, that he would give them pastors, ought not
to be doubted. Hence it appears that I rightly stated at the beginning, that the
former doctrine is confirmed by this passage in which God promises the coming of
the Mediator. And the demonstrative particle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as we have elsewhere seen, is intended to shew certainty; and it was
necessary for the Jews to be thus confirmed, because the time had not as yet
arrived, and we know that their faith must have been grievously shaken by so
many and so long trials, had they not some support. God, then, seems to point
out the event as by the finger, though it was as yet very remote. He does not
intimate a short time, but he thus speaks for the sake of making the thing
certain, so that they might not faint through a long expectation.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the days
in which he will raise up to David a righteous
branch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>is often redundant, yet in this place it seems to me that God has
a reference to the covenant which he had made with David. And the Prophet did
this designedly, because the Jews were unworthy of being at all regarded by God;
but he here promises that he would be faithful to that covenant which he had
once made with David, because David himself was also faithful and embraced with
true faith the promise made to him. God then, as though he would have nothing to
do with that perverse and irreclaimable people, but with his servant David,
says, &#8220;I<i> </i>will raise up to David a righteous branch;&#8221; as
though he had said, &#8220;Though<i> </i>ye were even a hundred times unworthy
of having a Deliverer, yet the memory of David shall ever remain complete with
me, as he was perfect and faithful in keeping my covenant.&#8221; Now, it cannot
be doubted but that the Prophet speaks here of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Jews, in order to obscure this prophecy, will
have this to be applied to all the descendants of David; and thus they imagine
an earthly kingdom, such as it was under Solomon and others. But such a thing
cannot certainly be gathered from the words of the Prophet; for he does not
speak here of many kings, but of one only. The word &#8220;branch,&#8221;<i>
</i>I allow, may be taken in a collective sense; but what is afterwards said?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A king shall
reign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They may also pervert this, for
the word &#8220;king&#8221;<i> </i>is often taken for successors in a kingdom.
This is indeed true; but we ought to consider the whole context. It is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence it appears evident that some
particular king is intended, and that the words ought not to be applied to many.
And the last clause is a further confirmation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This shall be his name, by which
they shall call him, Jehovah our
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here also the Jews
pervert the words, for they make God the nominative case to the verb, as though
the words were, &#8220;Jehovah<i> </i>shall call him our
righteousness;<i>&#8221; </i>but this is contrary to all reason, for all must
see that it is a forced and strained version. Thus these miserable men betray
their own perverseness; for they pervert, without any shame, all the testimonies
in favor of Christ; and they think it enough to elude whatever presses hard on
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now, then, understand that this passage
cannot be explained of any but of Christ only. The design of the Holy Spirit we
have already explained; God had from the beginning introduced this pledge
whenever he intended to confirm faith in his promises; for without Christ God
cannot be a Father and a Savior to men; nor could he have been reconciled to the
Jews, because they had departed from him. How, indeed, could they have been
received into favor without expiation? and how could they have hoped that God
would become a Father to them, except they were reconciled to him? Hence without
Christ they could not rely on the promises of salvation. Rightly, then, have I
said, that this passage ought to be confined to the person of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we know of a certainty that he alone was a
righteous branch; for though Hezekiah and Josiah were lawful successors, yet
when we think of others, we must say, that they were monsters. Doubtless, with
the exception of three or four, they were all spurious and covenant-breakers;
yea, I say, spurious, for they had nothing in common with David, whom they ought
to have taken as an example of piety. Since, then, they were wholly unlike their
father David, they could not have been called righteous branches. They were,
indeed, perfidious and apostates, for they had departed from God and his law. We
hence see that there is here an implied contrast between Christ and all those
spurious children who yet had descended from David, though wholly unworthy of
such an honor on account of their impiety. Therefore as these kings had roused
God&#8217;s wrath against the people, and had been the cause of their exile, the
Prophet says now, that there would be at length a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteous
branch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, that though those did
all they could to subvert God&#8217;s covenant by their wicked deeds, there
would come at length the true and the only Son, who is elsewhere called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first-born
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in the whole world,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
139:27,) and that he would be a righteous branch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this ought to be carefully noticed; for neither
Hezekiah nor Josiah, nor any like them, when viewed in themselves, were worthy
of this sacred distinction,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>will make
him the first-born in the earth;&#8221; and
further,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My Son art
thou.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
2:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This could not have been said of any mortal man,
viewed in himself. And then it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will be to him a
Father, and he shall be to me a Son;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and the Apostle tells us, that this cannot be applied
even to angels.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:5.) As, then, this dignity is higher than angels&#8217; glory, it is certain
that none of David&#8217;s successors were worthy of such an honor. Hence Christ
is justly called a righteous Branch. At the same time, the Prophet, as I have
already reminded you, seems to set the perfect integrity of Christ in opposition
to the impiety of those who under a false pretense had exercised authority, as
though they were of that sacred race of whom it had been said, &#8220;I will be
to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And reign shall a
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This also has not been added
without reason, shortly after Jeconiah had been driven into exile, and also the
whole royal family had been exposed to every kind of reproach. The crown,
indeed, was cast on the ground, as it has already appeared, and was trodden
under feet. There was, therefore, no hope of a future kingdom when the seed of
Abraham had become, as it were, extinct. This is the reason why God promises
what we now hear of the restoration of the throne; and we may easily infer from
what all the prophets have said, that the salvation of the people was dependent
on the person of their king; and whenever God bade the people to entertain hope,
he set a king before their eyes.<i> </i>A king was to be their head under
God&#8217;s government. We now see the design of the Prophet in saying, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king would
reign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that a king is to be understood as in
opposition to a tyrant, because many kings had departed from their duty, and
committed robbery under that specious authority. I have no doubt but that the
word king was expressed, lest the people should doubt the fulfillment of this
prophecy; for if it had been only said, &#8220;I<i> </i>will raise up to David a
righteous Branch, and he shall reign,&#8221; they might, indeed, have
entertained some hope, but it would have been small, and not full and complete.
We, indeed, know that Zerubbabel and others excelled in some things, and were
highly regarded for David&#8217;s sake; but there was then no kingdom. God
therefore intended here expressly to testify that there would be the high
privilege of a kingdom, that there might be nothing wanting to the Jews, as the
power of Christ would not be inferior to the power of David.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall a
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, he shall reign
gloriously, so that there would not be merely some remnants of pristine dignity,
but that a king would flourish, become strong, and attain perfection, such as it
was under David and Solomon, and much more
excellent.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE75</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>follows, &#8212; And shall act
prudently, and shall do judgment and justice in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>or, &#8220;he<i> </i>shall
prosper,&#8221; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shecal, </i>means both; yet the Prophet seems here to speak of right judgment
rather than of success, for the two clauses ought to be read together, &#8220;he
shall act prudently,&#8221; and &#8220;he shall do judgment and justice.&#8221;
It seems then that he means this in short, &#8212; that Christ would be endued
with the spirit of wisdom as well as of uprightness and equity, so that he would
possess all the qualifications, and fulfill all the duties of a good and perfect
king.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE76</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And in the first place, wisdom or prudence is
necessary; for probity alone would not be sufficient in a king. In private
individuals indeed it is of no small value; but probity in a king, without
wisdom, will avail but little, hence, the Prophet here commends Christ for his
good discernment, and then mentions his zeal for equity and justice. It is
indeed true that Christ&#8217;s excellences are not sufficiently set forth by
expressions such as these; but the similitude is taken from men; for the first
endowment of a king is wisdom, and then integrity in the second place. And we
know that Christ is often compared to earthly kings, or set forth to us under
the image of an earthly king, in which we may see him; for God accommodates
himself to our ignorance. As, then, we cannot comprehend the unspeakable justice
of Christ or his wisdom, hence God, that he may by degrees lead us to the
knowledge of Christ, shadows him forth to us under these figures or types.
Though, then, what is said here does not come up to the perfection of Christ,
yet the comparison ought not to be deemed improper; for God speaks to us
according to the measure of our capacities, and<i> </i>could not at once in a
few words fully express what Christ is. But we must bear in mind that from
earthly kings we must ascend to Christ; for though he is compared to them, yet
there is no equality; after having contemplated in the type what our minds can
comprehend, we ought to ascend farther and much higher.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, the difference<i> </i>between the
righteousness of Christ and the righteousness of kings ought to be here noticed.
They who rule well can in no other way administer righteousness and judgment
than by being careful to render to every<i> </i>one his own, and that by
checking the audacity of the wicked, and by defending the good and the innocent;
this only is what can be expected from earthly kings. But Christ is far
different; for he is not only wise so as to know what is right and best, but he
also endues his own people with wisdom and knowledge; he executes judgment and
righteousness, not only because he defends the innocent, aids them who are
oppressed, gives help to the miserable, and restrains the wicked; but he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doeth
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he regenerates us
by his Spirit, and he also </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doeth
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he bridles, as it
were, the devil. We now then understand the design of what I said, that we ought
to mark the transcendency of Christ over earthly kings, and also the analogy;
for there is some likeness and some difference: the difference between Christ
and other kings is very great, and yet there is a likeness in some things; and
earthly kings are set forth to us as figures and types of him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah shall be saved
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in the days of this king. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>days
</i></font><font face="Palatino">we are not to understand the life only of
Christ, which he lived in this world, but that perpetuity of which Isaiah
speaks, when in wonder he asks,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;His age who shall
declare?&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
53:8;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for he died once, that he might live to God,
according to what Paul says.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:10.) It was then but a short beginning of life when Christ was manifested in
the world, and held converse with men; but his life is to continue for ever. It
is then the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that when Christ came and
descended from the Father, the Church would be saved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be now asked, &#8220;How long shall it be
saved?&#8221;<i> </i>the answer is, &#8220;As long as the King himself shall
continue; and there is no end to his kingdom.&#8221; It follows then that the
salvation of the Church will be for ever. This is the import of the
whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, though the Prophet speaks of the deliverance of
the people, there is yet no doubt but that he especially sets forth what
properly belongs to the kingdom of Christ. He is set over us as a king, that he
might be our Savior; and his salvation, though it extends to our bodies, ought
yet to be viewed as properly belonging to our souls; for the kingdom of Christ
is spiritual, and so is everything connected with it. Hence, when the Prophet
says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saved would be
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is the same thing as though he
promised that the happiness of the Church would be real and solid under
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel shall dwell in
confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for in a happy life the
first thing is, that we possess tranquil and quiet minds; for tranquillity has
not been without reason commended by the ancients. When all things which men
covet are heaped together, and what they think necessary for happiness, they yet
cannot be otherwise than miserable if their minds are not in a right state. It
is not then without cause that tranquillity is added, when mention is made of
salvation. And experience itself teaches us, that we have no salvation, unless
we, relying on Christ the Mediator, have peace with God, as Paul also mentions
it as the fruit of faith, and shews that we cannot otherwise but be always
miserable: we have peace<i>, </i>he says, with God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:1.) He hence also concludes that our very miseries are a help to our
salvation; for afflictions prove patience, patience exercises hope, and hope
never makes us ashamed; and the proof of this is added, because God thus really
shews that he is present with us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how fitly the Prophet connects
tranquillity of mind with happiness. Moreover it is certain that we do not yet
enjoy either salvation or peace, such as are here promised; but let us learn by
faith what salvation is, and also what is rest even in the midst of the
agitations to which we are continually exposed; for we recumb on God when we
cast our anchor in heaven. Since, then, the Prophet says here that Judah would
be saved and that Israel would be in a tranquil state, let us know that he
includes the whole kingdom of Christ from the beginning to the end, and that
therefore it is no wonder that he speaks of that perfect happiness, the first
fruits of which now only appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the name by which
they shall call him, Jehovah our
Righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words the
Prophet shews more clearly that he speaks not generally of David&#8217;s
posterity, however excellent they may have been, but of the Mediator, who had
been promised, and on whom depended the salvation of the people; for he says
that this would be his name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah our
Righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE77</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those Jews, who seem more modest than others, and
dare not, through a dogged pertinacity, to corrupt this passage, do yet elude
the application of this title to Christ, though it be suitable to him; for they
say that the name is given to him, because he is the minister of God&#8217;s
justice, as though it was said, that whenever this king appeared all would
acknowledge God&#8217;s justice as shining forth in him. And they adduce other
similar passages, as when Moses calls the altar, &#8220;Jehovah my
banner,&#8221; or my protection.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
17:15.) But there is no likeness whatever between an altar and Christ. For the
same purpose they refer to another passage, where it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And this is the
name by which they shall call
Jerusalem,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jehovah our
peace.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;264808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
48:85)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Moses meant nothing else than that the altar was
a monument of God&#8217;s protection; and Ezekiel only teaches, that the Church
would be as it were a mirror in which God&#8217;s mercy would be seen, as it
would shine forth then, as it were, visibly. But this cannot for the same reason
be applied to Christ; he is set forth here as a Redeemer, and a name is given to
him, &#8212; what name? the name of God. But the Jews object and say, that he
was God&#8217;s minister, and that it might therefore be in a sense applied to
him, though he was no more than a man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But all who without strife and prejudice judge of
things, can easily see that this name is suitably applied to Christ, as he is
God; and the Son of David belongs to him as he is man. The Son of David and
Jehovah is one and the same Redeemer. Why is he called the Son of David? even
because it was necessary that he should be born of that family. Why then is he
called Jehovah? we hence conclude that there is something in him more excellent
than what is human; and he is called Jehovah, because he is the only-begotten
Son of God, of one and the same essence, glory, eternity, and divinity with the
Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears evident to all who judge impartially
and considerately, that Christ is set forth here in his twofold character, so
that the Prophet brings before us both the glory of his divinity and the reality
of his humanity. And we know how necessary it was that Christ should come forth
as God and man; for salvation cannot be expected in any other way than from God;
and Christ must confer salvation on us, and not only be its minister. And then,
as he is God, he justifies us, regenerates us, illuminates us into a hope of
eternal life; to conquer sin and death is doubtless what only can be effected by
divine power. Hence Christ, except he was God, could not have performed what we
had to expect from him. It was also necessary that he should become man, that he
might unite us to himself; for we have no access to God, except we become the
friends of Christ; and how can we be so made, except by a brotherly union? It
was not then without the strongest reason, that the Prophet here sets Christ
before us both as a true man and the Son of David, and also as God or Jehovah,
for he is the only-begotten Son of God, and ever the same in wisdom and glory
with the Father, as John testifies in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:5, 11.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the simple and real meaning of
this passage, even that God would restore his Church, because what he had
promised respecting a Redeemer stood firm and inviolable. Then he adds what this
Redeemer would be and what was to be expected from him; he declares that he
would be the true God and yet the Son of David; and he also bids us to expect
righteousness from him, and everything necessary to a full and perfect
happiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by saying, God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>our
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Prophet still more
fully shews that righteousness is not in Christ as though it were only his own,
but that we have it in common with him, for he has nothing separate from us.
God, indeed, must ever be deemed just, though iniquity prevailed through the
whole world; and men, were they all wicked, could do nothing to impugn or mar
the righteousness of God. But yet God is not our righteousness as he is
righteous in himself, or as having his own peculiar righteousness; and as he is
our judge, his own righteousness is adverse to us. But Christ&#8217;s
righteousness is of another kind: it is ours, because Christ is righteous not
for himself, but possesses a righteousness which he communicates to us. We hence
see that the true character of Christ is here set forth, not that he would come
to manifest divine justice, but to bring righteousness, which would avail to the
salvation of men, For if we regard God in himself, as I have said, he is indeed
righteous, but is not our righteousness. If, then, we desire to have God as our
righteousness, we must seek Christ; for this cannot be found except in him. The
righteousness of God has been set forth to us in Christ; and all who turn away
from him, though they may take many circuitous courses, can yet never find the
righteousness of God. Hence Paul says that he has been given or made to us
righteousness, &#8212; for what end? that we might be made the righteousness of
God in him.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:30.) Since, then, Christ is made our righteousness, and we are
counted the righteousness of God in him, we hence learn how properly and fitly
it has been said that he would be <i>Jehovah, </i>not only that the power of his
divinity might defend us, but also that we might become righteous in him, for he
is not only righteous for himself, but he is our
righteousness.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE78</font></sup><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, after having spoken of the Redeemer who
was to be sent, now sets forth in high terms that great favor of God, and says
that it would be so remarkable and glorious, that the former redemption would be
nothing to the greatness and excellency of this. When the children of Israel
were brought up out of Egypt, God, we know, testified his power by many
miracles, in order that this favor towards his people might appear the more
illustrious; and rightly did the Prophets exhort and encourage the faithful to
entertain good hope by calling to their minds what was then done. But our
Prophet enhances the second redemption by this comparison, that hereafter the
kindness of God, with which he favored his people when he delivered them from
the bondage of Egypt, would not be remembered, but that something more
remarkable would be done, so that all would talk of it, and that all would
proclaim the immense benefit, which God would confer on them in delivering them
from their exile in Babylon.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE80</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that the

fE81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Yet he does not mean that the
memory of God&#8217;s favor towards the Israelites, when he brought them from
Egypt, was to be abolished; but he reasons here from the less to the greater, as
though he had said that it was an evidence of God&#8217;s favor that could not
be sufficiently praised, when he delivered his people from the land of Egypt,
that if it were taken by itself, it was worthy of being for ever remembered; but
that when compared with the second deliverance it would appear almost as
nothing. The meaning is, that the second redemption would be so much more
remarkable than the first, that it would obscure the remembrance of it, though
it would not obliterate it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage deserves to be especially noticed,
for we hence learn how much we ought to value that redemption which we have
obtained through the only-begotten Son of God. And hence, also, it follows that
we are more bound to God than the Fathers under the Law, as he has dealt far
more bountifully with us, and has put forth his power more fully and effectually
in our behalf. We further learn, that the Prophet does not in this prophecy
include a few years only, but the whole kingdom of Christ and its whole
progress. He indeed speaks of the return of the people to their own country, and
this ought to be allowed, though Christians have been too rigid in this respect;
for passing by the whole intermediate time between the return of the people and
the coming of Christ, they have too violently turned the prophecies to spiritual
redemption. There is no doubt but that the Prophet makes a beginning with the
free return of the people from captivity; but, as I have said, Christ&#8217;s
redemption is not to be separated from this, otherwise the accomplishment of the
promise would not appear to us, for a small portion only returned to their own
land. We also know that they were harassed with many and continual troubles, so
that their condition was always miserable, for nothing is worse than a state of
disquietude. We know further, that they were spoiled, and that often, and were
also reduced to a state of bondage. We know how cruelly they were treated at one
time by the Egyptians, and at another by the kings of Syria. Then more was
promised by Jeremiah than what God has really performed, except we include in
this prophecy the kingdom of Christ. But as God so restored his Church by the
hand of Cyrus, that it might be a kind of prelude<i> </i>to a future and perfect
redemption, it is no wonder that the prophets, whenever they spoke of the
people&#8217;s return and of the end of their exile, should look forward to
Christ and to his spiritual kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see the design of the Prophet, when he
says that the days would come in which their first redemption would not be
spoken of by the people, as a remarkable or as the chief evidence of God&#8217;s
favor and power, as their second redemption would far exceed
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the formula or manner of speaking,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Live does
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we know that the ancients used
such words in making a solemn oath, and whenever they sought to animate
themselves with hope under adversities. Whenever, then, they found themselves so
pressed down that they had no other escape from evil than through God&#8217;s
favor, they usually said that the God who had formerly been the Redeemer of his
people still lived, and that there was no diminution of his power, so that he
could ten times, or a hundred times, or a thousand times, if necessary, bring
help to his Church and to every member of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from all the lands to which I
shall have driven them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he says this
for two reasons, which we shall presently state. The change of person does not
obscure the meaning:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>does Jehovah, who
brought out and led his people from the land of the north, and from all the
lands to which I had driven them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but
there is no ambiguity in the sense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the subject itself, it seems that God in the
first place intended to remind the Jews of their sins, as this knowledge was to
be the way to repentance, or a preparation for it. For except they were
convinced that they were chastised for their sins by God&#8217;s hand, they
would either have thought that their exile was by chance, or have given way to
murmuring complaints as they often did. But God here declares that he was the
author of their exile, in order that the Jews might know that God justly
punished them for their many and grievous sins. But God, in the second place,
shews that it was in his power, whenever he pleased, to restore those whom he
had afflicted. It was the same as to raise from death those whom he had slain,
according to what is said elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God<i> </i>is he
who kills, and who brings to
life.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Samuel 2:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many indeed can destroy, but they cannot heal the
wound which they may have made. But with regard to God, he is both a righteous
Judge and a merciful Savior. As, then, death is in his power whenever he
punishes men for their wickedness, so also he has life in his hand and at his
bidding, whenever he intends to shew mercy. We now, then, perceive what the
Prophet had in view in saying that the Jews had been driven away by
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall dwell in their own
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was necessary that the Jews
should have been sustained by this support until the coming of Christ, for they
saw that they would be in that inheritance which had been promised to the
fathers as a pledge of eternal life and of the heavenly kingdom. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again inveighs against the
wickedness of the people; but as the prophets by their flatteries had then led
astray the king and his princes, as well as the people, the Prophet directed his
discourse to them, and says that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was troubled </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on account of
the prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We know that men think
themselves half absolved when no one severely reproves them. When, therefore,
the prophets ceased from their work, there was so great a security among the
whole people, that there was no fear of God in them. This is the reason why the
Prophet now says that his heart was troubled on account of so much indifference;
for the prophets were, as it is said elsewhere, like dumb dogs; they overlooked
the most grievous and the most atrocious sins, they made no effort to restore
the people to the right way.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Troubled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, he says, is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my heart
for the prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">; a<i> </i>heavier judgment
awaited them, for they ought to have been the instruments of God&#8217;s Spirit,
the heralds of his judgments; they ought to have undertaken his cause by using
exhortations, reproofs, and threatenings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is yet no doubt but that what is said ought to
be extended to the whole body of the people. But Jeremiah wished to begin with
the prophets, as though he had said that it was monstrous that the prophets
boasted that they were God&#8217;s ministers, and yet were dumb in the midst of
so much wickedness. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of
the
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken is my
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then he says that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bones
</i></font><font face="Palatino">were disjointed. In the first chapter of
Genesis, when Moses speaks of the Spirit as moving on the waters, he uses the
same verb, but in a different conjugation. However this may be, it is most
suitable to say that his bones were disjointed.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And we know that the bones are tied
together by sinews, that they may not be moved from their places; for the
loosening of one bone renders the whole body almost useless. He meant, then, by
this kind of speaking, to express the most painful perturbation of mind, as
though he had said that what he had, as the firmost and strongest thing, was
become weak and altogether feeble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards compares himself to a drunken man; by
which metaphor he understands that he was completely stunned, and that all his
senses were taken from him. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>over whom wine has
passed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ober, </i>means to pass beyond; but to pass over is its meaning here. He who
is overcome by immoderate drinking seems as though he was drowned; for when one
falls under the water, he is no more sunk than he who drowns his brain with
wine; for drunkenness is like a grave, inasmuch as it holds the whole man under
its power. Yet the Prophet meant no other thing than that this monstrous thing
rendered those astonied who were of a sane and sound mind, and that it also
shook and disjointed all the members, and terrified and confounded minds
otherwise quiet and tranquil. For, certainly, Jeremiah was a wise man, and was
also endued with courage, so that he would not have quailed under every evil
though great; nor could he have been easily overwhelmed with stupor like a
drunken man. Hence by these comparisons he shows how dreadful and monstrous it
was, that the prophets were so unconcerned as not to say a word, when they saw
that impiety and contempt of God were so rampant, when they saw the whole land
defiled with every kind of wickedness, as we shall presently
see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of Jehovah, and on
account of the words of his holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on account of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he brings God before them as a
judge and avenger; as though he had said, &#8220;If they believe that there is a
God in heaven, it is a wonder that they are so brutish as to dare to boast of
his name, and yet silently to allow heaven and earth to be mingled together.
Where, then, is their reason, when they dare so heedlessly to profess a name so
fearful and awful? for whenever God&#8217;s name is mentioned, there ought to
come into their minds not only his goodness and mercy, but also his severity,
and then his power, which is dreadful to all the wicked. As then these men dare
thus to trifle with God, must not their stupidity be monstrous?&#8221; What,
then, the Prophet means is this, &#8212; that it was a wonder that the prophets
undertook their office, and yet had no concern for the glory of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the words of his
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Men would seek easiness were
not God to rouse them by his word. But as the Law had been written for the Jews,
as these false prophets knew that if they wished rightly to perform their work,
they ought to have been the expounders of the Law &#8212; as these things were
sufficiently known, the Prophet justly refers here to the word of God, as though
he would put a bridle in their mouths, lest they should, after their usual
manner, evade what a bare profession of God&#8217;s name implied. Since, then,
God had testified in his Law how he would have his people ruled, how was it that
these prophets were not terrified by God&#8217;s words? And as hypocrites not
only despise God himself, and depreciate his glory, but also disregard the
doctrine of his law, the Prophet adorns God&#8217;s words with a remarkable
encomium, calling his words the words of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he thus calls God&#8217;s
words holy, and therefore inviolable, in order that the ungodly might know, that
a dreadful vengeance was nigh them, because they disregarded both God and his
holy words. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now assigns the reason why he was so much
horrified by the insensibility which he observed in the prophets. If things were
in good order, or if, at least, they were tolerable, the prophets would have
more calmly addressed the Jews; for what need is there to make a great ado when
men willingly follow what God commands? When, therefore, we have to do with meek
and modest men, vehemence is foolish; and they who thus bestir themselves, and
seek, through great ambition, to shew very fervid zeal when there is no need,
are nothing but apes; but when things are in disorder and confusion, then
vehemence is wanted. Jeremiah now declares that things were so extremely out of
order, that the prophets could not have been silent, except they were like logs
of wood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These two things, then, ought to be connected
together, &#8212; that the prophets were dumb, &#8212; and that they were dumb
when there was the greatest necessity for speaking; for they saw the land filled
with adulteries. Though he names adulterers, he yet condemns the crime. As then
the land was polluted by adulteries and perjuries, as they all gave themselves
up to do evil, it was by no means to be tolerated that the prophets should not
be indignant, as though things were well ordered and peaceable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how much God abhors sloth in the
ministers of his word, in those whom he appoints as teachers in his Church,
while they connive at wickedness, and heedlessly pass by adulteries, and
fornications, and perjuries, and frauds, and other kinds of wrongs; for if there
were even the least particle of religion in their hearts, they would certainly
have been moved, and could not have been for a moment silent. For if that zeal
ought to be in all God&#8217;s children, which was in the
Psalmist,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The zeal of thine

<div><font face="Palatino">how inexcusable must be the indifference of prophets,
when they see God&#8217;s name exposed to mockery, and when they see every kind
of wickedness prevailing? We now see not only what the Prophet teaches in this
passage, but also the usefulness of his doctrine and how it ought to be applied.
Let us then learn, that the more liberty men take in sinning, and the more
audaciously their impiety and contempt of God break out, the more sharply ought
prophets and faithful teachers to reprove and condemn them; and that it is the
time of fighting, when the world thus presumptuously and furiously rise up
against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet mentions some kinds of evil, and yet does
not enumerate all kinds; but under adulteries and perjuries he includes also
other crimes. As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ale, </i>it properly means swearing; but as cursing often accompanies it,
some render it here &#8220;execration.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I rather think that what is meant is
perjury, and that swearing here is taken in a bad sense, signifying swearing
falsely in the name of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mourned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has the land, and
dried up have the pastures of the desert</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here the Prophet strikingly shews how shameful was that torpor of which he
speaks, for the land itself cried out, and not only the land which was
cultivated and had on it many men, but also the very mountains and their
recesses. He says that the land was in mourning, because God shewed his
judgments everywhere by rendering the fields barren, and by other means which he
used as punishments. And it is a very striking mode of speaking, when the
Prophet mentions the mourning of the land, as though it assumed the character of
a mourner, when it saw God angry on account of the wickedness of men. It is,
indeed, a kind of personification, though he does not introduce the land as
speaking; but he describes mourning as it appeared in the sterility of the land,
and also in hails and storms, in unseasonable rains, in droughts, and in other
calamities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whenever then God raises his hand to punish men for
their sins, if they themselves perceive it not, the very land, which is without
sense and feeling, ought to fill them with shame for their madness; for mourning
appears in the very land, as though it knew that God was displeased with it.
When, therefore, men sleep in their sins, and thus disregard God&#8217;s
vengeance, how monstrous must be their torpor! And if this be intolerable in the
common people, what can be said of the prophets, who ought to proclaim such
words as these, &#8212; &#8220;Cursed is he who has transgressed the precepts of
this law&#8221;<i> &#8212; &#8220;</i>cursed is he who has corrupted the worship
of God&#8221; &#8212; or, &#8220;who hath dealt unjustly with his
neighbor,&#8221; &#8212; and whatever else the law contains?

says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mourned has the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he amplifies the same thing by
saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dried up have the
beautiful places of the desert</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as
though he had said, that God&#8217;s judgments were seen in the remotest places,
not only in the plains, where the greater number of men dwelt, did the land
mourn; but if any one ascended the mountains, where shepherds only with their
flocks were to be found, even there the wrath of God was visible; and the very
mountains cried out that God was angry; and yet men still deluded themselves,
who, at the same time were expounders of the law, who were the mouth of God, and
to whom he had committed the office<i> </i>of reproving; but they were dumb! We
now understand what these words contain, and what is to be learnt from
them.</font><br></div>

place, but he has set before us an end for which we are to live. Therefore, by
course, the Scripture means all our doings, and the <i>very </i>end for which we
are to live. He then says, that all their

<div><font face="Palatino">He adds here that it ought not to appear strange that
the prophets were silent when they ought to have loudly cried out, because they

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?
</i>Hypocrites, who indulge themselves, are indeed often severe against others,
and even more than necessary; but no one can dare honestly to cry out against
wickedness, but he who is innocent. For he who condemns others seems to make a
law for himself, according to what a heathen writer has said, <i>(Cicero in
Salustium.) </i>Then the Prophet here shews to us why the prophets were not only
idle, but were even like stocks and stones; for in speaking against wickedness,
it was necessary for them in the first place to amend themselves; for their
lives were wholly dissolute. As then they were of all the most wicked, they
could not boldly cry out against others; and hence the Prophet condemns them,
because their own impiety prevented them to perform their own
duty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, possible for one to live soberly,
honestly, and justly, and yet to connive at the wickedness of others; but the
Prophet here condemns the prophets and priests on two accounts, &#8212; for
being mute, and for not undertaking God&#8217;s cause when they saw the land
polluted with all kinds of defilements; and he then shews the fountain of this
evil, that is, the cause why they were idle and wholly indifferent, and that
was, because they dared not say a word against those crimes of which they were
themselves guilty, <i>yea, </i>with which they were more loaded than even the
common people. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s object in saying that both
the <i>priests </i>and the <i>prophets </i>had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acted
impiously</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it was to shew, that their
contempt of God, for which they were notorious, and also their wickedness, had
taken away from them all power and freedom in acting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even in my house have I found
their wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He enhances what he
had said of their impiety; for they were not only infamous and wicked in common
life, as to the duties of the Second Table; but they also corrupted the whole
service of God, and the true Prophets were derided by them. For what was found
to be the priests&#8217; wickedness in the Temple, except that they practiced a
sort of merchandise under the cover of the priesthood? and then the prophets
vitiated and adulterated God&#8217;s worship; and what was religion to them but
the means of filthy lucre or gain? When, therefore, the prophets thus trod under
foot the service of God, corrupted and perverted the Law to make gain or to
acquire power, their impiety was not only seen in the habits of daily life, but
also in the very Temple of God, that is, with regard to the sacerdotal
office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, since this is true as to what took place under
the Law, there is no wonder that such a base example is to be seen in the
present day. And hence also is discovered<i> </i>the folly of the Papists, who
think that they ingeniously evade every objection as to the crimes of the Pope
and his filthy clergy, by saying that the Pope indeed may be wicked, as almost
all of them have been, and that the same thing may be said of their mitred
bishops; but that the Pope, as a Pope, cannot err, and that the bishops, as
bishops, that is, in their government and office, are ruled by the Holy Spirit,
because they represent the Church. But are they better than these ancient
priests, whom God himself had expressly appointed, and to whom he commanded
obedience to be rendered by the whole people? But the Prophet not only says here
that they were wicked, that they acted impiously and wickedly towards their

deceived the people. But he speaks figuratively when he says, that their <i>way

which they thought to be of the best kind, as elsewhere, nearly in the same

may take care of himself on seeing danger; but when darkness is added to the
slippery ground, he who can neither stand nor move can hardly do otherwise than
fall, either on this or that side: hence he says,

long abused his forbearance, he then suddenly begins to thunder against them;

<div><font face="Palatino">These two verses are to be read together; for there
is no doubt but that the Prophet here compares the false prophets, who had
corrupted God&#8217;s worship in the kingdom of Israel, with those in Jerusalem
who wished to appear more holy and more perfect. And he thus compares them that
he might set forth those who sought to be deemed God&#8217;s faithful ministers,
as being by far the worst; for he says, that he had found <i>fatuity </i>in the
prophets of Samaria, but <i>depravity </i>in the prophets of Jerusalem. They
are, therefore, mistaken in my judgment who take also,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlpt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tephle, </i>as meaning depravity; for they do not consider that he here
enhances by comparison their wickedness who thought themselves the best, as they
say, without exception.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the prophets of Samaria, they had been long ago
condemned; nor was there any at Jerusalem who dared openly to defend them; for
they had departed from the worship of God, and had led away the people from the
only true Temple and altar. They were then held at that time in the kingdom of
Judah as apostates, perfidious, and unprincipled. But the kingdom of Judah still
wished to be deemed pure and blameless; and the prophets, who were there,
boasted that they were uncorrupt and free from every spot. The Prophet therefore
says, that fatuity had been found in the prophets of Samaria, that is, in those
who had corrupted the ten tribes, and vitiated there the pure worship of God;
but that there was more wickedness in the prophets of Jerusalem and of the
kingdom of Judah, because they were not only foolish, but also designedly
subverted all religion, and allowed liberty in all kinds of wickedness, so that
they carried as it were a banner in approbation of every species of iniquity. We
hence see that the object of Jeremiah was to shew, that the prophets of the
kingdom of Judah surpassed in impiety those very prophets whom they proudly
condemned; for they were not only fatuitous and foolish, but had designedly as
it were conspired against God, and had become open enemies not only to religion
but to all laws.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words, that he<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>found</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>fatuity</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the prophets of Samaria, he speaks in
the person of God, who is the only fit judge. And he subjoins the cause of their
senselessness, because </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
prophesied by Baal, and made the people of Israel to go
astray</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Had Jeremiah spoken only of
these, he would no doubt have used stronger terms in describing their sin; but
as he was contrasting them with those who were worse, he was satisfied with the
word fatuity; as though he had said, &#8220;Were<i> </i>any one to consider them
by themselves, they were indeed very wicked, and deserved the most severe
punishment; but if they be compared with the prophets of Judah, then they must
be deemed only fatuitous and sottish.&#8221; Then the copulative is to be
rendered thus, &#8220;I have, indeed, seen fatuity in the prophets of
Samaria;&#8221; and then differently in the following clause, &#8220;but<i>
</i>in the prophets of Judah I have seen depravity.&#8221; It is to be read
adversatively in this verse, and concessively in the former.
Then</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in the prophets of Jerusalem
have I seen
depravity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE89</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It
follows,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> They commit adultery,
and walk in deception</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Expositors think
that there is a change of number; but what if these words be applied to the
people? as though Jeremiah had said, &#8220;When any one is an adulterer, when
any one walks in deception, that is, when any one is fraudulent,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they strengthen, the hands of the
wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221; </i>And, doubtless, this
sense seems here to be the most correct. Then Jeremiah shews how they surpassed
other prophets in impiety, even because they dissimulated when they saw on one
hand adulteries prevailing, and on the other frauds, plunders, and perjuries;
and not only so, but they undertook the patronizing of the wicked, and
strengthened the hands of the ungodly, and added audacity to their madness. For
as fear weakens the hands, so does shame; as, then, these prophets removed shame
as well as fear from the wicked and ungodly, so they strengthened their hands;
that is, they gave them more confidence, so that they rushed headlong into every
evil more freely and with greater liberty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they might not
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, every one from his
wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is added for the sake
of explanation; for, as I have said, either the fear of God or shame from men
might have checked their audacity; but when they were confirmed and
countenanced, they broke out into all excesses, and hardened themselves in their
obstinacy: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they might not
return, every one from his wickedness.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last place he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be to me all of them
as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We see that the last clause is confined to the citizens of Jerusalem. Then
God says, that these prophets would be like the Sodomites, and the citizens of
Jerusalem like the citizens of Gomorrah. This is not to be understood only as to
crimes, but also as to punishment; as though he had said, that there was no more
hope of pardon for them than for the Sodomites, for they had provoked to the
utmost the wrath of God, so that he could not now spare them. It then follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is addressed to the prophets of the
kingdom of Judah, as we learn from its conclusion; and thus the exposition which
I have given is confirmed, even this, that God extenuates the fault of other
prophets, in speaking of the prophets of Jerusalem, who boasted of greater
sanctity. But he declares that they would have poison for meat and gall for
drink; as though he had said, &#8220;I will pursue them with every kind of
punishment.&#8221; He expresses evidently the same thing I have before referred
to, that their table would become a snare to them.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196922&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:22.) The ungodly, indeed, always think that they can by their arts escape;
God on the other hand declares, that though they might have a table prepared,
they yet would find nothing on it, but poison for meat, and gall for drink. For
as to God&#8217;s children and faithful servants, evils are turned to their
benefit; so as to the ungodly and his wicked despisers, all things must
necessarily turn out for their ruin, even meat and drink, and their course of
life, and in a word everything.</font><br></div>

words he declares that they were the authors of all evils, so that in comparison
with them the prophets of Samaria might have been deemed in a manner righteous.
But there is no doubt but that this declaration was considered too severe; yet
we see by what necessity Jeremiah was constrained thus to speak; for the lamp of
God as yet remained at Jerusalem, according to what is said in many passages,
nor was the light of sound doctrine wholly put out. They professed that they
continued to obey the Law; and at the same time they were much worse than
others, for not only the worship of God in the Temple and in the city was
corrupted, but adulteries, frauds, plunders, and all kinds of wickedness
prevailed everywhere. He adds &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">What is here said must have appeared very severe, and
must have grievously offended the people; for Jeremiah forbade them to hear the
teaching of the prophets. He indeed concedes to them the name of prophets, which
was a sacred name; but yet he discredits them, and deprives them of all dignity.
he speaks not of magicians or impostors, who were aliens to God&#8217;s people;
he speaks not of Egyptians, or Chaldeans, or any like them, nor does he speak of
the prophets of Samaria, but of those who daily appeared in the Temple and
boasted that they were divinely chosen, endued with the spirit of revelation,
and that they brought nothing but what God had committed to them. As then
Jeremiah forbade them to hear these, some great perplexity must have necessarily
seized the minds of all, especially of the simple, &#8212; &#8220;What does this
mean? why does God suffer these unprincipled men to occupy a place in the
Temple, and to exercise there the prophetic office, while at the same time they
are cheats, perjurers, and impostors?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the same manner we see that many at this day are
perplexed on account of the discords by which the Church is harassed, and as it
were torn to pieces. We are constrained to contend with those who arrogate to
themselves the name of the Catholic Church, who boast that they are bishops,
vicars of Christ, successors of the Apostles. When therefore the ignorant see
such hostile conflicts in the very bosom of the Church, they must necessarily be
terrified, and such stumbling-block shakes dreadfully their faith. Hence this
passage ought to be especially noticed; for though at first ignorant people may
be disturbed by such a prohibition as this, yet every one who really fears God
will exercise his mind, so that he may distinguish between false and true
prophets; and God will never leave his chosen people destitute of the spirit of
judgment and discernment, when teachers contend on both sides, and tumults
nearly overthrow the Church; even then, as I have said, God will preserve his
own elect, provided we piously and humbly strive to submit to his word; he will
also guide us by his hand, so that we may not be deceived. Since then God had
commanded <i>Jeremiah </i>to forbid the people to hear the false prophets, let
us not at this day wonder, that faithful teachers who desire to maintain true
doctrine and genuine piety, feel themselves constrained to oppose these men of
titles who shelter themselves under the masked names of pastors, and prelates,
and bishops, that they may delude the unwary and the ignorant;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the words of the prophets who
prophesy to you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They make you to be
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, they infatuate
you.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE91</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But this would not have been sufficient, had he not added what more fully
confirmed it. Hence Jeremiah says, that they brought forward the vision of their
own hearts, and did not speak what came from God&#8217;s mouth. This is a mark
which can never deceive us, except we willingly throw ourselves into the snares
and intrigues of Satan, as many do who wilfully seek to be deceived, and even
hunt for falsehoods; but whosoever applies his mind to the study of truth, can
never be deceived, if by this mark, which is set before us, he distinguishes
between prophets and prophets; for every one who speaks according to the mere
suggestions of his own mind must be an impostor. No one then ought to be deemed
a sound teacher, but he who speaks from God&#8217;s mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question may be raised, How can the common
people understand that some speak from God&#8217;s mouth, and that others
propound their own glosses? I answer, That the doctrine of the Law was then
sufficient to guide the minds of the people, provided they closed not their
eyes; and if the Law was sufficient at that time, God does now most surely give
us </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a clearer
</i></font><font face="Palatino">light by his prophets, and especially by his
Gospel. Since then God has once given us his testimony, every one ought to obey
him as soon as he knows what is right, what he ought to follow, and what he
ought to shun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how useful this passage is; for there
is nothing more miserable than for men to be tossed here and there, and to be
led astray from the way of salvation. There is therefore nothing more desirable
than to know this way with certainty, Now, God shews us the way here as by the
finger; for he says that those who speak from his mouth can be heard with
safety; but that others are to be <i>rejected, </i>how much soever they may
boast of being prophets, and thus seek under the guise of authority to subject
men&#8217;s minds captive to themselves. And this ought to suffice at this day
to put an end to all controversies;<i> </i>for on this no doubt depends almost
every question that is now agitated in the world. The Papists will have their
own devices to be taken as oracles, and claim to be the Church; but we, on the
other hand, say that perfect wisdom is alone to be found in the Law, in the
Prophets, and in the Gospel. Were we then to attend to the mouth of God, it
would be easy to settle all the disputes between us. It hence also follows, that
the Papists are deceived because they<i> </i>deign not to ask at God&#8217;s
mouth, but choose to become slaves to men and to their own falsehoods, rather
than to inquire what pleases God; for he himself has spoken, and has not spoken
hiddenly, neither doubtfully nor obscurely; for there is nothing more clear than
his teaching, provided men do not become wilfully blind. He then adds,

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for we know with how much haughtiness and
confidence the false prophets dared to announce their dreams; for they were led
by the spirit of pride, as they were the children of Satan. Hence then was their
confidence, so that they made their declarations as though they had come down
from heaven. <i>They say, </i>then, <i>by saying; </i>that is, they promise, and
that with great effrontery, that peace would be to all the despisers of God; and
not only so, but they pretended God&#8217;s name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spoken, has
Jehovah</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They wished to be deemed the
instruments or agents of the Holy Spirit, while they were vainly announcing, as
it has been said, their own imaginations. And hence Jeremiah applied to them,
though improperly, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vision, They speak the vision of
their own heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By using this word he
makes a concession; for he might have said only, that they adduced nothing but
trifles, even the falsehoods which they themselves had devised, but he mentions
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chezun, </i>which in itself ought to be deemed of high import. And yet he
means that they were only apes as prophets, when they prattled of visions and
confidently declared that they brought forward the revelations of the Spirit. He
then concedes to them, though improperly, that they saw visions; but what did
they see? even that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah had
spoken, Peace shall be to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They promise to those who walk in
the wickedness of their own heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that
all things shall turn out well to them, No
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil shall come upon
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;They<i> </i>promise impunity to all the wicked.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verse which follows is usually thus explained,
Jeremiah condemns the false teachers for their carelessness, because they
attended not to the word of God, and regarded as nothing what the Law contained.
But interpreters seem to me to have been certainly much mistaken in this view;
for Jeremiah here shews throughout, he passage how insolently and arrogantly the
false teachers conducted themselves in audaciously opposing the true and
faithful servants of God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who has
stood in the counsel of Jehovah? </i></font><font face="Palatino">They no doubt
spoke thus tauntingly of the true prophets, &#8220;What!<i> </i>These announce
to you pestilence, war, famine, as though they were angels sent by God from
heaven; have they stood in the counsel of God?&#8221; Thus I connect this verse
with the former, for I am fully persuaded that he refers here to the arrogance
which the false teachers manifested towards the true
teachers.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE94</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Examples of this in our time give a plain exposition
to this passage. For when the Papists feel themselves driven to an extremity,
when they prevail nothing by clamor and falsehood, they run to this sort of
evasion, &#8220;He!<i> </i>if we must determine everything in religion by the
Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel, what certainty can be found? The Scripture is
like a nose of wax, for it can be turned to anything, and no meaning can with
certainty be elicited; thus all things will remain perplexed and doubtful, if
authority belongs to the Scripture alone.&#8221; We then see that the enemies of
truth at this day, when they cannot otherwise cover their filthiness, labor to
throw all things into confusion, and to discredit God&#8217;s word, and to
introduce such darkness, that white cannot be distinguished from black, that
light becomes mixed with darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Similar to this was the perverse wickedness of the
false teachers. For Jeremiah and his associates, when they came forth, declared
that God&#8217;s vengeance could no longer be deferred, for the people continued
to provoke it; and they announced themselves as the heralds of God and witnesses
to his hidden purpose; but these unprincipled men, that they might lull to
sleep, yea, and stupify the consciences of men, said, &#8220;Eh!
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who has stood in the counsel of
Jehovah? who has heard? who has attended? who has seen?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">all these things are uncertain; and though
these severely threaten you with pestilence, war, and famine, yet there is no
reason why ye ought to fear. Be then easy, and quietly and cheerfully enjoy
yourselves, for they do not understand the purpose of God.&#8221; And this
meaning we shall presently see confirmed by what is said in verse 22,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ydwsb
wdm[&#181;aw</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>veam omdu besudi,
</i>&#8220;And<i> </i>if they had stood in my counsel.&#8221; There is then no
doubt but that he turns against them what they perversely boasted. But it now

<i>ichul, </i>means both. The Prophet now assails with more vehemence the false
teachers, for they were almost stupid. None, indeed, can betray so much audacity
as to oppose God, except when wholly blinded by Satan. Hence our Prophet deals
with the false teachers as with fanatics or those wholly stupified: he tells
them that God would come like a

with hypocrites, and especially with false teachers, because Satan rules in them
to an awful extent. And doubtless, as I have already said, except a person be
fascinated with illusions, he could not dare to oppose God. There is, then, no
wonder that the Prophet fulminates against these ungodly teachers; for it was
nothing but play and sport to them to pretend God&#8217;s sacred name that they
might deceive the people. He afterwards adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he had said, lest the hypocrites,
with whom he had to do, should think that their punishment would be light and
soon pass away. For though they may have seen that God&#8217;s hand was armed
against them, yet they took comfort, because they expected that it would only be
for a short time. Hence Jeremiah here reminds them that they were much deceived
if they thought that they could dissipate as a cloud the vengeance that, was at
hand; for God would not cease to punish them until he had destroyed
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was another security which deceived the
ungodly: they were not terrified by threatenings of the Prophet, because they
thought that God was in a manner dallying with them whenever he denounced ruin.
And, doubtless, the wicked could not have so securely indulged themselves, had
it not been that they did not believe that God&#8217;s word would be fulfilled.
As, then, God&#8217;s threatenings did not strike hypocrites with terror, the
Prophet here declares that there was no reason for them to harbor the vain hope
that God only uttered words, and that there would be no execution of his
vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Turn back, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall not the anger of Jehovah
until he has performed and confirmed the thoughts of his
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah shews that God had not
spoken in vain by his servants, according to what is done by men, who often
speak rashly, for their tongue frequently outruns their purpose. But he reminds
them here that God is far different from men, for he ever speaks in earnest, and
his prophetic word is a sure evidence of his hidden purpose, as it will again be
presently declared. This is the reason why he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the thoughts of his
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must not yet think that God is like us, as though
he reflected on this thing and on that, and formed many purposes, while one
thing or another comes into his mind; no, such a gross idea as this cannot be
entertained, and cannot be consistent with the nature of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah calls, by a kind of metaphor, the
counsel of God his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thoughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>even that fixed and unchangeable counsel, which he declared by his prophets.
Sometimes, indeed, God threatened, in order to restore men to repentance; but we
must bear in mind that he neither varies himself nor changes his purpose.
Whatever, then, the prophets announced in his name, flowed from his hidden
purpose, and it was the same as though he had made known to us his own heart.
And it is no small commendation to prophetic doctrine that God as it were
connected his heart with his mouth. The mouth of God is the doctrine itself; and
he says now that it had proceeded from the depth of his heart. It hence follows
that there is nothing frustratory, (deceptive,) as they say, in God&#8217;s
word; for he here declares that whatever he had committed to his servants were
the thoughts of his heart. And to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confirm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or establish, must be applied to the execution of his
thoughts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is, that God now pronounces a
sentence against the people, which could not be reversed; for he had once for
all decreed to destroy the men who were obstinate in their
sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he seems to refer to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwjy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ichul, </i>which means, as I have said, to fall, and also to abide or to lie
upon. According to this meaning, he says now, that the anger of God would not
return, so as to change its course, until it had completed what had already been
decreed, even what God had resolved respecting the destruction of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the extremity of days ye shall
understand the knowledge of this thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>So it is literally; but we may give a simpler version, &#8220;Ye shall
perceive the knowledge of this matter,&#8221; or &#8220;Ye shall know what this
means.&#8221; The Prophet, no doubt, exults over the insensibility of those who
could not be moved by such awful warnings. We know how great is the hardness of
the ungodly, especially when Satan possesses their minds and hearts. There is,
indeed, no iron and no stone which has so much hardness as there is in the
perversely wicked; and they in a manner assail God with the greatest obstinacy,
as though they were victorious, for they despise all his warnings and
threatenings. Hence the Prophet derides their insolence, or rather their
madness, and. says, &#8220;Ye<i> </i>shall understand,&#8221; but too late; for
by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>extremity of
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE96 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">he means the time which God had
appointed for his anger. But yet God had in due time warned them that they might
repent before his judgment came. It was now then the same as though he left them
in their own stupor, and said that they could not, however, escape the hand of
God by their perverseness, according to what Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Let<i> </i>him who

<div><font face="Palatino">He no doubt checks the arrogance of those who
rejected every sound doctrine and all right counsels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So, then, the Prophet teaches us here that hypocrites
gain nothing by setting up their own contumacy and arrogance in opposition to
God, for they will find, though too late, that God has not spoken in vain. We
then see that by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>extremity of
days </i></font><font face="Palatino">is to be understood that time when the
door shall be closed, because they did not in due time respond to God when he
invited them to himself, and set before them the hope of
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also another truth taught us here, that we
are to seek God while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again warns the Jews not to be perverted
by the flatteries of false teachers, and not to disregard the threatenings of
God. We have already said that the minds of the people were then lulled asleep
by false teachers, who promised them impunity. And there is no evil worse than
when false teachers, under the name of God, flatter us, and drive away every
fear and concern for our souls. This evil prevailed among the ancient people, as
it does also at this day. Indeed the greater part of the world have ever sought
flatterers, and when God sees that men thus indulge themselves, and in a manner
seek for themselves snares, he gives loose reins to Satan and his ministers,
that they may deceive those miserable men who thus wilfully seek to be deceived.
The object, then, of Jeremiah was to remind the people often, that all
flatteries were nothing but the wiles of Satan, or some deadly poison which
stupified all their senses. For when one gives a person poison, which
extinguishes the senses of the body and the faculties of the mind, it is all
over with the miserable being who has been thus drugged. We see a similar thing
done by false teachers, who soothe miserable sinners and promise peace to them,
as we saw in our last lecture. As, then, it was difficult to awaken men out of
this stupor, which became, as it were, innate in them, and as Satan always
employs the same intrigues, it was necessary for the holy Prophet to urge his
doctrine more and more.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God now says that he did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not send the
Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and yet they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ran</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For this objection might have appeared sufficient against Jeremiah, &#8212;
that he was alone, and that the other prophets were many in number. It is,
indeed, the dictate of common sense, that we ought to believe a hundred persons
rather than one. Jeremiah, then, was alone, and there was a great number of
false prophets; and the prophetic name was common to them all. It was therefore
necessary to meet this objection, which was calculated to render God&#8217;s
faithful servant contemptible. Hence he mentions the difference between the
false teachers with whom he contended and himself, as though he had said,
&#8220;I indeed am alone, but sent by God; and I am thoroughly convinced of my
legitimate calling, and am also ready to prove that I bring no inventions of my
own brain; let not, then, a false comparison of one man with a great multitude
deceive you. For the question here is not of men or of their authority, but what
we ought to inquire is, who sends them? If God be the author of my mission, then
I, though alone, am superior to the whole world; and if they have not been
called by God, though they were a hundredfold more than they are, yet all that
they boast of means nothing, for in God alone we ought to believe.&#8221; We now
see the design of the Prophet in saying that the prophets
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ran</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but were not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but had received no commands from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage especially teaches us that no one is
worthy of being heard except he be a true minister of God. But there are two
things necessary to prove a person to be such &#8212; a divine call, and
faithfulness and integrity. Whosoever, then, thrusts in himself, however he may
pretend a prophetic name, may be safely rejected, for God claims the right of
being heard to himself alone. Yet a simple and naked call is not sufficient; but
he who is called must also faithfully labor for his God; and both these things
are intimated here, for he says that the prophets ran, though they were not
sent, and that they prophesied, though they were without any command from God. I
indeed allow that the same thing is here repeated, according to common usage, in
Hebrew, in different words; yet the stronger expression is found in the second
clause, for to send belongs properly to the call, and to command to the
execution of the office. For God in the first place chose his prophets, and
committed to them the office of teaching, and then he commanded them what to
say, and dictated to them as it were his message, that they might not bring
forward anything devised by themselves, but be only his heralds, as it has
appeared elsewhere.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE97</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn also that our ears ought not to be
open to impostors, who boldly pretend the name of God, but that we ought to
distinguish between true and false teachers; for Jeremiah does not here speak to
a few men, but he addresses the whole people. And what he designed to shew was,
that they in vain sought to escape under the pretense of ignorance, who were not
attentive to sound doctrine; for except they designedly neglected God and his
word, they might have known whom to believe. It hence follows that frivolous is
the excuse which many consider at this day to be as it were their sacred asylum;
for they plead in their own behalf they have been deceived by false teachers.
But we ought to see and to inquire whether God has sent them, and whether they
teach as coming from his school, and bring anything but what they have received
from his mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I shall not here speak at large of God&#8217;s call;
but if any one wishes for a very short definition, let him take the following:
There is a twofold call; one is internal and the other belongs to order, and
may, therefore, be called external or ecclesiastical. But the external call is
never legitimate, except it be preceded by the internal; for it does not belong
to us to create prophets, or apostles, or pastors, as this is the special work
of the Holy Spirit. Though then one be called and chosen by men a hundred times,
he cannot yet be deemed a legitimate minister, except he has been called by God;
for there are peculiar endowments required for the prophetic, the apostolic, and
the pastoral office, which are not in the power or at the will of men. We hence
see that the hidden call of God is ever necessary, in order that any one may
become a prophet, or an apostle, or a pastor. But the second call belongs to
order; for God will have all things carried on by us orderly and without
confusion.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461440&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:40.) Hence has arisen the custom of electing. But it often
happens that the call of God is sufficient, especially for a time. For when
there is no Church, there is no remedy for the evil, except God raises up
extraordinary teachers. Then the ordinary call, of which we now speak, depends
on a well-ordered state of things. Wherever there is a Church of God, it has its
own laws, it has a certain rule of discipline: there no one should thrust in
himself, so as to exercise the prophetic or the pastoral office, though he
equaled all the angels in sanctity. But when there is no Church, God raises up
teachers in an unusual way, who are not chosen by men; for such a thing cannot
be done, where no Church is formed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This subject deserves, indeed, to be much more
diffusely treated; but as I am not wont to digress unto particular points, it is
enough for me to state what the present passage requires, which seems to be
this, &#8212; that none ought to be acknowledged as God&#8217;s servants and
teachers in the Church, except those who have been sent by God, and to whom he
has, as it were, stretched forth his hand and given them their commission. But
as the internal call of God cannot be surely known by us, we ought to see and
ascertain whether he who speaks is the organ or instrument of the Holy Spirit.
For whosoever brings forward his own figments and devises, is unworthy of being
attended to. Hence, let him who speaks shew really that he is God&#8217;s
ambassador; but how can he shew this? By speaking from the mouth of God himself;
that is, let him not bring anything of his own, but faithfully deliver, as from

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is as it were an explanation of the
former; for many might have been perplexed, if it had only been said to them,
that there are none who are fit and legitimate teachers but those who had been
sent and entrusted with what God had commanded. Hence the Prophet here calls our
attention to the truth which is certain and manifest; for God had delivered the
sum of all truth in his Law. As then the perfection of wisdom was found in the
Law, from which the prophets drew whatever we read in their writings, no
excuses, such as the following, could be admitted, &#8212; &#8220;How can we
know that the prophets speak from God&#8217;s mouth, that they bring nothing
devised by themselves, that they have the instructions which God
approves?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then calls the attention of the Jews to
the Law, as though He had said as Moses did,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;There<i> </i>is no
need to ascend above the clouds, or to descend into the depths, or to run beyond
the sea; for the Law and the word is nigh in thy mouth, that is, God has set
before you whatever is necessary and useful to be known.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:12-14;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
10:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is fully made known to you, nor will the
knowledge of anything necessary be obscure, if ye attend to the Law. Hence the
cause of error is not only your sloth, but also your perverseness; for ye
wilfully neglect the Law, and remain doubtful and inquire, &#8220;Which<i>
</i>is the way?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;This is the

<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive what Jeremiah had in view: he
had before said, that none were to be attended to, except they who were sent and
spoke from the mouth of God; but he now explains what he meant, even that the
Law contained the whole sum of wisdom. But as he had before introduced the false
prophets, as boldly deriding the true and faithful servants of God, by objecting
to them and saying, &#8220;Who had stood in the counsel of God? these imagine
that they have fallen from the clouds, they terrify you with dreadful
threatenings, as though they were angels from heaven,&#8221; &#8212; as<i>
</i>then the false prophets were thus wont to speak disdainfully of God&#8217;s
servants, and alleged that they did not stand in God&#8217;s counsel, Jeremiah
now retorts upon them, and says, speaking in God&#8217;s name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they had stood in my counsel,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">they would doubtless have spoken from my Law;
as though he had said, &#8220;They believe not my servants, because they are men
and not angels; they hence deny that they are of my counsel: thus they persuade
the whole people to despise the doctrine of salvation. There are, however, some
prophets whom I have sent: now, if they wish to be deemed sent, let them prove
themselves to be so.&#8221;<i> </i>What is the true proof? If they had stood in
my counsel, they would have doubtless made known my word to my people. What is
that word? the definition follows, even the word of the Law,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They would have turned
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the straying people from their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE98</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The passage may seem obscure, but from the context
itself we can gather that the real design of the Prophet was to convict the
false teachers, that they might no longer boast of God&#8217;s name, and falsely
pretend that they were endued with the prophetic office, and glory in that
distinction. He says that it was an evident proof that they were not God&#8217;s
prophets, because they did not faithfully teach what they ought to have derived
from the Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed certain, that no one has been
God&#8217;s counsellor, according to what Scripture says in many places, when
the object is to check the arrogance of those who, in their curiosity, attempt
to penetrate into the hidden judgments of God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234013&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:13; ) and Paul, while speaking of God&#8217;s eternal election, it being
incomprehensible, exclaims, Who has been his counsellor? (Romans 11: 34.) He
uses a similar language in the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:16:) and why? that he might check the temerity of the human mind,
which ventures farther than it is lawful. But afterwards Paul adds by way of
correction, &#8220;But we have the mind of Christ:&#8221; how so? because he has
made known his counsel to us. When, therefore, the false prophets denied that
God&#8217;s servants were<i> </i>his counsellors, they might indeed have said
so, viewing them only as mortal men; but their object was to discredit and to
render void the word of God; so that they wished to put a restraint not only on
men, but also on God himself. This was an intolerable insult to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover the Prophet now turns as it were upon them,
&#8220;There is then no Prophet of God in the world!&#8221; But fixed was that
saying, that there would ever be some prophets; and none of the Jews could have
dared to deny Moses to have been divinely inspired. This, then, being allowed,
the Prophet now indirectly reproves them, &#8220;Where are the prophets of
God?&#8221; and as they laid claim to this distinction, he says,
&#8220;Doubtless<i> </i>ye stand not in God&#8217;s counsel. How so? because the
counsel of God is included in his Law; and as ye have departed from the doctrine
of true religion, as ye have no care to convey instruction, as your doctrine
does not teach men the fear of God, nor leads to repentance, it follows that ye
are not God&#8217;s counsellors nor his prophets.&#8221;<i> </i>But that this
may appear more evident, we must bear in mind what Moses said, that God has his
own secret things, but that whatever is taught in the Law belongs to us and to
our children.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
29:29.) There is then no reason why the inquiry should be difficult respecting
the true prophets of God; for they, without controversy, deserve to be heard as
the angels of God, who are faithful interpreters of his Law; but they who lead
us away from the Law ought to be firmly and boldly rejected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must also bear in mind the definition that is
given when it is said, that they ought to have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the people<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from their evil way, and from
the wickedness of their
doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We indeed know that the worst men
insolently pretend to preach God&#8217;s word, as the Papists do at this day:
though they have inebriated the whole world with their ungodly and delirious
doctrines, they yet boast that they are the servants of God. Hence the Prophet,
after having spoken generally of God&#8217;s word, adds a special distinction,
&#8212; that the doctrine of God is that which edifies, which teaches and leads
men to repentance and the fear of God, according to what Paul says, that the
Scripture is useful for these purposes,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:16; ) for by so saying, he intended to condemn all false interpreters
of Scripture, as there were many then who boasted that they were the best
teachers, while yet they only pleased itching ears. As then there were many who
regarded display and not edification, Paul says, that the Scripture is useful;
and therefore he rejected with contempt all expositions in which there was
nothing useful. So also in this place the Prophet shews that the right and
legitimate use of Scripture was when it was employed to restore men from their
evil way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, indeed, here an instance of a part being
stated for the whole: for if we only exhort men to repent, there will be no
great fruit; and our teaching would be defective, for the doctrine of repentance
would be inefficient without faith and without calling on the name of God. But
the Prophet did not intend here to mention every part of a sound and useful
doctrine; he deemed it enough to confute the false teachers who wished to be
alone in repute, while yet they had no care to edify the people; for they saw
all things in disorder, they saw crimes prevailing everywhere, they saw a
dreadful contempt of God, but to these things they were wholly blind. It might
then have been hence easily inferred that they neither faithfully labored for
God nor manifested any care for the safety of the Church; for they thus betrayed
miserable souls, whose ruin they saw was near at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the whole design of the Prophet. But
there is no doubt but that to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil way
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he added
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wickedness of their
doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that he might more
fully expose the insensibility of those who under such an urgency were silent
and remained inactive. There is sometimes the need of a moderate reproof; but
when people allow themselves an extreme license in wickedness, when impunity is
everywhere permitted, and when such corruptions prevail in common, that nothing
remains untainted, if then the tongue of the teacher is silent and as it were
tied, is he not rightly called an idle and a dumb dog? And thus the Prophet
enhances the insensibility, for which he condemns the false teachers; they were
silent, as though things were in a good order, while they had to witness not
only common crimes, but even a vast accumulation of all kinds of crimes; for the
people gave themselves up not only to one kind of wickedness, but to all kinds,
and wholly despised God and his Law. It afterwards follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he especially shakes off from hypocrites their
self-delusions; for they were torpid in their vices, because they thought that
they could in a manner blind the eyes of God. They did not indeed say so; but
the heedless security of men would, never be so great as it is, were they to
believe that nothing is hid from God, but that he penetrates into the inmost
recesses of the heart, that he discerns between the thoughts and the feelings,
and leaves not unobserved the very<i> </i>marrow. If, then, this truth were
fixed in the hearts of all, they would certainly obey God with more reverence,
and also dread his threatenings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, they are so heedlessly torpid, it follows,
that they imagine God as not having a clear sight, who sees only things nigh
him, like one who has a deficient vision, who can see what is near at hand, but
not what is far off. Such is what hypocrites dream God to be, who after the
manner of men either connives at things, or is blind, or at least does not
clearly see but what is near at hand. We now understand the design of the
Prophet in saying, that Jehovah is God afar off as well as near at
hand.</font><br></div>

the Prophet most sharply reproves the hypocrites,<i> </i>who thought that they
had no concern with God, as is the case<i> </i>always with those who delude
themselves in their sins. Though this truth is ever professed by them, that God
is the judge of the world, and that an account must some time be rendered to
him; yet they afterwards think that they can by some evasion escape, so that God
will forgive them. In short, it is usual with hypocrites<i> </i>to trifle as it
were childishly with God. On this account, God is grievously displeased with
them, and declares that he is far different from what they imagine him to be.
For while they thus set themselves up as arbitrators, so that they subject God
to their own laws, they<i> </i>think him to be as it were full of apprehension,
and that he sees nothing, or at least very little; he says, that he is not only
a God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>near at hand
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>afar
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE100</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some apply this to time, as though he denied that he
lately came into existence; and so they think that the only true and eternal God
is compared with idols, which men form presumptuously for themselves. But the
other meaning is far more suitable, &#8212; even that he is a God afar off; for
as it is said elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though he dwells

<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, nothing escapes his sight, he is said to be
a God afar off, while hypocrites thought him to be a God only near at hand, as
we say in French, <i>De courte veue, </i>who sees only things near, as it were
before the eyes. But a question has much more force than if it was said, that he
was not merely a God near at hand; and this mode of speaking conveys reproof;
for hypocrites greatly detract from his majesty, when they thus, according to
their own notions, imagine that he can see no more than a mortal man. They would
not indeed have dared to speak thus; but when any one examined all their
counsels and their actions, he would have found that they could have never shewn
so much audacity, had they not deceived themselves with the vain notion, that
God could be deceived</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE101
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">And, therefore, Jeremiah does not relate
their words, but points out the wickedness which sufficiently manifested itself
in their doings, though they professed otherwise with their
tongues.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that this is the meaning appears more clearly
from the next verse, which ought to be read in connection with this;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will a man hide himself in
coverts, that I should not see him?</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon"><i> </i>
fE102 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">This verse is added by way of
explanation; there can therefore be no doubt respecting the words, far off and
near, &#8212; that God is said to be a God afar off; because his eyes penetrate
into the lowest depths, so that nothing can escape him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a wonder that the Greek translators made so
great a mistake; for they wholly changed the sense, &#8212; that God is God nigh
at hand, but not afar off. In the first place, they did not consider the
question, and then, as they did not see the drift of the passage, they contrived
from their own brains what is wholly remote from the words of the Prophet. This
sentiment, that God is nigh and not afar off, is indeed true; but what is meant
here is quite another thing, &#8212; that God sees in a way very different from
men, for he fully and perfectly sees what is farthest from him, according to the
passage we have quoted from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:19; and there is another in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
139:7-12, where the Psalmist says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Where<i> </i>shall
I flee from thy face? for if I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I lie down
in hell, there thou stretchest forth thine hand; if I take the wings of the dawn
and fly to the clouds, even thine hand will lay hold of me there; if I seek
coverts, even the night itself is before thee as the light, and darkness shines
as the light.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, then, we join together these two passages, there
will appear nothing ambiguous in the words of Jeremiah, &#8212; even that God
penetrates with his eyes into the lowest depths, so that nothing is hid from
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah not only explains the meaning of the
last verse, but also makes a practical use of it;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will any
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hide himself in coverts that I
should not see him? </i></font><font face="Palatino">The seeing of God has a
reference to his judgment. Then all frivolous speculations ought to be cast
aside, since Scripture says that God sees all things; but we ought especially to
consider for what purpose it is that he sees all things; which is evidently
this, &#8212; that he may at last call to judgment whatever is done by men.
There is then an application of the doctrine to our case; for we hence learn,
that whatsoever we do, think, and speak, is known to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By <i>coverts, </i>or hiding-places, he means all the
secret frauds which men think they can cover; but by such an attempt they gain
nothing but a heavier judgment. By coverts then we are to understand all those
vain thoughts which hypocrites entertain; for they think that they can so hide
themselves that God cannot see their purposes. Hence God laughs them to scorn,
and says in effect, &#8220;Let them enter into their coverts, let them hide
themselves as much as they please, I yet do see them in their coverts no less
clearly than if they were quite close to me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To confirm this he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do not I fill heaven and earth,
saith Jehovah? </i></font><font face="Palatino">This must not be refinedly
explained of the infinite essence of God. It is indeed true, that his essence
extends through heaven and earth, as it is interminable. But Scripture will not
have us to feed on frivolous and unprofitable notions; it teaches only what
avails to promote true religion. What therefore God declares here, that he fills
heaven and earth, ought to be applied to his providence and his power; as though
he had said, that he is not so taken up with things in heaven that he neglects
the concerns of earth, as profane men dream; but he is said to fill heaven and
earth, because he governs all things, because all things are noticed by him,
because he is, in short, the judge of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the Prophet means; and this
passage is entitled to particular notice, because this error of imagining a God
like ourselves is inbred almost in us all. Hence it is, that men allow
themselves so much liberty; for they consider it a light thing to discharge
their duty towards God, because they reflect not what sort of being he is, but
they think of him according to their own understanding and character. As, then,
we are thus gross in our ideas, it becomes us carefully to reflect on this
passage, where God declares, that he is not only a God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>near at
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that he is not like us,
who have only a limited power of seeing, but that he sees in the thickest
darkness as well as in the clearest light; and that therefore it avails those
nothing to deceive themselves who dig for themselves caverns, as it is said in
Isaiah, and hide themselves in deep labyrinths.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah returns again to those impostors who soothed
the people with their blandishments. Whenever Jeremiah and those who were like
him, who faithfully performed their office, treated the people with severity by
reproving and threatening them for their sins, these unprincipled men rose up
against, them, and under the name of prophets flattered the ungodly despisers of
God. It was, as we have before said, a most grievous trial, when in the very
Church itself the ministers of Satan thus falsely pretended the name of God. The
Jews would have unhesitantly despised and laughed to scorn what the vain
prophets of the Gentiles might have boasted; for they knew that these had no
knowledge of God; but when the false prophets of whom he now speaks occupied a
place in the Church, and in high terms boasted that they were God&#8217;s
servants, this would have greatly disturbed the weak and shaken their faith, and
even wholly upset it, had not God stretched forth his hand. It is therefore no
wonder that Jeremiah dwells so much on this subject; for it was an evil that
could not be easily cured; had he said only, that they were not to be esteemed,
the weak would not have been satisfied. It was hence necessary for him often to
repeat this truth, that they were all to know that there was need of
discrimination and judgment, and that those who pretended God&#8217;s name were
not to be indiscriminately allowed to be his prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then repeats what we have before observed, but in
other words, &#8212; I </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what the prophets say who
prophesy in my
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>An objection is anticipated, for
it might have been said, &#8220;What can this mean? the prophets disagree! and
what is to be done under these dissensions? they who differ dazzle our eyes with
an illustrious title, and boldly affirm that they have been sent by God. As,
then, there is such a conflict between the prophets, what are we to do?&#8221;
God meets this objection, and declares that it was not unknown to him what the
false prophets boasted of. He adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied in his
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was an offense, which must have
greatly distressed weak minds, to hear of this profanation of God&#8217;s name.
For as it behoves us reverently to receive what proceeds from God, so it is no
small danger when God&#8217;s name is falsely and mendaciously pretended. As,
then, they might have been greatly disturbed by this false pretext of what was
good, it is here expressly said, that they had used the name of God, but he
adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>falsely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see the truth of what I have said, that
those who affirm that they are prophets and ostentatiously pretend God&#8217;s
name, ought not to be received indiscriminately, but that judgment ought to be
exercised; for it has been God&#8217;s will in all ages to try the faith of his
servants by permitting to Satan and his ministers the liberty of pretending
falsely his holy name. And as we see that the Church has ever been exposed to
this evil, there is no cause for us to be disturbed at this day, when the same
thing happens, for it is nothing new. Let us, therefore, learn to harden
ourselves against such trials; and whenever false prophets try our faith, let;
us remain firm, holding this principle, &#8212; that we ought wisely to
consider, whether God himself speaks, or whether men falsely boast themselves to
be his servants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is to be taken here in a good sense; for, as we have seen elsewhere, God was
wont to make himself known to his servants by dreams. It is not then every kind
of dreams that is to be understood here, but, such dreams as were from above.
The false prophets, indeed, stated what was not true by using this language; for
it was the same as though they testified that they did not bring their own
devices, but faithfully related what they had received from God. As the Pope at
this day declares that he is the vicar of Christ and the successor of Peter,
while he exercises tyranny over the Church; so also these, by a specious
pretext, deceived the simple by saying that they brought nothing human, but were
only witnesses as to God&#8217;s oracles. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God reproves the false prophets, and also
promises to his people what was especially to be desired, &#8212; that he would
cleanse his Church from such pollutions. He then shews that it was his purpose
to take vengeance, because the false prophets had dared in such an impious and
bold manner to abuse his sacred name. For it ever occurred to their minds,
&#8220;How<i> </i>is it that God permits this? Is it because he cares not for
the safety of his people? or does it give him any delight when he sees truth
mingled with falsehood, and light with darkness?&#8221; Hence God here shews
that he for a time bore with that sacrilegious audacity which the false prophets
practiced, but that he did not so connive at it as not at length to punish
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long?

said, &#8220;It<i> </i>shall not be perpetual; though I may delay, yet they

forbearance.&#8221; And he also enhances their crime by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long shall it be in the heart
of the prophets to prophesy falsehood? </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this
way of speaking he intimates, that they erred not through ignorance, as many do,
who through want of knowledge bring forth what they do not understand; but God
here complains that these prophets, as it were designedly, rose up to suppress
the truth. Then by <i>heart </i>is to be understood thought or purpose; as
though he had said, that they designedly made a false pretense as to his name,
that it was their settled purpose to deceive the
people.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE104</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets of the deceit of their
own heart. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This deceit of the heart is put in
opposition to true doctrine; and thus God intimates that whatever men bring
forward from themselves is deceitful, for nothing can proceed from them but
vanity. There is yet no doubt but that he condemns that foolish conceit, of
which the false prophets proudly boasted, that they were alone wise, as the case
is now under the Papacy; how arrogantly do unprincipled men prattle whenever
they speak of their own figments? Nothing can<b> </b>be more silly, and yet they
think that they surpass the angels in acuteness and in high speculations. Such
was the arrogance displayed by the false prophets of old. But God declares that
whatever men invent, and whatever they devise, which they have not received from
his mouth, is only the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceit of
the heart.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this ought to be carefully noticed; for there are
many plausible refinements, in which there is nothing solid, but they are mere
trifles. If, then, at any time these vain thoughts seem pleasing to us, let us
bear in mind what Jeremiah says here, that whatever proceeds not from God is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceit of the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and further, that though the
whole world applaud falsehoods and impostures, we ought yet to know that
everything is a deceit which has not God himself as its author.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a clearer definition, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made his people to forget his
name by their dreams, as their fathers had forgotten it through
Baal.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We may infer from this verse,
that those with whom Jeremiah contended were not openly the enemies of the Law;
for they held many principles of true religion. They maintained in common with
the true and sincere worshippers of God this truth, &#8212; that the only true
God ought to be worshipped; and also this, &#8212; that there was only one
legitimate altar on which sacrifices according to the Law were to be offered. On
these points, then, there was no controversy. But yet they deceived the people
by their flatteries; for they made gain of their prophetic office. Hence
Jeremiah condemns them, because they made God&#8217;s name to be forgotten by
their dreams, as their fathers had forgotten it through Baal; as though he had
said, &#8220;These<i> </i>dreams are like the fictitious and spurious forms of
worship, by which true religion was formerly subverted; for their fathers
worshipped Baal and Baalim: they set up for themselves these false gods, and
thus subverted the glory of God by their own devices.&#8221; The impiety of the
false prophets, who lived in the time of Jeremiah, was not indeed so gross; and
yet it was an indirect defection, for they brought forward their dreams, and
falsely professed that. they were God&#8217;s servants, though he had not
commissioned them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have said elsewhere
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:21) that their crime was twofold; first, they ran when not called nor sent;
and secondly, they brought forward their own fancies and not the word of God.
And this passage ought to be carefully noticed; for we here learn, that not only
open defection cannot be endured by God, but also indirect depravations, which
stealthily withdraw us from the fear of God. Then these two evils must be
carefully avoided in the Church, if we desire to continue entire in our
obedience to God. One evil is sufficiently known, that is, when truth is openly
turned into falsehood, when men are drawn away into idolatry and filthy
superstitions, or when the ancient people, as Jeremiah says, forgat the name of
God through Baal. But the other evil is more hidden, and therefore more
dangerous, that is, when some appearance of true religion is retained, and men
are yet insidiously drawn away from the fear of God and his true worship, and
from pure doctrine, as we see to be the case at this day in the Churches, which
profess to have separated from the Papacy that they might embrace the doctrine
of the Gospel: there are many among them who insidiously corrupt the simple and
genuine doctrine of the Gospel. We see how many curious men there are at this
time, who disturb all things by their own inventions, and how absurdly many seek
refinements, and how confidently also do many propound their own inventions as
oracles! It behoves us then to be watchful, not only that we may shun open
abominations, but that we may also retain the pure and true word of God, so as
not to allow false workers insidiously to corrupt and vitiate anything. It

<div><font face="Palatino">We ought also to read<i> </i>this verse attentively,
for doubtless it contains a doctrine especially useful. I have already said,
that the faith of many might have failed at seeing a conflict in the Temple of
God, not only among the common people, but also among the prophets of God. God
did not appear from heaven, nor did he send his angels, but would have himself
to be heard through men. They who came to the Temple expected the prophets to
teach them. There the ministers of Satan appeared, who corrupted and perverted
all things. There were a few, who sincerely declared the truth of God, and
faithfully explained what God commanded. What could miserable men do in this
case, who were willing to obey,<i> </i>and possessed a teachable spirit? Hence
it was, that many threw aside every concern for religion, and gave themselves up
to despair: &#8220;What means all this? why are there so many discords, so many
disputes, so many contentions, so many invectives? Where can we now betake
ourselves? It is better not to care for anything any more.&#8221; Thus many took
occasion to indulge their indifference, choosing not to weary themselves any
more, nor to seek what God was, what his will was, whether there was salvation
for them, whether there was any hope, rather than to entangle themselves in
troublesome and thorny disputes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such a temptation existed in the time of Jeremiah.
He, therefore, applied in due time a suitable remedy and said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Prophet, who has a
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, with whom is a dream,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will relate a
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Prophet with whom is my word,
he will speak my
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as though God had said, that it
was all extremely wicked thing to obstruct the way of truth by falsehood. But
this is what usually happens, as I have already said; for where Satan has his
agents, an obstacle seems to be in our way which prevents us to go on and
proceed in the course of true religion. For when those who are right-minded, as
we have said, see the prophets themselves contending, disputing, and
quarrelling, they stand still, nay, they go backward. Now God shews that this is
extremely unreasonable. Then the meaning is, as though he had said,
&#8220;Let<i> </i>not the false prophets by Their fallacies impede the course of
God&#8217;s servants, that they may not proceed, and that his word should not be
reverently heard.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Unless we attend to this which the Prophet had in
view, the passage will appear unmeaning. It has been often quoted, but this
circumstance has not certainly been observed. We ought, therefore, ever to
consider, why is a thing said. This verse depends on what is gone before; and
God here answers a question, which might have been raised, &#8212; &#8220;What
then must we do, for falsehoods conflict with truth?&#8221; God answers, that
his word ought not to be prejudiced by this circumstance; as though he had said,
&#8220;Let nothing prevent my Prophets from teaching; I bid them to be
heard.&#8221; We hence conclude, that those do wrong to God, who allege the
controversies, by which religion is torn and as it were lacerated, and think
that they thus obtain a license to indulge their impiety; for it is not a reason
that can avail them, that Satan and his ministers labor to discredit the
authority of God and of his servants. Though these false prophets insinuate
themselves, though they may set up themselves against the true and faithful
servants of God, yet let dreams, that is, prophetic revelations, retain their
weight, and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let him with whom is
God&#8217;s word, speak the word of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>so that it may be heard. This clause refers to the hearers; they were not to
desist from rendering obedience to the Law, how much soever Satan might strive
to subvert their faith by attempting to destroy its unity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is the chaff to the wheat?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This addition was also wholly necessary, for
many might have again objected and said, that they had no sufficient judgment to
distinguish between the true and false prophets. God here gives the answer, that
the difference between true and false doctrine was nothing less to him who made
a careful examination than between wheat and chaff And by this comparison he
shews how foolishly and absurdly many detract from the authority of the Law on
this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pretense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that there are many who falsely interpret it. For when any one rejects the
wheat because it is covered with chaff, does he not deserve to perish through
hunger? and who will pity him who says that he has indeed wheat on his floor,
but that it is mixed with chaff, and therefore not fit for food? Why, then, thou
silly man, dost not thou separate the chaff from the wheat? But thou choosest to
perish through want, rather than to cleanse the wheat that thou mayest have it
for thy food. So also in the Temple the wheat is often mixed with the chaff, the
pure truth of God is often defiled with many glosses and vain figments; and yet,
except it be our own fault, we shall be able to distinguish between the wheat
and the chaff.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if we be negligent, and think that
it is a sufficient excuse for despising the word of God, because Satan brings in
his fallacies, we shall perish in our sloth like him who neglects to cleanse his
wheat that he might turn it to bread. But the time will not allow me to say
more.</font><br></div>

the course of true religion, and never turn aside, whatever Satan and his
ministers may devise against us, but that we may stand firm and persevere, until
having finished our warfare, we shall, at length come unto that blessed rest

so confused a state of things he could not know what to avoid and what to

<div><font face="Palatino">He said, first, that God&#8217;s word was wheat,
because souls are nourished by it unto a celestial life; and nothing can be more

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hammer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There is in these terms some appearance of contradiction; but there is a
distinction to be made as to the hearers, for they who reverently embrace the
word of God, as it becomes them, and with genuine docility of faith, find it to
be food to them; but the ungodly, as they are unworthy of such a benefit, find
it to be far otherwise. For the word which is in itself life-giving, is changed
into fire, which consumes and devours them; and also it becomes a hammer to
break, to tear them in pieces, and to destroy them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is, that God&#8217;s word
ever retains its own dignity; for if it happens to be despised by men, it cannot
yet be deprived of its vigor and efficacy; if it be not wholesome for food, it
will be like fire or like a hammer. Then these two comparisons belong to the
wicked, for God&#8217;s word has another sense when called fire with reference
to the faithful, even because it dries up and consumes the lusts of the flesh,
as silver and gold are purified by fire. Hence the word of God is properly and
fitly called fire, even with regard to the faithful; but not a devouring but a
refining fire. But when it comes to the reprobate, it must necessarily destroy
them, for they receive not the grace that it offers to them. It may also be
called a hammer, for it subdues the depraved affections of the flesh and such as
are opposed to God even in the elect; but it does not break the elect, for they
suffer themselves to be subdued by it.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hammer

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah returns again to the false teachers, who
were the authors of all the evils; for they fascinated the people with their
flatteries, so that every regard for sound and heavenly doctrine was almost
extinguished. But while God declares that he is an avenger against them, he does
not exempt the people from punishment. We indeed know that a just reward was
rendered to the reprobate, when God let loose the reins to the ministers of
Satan with impunity to deceive them. But as the people acquiesced in those false
allurements, while Jeremiah so severely reproved the false teachers, he reminds
the people how foolishly they betook themselves under the shadow of those men,
thinking themselves to be safe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I am, against the
prophets, who steal my words every one from his neighbor.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Many explain this verse as though God condemned
the false prophets, who borrowed something from the true prophets, so that they
might be their rivals and as it were their apes; and no doubt the ungodly
teachers had ever from the beginning made some assumptions, that they might be
deemed God&#8217;s servants. But it seems, however, a forced view, that they
stole words from the true prophets, for the words express what is different,
that they stole </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one from
his friend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah would not have
called God&#8217;s faithful servants by this name. I rather think that their
secret arts are here pointed out, that they secretly and designedly conspired
among themselves, and then that they spread abroad their own figments according
to their usual manner. For the ungodly and the perfidious, that they might
obtain credit among the simple and unwary, consulted together and devised all
their measures craftily, that they might not be immediately found out; and thus
one took from the other what he afterwards announced and published. And this is
what Jeremiah calls stealing, because they secretly consulted, and then declared
to the people what they agreed upon among themselves; and they did this as
though every one had derived his oracle from heaven. I have, therefore, no doubt
but that the Prophet condemns these hidden consultations when he says that every
one stole from his neighhour.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE109</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed see the same thing now under the Papacy,
for the monks and unprincipled men of the same character have their own false
doctrines; and when they ascend the pulpit, every one speaks as though he was
endued with some special gift; and yet they steal every one from his friend, for
they are like the soothsayers or the magi, who concocted among themselves their
own falsehoods, and only brought out what they deemed necessary to delude the
common people. This, then, was one of the vices which the Prophet shews
prevailed among the false teachers, &#8212; that no one attended to the voice of
God, but that every one took furtively from his friend what he afterwards openly
proclaimed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, secondly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I am against the
prophets, who mollify their own tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Almost all interpreters take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hql</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lekech, </i>as signifying to render sweet or soft; and they understand that
the false prophets are condemned, because they flattered the wicked for the sake
of gain; for had they offended or exasperated them, they could not have attached
them to themselves. They then think that to mollify their tongue means here that
they used their tongue in speaking smooth and flattering things. But others give
another explanation, &#8212; that they mollified their tongue because they
polished their words in imitation of God&#8217;s servants, so that their speech
was sweeter than honey. But as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hql</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lekech,</i> means to receive and to take, and sometimes to raise on high, and
sometimes to carry, I see not why it should not be taken in its proper meaning.
I certainly see no reason to turn its meaning to a metaphor, when it can be
taken in its plain sense of raising their tongue; they elevated themselves, and
in high terms boasted that the office of teaching had been committed to them,
for we know how haughtily false teachers elevate themselves. Therefore the verse
may be taken thus, that God would punish those impostors who raised their
tongue, that is, who proudly boasted and boldly arrogated to themselves
authority, as though they were messengers from
heaven.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE110</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;an</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nam,</i> <i>he saith. </i>We know that it was a common thing for all the
prophets to add, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhy
&#181;an</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>nam Jeve, </i>the saying of Jehovah,
or the word of Jehovah, in order to shew that they said nothing but what they
had received from above. And if we read this verse as connected together, we
shall find true what I have said &#8212; that the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hql</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lekech, </i>does not mean the smoothness or adulation used, but, the lofty
vaunting of the false teachers, who wished to be deemed the organs of the Holy
Spirit, and assumed to themselves all the authority of God. For their elation
was this, that they confidently boasted that God himself had spoken, and said
that it was <i>the word; </i>and they did this, that whatever they prattled
might appear indisputed, though it was sufficiently evident that they falsely
pretended the name of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, thirdly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I am against those who
prophesy dreams of falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was
indeed necessary to say here, that though the false teachers arrogated to
themselves what alone belonged to the servants of God, they were yet mendacious.
He afterwards adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They narrate
them, and cause my people to err by their falsehoods and their
levity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning is, that however
proudly they might, have pretended the name of prophets, they were yet
impostors, who deceived the people by narrating to them their false dreams. The
word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dream
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is taken here in a good sense, but the word
added to it, shews that they boasted of dreams which were only their own; and
this is again confirmed when Jeremiah says, that they deceived the people by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
falsehoods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he adds, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
levity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which some render
&#8220;flattery.&#8221; I doubt not but that it means their inventions, which
were vain, because they proceeded only from vain presumption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though I sent them not nor
commanded them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This negation ought
especially to be noticed; for God shews how we are to form a judgment, when a
question is raised respecting true and false teachers. Whatever, therefore, is
without God&#8217;s command is like the wind, and will of itself vanish away.
There is, then, no solidity in anything but in God&#8217;s command. Hence it
follows, that all those who speak according to their own fancies are mendacious,
and that whatever they bring forward has no weight in it; for God sets these two
things in opposition the one to the other; on the one side are falsehood and
levity, and on the other, his command and his call. It hence follows, that no
one, except he simply obeys God and faithfully declares what he has received
from him, can be of any account; for his whole weight is lighter than a feather,
and all his apparent wisdom is falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would not profit his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In<i> </i>which words he warns
the people to shun them as the plague. But we see how the world indulges itself
in this respect; for they who are drowsy seek to absolve themselves on the plea
of ignorance, and throw the blame on their pastors, as though they were
themselves beyond the reach of danger. But the Lord here reminded the people,
that the teachers whom they received were pestilent; though for another reason
he testified that they were useless, and that in order that he might shake off
the vain confidence of the Jews, who were wont to set up this shield against all
God&#8217;s threatenings, that their false teachers promised them wonderful
things. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It appears sufficiently evident from this passage,
&#8212; that the contumacy of the Jews was so great, that they sought from every
quarter some excuse for their insensibility, as though they could with impunity
despise God when they rejected his word. For the devil by his artifice
fascinates the<b> </b>reprobate, when he renders God&#8217;s word either hateful
or contemptible; and whenever he can exasperate their minds, so that they hear
not God&#8217;s word except with disdain and bitterness, he gains fully his
object. The Jews, then, were led into such a state of mind, that they regarded
God&#8217;s word with hatred; and they were thus alienated from all docility and
from every care for religion. In short, the prophets, as it is well known,
everywhere employ the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesha, </i>which means a burden.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, a burden means a prophecy, which terrifies the
despisers of God by threatening them with vengeance. As, then, their minds were
exasperated, they called through hatred the word of God a burden, and used it as
a proverbial saying, &#8220;It<i> </i>is a burden, a burden.&#8221; They ought
to have<b> </b>been moved by God&#8217;s threatenings, and to have trembled on
hearing that he was angry with them. The word burden, then, ought to have
humbled them; but, on the contrary, they became exasperated, first, through
haughtiness, then through an indomitable contumacy, and thirdly, they kindled
into rage. We hence see how the expression arose, that the prophets called their
prophecies burdens. God now severely condemns this fury, because they hesitated
not thus openly to shew their insolence. It was surely a most shameful thing,
that the word of God should be thus called in disdain and contempt, in the ways
and streets; for they thus acted disdainfully and insolently against God; for it
was the same as though they treated his word with open contempt. It was then no
wonder that he reproved this fury with so much vehemence, by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if this people ask thee, What
is the burden of Jehovah?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This manner of asking was altogether derisive, when
they said to Jeremiah and to other servants of God, &#8220;What<i> </i>is the
burden?&#8221; that is, &#8220;What dost thou bring to us, what trouble is to
come on us?&#8221; They thus not only spoke contemptuously of God&#8217;s word,
but, as though this wickedness was not sufficient, they became, as I have said,
irritated and exasperated. If, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they ask thee, What is the
burden? </i></font><font face="Palatino">And he speaks not only of the common
people, but of the very prophets and priests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn how great a contempt for God then
prevailed, so that there was no integrity either in the priestly or the
prophetic order. It is indeed wonderful with what impudence they dared to boast
themselves to be God&#8217;s servants, while they spoke with so much insolence!
But the same thing happens in the world in our day; for we see that the
ministers of Satan in no other way hold the world under their power, than by
alluring the minds of the ungodly; and at the same time they cause God&#8217;s
word to be hated, and say that it brings not only troubles, but also torments.
Since, then, these unprincipled men, who thus lead with hatred and disdain the
true doctrine, occupy pulpits, we need not wonder that the same evil prevailed
in the ancient Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a prophet or a priest ask
thee, What is the burden of Jehovah? thou shalt say to them, What burden? I will
forsake thee, saith Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This was a
most grievous threatening, but it has not been well considered and rightly
understood; for interpreters have overlooked the implied contrast between the
presence and the absence of God. Nothing could have been more acceptable to the
Jews than God&#8217;s silence. And yet in no other way does he more clearly show
that he is a Father to us, caring for our salvation, than by familiarly
addressing us. Whenever, then, the prophetic word is announced, we have a sure
and a clear evidence of God&#8217;s presence, as though he wished to be
connected with us. But when the ungodly not only reject so remarkable a benefit,
but also furiously repel, as far as they can, such a favor, they desire and seek
the absence of God. Therefore God says, &#8220;Ye cannot bear my word, by which
symbol I shew that I am present with you;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will forsake
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;&#8221; </i>that is, &#8220;I will no
longer endure this indignity, but I will depart from you; there shall be

<div><font face="Palatino">At the first view this was not deemed grievous to the
Jews; for as I have said, the ungodly desire nothing more than that God should
be silent, and they thought that they had gained their greatest happiness, when
with consciences lulled to sleep they indulged themselves in their filth. It was
then their chief wish that God should depart from them. But yet there was
nothing more to be dreaded. The Prophet then shews here that they were extremely
infatuated and wholly fascinated by the devil, for they could desire nothing
more dreadful than that God should depart from them; as though he had said,
&#8220;My word is a weariness to you, and I in my turn will now avenge myself,
for I am weary of forbearing you, when I see that you can by no means be healed;
and as I have been hitherto assiduous in instructing you, and have found you
unteachable, I will now in my turn leave you.&#8221;<i> </i>It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Prophecy might indeed have been called a burden, when
anything sad was announced; but it might also have been so called, when men were
aroused to fear God, or when they were exhorted to repent. But God has a
reference here to that wicked impiety, when men dared in ridicule to call any
prophecy a burden. And hence it appears, that they were all so given up to their
sins, that the very name of God&#8217;s judgment was hated by them. We now then
perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning when he said, that God would punish all
those who called his word a burden; for the Prophets themselves were wont to
speak thus; and we find that Jeremiah in many places used this word. He does not
then speak here generally, but points out, as by the finger, a vice which
prevailed; for the Jews had so hardened themselves in hatred to sound doctrine,
that they said, &#8220;He! these Prophets do nothing but terrify us by
threatenings and by denouncing ruin on us; and what will be the end of all
this?&#8221; God says, that he would take punishment on all who thus spoke and
on all their families. It hence appears how much he abominated this blasphemy;
and hence also we see how precious to God is the honor of his word; for it is
not of every kind of sin that God speaks when he extends his vengeance to
posterity. It is the same thing as though Jeremiah had said, &#8220;It is
altogether intolerable, when men became irritated and exasperated against
God&#8217;s word.&#8221; And yet this evil is not an evil of one age only. We
see that the Israelites ever complained of God&#8217;s rigor; hence that
saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The ways of the
Lord are not tortuous, but rather your ways, O house of Israel.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
18:25.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here we must notice the wickedness of the human
mind; for God, as it has been before stated, has nothing else in view by calling
us to himself, but to make us partakers of eternal life and salvation. It is
then God&#8217;s design to receive us for the purpose or saving us; this is the
end intended by, all the prophets; and hence the Prophet called before the word
of God wheat; but what is done by men? They despise this favor; and not only so,
but turn food into poison and cease not to provoke God&#8217;s wrath. He was,
therefore, constrained to threaten them. When he finds us teachable, he allures
us to himself even with paternal kindness. But when we provoke him to wrath, we
in a manner force him to put on another character, according to what he says,
that he will be refractory towards the refractory.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:26.) Yet we complain when God deals rigidly with us. We cease not to carry on
war with him; but when he restrains and checks our insolence, we immediately
expostulate with him, as though he were too severe and his word offended us.
Whence is this offense? even from our obstinate wickedness. Were men to put an
end to their sinful course, the Lord would change his manner of dealing with
them, and gently treat them and foster them as chickens under his wings; but
this they suffer not; nay, they reject such a treatment as much as they can.
Hence it is, that they abhor the name of God and his word. What then is the
excuse for the complaint, when they say that God is too rigorous, as though his
word were a burden? There is none; for they are themselves refractory against
God, and thus his word becomes a hammer to break their heads, to shatter and
destroy them. We now see the reason why God not only declares that he was angry
with these ungodly despisers of his word, but also denounces the same vengeance
on their posterity.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet explains himself more clearly; he
shews why God would not have his word to be called a burden. Why so? because
they in a manner closed the way, so that they derived no benefit from
God&#8217;s word, while they regarded it with disdain and hatred; for the word
burden was an obstacle, so that they gave no access to God, nor opened their
ears to hear his word. God then bids them to come with empty and sincere hearts;
for it is a real preparation for a teachable spirit, when we acknowledge that we
ought to believe in God&#8217;s word, and also when we are not possessed by a

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the same subject, that every
one ought calmly and meekly to hear God speaking, he said, as we saw yesterday,
that the prophets were to be asked as to what God had spoken and what he had
answered; he thereby intimated that there must be docility, in order that
God&#8217;s word may obtain credit, authority, and favor among us. He again
repeats, that the word burden could not be endured by God; for, as we explained
yesterday, this word was used commonly by the Jews as expressive of hatred or
disdain, being as they were unwilling to receive sound
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In forbidding them to mention the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>it was the same thing as though he had said, &#8220;Let not this form of
speaking be any longer in use among you.&#8221; He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For to every one his word shall
be his burden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he shews
that what is bitter in prophecies is as it were accidental; for God has nothing
else in view in addressing men, but to call them to salvation. The word of God
then in itself ought to be deemed sweet and delightful. Whence then is this
bitterness and hatred towards it? even from the wickedness of men alone. As when
a sick person, eating the most wholesome food finds it turned into poison, the
cause being in himself; so it is with us, it is our own fault that the word of
God becomes a burden. It was, moreover, the Prophet&#8217;s design to shew that
the Jews had no reason to complain that prophecies were grievous to them, and
always announced some trouble; for God wishes to address men with lenity and
kindness, but he is forced by their wickedness to deal sharply with them. The
Prophet seems, however, to go still farther, as though he had said,
&#8220;Though prophecies should cease, yet every one shall be a prophet to
himself; for as they murmur against God, and cannot bear his judgment, however
silent God&#8217;s ministers may be, they will yet afford a sufficient cause for
condemnation, who dare thus to rise up against God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the design of the Prophet in saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall no more mention the
burden of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;This
shameful proverb, which brands God&#8217;s word with disgrace, shall no more be
used by you; this wicked practice shall cease,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for else to every one of you;
his word shall be a burden;&#8221; </i></font><font face="Palatino">so the
causal particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>is to be rendered. But if another sense be preferred, I feel no
objection, that is, that they ought to have considered the reason why God did
not deal more mildly with them; which was, because they were of a perverse
disposition, and thus they refused the paternal kindness which he was prepared
to shew, provided they received it.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE114</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is entitled to special notice, for we
see how the greater part cannot bear threatenings and terrors when announced to
them. Hence they entertain contempt and hatred towards heavenly doctrine; and
yet none consider why God so often threatens and terrifies them in his word. For
if men ceased to sin, God would cease to contend with them; but when they
continually provoke him, is he to be silent? and further, are his prophets to
suffer everything just to be violated, and God himself to be despised? Let us
then know that the fault is in us when God seems to deal rigidly with us, for we
do not allow him to use such a paternal language as he always would, were it not
that we put a hinderance in the way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet also adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye have corrupted the words
of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So ought the words to be rendered.
Here he justly accuses them, that they perverted the words of God, and in two
ways, because they constrained God by their wickedness to speak otherwise than
he wished, and also, because they were preposterous interpreters of his
dealings. For though God may severely chastise us, yet it is our duty to receive
his reproofs with a meek spirit, as they are necessary for us; but when we
murmur and become refractory, we pervert the word of God. We hence see that the
word of God is not only perverted in one way, but when we furiously oppose him,
we prevent him to deal gently and kindly with us; and we do the same when we
submit not to his reproofs, but rage against him whenever he summons us to
judgment. And as their wantonness was in this instance so great, the Prophet
here sets up against them in express terms the power of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that he is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>living
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and by this term he reminded them
that the ungodly, who vomited thus their blasphemies against him, would not go
unpunished; &#8220;See,&#8221;<i> </i>he says, &#8220;with whom ye have to do;
for you contend with the living God; this audacity will rebound on your own
heads; ye then carry on a fatal war.&#8221; He, secondly, adds, that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which expression he again
shews his power. And, thirdly, he says, that he is the <i>God </i>of that
people; as though he had said, that not only their impiety was madness in daring
to contend with God, but that it was also connected with ingratitude; for God
had adopted them as his people, and had promised to be their
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the design of the Prophet; he first
warned them not to entertain hatred in their hearts to prophetic doctrine;
secondly, he shewed that the whole fault was in themselves, as they constrained
God to deal severely with them; and further, that they perverted the word of
God, being false interpreters of it, and closing the door against his kindness
when he invited all the pious and the teachable; and lastly, he exalts
God&#8217;s power and commends his goodness, that he might thus aggravate the
sin of the people in daring to carry on war with God himself, and in despising
the favor conferred on them. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats what we noticed yesterday, and almost in
the same words. The meaning is, that if we desire to profit in God&#8217;s
school, we must beware lest our minds be preoccupied by any corrupt feeling. For
whence is it that God&#8217;s word is not savored by us, or excites in us a
bitter spirit? even because we are infected by some sinful lust or passion which
wholly corrupts our judgment. God then would have us to come to him free from
every vicious disposition, and to be so teachable as to inquire only what he
teaches, what he may answer to us; for whosoever becomes thus disentangled and
free, will doubtless find the prophetic doctrine to be for his benefit. There is
then but one cause why God&#8217;s word does not profit us, but on the contrary
is injurious and fatal to us, and that is, because we seek not what God speaks,
that is, because we are not teachable, nor come to learn, but either sloth, or
contempt, or ingratitude, or perverseness, or something of this kind, bears rule
in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says here, that the prophets ought to be asked
as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to what God
speaks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or as to

God&#8217;s faithful servants; for if a hearer is ready to obey, he will find
from a faithful teacher what may justly please and do him good. In short he
shews that there is nothing wrong in the prophets when their doctrine does not
please us, but that this happens because we do not regard what Jeremiah here
reminds us of, that we ought to hear God that we may learn, and that we may obey
his voice. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet confirms what he had said, for God
might have seemed to be too indignant, having been so grievously offended at one
short expression. The Jews had borrowed from the prophets themselves, when they
called prophecies burdens, as we have already said, and as we find in many
places. Now as the lubricity of language is great, though the Jews might have
done wrong as to one word, it might yet have appeared an insufficient reason for
the punishment which God threatened to inflict. But the Prophet here shews that
God was justly angry with them, for he had sent to them, and often warned them
not to use this form of speaking, which was a manifest evidence of their
impiety. As then they had thus disregarded God and his warnings, was it an
excusable mistake? In short, Jeremiah shews that they had not erred
inconsiderately, as it often happens as to those who speak rashly and
thoughtlessly, but that this perverted way of speaking proceeded from determined
wickedness, from a wish to affix some mark of disgrace to God&#8217;s word; and
thus they acted in disdain towards God himself. This then is the import of the
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye shall
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even when I warn you not to speak
in this manner; if then ye persevere in this obstinacy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold
I</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; God here declares that he would
take vengeance. As to this sentence, most interpreters derive the verb from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nushe, </i>making
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>he, </i>the final letter; but I doubt the correctness of this; yet if this
explanation be adopted, we must still hold that the Prophet alludes to the verb,
to take away, which immediately follows. But I am disposed to take another view,
that God would by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>removing remove
them. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It must be noticed that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesha, </i>which has often been mentioned, comes from the same root;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesha, </i>a burden, is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nusha,</i> to remove or take away. As therefore this proverb was commonly
used, that prophetic doctrine ever brought some burden and trouble, God answers,
&#8220;I will take you away;&#8221; that is, &#8220;ye<i> </i>shall find by
experience how grievous and burdensome your wickedness is to me, it shall
rebound on your heads; ye have burdened and treated with indignity my word, and
I will treat you with indignity,&#8221; but in what manner?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take you away even by
taking you away. </i></font><font face="Palatino">If any one approves more of
the sense of forgetting, let him follow his own judgment; but that explanation
appears to me unmeaning, &#8220;I will forget you,&#8221; except
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nusha, </i>be taken in the second place as signifying to take away. &#8220;I
will forget you, that I may take you
away.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE116</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will pluck you
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which some render, &#8220;I will
forsake you,&#8221; but they seem not to understand what the Prophet intended;
for he declares something more grievous and more dreadful than before, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pluck you
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and yet this sense does not satisfy
me. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;fn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuthash, </i>means to extend, and metaphorically to cast far off; and casting
off or away seems to suit the passage best. God then would not only remove or
take away the Jews from their own place, but would also cast them far off into
distant countries. He thus denounces on them an exile, by which they were to be
driven as it were into another world. For had they dwelt in the neighborhood, it
would have been more tolerable to them, but as they were to be driven away, as
by a violent storm to the farthest and remotest regions, it was much more
grievous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the city also which I gave to
you and to your fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verbs, to
cast away and to pluck up, do not well suit stones; but as to the sense, it may
rightly be said that God would take away the city with its inhabitants, as
though they were driven away by the wind. And this was added designedly, for the
Jews relying on this promise, &#8220;This is my rest for ever, here will I
dwell,&#8221; thought it impossible that the sanctuary of God would ever be
destroyed. As then this vain confidence deceived them, that the city which God
had chosen as his habitation would stand always, the Prophet expressly adds that
the city itself would perish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is also added, that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>given
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to them and their

</i>He anticipates all objections, and shakes off from the Jews the vain hope by
which they were inebriated, even that the city was given perpetually to them,
and that God resided there to defend them; &#8220;This donation,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;will not keep you nor the city itself from destruction.&#8221; He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From my
presence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it was customary for them
to pretend God&#8217;s name, when they sought to harden their hearts against the
threatenings of the prophets; but God here answers them and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from my
presence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;In<i> </i>vain do ye harbor the thought respecting the perpetuity of the

and enjoy abundance of every blessing, though it was then nearly emptied; for
everything precious had become a prey to the conqueror; and we indeed know how
great was the avarice and rapacity of Nebuchadnezzar. The city then was at that
time almost empty, and desolate in comparison with its former splendor. They
however who remained might indeed have hoped for a better state of things, but
those who had gone into exile were become like dead bodies. Hence miserable
<i>Jeconiah, </i>who was banished and deprived of his kingdom, was apparently
undergoing a most grievous punishment, together with his companions, who had
been led away with him; and the Jews who remained at Jerusalem no doubt
flattered themselves, as though God had dealt more kindly with them. Had they
really repented, they would indeed have given thanks to God for having spared
them; but as they had abused his forbearance, it was necessary to set before
them what this chapter contains, even that they foolishly reasoned when they
concluded, that God had been more propitious to them than to the
rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is shewn by a vision: the Prophet saw two
baskets or flaskets; and he saw them full of figs, and that before the temple of
God; but the figs in one were sweet and savory; and the figs in the other were
bitter, so that they could not be eaten. By the sweet figs God intended to
represent Jeconiah and the other exiles, who had left their country: and he
compares them to the ripe figs; for ripe figs have a sweet taste, while the
other figs are rejected on account of their bitterness. In like manner,
<i>Jeconiah </i>and the rest had as it were been consumed; but there were figs
still remaining; and he says that the lot of those was better whom God had in
due time punished, than of the others who remained, as they were accumulating a
heavier judgment by their obstinacy. For since the time that Nebuchadnezzar had
spoiled the city and had taken from it everything valuable, those who remained
had not ceased to add sins to sins, so that there was a larger portion of divine
vengeance ready to fall on them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the design of this vision. And he says
that the vision was presented to him by God; and to say this was <i>very
</i>necessary, that his doctrine might have more weight with the people. God,
indeed, often spoke without a vision; but we have elsewhere stated what was the
design of a vision; it was a sort of seal to what was delivered; for in order
that the Prophet might possess greater authority, they not only spoke, but as it
were sealed their doctrine, as though God had graven on it, as it were by his
finger, a certain mark. But as this subject has been elsewhere largely handled,
I shall now pass it by.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two baskets of figs
set before the temple.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The place ought to be noticed.
It may have been that the Prophet was not allowed to move a step from his own
house; and the vision may have been presented to him in the night, during thick
darkness: but the temple being mentioned, shews that a part of the people had
not been taken away without cause, and the other part left in the city; for it
had proceeded from God himself. For in the temple God manifested himself; and
therefore the prophets, when they wished to storm the hearts of the ungodly,
often said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go forth shall God
from his temple.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
26:21;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Micah
1:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The temple then is to be taken here for the tribunal
of God. Hence, he says, that these two baskets were set in the temple; as though
he said, that the whole people stood at God&#8217;s tribunal, and that those who
had been already cast into exile had not been carried away at the will of their
enemies, but because God designed to punish them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The time also is mentioned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After Yeconiah the son of
Jehohoiakim had been carried away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for
had not this been added, the vision would have been obscure, and no one at this
day could understand why God had set two baskets in the presence of Jeremiah. A
distinction then is made here between the exiles and those who dwelt in their
own country; and at the same time they were reduced to great poverty, and the
<i>city </i>was deprived of its splendor; there was hardly any magnificence in
the Temple, the royal palace was spoiled, and the race of David only reigned by
permission. But though the calamity of the city and people was grievous, yet, as
it has been said, the Jews who remained in the city thought themselves in a
manner happy in comparison with their brethren, who were become as it were dead;
for God had ejected the king, and he was treated disdainfully as a captive, and
the condition of the others was still worse. This difference then between the
captives and those who remained in the land is what is here
represented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds, that one
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>basket
</i></font><font face="Palatino">had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>very good
figs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that the other had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>very bad figs.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">If it be asked whether Jeconiah was in himself
approved by God, the answer is easy, &#8212; that he was suffering punishment
for his sins. Then the Prophet speaks here comparatively, when he calls some
good and others bad. We must also notice, that he speaks not here of persons but
of punishment; as though he had said, &#8220;ye feel a dread when those exiles
are mentioned, who have been deprived of the inheritance promised them by God:
this seems hard to you; but this is moderate when ye consider what end awaits
you.&#8221; He then does not call Jeconiah and other captives good in
themselves; but he calls them good figs, because God had chastened them more
gently than he intended to chastise Zedekiah and the rest. Thus he calls the
Jews who remained bad figs, not only for this reason, because they were more
wicked, though this was in part the reason, but he had regard to the punishment
that was nigh at hand; for the severity of God was to be greater towards those
whom he had spared, and against whom he had not immediately executed his
vengeance. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet. The rest we shall defer
to the next Lecture.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since thou

<div><font face="Palatino">In the last Lecture we began to explain the meaning
of the vision which the Prophet relates. We said that the miserable exiles whose
condition might have appeared to be the worst, are yet compared to good figs,
and that those who still remained in the country are compared to bad and bitter
figs. We have explained why God shewed this vision to his servant Jeremiah, even
because the captives might have otherwise been driven to despair, especially
through the weariness of delay, for they saw that their brethren were still in
possession of the inheritance granted them by God, while they were driven into a
far country, and as it were disinherited, so that no one could regard them as
God&#8217;s people. As then despair might have overwhelmed their minds, God
designed to give them some comfort. On the other hand, those who remained in the
land not only exulted over the miserable exiles, but also abused the forbearance
of God, so that they obstinately resisted all threatenings, and thus hardened
themselves more and more against God&#8217;s judgment, hence God declares what
was remotest from what was commonly thought, that they had a better lot who
lived captives in Babylon than those who remained quietly as it were in their
own nest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have said that the badness of the figs is not to
be explained of guilt, but of punishment: and this is what Jeremiah confirms,
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As these good figs,
so will I acknowledge the captivity for
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or for beneficence,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thube. </i>It is well known that captivity means the persons led captive, it
being a collective word. Then he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>will
acknowledge the captives of Judah, whom I have driven from this people, so as to
do them good again.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> 
fE120</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As this doctrine was then incredible, God calls the
attention of the Jews to the final issue; as though he had said, that they were
mistaken who took only a present view of things, and did not extend their
thoughts to the hope of mercy. For they thus reasoned, &#8220;It is better to
remain in the country where God is worshipped, where the Temple is and the
altar, than to live among heathen nations; it is better to have some liberty
than to be under the yoke of tyranny; it is better to retain even the name of
being a separate people than to be scattered here and there, so as not to be a
community at all.&#8221; Hence, according to their state at that time, they
thought their condition better: but God corrected this wrong judgment; for they
ought to have looked to the end, and what awaited the exiles and captives as
well as those whom the king of Babylon had for a time spared. Though, indeed, it
was the Prophet&#8217;s object to alleviate the grief of those who had been led
away into Chaldea, yet he had a special regard to the people over whom he was
appointed an instructor and teacher. He was then at Jerusalem; and we know how
perverse were those whom he had to contend with, for none could have been more
obstinate than that people. As God had delayed his punishment, they supposed
that they had wholly escaped, especially as they had an uncle as a successor to
their captive king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, then, was their contempt of threatenings;
hence was their greater liberty in sinning: they thought that God had taken
vengeance on the exiles, and that they were saved as being the more excellent
portion of the community. The Prophet, therefore, in order to break down this
presumption, which he could not bend, set before them this vision, which had
been given him from above. We now, then, see that the doctrine especially set
forth is, that God would remember the captives for the purpose of doing them
good, as though he had said that a wrong judgment was formed of the calamity of
a few years, and that the end was to be looked to. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he said in the last verse, but in
other words, for it was difficult to persuade them that they were happier who
were apparently lost, than those who still enjoyed some measure of safety. He
had said that he would <i>acknowledge </i>them; but he now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set my eye upon
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He uses a metaphor which often
occurs in Scripture, for God is said to turn away his face when he hides his
favor; and in the same sense he is said to forget, to depart, not to care, to
despise, to cast away. Then, as God might have seemed to have no more any care
for this people, he says, &#8220;I<i> </i>will set my eyes on them.&#8221; But
he goes even farther, for he refers to the sentence announced in the last verse
&#8212; he had said that he was the author of their exile, &#8220;I have cast
them into the land of the Chaldeans&#8221;<i> </i>but he now confirms the same
thing, though in other words, when he says, &#8220;Mine eyes will I set on them
<i>for good.&#8221; </i>For God is said to visit men, not only when he manifests
his favor towards them, but also when he chastises them and punishes them for
their sins. He had then set his eyes on them to execute punishment; he says now
that he would act differently, that he would kindly treat the
miserable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will restore
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For, as he had sent them away, it
was in his power to restore them. As, then, he could heal the wound inflicted by
his own hand, this promise ought to have been sufficient to dispel every doubt
from the minds of the captives as to their return; and further, the Jews, who as
yet remained in Jerusalem and in the land of Judah, ought to have known that
they in vain boasted in their good lot, as though God treated them better than
their captive brethren, for it was in his power to restore those whom he had
banished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will build and not pull them
down, I will plant and not pluck them up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This mode of speaking would not be so significant either in Latin or in
Greek; but such a repetition, as it is well known, often occurs in Hebrew. But
whenever a negative is added to an affirmative, such form of expression is to be
thus interpreted, &#8220;I<i> </i>shall be so far from plucking them up, that I
will plant them; I shall be so far from pulling them down, that I will build
them up;&#8221; or, &#8220;since<i> </i>I had pulled them down, I will now build
them up; since I had plucked them up, I will now plant them:&#8221; or a
perpetuity may be meant, as though God had said, &#8220;I<i> </i>will plant
them, so as not to pluck them again; I will build them, so as not to pull them
down again.&#8221; But the most frequent import of such expressions is what I
first mentioned, &#8220;I will not pull them down, but on the contrary build
them up; I will not pluck them up, but on the contrary plant
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the whole is, that however sad might
be the calamities of the people in Chaldea, they being as exiles reduced to a
desolate condition, yet God could collect them again, like one who plants a tree
or builds a house. The metaphor of building is common in Scripture, and also
that of planting. God is said to plant men, when he introduces a certain order
among them, or when he allots to them a certain place to dwell in, or when he
grants them peace and quietness. God is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:2, to have planted his people; but I will not refer to the many passages
which are everywhere to be met with. God often says that he had planted his
vineyard.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:2, etc.) And then well known is this passage,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The branch of the
Lord, and the planting for his
glory.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
60:21)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is said of the preservation of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, that though God severely
chastised the exiles who had been led into Chaldea, yet their condition was not
to be estimated by one day, or a month, or a few years, but that a happy end was
to be expected. And as God intended at length to shew himself reconcilable and
propitious, it follows that the calamity which had happened to them<i> </i>was
lighter than that which awaited the rest, who resolutely despised God and his
prophets, and thus increased the vengeance which had been already denounced on
them. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is added the main benefit, that God would not
only restore the captives, that they might dwell in the land of promise, but
would also change them inwardly; for except God gives us a conviction as to our
own sins, and then leads us by his Spirit to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>whatever benefit he may bestow on us, they will only conduce to our greater
ruin. The Prophet has hitherto spoken of the alleviation of punishment, as
though he had said, &#8220;God<i> </i>will stretch forth his hand to restore his
people to their own country.&#8221; Then the remission of punishment is what has
been hitherto promised; but now the Prophet speaks of a much more excellent
favor, that God would not only mitigate punishment, but that he would also
inwardly change and reform their hearts, so that they would not only return to
their own country, but would also become a true Church, a name of which they had
vainly boasted. For though they had been chosen to be a peculiar people, yet, as
they had departed from true religion, they were only a Church in name. But now
God promises that he would bring them, not only to enjoy temporal and fading
blessings, but also eternal salvation, for they would truly fear and serve
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what we ought carefully to observe, for
the more bountiful God is towards men, the more is his vengeance kindled by
ingratitude. What, then, would it avail us to abound in all good things, except
we had evidences of God&#8217;s paternal favor towards us? But when we regard
this end, that God testifies to us that he is our Father by his bounty towards
us, we then make a right use of all his blessings; and God&#8217;s benefits
cannot conduce to our salvation except we regard them in this light. Hence
Jeremiah, after having spoken of the people&#8217;s restoration, justly exalts
this favor above everything else, that the people would repent, so that they
would not only fully partake of all the blessings they could expect, but would
also worship God in sincerity and truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, God says that he would give
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them a heart to know
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word heart is to be taken here
for the mind or understanding, as it means often in Hebrew. It, indeed, means
frequently the seat of the affections, and also the soul of man, as including
reason or understanding and will. But though the heart is taken often for the
seat of the affections, it is yet applied to designate the other part of the
soul, according to these words,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Hitherto God has
not given thee a heart to understand.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
29:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Latins sometimes take it in this sense, according
to what Cicero shews when he quotes these words of Ennius, &#8220;Catus<i>
</i>AElius Sextus was a man remarkable in understanding.&#8221; <i>(Egregie
cordatus</i>; Cic. 1 Tuscul.) Then, in this passage, the word heart is put for
the light of the understanding. Yet another thing must be stated, that a true
knowledge of God is not, as they say, imaginary, but is ever connected<i>
</i>with a right feeling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the words of the Prophet we learn that
repentance is the peculiar gift of God. Had Jeremiah said only that they who had
been previously driven by madness into ruin, would return to a sane mind, he
might have appeared as one setting up free-will and putting conversion in the
power of man himself, according to what the Papists hold, who dream that we can
turn to either side, to good as well as to evil; and thus they imagine that we
can, after having forsaken God, of ourselves turn to him. But the Prophet
clearly shews here, that it is God&#8217;s peculiar gift; for what God claims
for himself, he surely does not take away from men, as though he intended to
deprive them of any right which may belong to them, according to what the
Pelagians hold, who seem to think that God appears almost envious when he
declares that man&#8217;s conversion is in his power; but this is nothing less
than a diabolical madness. It is, then, enough for us to know, that what God
claims for himself is not taken away from men, for it is not in their
power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, he affirms that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give
</i></font><font face="Palatino">them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a heart
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to understand, we hence learn that men are by
nature blind, and also that when they are blinded by the devil, they cannot
return to the right way, and that they cannot be otherwise capable of light than
by having God to illuminate them by his Spirit. We then see that man, from the
time he fell, cannot rise again until God stretches forth his hand not only to
help him, (as the Papists say, for they dare not claim to themselves the whole
of repentance, but they halve it between themselves and God,) but even to do the
whole work from the beginning to the end; for God is not called the helper in
repentance, but the author of it. God, then, does not say, &#8220;I will help
them, so that when they raise up their eyes to me, they shall be immediately
assisted;&#8221; no, he does not say this; but what he says is, &#8220;I<i>
</i>will give them a heart to understand.&#8221; And as understanding or
knowledge is the main thing in repentance, it follows that man remains wholly
under the power of the devil, and is, as it were, his slave, until God draws him
forth from his miserable bondage. In short, we must maintain, that as soon as
the devil draws us from the right way of salvation, nothing can come to our
minds but what sinks us more and more in ruin, until God interposes, and thus
restore us when thinking of no such thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage also shews, that we cannot really turn
to God until we acknowledge him to be the Judge; for until the sinner sets
himself before God&#8217;s tribunal, he will never be touched with the feeling
of true repentance. Let us then know that the door of repentance is then opened
to us, when God constrains us to look to him. At the same time there is more
included in the term </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">than the majesty of God, for he assumes this
principle, which ought to have been sufficiently known to the whole people, that
he was the only true God who had chosen for himself the seed of Abraham, who had
published the Law by Moses, who had made a covenant with the posterity of
Abraham. There is then no doubt but that the Prophet meant that when the Jews
became illuminated, they would be convinced of what they had forgotten, that is,
that they had departed from the only true God. This mode of speaking then means
the same as though he had said, &#8220;I will open their eyes, that they may at
length acknowledge that they are apostates, and be thus humbled when made
sensible how grievous was their impiety in forsaking me the fountain of living
waters.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that they should be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to him a
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that he in his turn would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to them a
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the whole
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words the Prophet shews
more clearly what he had before referred to, that God&#8217;s blessings would be
then altogether salutary when they regarded their giver. As long then as we
regard only the blessings of God, our insensibility produces this effect, that
the more bountiful he is towards us, the more culpable we become. But when we
regard God&#8217;s bounty and paternal kindness towards us, we then really enjoy
his blessings. This is the meaning of the Prophet&#8217;s words when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>shall be
to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What this mode of speaking means has been stated
elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though God rules the whole world, he yet declares
that he is the God of the Church; and the faithful whom he has adopted, he
favors with this high distinction, that they are his people; and he does this
that they may be persuaded that there is safety in him, according to what is
said by Habakkuk,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou art our God,
we shall not die.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Habakkuk
1:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And of this sentence Christ himself is the best
interpreter, when he says, that he is not the God of the dead, but of the
living,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422038&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
20:38; ) he proves by the testimony of Moses, that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
though dead, were yet alive. How so; because God would not have declared that he
was their God, were they not living to him. Since then he regards them as his
people, he at the same time shews that there is life for them laid up in him. In
short, we see that there is here promised by God not a restoration for a short
time, but he adds the hope of eternal life and salvation; for the Jews were not
only to return to their own country, when the time came to leave Chaldea, and a
liberty granted them to build their own city; but they were also to become the
true Church of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the reason is also added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they will return to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with their whole
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He repeats what we have already
observed, that they would be wise <i>(cordatos) </i>and intelligent, whereas
they had been for a long time stupid and foolish, and the devil had so blinded
them, that they were not capable of receiving sound doctrine. But these two
things, the reconciliation of God with men and repentance, are necessarily
connected together, yet repentance ought not to be deemed as the cause of pardon
or of reconciliation, as many falsely think who imagine that men deserve pardon
because they repent. It is indeed true that God is never propitious to us,
except when we turn to him; but the connection, as it has been already stated,
is not such that repentance is the cause of pardon, nay, this very passage
clearly shews that repentance itself depends on the grace and mercy of God.
Since this is true, it follows that men are anticipated by God&#8217;s
gratuitous kindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence further learn, that God is not otherwise
propitious to us than according to his good pleasure, so that the cause of all
is only in himself. Whence is it that a sinner returns to the right way and
seeks God from whom he has departed? Is it because he is moved to do so of
himself? Nay, but because God illuminates his mind and touches his heart, or
rather renews it. How is it that God illuminates him who has become blind?
Surely for this we can find no other cause than the gratuitous mercy of God.
When God then is propitious to men, so as to restore them to himself, does he
not anticipate them by his grace? How then can
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance
</i></font><font face="Palatino">be called the cause of reconciliation, when it
is its effect? It cannot be at the same time its effect and
cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought therefore carefully to notice the context
here, for though the Prophet says that the Jews, when they returned, would be
God&#8217;s people, because they would turn to him with their whole heart, he
yet had before explained whence this turning or conversion would proceed, even
because God would shew them mercy. They who pervert such passages according to
their own fancies, are not so acquainted with Scripture as to know that there is
a twofold reconciliation of men with God: He is first reconciled to men in a
hidden manner, for when they despise him, he anticipates them by his grace, and
illuminates their minds and renews their hearts. This first reconciliation is
what they do not understand. But there is another reconciliation, known by
experience, even when we feel that the wrath of God towards us is pacified, and
are indeed made sensible of this by the effects. To this the reference is made
in these words,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Turn ye to me, and
I will turn to you,&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
1:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, &#8220;I appear severe and rigid to you; but
whence is this? even because ye cease not to provoke my wrath; return to me, and
you shall find me ready to spare you.&#8221; God therefore did not then first
begin to pardon sinners, when he does them good, but as he had been previously
pacified, hence he turns them to himself, and afterwards shews that he is really
reconciled to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is intimated sincerity or
integrity, as by a double heart, or a heart and a heart, is signified
dissimulation. It is certain that no one turns to God in such a manner that he
puts off all the affections of the flesh, that he is renewed at once<i> </i>in
God&#8217;s image, so that he is freed from every stain. Such a conversion is
never found in man. But when the Scripture speaks of the whole heart, it is in
contrast with dissimulation;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;with my whole
heart have I sought thee,&#8221; says David; &#8220;I have hid thy words and
will keep them: I have prayed for thy favor; I will ask,&#8221;<i> </i>etc.,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm

10:12)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David did not divest himself of everything sinful,
for he confesses in many places that he was laboring under many sins; but the
clear meaning is, that what God requires is integrity. In short, the whole heart
is integrity, that is when we deal not hypocritically with God, but desire from
the heart to give up ourselves to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we have before refuted the error of those who
think that repentance is the cause why God becomes reconciled to us, so now we
must know that God will not be propitious to us except we seek him. For there is
a mutual bond of connection, so that God anticipates us by his grace, and also
calls us to himself; in short, he draws us, and we feel in ourselves the working
of the Holy Spirit. We do not indeed turn, unless we are turned; we do not turn
through our own will or efforts, but it is the Holy Spirit&#8217;s work. Yet he
who under pretext of grace indulges himself and cares not for God, and seeks not
repentance, cannot flatter himself that he is one of God&#8217;s people; for as
we have said, repentance is necessary. It follows, &#8212; but I cannot to-day
finish this part, for he speaks of the badness of the figs, and of the remnant
which still remained.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God, after having promised to deal kindly with the
captives, now declares that he would execute heavier punishment on King
Zedekiah, and the whole people who yet remained in their own country. We have
stated why God exhibited this vision to the Prophet, even that he might support
their minds who saw nothing but grounds of despair, and that also, on the other
hand, he might correct their pride who flattered themselves in their own lot,
because God had deferred his vengeance as to them. Then the Prophet, having
given comfort to the miserable exiles, now speaks against Zedekiah and his
people, who boasted that God was propitious to them, and that they had not only
been fortunate, but also wise in continuing in their own
country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zedekiah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and all who remained in Judea,
were like the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bad
figs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which could not be eaten on
account of their bitterness. I have said that this is to be referred to
punishment and not to guilt. They had sinned, I allow, most grievously; but we
are to regard the design of the Prophet. The meaning then is, that though the
condition of those who had been driven into captivity was for the present
harder, yet God would deal more severely with those who remained, because he had
for a time spared them, and they did not repent, but hardened themselves more
and more in their wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we know that Zedekiah was set over the kingdom of
Judah, when Jeconiah surrendered himself to Nebuchadnezzar: he was the uncle of
Jeconiah, and reigned eleven years; and during that time he ought to have been
at least wise at the expense of another. For Eliakim, who was also called
Jehoiakim, had been chastised, and that not only once; but Nebuchadnezzar, after
having spoiled the temple, rendered him tributary to himself, on his return to
Chaldea. At length, after having been often deceived by him, he became extremely
displeased with him; and his son, who had reigned with his father, three months
after his death, voluntarily surrendered himself into the power and will of the
conqueror. Mathaniah afterwards reigned, of whom the Prophet speaks here. So, he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I
render</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zedekiah

princes, and the remnants of Jerusalem, who remain in this land,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and those who dwell in the land
of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for many had fled thither; and
we know that they were confederates with the Egyptians, and that through a vain
confidence in them they often rebelled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this was also the reason why the prophets so
sharply reproved them: they relied on the help of Egypt, and took shelter under
its protection. When, therefore, they found themselves exposed to the will of
their enemies, they fled into Egypt. But Nebuchadnezzar afterwards, as we shall
see, conquered Egypt also. Thus it happened that they were only for a short time
beyond the reach of danger. But as fugitive slaves, when recovered, are
afterwards treated more severely by their masters, so also the rage of King
Nebuchadnezzar became more violent against them. It now follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet borrows his words from Moses, in
order to secure authority to his prophecy; for the Jews were ashamed to reject
Moses, as they believed that the Law came from God: it would at least have been
deemed by them an abominable thing to deny credit to the Law. And yet they
boldly rejected all the prophets, though they were but faithful interpreters of
the Law, as the case is with the Papists of the present day, who, though they
dare not deny but that the Scripture contains celestial truth, yet furiously
reject what is alleged from it. Similar was the perverseness of the Jews.<i>
</i>Hence the prophets, in order to gain more credit to their words, often
borrowed their very words from Moses, as though they had recited from a written
document what had been dictated to them. For in Deuteronomy and in other places
Moses spoke a language of this kind, &#8212; that God would give up the people
to a concussion or a commotion, for a reproach, for a proverb, for a taunt, to
all the nations of the earth.

<div><font face="Palatino">It is then the same as though Jeremiah had said, that
the time would at length come when the Jews would find that so many maledictions
had not been pronounced in vain by Moses. They no doubt read Moses; but as they
were so stupid, no fear, no reverence for God was felt by them, even when he
terrified them with such words as these. The Prophet then says, that the time
was now near when they should know by experience that God had not in vain
threatened them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set them for a

such, that it would move and disturb all nations. He indeed mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
kingdoms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but the meaning is the same.
He then adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, that they would be subjected to the condemnation of all nations.
They had refused to submit to God&#8217;s judgment, and when he would have made
them ashamed for their good, they had wickedly resisted. It was therefore
necessary to subject them to the reproach of all people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a proverb and for a

similar meaning must be given to,

heathens wished to describe a most grievous calamity, they would take this
example, &#8220;Yes,<i> </i>it is all over with the Jews, no nation has become
so wretched.&#8221; The same view is to be taken of <i>execration; </i>for he
intimates that they would become a type and a pattern of a curse, &#8220;Yes,
may you perish like the Jews; may God execute vengeance on you, as he has done
on the Jews.&#8221; He then adds, that this would happen to them

become objects of reproach, so that all would point at them with the finger of
scorn, accompanied with every mark of reproach, and would be also taking them as
an example of execration. He afterwards adds &#8212; </font><br></div>

speaks as from the mouth of Moses, that his prophecy might be more weighty, and
that he might frighten those men who were so refractory. There are here three
kinds of punishments which we often meet with, under which are included all
other punishments. But as God for the most part punishes the sins of men by

what had been promised to their fathers, they thought that it could never be
taken away from them. They therefore became torpid in their sins, as though God
was bound to them. The Prophet ridicules this folly by saying, that the promise
and favor of God would not prevent him from depriving them of the land and of
its possession, and from rejecting them as though they were aliens,
notwithstanding the fact, that he had formerly adopted them as his
children.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the meaning of both parts of this vision.
For the Prophet wished to alleviate the sorrow of the exiles when he said, that
their state at length would be better; and so he promised that God would be
reconciled to them after having for a time chastised them. Thus it is no small
comfort to us when we regard the end; for as the Apostle says to the Hebrews,
when we feel the scourges of God, sorrow is a hinderance to a patient suffering,
as chastisement is for the present grievous, bitter, and difficult to be
endured.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:11.) It is therefore necessary, if we would patiently submit to God, to have
regard to the issue: for until the sinner begins to taste of God&#8217;s grace
and mercy, he will fret and murmur, or he will be stupid and hardened; and
certainly he will receive no comfort. Afterwards the Prophet shews, on the other
hand, that though God may spare us for a time, there is yet no reason for us to
indulge ourselves, for he will at length make up for the delay by the heaviness
of his punishment: the more indulgently he deals with us, the more grievous and
dreadful will be his vengeance, when he sees that we have abused his
forbearance. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">his prophecy no doubt preceded the vision which we
have just explained, and which had just been presented to Jeremiah<i> </i>when
Jehoiakim died, and when Zedekiah reigned in the place of Jeconiah; who, being
the last king, was substituted for his nephew Jeconiah. But related now is the
prophecy which Jeremiah was bidden to proclaim in the fourth year of Jehoiakim;
and he reigned, as we shall hereafter see, eleven years. We hence conclude that
his book is composed of various addresses, but that the order of time has not
always been preserved. Now the sum of the whole is, that when God found that the
people could not be amended and restored to a right mind by any warnings, he
denounced final ruin both on the Jews and on all the neighboring nations: but
why he included the heathens we shall hereafter see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that this prophecy was committed to him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he adds, that the same
year was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the first of King
Nebuchadnezar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This seems inconsistent
with other places, where the third of Jehoiakim is mentioned for the fourth
year; and hence a long time is allotted for the first year of Nebuchadnezar. But
a solution of this is not difficult, if we consider that Nebuchadnezar suddenly
returned into Chaldea to settle his affairs at home, when the report of his
father&#8217;s death was brought to him; for he feared, lest in his absence a
tumult should arise, as it often happened. He was therefore anxious to secure
his own affairs; and having settled things at home, he brought Jehoiakim into
subjection, and in the fourth year of his reign he compelled him to open his
treasures, and also led away<i> </i>captive those whom he wished. And it was at
this time that Daniel and his companions were led away into exile, and the
precious vessels of the Temple were removed. As to the first year of
Nebuchadnezar&#8217;s reign, he reigned first with his father; and then when he
reigned alone, the beginning of a new reign is justly mentioned as the first
year. Though then he was made king, yet as he did not exercise the chief power
until his father&#8217;s death, it was not until that event that he was really
king; this is the reason why mention is made of his first year. But we ought
especially to notice what the Prophet says, &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word came

be the public herald of God. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now expostulates with the Jews, because they
had not only perfidiously departed from the true worship of God, and despised
the whole teaching of his Law, but because they had shaken off the yoke, and
designedly and even obstinately rejected all warnings, being not moved by
reproofs nor even by threatenings. He does not then simply charge them with
impiety and ingratitude, but adds the sin of perverseness, that they were like
untameable wild beasts, and could by no means be corrected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that from the thirteenth year of
Josiah king of Judah, to that year</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which was the <i>twenty-third year, </i>he had not ceased faithfully to
perform the office committed to him, but had effected nothing. It hence appears
how incorrigible was their wickedness. We have seen, at the beginning of the
book, that he was called by God to be a Prophet in the thirteenth year of King
Josiah; and he had now been engaged in his calling, as he declares, for
twenty-three years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had spent his time in vain, he had consumed much
labor without any fruit. It is then no wonder that he now accuses them of
perverseness, and that in the name of God; for he pleads not his own cause, but
shews what the Jews deserved, considering how much God had labored in reclaiming
them, and that they had rejected all his warnings and refused all his remedies.
Then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the thirteenth year of
Josiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and afterwards in a parenthesis he
adds, that he had already discharged his office for twenty-three
years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We learn that the Prophet spoke thus seventeen years
before the destruction of the City and Temple; for he had accomplished forty
years before the people were driven into exile, and before they who thought
themselves safe, miserably perished. He continued to the death of Josiah; and
afterwards about twenty-two transpired; for Jehoiakim reigned eleven years; and
without reckoning the short time of Jeconiah, Mathaniah, called also Zedekiah,
was in the eleventh year removed, and disgracefully and reproachfully put to
death. Thus it appears that the Prophet constantly labored for forty
years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, also, we learn how diabolical was the madness
of that people in rejecting so many admonitions. And if we connect another
thing, to which I lately referred, that they had been taught by many examples,
it will appear still more evident that the disease of impiety as to that people
was altogether incurable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage deserves special attention; for we
here learn that we ought immediately to return to God when he invites us; for
faith is known by its promptitude. As soon then as God speaks, it behoves us to
be attentive, so that we may immediately follow him. But if God ceases not for a
whole year to warn and exhort us, while at the same time his doctrine is
despised, we become guilty of intolerable sin. Let us then remember that <i>days
</i>are here in a manner mentioned as well as <i>years, </i>that the Jews might
consider how many days are included in every year; and let us also know that
years are mentioned by Jeremiah, that they might, understand that they had no
excuse, inasmuch as God had for so long a time ceased not to promote their
welfare, while in the meantime they persisted in their impiety, and continued
obstinate to the last. This is the reason why the Prophet relates again when it
was that he began to discharge his prophetic office, even from the thirteenth
year of Josiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that it was their own fault that they
had not repented;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has Jehovah to me,
and I to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By saying that the word of God
was deposited with him, he no doubt intended to assert his authority against the
unbelievers, who clamored that he presumptuously pretended God&#8217;s name, and
that he had not been sent by God. For we have elsewhere seen that the Church was
then miserably torn, having intestine broils, and many were boasting that they
were prophets; and we shall hereafter find the same thing in other places. Thus,
then, Jeremiah was not received by the whole people, and his authority was
disputed. Since then he had to contend with many ungodly men, he here testifies
that he came not of himself, but that the prophetic office had been committed to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After having asserted the authority of his call, he
adds, that he had faithfully promoted the welfare of the whole people; for he
declares how faithful and diligent he had been when he says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoken
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rose up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for to rise up early means that
he had been assiduous in his work. The Prophet then shews that he had not been
tardy or idle, and that he had not spoken carelessly as many do, who seem to do
what God commands, but display no fervid zeal and no sedulity. The Prophet then,
after having declared that he had been sent from above, adds that he had
exercised fidelity and diligence, that he had strenuously served God and his
Church. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have spoken to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the Lord had spoken to
</i></font><font face="Palatino">me, &#8212; how?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have spoken, and ye heard
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He complains here that his work had
been useless, and at the same time shews that the whole fault was in the people.
He confirms the same thing in other words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah has sent to
</i></font><font face="Palatino">you
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all his servants the prophets,
rising. up early, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He enhances their
sin, &#8212; that they had not only rejected one Prophet but even many; for God
had not employed Jeremiah alone to teach them, but had joined others with him,
so that they were less excusable. We hence see that their sin is in this verse
exaggerated; for the Jews had not only despised God in the person of one man,
but had also rejected all his servants. He might, indeed, have simply said, that
God had sent his servants, but he adds the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order that their ingratitude might appear more evident. It was, indeed,
very wicked to neglect God&#8217;s servants; but as prophecy was an invaluable
treasure, and a singular pledge and symbol of God&#8217;s favor, it was a double
crime when they thus despised the prophets, whose very name ought to have been
held sacred by them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards applies to God what he had said of
himself, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is certain that God does not
rise up, as he sleeps not in the night; but the language is much more expressive
and forcible, when God himself is said to rise up early. And it, was not without
reason that the Prophet spoke so emphatically; for though the Jews were
sufficiently convicted of ingratitude for having disregarded God&#8217;s
servants, it was yet a monstrous impiety to shew no regard for God. But when the
unbelieving are proved guilty, they ever fix their eyes on men, &#8220;He! it is
with a mortal that I have to do; far be it from me ever to rise up against God;
but why is this so much blamed, since I do not immediately perish? since I am
not suddenly cast down at the nod of man? what! am I not free to inquire, and to
discuss, and to examine every part of what is said? why do the prophets so
imperiously treat us, that it is not lawful to doubt any of their words?&#8221;
Thus, then, did the ungodly speak. But God on the other hand answered them and
said, that he was despised, as also Christ said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who hears you
hears me,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and he who despises you
despises me.&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
10:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also the Prophet sets forth God himself as rising
up early, exhorting the people and manifesting every care for their wellbeing.
This, then, is the design of the metaphor, when he says, that God had sent to
them and rose up early; he rose up early while sending his
servants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as God fulminates against all despisers of his
doctrine, so from these words we may gather no small consolation; for we
certainly conclude that God watches over our safety whenever sound and faithful
teachers go forth: it is the same as though he himself descended from heaven,
rose up early, and was intent in securing our salvation. This we learn from the
very words of the Prophet, when he says, that God rose up early. But as this
testimony of God&#8217;s favor and paternal care towards us is delightful, so to
the same extent dreadful is the vengeance that awaits those who neglect this
favor, who sleep when God is watching, who hear not when he is speaking, who
continue in their sloth and torpor when God of his own accord meets them, and
kindly and gently invites them to himself.</font><br></div>

we in our turn respond to thee, and not only by our tongues, but also by our
works, pursue the course which thou hast appointed for us, until we shall reach
the goal, and enjoy that blessed state of glory which thou hast prepared for us

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINETY-FOURTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain God&#8217;s complaint
against the Jews, &#8212; that he had found them wholly refractory and
rebellious. He says, in one word, that they did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not hear
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but he afterwards adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did not incline their ear to hear
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which mode of speaking, is set
forth more fully their perverseness, as they closed their ears as it were
designedly; for not to incline the ear is more than not to hear. Jeremiah then
means, that they had so hardened themselves against all that was taught by the
prophets, that they designedly rejected everything that was set before them by
God&#8217;s authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards explains what God required them to do,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turn ye, I pray, every one from
his evil way and from the wickedness of your doings, and dwell in the land which
Jehovah has given to you and your fathers from age even to
age</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What God required was doubtless
most just; for he demanded nothing from the Jews but to repent. There was also a
promise added; God not only exhorted them to repent, but wished also to be
reconciled to them, and having blotted out all memory of their sins, to shew
them kindness: had they not been harder than stones, they must have been turned
to his service by so kind a treatment. God might have indeed sharply reproved
them, he might have threatened them, he might, in short, have cut off every hope
of pardon; but he only required them to repent, and at the same time added a
promise of free forgiveness. As then they had despised so great a favor, it
follows that they must have been men of reprobate minds and of irreclaimable
habits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When they were bidden to repent of their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil way and of the wickedness of
their doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it was done for sake of
amplifying; for the Prophet wished to take away from them every pretense for
evasion, lest they should ask what was the wickedness or what was the evil way.
He then intimates that they were fully proved guilty; and for this purpose he
made the repetition. By <i>way </i>is designated a continued course of life; but
as they had fully shewed themselves perverse in many ways, he refers to their
fruits, as though he had said, that they in vain contended with God, by
inquiring what had been their evil way, for their whole life sufficiently
testified that they were wholly given to wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now there is a striking alliteration in the verbs
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb&ccedil;w</font><font face="Palatino">:
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shebu, </i>means sometimes to rebel, it means to return to the right way, and
it means to rest or dwell in. He uses the same verb, though the sense is
different when he says, &#8220;Return ye,&#8221; and &#8220;ye shall
dwell.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE124</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also emphatically uses the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ya</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
aish </i>&#8220;every<i> </i>one:&#8221; it means properly &#8220;man;&#8221;
but it is taken in Hebrew for every one or each one, &#8220;each one from his
evil way.&#8221; The Prophet exempted none, lest they thought that their fault
was extenuated, had not the evil been universal. He hence says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was given to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>as though he had said, that impiety not only prevailed among the whole
people, as the case commonly is, but that every one had become corrupt, so that
there was not one sound or upright among the whole people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what ought to be observed; for we are
wont, in a cold manner, to confess our sins, and to pray to God when we are
proved guilty, except when each one is touched with the sense of his own guilt,
and owns himself to be justly exposed to God&#8217;s judgment; for while every
one mingles with the multitude, it so happens that no one acknowledges the
heinousness of his own sins. Therefore, for true and sincere repentance this
peculiar examination is necessary, so that every one may repent and not regard
his friends.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dwell ye in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>though it be the imperative mood,
yet it is a promise, by which God declared that he was ready to receive the Jews
into favor, provided they returned from the heart to him: he proposed to them,
as a symbol of his paternal layout, the possession of the land; for that land
was as it were the pledge of their adoption; and the Jews, while they dwelt
there, might have felt assured that God was their Father. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From age even to
age</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, &#8220;I am
prepared to do you good not only for one day, or for a short time, but also to
shew you kindness from age to age. It will then be your fault if ye be not
happy, and if this happiness will not pass on from you to your children and
grandchildren.&#8221; But the more delightful the invitation was, the more

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet mentions here one kind of sin; for though
the Jews in many, and even in numberless ways kindled God&#8217;s wrath, yet
they especially procured a heavy judgment for themselves by their superstitions.
They indeed manifested their contempt of God by adultery, theft, and plunder,
but in a way not so direct; for when they abandoned themselves to the
superstitions of the Gentiles, they thus shook off the yoke of God, as though
they openly testified that he was no longer their God. And we know that nothing
is so much valued and approved by God as a sincere attention to real piety;
hence the Church is taught in the first table of the Law how he is to be
worshipped. This is the reason why the Prophet especially reminds the Jews here
that they had, in this respect, been rebellious against God, because he could
not bring them back from their corrupt superstitions. He does not at the same
time absolve them of other sins; but he mentions this one kind, in order that
they might understand, that they were not only in part, but altogether
rebellious against God; for they wholly departed from him when they vitiated his
worship with wicked superstitions. We must then bear in mind, that the Jews were
not condemned for some small offenses, but accused of the most heinous of sins;
for they had become covenant-breakers and apostates, and had forsaken God
himself and his law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Walk ye not after foreign gods to
serve them and to worship them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
pointed out as by the finger, how gross had been their impiety; for they had
given themselves up to idols, that they might basely serve them; they had wholly
devoted themselves to them. It was not then an excusable error, but a manifest
treachery. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Provoke me
not by the work of your hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No doubt
the Prophet meant by these words to confirm what has been already stated, that
idolatry is before God an intolerable wickedness: and at the same time he shews,
that they had not sinned through ignorance, for they had in time been reminded
of the atrocity of this sin. As then they had not ceased from their
superstitions, they were thus proved guilty of a diabolical madness, for they
feared not to provoke God against them. And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the work of your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and thus he speaks contemptuously
or rather reproachfully of idols. They called them gods, not that they were
ignorant that they were statues curiously made of wood and stone, or of some
other material; but still they thought that divinity was connected with them,
for they believed that God was thus rightly worshipped. Now, then, the Prophet
calls them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the work of
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;If<i> </i>the Jews themselves are nothing, the idols are less than
nothing; for they are only the work of hands.&#8221; And this way of speaking
often occurs in the Prophets, by which God intended to shake off the stupidity
of men, who were become quite senseless in their own devices; as though he had
said, &#8220;Have<i> </i>you not a particle of a right understanding in you? do
you not know, that this which ye worship is the work of your own hands? and what
can your hands do? for what are ye yourselves?&#8221; We now perceive what the
Prophet had in view in using these words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, again; a promise given,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not do you
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God declares by these words that
they would be exempt from all trouble and distress, if they continued to walk
according to the rule of true religion; and thus he intimates that whatever
evils they had already endured, and would have hereafter to endure, could not be
imputed to anything but to their own perverseness, for God had of his own
free-will promised to spare them, provided they departed from their wicked ways.
And such a hope ought especially to encourage us to repent, for we see that God
is ready to receive us and seeks reconciliation with us, and is always prepared
to forgive all our sins, provided we from the heart return to him; and he seems
as one unwilling to inflict punishment. Here again the impiety of the people is
more fully proved, for they refused to receive from God this invaluable favor.

<div><font face="Palatino">He proves what he had said before, that the Jews had
been wholly disobedient, though God had kindly offered and shewed that he would
be reconciled to them, provided they turned from the heart to him. The fact that
this message was not received by the Jews, was an evidence of extreme and
irreclaimable obstinacy. And he enhances their guilt by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye might provoke
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he intimates that they were led
away to evil by a voluntary purpose, as though they wished to provoke God. The
Prophet, then, by saying </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye
might provoke me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>accuses them of
deliberate wickedness. It, indeed, often happens that men go astray through
ignorance, and do not attend because no one warns them; but since God had so
many times exhorted the Jews to repent, no other opinion could have been formed
of them, but that they designedly wished, not only to despise God, but also to
provoke him to the contest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what we ought carefully to notice, for
whosoever has been taught the will of God, unless he obeys, he cannot escape the
charge of a voluntary obstinacy, as he has resolved, as it were, to carry on war
with God. Though the ungodly do not confess this, yet the fact is evident; and
God, who is a righteous judge, has declared that they who despised the prophetic
doctrine were so regarded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for evil to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that they might know that
God did not plead his own cause because he stood in need of their service, but
that he cared for their welfare. For there is to be understood here an implied
contrast, as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;What loss has God suffered by
your perverseness? Ye have, indeed, tried to deprive him of his glory, for ye
have adorned your idols by spoils taken from him; but it is not in men&#8217;s
power to subtract anything from the rights of God; he remains ever perfect: then
it only turns out to your ruin when ye are rebellious. When, therefore, God now
reproves you, he does not maintain his own right, as though he received any gain
or loss from you; but it is an evidence of his mercy, because he would not have
you to perish, though he sees that you are led into destruction by an insane
impulse.&#8221; It afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here follows a denunciation of punishment; the
Prophet says that God would no longer deal in words, for their iniquity had
ripened, according to what is in Genesis,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My Spirit shall
not contend (or strive) any more with man.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
6:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When God prepares to execute vengeance on the
wickedness of men, he says that there is no more time for contending. A sudden
execution of judgment is then what is here intended; but he mentions at the same
time the punishment. After having explained the cause of so much severity, even
because they would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not hear the
words of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will send for and take
all the families of the north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. I
have no doubt but that the Prophet alludes to the edicts of kings, for when they
wish to raise an army they publish their edicts, and order those everywhere to
meet who have either given their names or been enlisted as soldiers. So God now
by these words intimates that the Chaldeans were under his power, so that they
were ready, as soon as he gave them a signal; according to other modes of
speaking he uses in other places, but in the same sense, &#8220;I<i> </i>will
hiss,&#8221; and also, &#8220;I will send an alarm.&#8221; The Scripture is full
of expressions of this kind, which shew that all mortals are prepared to obey
God whenever he intends to employ their services; not that it is their purpose
to serve God, but that he by a secret influence so rules them and their tongues,
their minds and hearts, their hands and their feet, that they are constrained,
willing or unwilling, to do his will and pleasure. And in the same sense he
calls Nebuchadnezzar his <i>servant, </i>for that cruel tyrant never meant to
offer his service to God; but God employed him as his instrument, as though he
had been hired by him. And we shall see also elsewhere that he is called
God&#8217;s servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it ought to be noticed, for we hence learn the
fact, that many are God&#8217;s servants who are yet wholly unworthy of so
honorable a title; but they are not so called with respect to themselves.
Nebuchadnezzar thought that he was making war with the God of Israel when he
invaded Judea; and only ambition, and avarice, and cruelty impelled him to
undertake so many wars. When, therefore, we think of him, of his designs and his
projects, we cannot say that he was God&#8217;s servant; but this is to be
referred to God only, who governs by his hidden and incomprehensible power both
the devil and the ungodly, so that they execute, though unwittingly, whatever he
determines. There is a great difference between these and God&#8217;s servants,
who, when anything is commanded them, seek to render that obedience which they
ought &#8212; all such are faithful servants. They are, then, justly called
God&#8217;s servants, for there is a mutual concord between God and them: God
commands, and they obey. But it is a mutilated and a half service when the
ungodly are led beyond the purpose of their own minds, and God uses them as
instruments when they think of and design another thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must at the same time be noticed that this name of
servant is given, though in an inferior sense, to Nebuchadnezzar for the sake of
honor, in order that the Jews might be made ashamed; for it was a great reproach
to them that a heathen had been chosen by God, and had obtained the title of a
servant, when they themselves had become aliens. The Prophet then, no doubt,
intended to cast reproach on them by raising to this dignity the king of
Babylon. There was also another reason, even that the Jews might know that
whatever they were to suffer would be inflicted by God&#8217;s hand, and that
they might not otherwise think of Nebuchadnezzar than as God&#8217;s scourge, in
order that they might thus be led to confess their sins and be really humbled.
We now perceive the meaning of the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>afterwards, I will bring them on
this land and on all its inhabitants, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>By these words he confirms what I have just referred to, that God had his
vengeance ready as soon as he purposed to treat the Jews as they deserved. As he
had then said that Nebuchadnezzar and all the people of the north were prepared
by him as hired soldiers, so he now adds that victory was in his power &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will bring
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>over the land
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and over all the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neighboring nations which are
around</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE125</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Why the Prophet denounces
punishment here on other nations we shall see elsewhere. The Jews, in addition
to other vain confidences, were wont to flatter themselves with this, that if
Nebuchadnezzar should invade the territories of others, all would unite together
against him, and that by such a confederacy they could easily overcome him. As,
then, the Jews looked to all parts, and knew that the Egyptians were in alliance
with them, and were also persuaded that the Moabites, the Tyrians, the Syrians,
and all the rest would become confederates, they became confident, and indulged
in that security by which they deceived themselves. This, therefore, is the
reason why the Prophet expressly threatens the nations by which they were
surrounded, not for the sake of these nations, but that the Jews might cease to
entertain their vain confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God says that he would make all nations, as well as
the Jews, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an astonishment, a
hissing, and perpetual desolations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
intimates that it would be a dreadful calamity, such as would astonish all that
heard of it. As it is said elsewhere, &#8220;The report alone will excite
alarm;&#8221; so in this place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will make them for an astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When
a moderate calamity is related to us, we are indeed moved to pity; but when the
greatness of the evil exceeds belief, we then stand amazed, and all our senses
are stunned. The Prophet then means that the calamity which God would bring on
the Jews would be, as it were, monstrous, such as would stupify all that would
hear of it.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE126</font></sup><br></div>

mitigate the severity of these words; for he confines God&#8217;s vengeance to
seventy years. But this mode of speaking is common in Scripture; for,

through a course of years, which shall last perpetually. But age, or

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now, as I have said, shews more clearly
why the time of the captivity and exile had been defined, even that the faithful
might know that God would not forget his covenant, though he deprived the people
of the inheritance of the land. These words were not addressed indiscriminately
to the whole body of the people, as we have observed before in other places; but
the Prophet intended to consult the benefit of God&#8217;s elect, who always
retained a concern for true religion; for they must have a hundred times
despaired had not this promise been added. This, then, was a special doctrine
intended as food for God&#8217;s children; for he addressed, as it was apart,
the <i>elect </i>and faithful only.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God says also, that at the end of seventy years he
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>visit the iniquity of the
king of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and of his whole
people. We hence learn that Nebuchadnezzar was not called God&#8217;s servant
because he deserved anything for his service, but because God led him while he
was himself unconscious, or not thinking of any such thing, to do a service
which neither he nor his subjects understood to be for God. Though, then, the
Lord employs the ungodly in executing his judgments, yet their guilt is not on
this account lessened; they<i> </i>are still exposed to God&#8217;s judgment.
And these two things well agree together, &#8212; that the devil and all the
ungodly serve God, though not of their own accord, but whenever he draws them by
his hidden power, and that they are still justly punished, even when they have
served God; for though they perform his work, yet not because they are commanded
to do so. They are therefore justly liable to punishment, according to what the
Prophet teaches us here.</font><br></div>

return to the right way, and seek to be reconciled to thee, and never doubt but
that thou wilt be merciful and gracious to us, whenever we solicit pardon in the
name of thy only-begotten Son; and may we also be so reconciled to thee, that we
may know that thou art indeed with us as our Father, by ruling us by thy Spirit,

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINETY-FIFTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We explained in the last Lecture the verse in which
God declared that he would punish the king of Babylon and his people for their
cruelty towards the Israelites. We said that this was addressed peculiarly to
the elect, for many of the people perished without the hope of salvation. But
God intended in the meantime to shew his care for the remnant; and for this
reason he defined the time of exile, and predicted that he would be an enemy to
the Babylonians, for he would undertake the cause of his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One thing I did not explain, that is, what the
Prophet says of eternal reproaches. Now, it seems that this was not fulfilled;
for though after seventy years Babylon was taken and was reduced to a state of
subjection, yet the city itself remained safe, and for many ages was celebrated
for its great splendor. The Prophet, then, seems to have exceeded the limits of
truth in speaking of these desolations; for such did not take place when the
city was taken by the Medes and Persians. But, as we have said elsewhere, we
ought not to restrict to one time what is said in many places by the prophets
respecting the destruction of Babylon; for it pleased God, in various ways and
at different times, to execute his vengeance on that people; and it appears
evident from history that it would have been better for the Babylonians to have
perished at once than to have undergone so many calamities. For in a short time
after the people revolted from the Persians, the city was recovered<i> </i>by
the contrivance and craft of Zopyrus; the nobles were then reduced<i> </i>into
slavery, so that no dignity remained. It was afterwards taken by Alexander; and
after that Seleucus obtained possession of it. On its ruins were then built the
city Ctesiphon, and at length it gradually decayed.<i> </i>But no change
occurred without a great diminution of the city&#8217;s opulence; and nothing
more disgraceful could have happened to it than for those who were in authority
to be taken and hung on gibbets, as Zenophon and other historians
relate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see how this passage, and others like
it, are to be understood; for God does not speak only of one time of vengeance,
but he includes all those judgments by which he vindicated the wrongs done to
his people. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he had said before when he says,
that he would <i>bring </i>all his <i>words </i>on the Chaldeans; that is, that
he would give effect to all the prophecies, so that it would be evident that
Jeremiah had foretold nothing rashly, and that God had not in vain threatened
them by the mouth of his servant. Such is the meaning, and hence we see what the
Prophet intimates when he says, that God would bring all his words, for he had
then spoken. But as the ungodly regard whatever is brought forward in
God&#8217;s name as a matter of sport and mockery, and boldly deride all
threatenings, to <i>bring words </i>means the same thing with proving by events
that God does not terrify men without accomplishing his words; in short, to
bring words is to prove their authority. And, as I have said, the expression has
a reference to the insensibility of men who give no credit to God&#8217;s words
until they are convinced by their accomplishment; for they think that the air
only is beaten, and thus they are not touched by any fear. But God proves the
power of his word when he executes what he has predicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that the Prophet intends nothing else in
this verse than to confirm what he had said before. And he speaks of Chaldea and
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon that
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we must at the same time notice another form of
speaking; for God says, that he had pronounced these
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>he afterwards says, that Jeremiah was his minister, and as it were his
herald; and he calls him also a scribe or a writer. God then here declares that
he was the author of all that Jeremiah had brought forward; and yet he leaves
his own office to his minister, for it is necessary to secure authority to the
prophets; otherwise, except God visibly descended from heaven, men would either
indiscriminately admit what might be said, and without judgment receive
falsehood and truth, or they would become wholly hardened, so as to give no
credit to prophetic instruction. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whatsoever is written in this
book</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet no doubt wrote down a
summary of what he had delivered; for as we have said elsewhere, it was usual
with the prophets, after they had spoken at large to the people and preached
diffusely, to affix a short summary to the doors of the Temple. This volume then
is what Jeremiah calls the book, which was composed from his public addresses.
It might in common language be called a summary. Then he adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">The beginning of the verse is obscure. When the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">db[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>obed, </i>is followed by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth, </i>they think that it is to be taken actively, and rendered, to force
or drive to bondage. It means properly, to serve; but they think that found as
here it is a transitive verb. Some render it, &#8220;they employed them;&#8221;
but this is frigid and ambiguous; for friends may be said to employ one another,
when the work is mutual; hence the meaning is not sufficiently expressed. But
the meaning may be given by a paraphrase, that they &#8220;forced them into
bondage.&#8221; Still the meaning of the Prophet is not yet sufficiently clear;
for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wdb[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>obedu, </i>may be taken either in the past or future tense. It is, indeed, in
the past tense; but the past may be taken for the future: thus the meaning may
be different. If it be taken in the past tense, then it cannot be applied except
to the Babylonians; for they were those who had treated the Israelites as
slaves, or had forced them into bondage; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bem, </i>&#8220;them,&#8221;<i> </i>might be understood of the Israelites;
for we know that pronouns are often thus used, when the Church, or God&#8217;s
elect people, is the subject. Then the Prophet&#8217;s words may be thus
rendered, &#8220;for they have tyrannically ruled over them,&#8221; even the
Israelites, &#8220;and they themselves,&#8221; that is, the Israelites, shall in
their turn rule, the latter words being understood. But the meaning, as it seems
to me, would be more simple, were we to read the whole together in this way,
&#8220;For they also themselves shall rule over them, even over strong and
valiant nations and great kings, and I will recompense them,&#8221;
etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason which has constrained me to give this
interpretation is this: It is said in the last verse that Jeremiah prophesied
against all nations; then follows an explanation, and the Prophet briefly shews,
or reminds us, what would be the issue of these prophecies, even that they also
would themselves rule over these nations. Then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bem, </i>as I think, refers to the Babylonians and other heathen nations; and
it is a common thing with the prophets, when they speak of the restoration of
the ancient Church, and of Christ&#8217;s coming, to promise power to
God&#8217;s children to hold the whole world under their feet. The sentence also
will flow better, when we give this version, &#8220;They shall rule.&#8221;
There is, indeed, a change as to time, but this is a common thing in Hebrew. It
is then; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they shall rule over
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the nations. Jeremiah had
spoken of all heathen nations; mention had been made of all that he had
prophesied against all nations; and he says now what seemed incredible, and
hence the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam,</i> is introduced, &#8220;even these very Israelites,&#8221; as though
he had said, &#8220;Though<i> </i>this shall happen beyond hope, so as to appear
strange and fabulous, yet God by the issue will shew that he has not in vain
communicated this to me; for they, even the Israelites, shall have their turn to
exercise dominion; and they shall constrain all nations to obey them.&#8221; And
what follows confirms my view; for he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>over strong
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr
&#181;ywg</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> guim rebim, </i>(for the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth, </i>may be repeated here;) or we may render the words &#8220;many<i>
</i>nations;&#8221; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rebim, </i>means both; but as it follows &#8220;and<i> </i>great
kings,&#8221; I am disposed to render the words, &#8220;strong<i>
</i>nations.&#8221; Then he says, &#8220;For they shall rule over strong nations
and great kings.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE130</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will recompense
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, both kings and nations,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to their doing, and
according to the work of their hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because they had exercised every kind of cruelty towards the miserable
Israelites. Hence the Prophet pursues the same subject, &#8212; that God would
at length really shew, that though he had been angry with his Church, yet all
hope of mercy was not lost, for he was mindful of his covenant. He thus
mitigates the severity of what he had previously said; he promises them
something far better than what the wretched Jews could have expected in their
extreme calamities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may again learn from the words of the Prophet,
that God so employed Nebuchadnezzar and others, that they performed no service
deserving of praise; for had they been without fault, God must doubtless have
unjustly punished them. This passage then teaches us, that though the devil and
the reprobate execute God&#8217;s judgments, they yet deserve no praise for
their obedience, for they have no such purpose in view. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now explains more at large what might on
account of its brevity have appeared obscure. He had spoken of all nations, but
his discourse was abrupt; for he had not yet openly told us that he had been
sent by God as a herald to summon all kings and nations before his tribunal, and
to declare what was to be. As, then, the Prophet had referred to nothing of this
kind, his discourse was ambiguous. But he now declares that a cup from
God&#8217;s hand had been delivered to him, which he was to give to all nations
to drink. We hence see that there is here nothing new, but that the Prophet is,
as it were, the interpreter of his previous prophecy, which was briefly
stated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, that what he said might have more weight,
he relates a vision, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus said
Jehovah the God of Israel unto me, Take the cup of the wine of this fury from my
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have said in other places
that the fulfillment of prophetic truth was not without reason dwelt upon, and
that the servants of God were so armed, as though the execution of all that they
alleged was ready at hand. They were said to demolish cities and to overthrow
kingdoms even for this reason, because such was the torpidity of men, that they
gave no credit to God, except they were brought to see the event as it were
before their eyes. But as this subject has been handled more fully elsewhere, I
shall only touch upon it here. He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a cup had been delivered
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to him by God&#8217;s hand; by which words he
intimates, that he did not come forth of his own will to terrify the Jews and
other nations, but that he faithfully proclaimed what had been committed to him;
and he also intimates, that God spoke nothing now but what he meant shortly to
execute; and this is what is to be understood by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cup.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cup of the wine of
fury</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or of wrath. This metaphor often
occurs in the prophets, but in a different sense. For God is said sometimes to
inebriate men when he stupifies them, and drives them at one time to madness,
and at another time deprives them of common sense and understanding, so that
they become like beasts; but he is said also to inebriate them, when, by outward
calamities, he fills them with astonishment. So now the Prophet calls calamity
the cup of wrath, even that calamity, which like fire was to inflame the minds
of all those who received no benefit from chastisements. Madness, indeed, means
no other thing than the despair of those who perceive God&#8217;s hand stretched
out against them, and thus rage and clamor, and curse heaven and earth,
themselves and God. This is what we are to understand by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He compares this wrath to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because they who are thus smitten by God&#8217;s hand are carried away as it
were beyond themselves, and repent not, nor think of their sins with calmness of
mind, but abandon themselves to a furious rage. We now then understand why the
Prophet says, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cup of the
wine of wrath </i></font><font face="Palatino">had been given to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,

lately referred to, that his office was farther extended than to teach in the
middle of the Church, but that he had also been chosen to proclaim as a herald
God&#8217;s judgments on all nations. He was, indeed, sent to the Jews otherwise
than to heathen nations, for he was set over them as a teacher, and that for
their salvation, provided they<i> </i>were not irreclaimable; but he was sent to
the heathens expressly to threaten them with what was nigh at hand. He was,
however, sent both to the Jews and to all other nations, as he will hereafter

performed his commands; and thirdly, he intimates that he was not only appointed

on all nations, for we call those threatenings childish which are not
accomplished. But the Prophet here declares that however obstinately the Jews
and others might resist, they could not possibly escape God&#8217;s vengeance,
as he was the judge of all. Hence the Prophet is bidden to take a cup and to
give it to others. But the Jews might have still objected and said, &#8220;We
may, indeed, take the cup from thine hand, but what if we refuse? what if we
cast away from us what thou givest us to drink?&#8221; Hence the Prophet says
that, willing or unwilling, they were to take the cup, that they might drink and
exhaust whatever was destined for them by God&#8217;s judgment; he therefore
says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may

and to flee to his mercy; but when we make a clamor and are driven almost to
madness, we then shew that an extreme rigor is felt, and that there is no hope
of pardon. The Prophet, then, intended to express, that so atrocious would be
the calamities of the nations with whom God was angry, that they would become
stupified and almost insane; and at the same time frantic, for despair would lay
hold on their minds and hearts, that they would not be able to entertain any
hope of deliverance, or to submit to God, but that they would, as it is usual
with the reprobate, rise up against God and vomit forth their
blasphemies.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He begins with Jerusalem, as it is said elsewhere
that judgment would begin at God&#8217;s house.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:17.) And there is nothing opposed to this in the context of the passage;
for though he had promised to the children of God a happy end to the evils which
they were shortly to endure, he nevertheless enumerates here all the nations on
whom God had bidden him to denounce judgments. In this catalogue the Church
obtains the first place; for though God be the judge of the whole world, he yet
justly begins with his own Church, and that especially for two reasons &#8212;
for as the father of a family watches over his children and servants, and if
there be anything wrong, his solicitude is particularly manifested; so God, as
he dwells in his Church, cannot do otherwise than chastise it for its faults;
&#8212; and then, we know that they are less excusable, who, having been taught
the will of God, do yet go on indulging their own lusts,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421247&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
12:47; ) for they cannot plead ignorance. Hence is fulfilled what Christ
declares, that those servants shall be more grievously beaten, who, knowing
their masters will, yet obstinately disregard it. There is, then, a twofold
fault in the members of the Church; and no comparison can be made between them
and the unbelieving who are in thick darkness. Since God shines in his Church
and shews the way, as Moses says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Behold<i> </i>I set before you
the way of life and of death; I therefore call heaven and earth to witness that
there is no excuse for you.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:15, 19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is the second reason why God first visits
the sins of the faithful, or of those who are counted faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also what appertains to an example: God
chastises his own children lest he should seem by his indulgence to favor or
countenance what is wicked and sinful. But this third reason is in a manner
accidental; and therefore I wished to state it apart from the two other reasons.
When, therefore, God so severely treats his own Church, the unbelieving ought to
draw this conclusion, that if this be done in the green tree, what shall be done
in the dry?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422331&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:31.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the two things which I have before mentioned
ought to be deemed by us as sufficient reasons why God, while suspending his
vengeance as to the reprobate, punishes the elect as well as all those who
profess themselves to be members of his Church. We now understand why Jeremiah
mentions first the holy city, and then all the cities of Judah, the kings also
and the princes; for God had with open bosom invited them to himself, but they
had, as it were, from determined wickedness, provoked his wrath by despising
both his Law and his Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to make them a
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or a solitude. This was a
grievous denunciation, no doubt, and we shall hereafter see that most became
enraged against the holy man, and in their fury endeavored to destroy him; yet
he with all intrepid mind fully declared what God had commanded him. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an
astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and in the third place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an
hissing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even that they would become
detestable to all; for hissing intimates contempt, reproach, and detestation. In
the fourth place he mentions <i>a curse. </i>We have already said what the
Prophet meant by this word, even that the Jews would become in this respect a
proverb, so that when one cursed another, he would use this form, &#8220;May God
destroy thee as he destroyed the Jews.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as at this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet refers, no doubt, to
the time of the city&#8217;s destruction. God had indeed even then begun to
consume the people; but we shall hereafter see that the minds of the greater
part were still very haughty: so that they often raised their crests and looked
for a new state of things, and depended on aid from the Egyptians. But the
Prophet here mentions what was not yet completed, and as it were by the finger,
points out the day as having already come in which the city was to be destroyed
and the temple burnt up. This, then, refers to the certainty of what he
predicted. Some think that it was written after Jeremiah had been led into
exile; but this conjecture has nothing to support
it.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
seems to me enough to suppose that his object was to rouse the Jews from their
security, and to shew that in a short time all that he predicted would be
accomplished, and that they were no more to doubt of this than if the calamity
was now before their eyes. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It may here be asked, why he connects Pharaoh with
the Jews, and assigns the second place to the Egyptians rather than to other
nations? The reason is evident, &#8212; because the Jews expected deliverance
from them; and the cause of their irreclaimable obstinacy was, that they could
not be removed from that false confidence by which the devil had once<b>
</b>fascinated them. They departed from God by making the Egyptians their
friends; and when they found themselves unequal to the Assyrians, they turned
their hopes to the Egyptians rather than to God; the prophets remonstrated with
them, but with no success.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the occasion of ruin to the chosen people
was Egypt, and as Pharaoh was, as it were, the fountain and cause of destruction
to Jerusalem, as well as to the whole people, rightly does the Prophet, after
having spoken of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, immediately mention Pharaoh
in the second place; for he was a friend to the Jews, and they were so connected
together that they were necessarily drawn together into destruction; for they
had corrupted one another, and encouraged one another in impiety, and with
united minds and confederate hearts kindled God&#8217;s wrath against
themselves.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah, after having spoken of his own nation and
of the Egyptians, now mentions other nations who were probably known by report
to the Jews; for we see in the catalogue some who were afar off. He then does
not only speak of neighboring nations, but also of others. His object, in short,
was to shew that God&#8217;s vengeance was near, which would extend here and
there, so as to include the whole world known to the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We stated yesterday the reason why he connected the
Egyptians with the Jews; but now nothing certain can be assigned as a reason
with regard to each of these nations; only it may be said in general, that the
Jews were thus reminded, not only to acknowledge God&#8217;s judgment towards
them as an evidence of his wrath, but also to extend their thoughts farther and
to consider all the calamities, which would happen to nations far as well as
nigh, in the same light, so that they might know that human events revolve, not
by chance, but that God is a righteous judge, and that he sits in heaven to
chastise men for their sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a common proverb, that it is a solace to the
miserable to see many like them; but the Prophet had something very different in
view; for it was not his object to alleviate the grief of his people by shewing
that no nations would be free from calamities; but his intention was to shew
them in due time that whatever happened would proceed from God; for if it had
not been predicted that the Chaldeans would have the whole of the east under
their dominion, it would have been commonly said, that the world was under the
rule of blind fortune, and thus men would have become more and more hardened in
their impiety; for it becomes the cause of obstinacy, when men imagine that all
things happen by chance. And for this reason God severely reproves those who
acknowledge not that he sends wars, famine, and pestilence, and that nothing
adverse takes place except through his judgment. Hence the Jews were to learn
before the time, that when God afflicted them and other nations, they might know
that it had been predicted, and that therefore God was the author of these
calamities, and that they might also examine themselves so as to acknowledge
their sins; for they who dream that the world as to its evils is governed at
random by fortune, do not perceive that God is displeased with them; and so they
regard not what they suffer as a just punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many indeed confess God as the inflicter of
punishment, and yet they complain against him. But these two things ought to be
remembered, &#8212; that no adversity happens fortuitously, but that God is the
author of all those things which men regard as evils, &#8212; and that he is so,
because he is a righteous judge; which is the second thing. God then in claiming
for himself the disposal of all events, and in declaring that the world is
governed at his will, not only declares that the chief power and the supreme
government is in his hand, but goes farther and shews, that things happening
prosperously are evidences of his goodness and justice, and that calamities
prove that he cannot endure the sins of men, but must punish them. To set forth
this was the Prophet&#8217;s design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that God threatened
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the promiscuous

fE136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">br[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021238&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:38.) Nehemiah also says that he separated such mixtures from the people of
God, lest they who had become degenerated, should corrupt true religion.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;161303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Nehemiah

took away
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">br[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
oreb, </i>or this mixture. Now as to this passage, I have no doubt but that the
Prophet speaks thus generally of the common people; and I extend this name to
all the kingdoms, of which he will hereafter speak. He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the kings of the land of
Uz.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know that this was an eastern
land. I know not why Jerome rendered it &#8220;Ausitis,&#8221; and not as in the
Book of Job, for the same word is found there,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
1:2) and we find that Job was born in the eastern part of the world, for he was
plundered by his neighbors, who were men of the east. Some think that it was
Armenia; but it could hardly be a country so far off, for Cilicia was, with
regard to Judea, in the middle between them. I, then, rather think that Uz was
directly east to Judea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the kings of the land of
the Philistines</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whether Palestine had
then many kings is uncertain; it seems indeed probable; but what seems doubtful
to me, I leave as such. It is no objection that he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>since he afterwards speaks of all
the kings of Tyre and Sidon, though neither Tyre nor Sidon had many kings; for
they were only two cities. There is then no doubt, but that the Prophet in
speaking of all the kings of the land, meant that though they succeeded one
another, it was yet decreed in heaven, that all these nations should perish. He
therefore intended to obviate every doubt; for the prophecy was not immediately
fulfilled; but the nations, of whom he now speaks, retained for a time their
state, so that the Prophet might have appeared false in his predictions. Hence
he distinctly mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that the faithful might
suspend their judgment until the appointed time of God&#8217;s vengeance
came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ashkelon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>which was not a maritime city, though not far from the sea. Then he adds
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hz[</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
oze, </i>which we call
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gaza</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

writers have thought, that it was called Gaza, because Cyrus deposited there his
treasures while carrying on war here and there, is wholly absurd; and it was a
frivolous conjecture which occurred to their minds, because Gaza means a
treasure, and the Greek translators rendered Oze, Gaza; but it was entertained
without much thought. The situation of the city is well known. He then mentions
<i>Ekron, </i>a neighboring city, not far from <i>Azotus, </i>which is also
named. The Prophet says <i>Ashdod, </i>which the Greeks have rendered Azotus,
and the Latins have followed them. We hence see that the Prophet refers to that
part of the country which was towards Syria.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, why he names the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remnant of Ashdod?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some think that he refers to neighboring towns,
not so much known, as Gath, which is elsewhere named, but less celebrated<i>.

not wholly forsaken. For

summoned to God&#8217;s tribunal; for why does the Prophet mention all the kings
of Tyre and all the kings of Sidon? Was it possible for these two cities to have
four or two kings at the same time? But we must bear in mind what I have already
stated, &#8212; that the children of God were warned, lest they should entertain
a too fervid expectation as to the fulfillment of this prophecy. It is then the
same as if he had said, &#8220;Though God&#8217;s vengeance may not come upon
the present king of Tyre or of Sidon, it is yet suspended over all kings, and
shall be manifested in its time.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

presents to it every<i> </i>year, in order to shew that they were its
descendants. And Tyre itself was a colony of Sidon, according to historians; but
it so prospered, that the daughter as it were swallowed up the mother. But it
appears evident that there were kings there in the time of Isaiah and Jeremiah,
though in the time of Alexander both cities were republics; for many changes
during that period had taken place in them. Now the Prophet says only, that Tyre
and Sidon would be involved in the punishment which he denounced on both kings
and people. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet speaks now of the kings of the north who
bordered on the king of Babylon; for as to Judea, Babylon was northward. He
calls all those who were towards Chaldea the kings of the north. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether near or remote, every one
shall be against his brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and, in
short, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the kingdoms of the
earth on the face of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is
no doubt, as we shall see, but that the Prophet put in the last place the
Chaldeans and their king. It is hence probable that what he here predicts was to
be <i>accomplished </i>by the hand and power of the king of Babylon, who
executed God&#8217;s vengeance on all these nations. God, then, chose for
himself the king of Chaldea as a scourge, and guided him by his hand in
punishing all the lands mentioned here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have already reminded you that this was not
predicted for the sake of the Jews, that they might derive any alleviation to
their grief from the circumstance of having associates, because the condition of
others was nothing better; but that God&#8217;s design was another, that is,
that in so great a confusion of all things, when heaven and earth, as they say,
were blended together, they might know that nothing happens through the blind
will of fortune. For God had already testified by the mouth of his servant what
he would do, and from this prophecy it was easy to conclude that all these
changes and violent commotions were the effects of God&#8217;s
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, after having shewn that the most
grievous calamities were nigh all the nations who were neighbors to the Jews,
and whose fame had reached them, says, in the last place, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king of Sheshach would drink
after them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hitherto the Prophet seems
to have exempted the king of Babylon from all trouble and danger; for he has
mentioned all the nations, and has spoken not only of those who were nigh the
Jews, but also of the Persians, the Medes, and others. What, then, could have
been the design of all this, if the king of Babylon had been passed by? It might
have been asked, how can it be right and consistent that this tyrant should
escape punishment, though he was of all the most cruel and the most wicked?
Hence the Prophet now says, that the king of Babylon, how much soever his
violence prevailed among all nations, and raged unpunished, would yet in his
time be brought to a reckoning. The meaning then is, that God would defer the
punishment of the Chaldeans until he employed them in destroying all the nations
of which Jeremiah has hitherto spoken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Respecting the king of Babylon being called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king of
Sheshach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>a question has been raised,
and some think that some unknown king is intended; for we know that the word is
a proper name, as it appears from some passages of Scripture.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111140&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 11:40;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;141202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 12:2.) But this opinion is not well founded; for the Prophet no doubt
speaks here of some remarkable king; and there is also no doubt but that he
reminded them of some most important event, so that there was no reason why
delay should depress the minds of the faithful, though they saw that this
Sheshach was not immediately punished with the rest. Others conjecture that
Sheshach was a renowned city in Chaldea. But there is no necessity for us to
adopt such light and frivolous conjectures. I have no doubt but that the opinion
which the Chaldee paraphraser has followed is the true one, that is, that
Sheshach was Babylon. For the sort of alphabet which the Jews at this day call
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;bta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>atbash, </i>is no new invention; it appears from Jerome it had been long
known; he, indeed, derived from great antiquity the practice, so to speak, of
counting the letters backwards. They put, the last letter,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the place of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a</font><font face="Palatino">,
the first, and then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
in the place of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,

being in the middle of the letters was put for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">;
and so they called Babel Sheshach.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE141
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">And to designate Babylon by an obscure name
was suitable to the design of the Prophet. But every doubt is removed by another
passage in this Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;How<i> </i>is
Sheshach demolished! how fallen is the glory (or praise) of the whole earth! how
overthrown is
Babylon!&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;245140&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
51:40.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There, no doubt, the Prophet explains himself; there
is therefore no need to seek any other interpretation. It is a common thing, as
we know, with the prophets to repeat the same thing in other words; as he had
mentioned Sheshach in the first clause, to prevent any doubt he afterwards
mentioned Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises; why did not the Prophet
openly and plainly denounce ruin on the king as well as on the Chaldean nation?
Many think that this was done prudently, that he might not create an ill-will
towards his own people; and Jerome brings forward a passage from Paul, but
absurdly, where he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Until a defection
shall come,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Thessalonians 2:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but he did not understand that passage, for he
thought that Paul spoke of the Roman empire. One error brings another; he
supposed that Paul was cautious that he might not excite the fury of the Roman
Emperor against the Church; but it was no such thing. Now, they who reject the
opinion, which is the most correct, that Sheshach was Babylon, make use of this
argument, &#8212; that the Prophet was not afraid to speak of Babylon, because
he had declared openly of it what he had to say, as we have already seen in
other places, and as it will appear more clearly hereafter. But I do not allow
that the Prophet was afraid to speak of Babylon, for we find that he boldly
obeyed God, so that he stood firm, as we may say, in the midst of many deaths;
but I think that he concealed the name for another reason, even that the Jews
might know that they had no cause to be in a hurry, though the punishment of
Babylon had been predicted, for the prophecy was, as it were, buried, inasmuch
as the Prophet withheld the very name of Babylon. It was not, then, his purpose
to provide for the peace of the Church, nor was he afraid of the Chaldeans, lest
he should kindle their fury against God&#8217;s people; he had no such thing in
view, but wished rather to restrain too much haste.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this appears from the context;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the king of
Sheshath after them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, all these
nations must drink before God shall touch the king of Babylon. He will not,
then, be an idle spectator of all these calamities, but his severity will
proceed through all lands until it reaches its summit; and then, he says, this
king shall drink after the rest. Now, it might have seemed a poor consolation
that God would for so long a time spare the king of Babylon; but all God&#8217;s
children ought nevertheless to have acquiesced in the admonition given them,
that though they were to bear in mind that each of these nations were to be
punished by God&#8217;s hand, they were yet to believe that the king of Babylon
would have his turn, and that they therefore were to restrain themselves, and
not to be carried away by too hasty a desire to look for his punishment, but
patiently to bear the yoke of tyranny laid on them, until the seasonable time
came of which they had been reminded. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet returns to his former discourse. He
had said that a cup was extended to him by God&#8217;s hand, that he might give
it to all nations to drink. He now repeats and confirms the same thing, not
indeed that he brought this message to all the nations; for we have said the
benefit arising from these predictions belonged only to the Jews. Neither the
Tyrians nor the Sidonians ever knew that they were punished by God&#8217;s hand
when they were plundered by their enemies; this never came to their minds, nor
had this been ever taught them. The Prophet had not been appointed their
teacher; but his duty was only to warn his own nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However, the Prophet, that his predictions might have
greater authority, is here introduced as God&#8217;s herald, denouncing ruin on
all nations, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt therefore
say to them, Thus saith Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.
The true God was unknown to these heathens, except they had heard that God was
worshipped in Judea; but at the same time they despised, yea, hated true
religion. But, as I have already said, the Prophet addressed his own people, the
Jews alone, though he spoke of aliens and distant nations. I cannot advance
further now.</font><br></div>

reconciled to thee, and that, commiserating the many evils, by which the world
is at this day afflicted, we may also strive to restore those to the right way
who seem to give themselves up to their own ruin, so that by converting those to
thee who are now far away and aliens, thy name may be more glorified and

Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINETY-SEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain the verse in which
Jeremiah bids </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all nations
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to drink of the cup until they were drunken. Of
the metaphor of the cup an explanation has already been given: the reason is,
because God in his infinite wisdom knew what every one deserved, or how just it
was to chastise at one time in a lighter, and at another time in a heavier
degree. As then the measure is not the same, the similitude of a cup is most
suitable. Further, God sometimes gives a cup to drink, that he who cannot bear a
heavier punishment may only taste it. For we know that God deals more severely
with the strong and the obstinate: but when any one is weak, he is treated more
gently, and is made only to sip or to taste of the cup.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet says here that they were to drink
until they became drunken, according to what is said in another place, when the
heathens are spoken of, &#8220;They shall even exhaust the yew dregs.&#8221; And
God makes men drunken, as I have said before, even when he blinds them and gives
them the spirit of giddiness or stupor.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;310126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Obadiah
26.) But the word drunkenness refers to external chastisements.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Drink
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and be
drunken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;think ye not
that you have suffered all, when God begins to punish you and has given you one
draught only; but the Lord will make you thoroughly drunken.&#8221; And hence he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Vomit ye and
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for they who indulge in excess and
fill themselves, so that they almost burst, must necessarily disgorge
themselves. And vomiting disorders the brain, so that the feet can no longer
perform their office, and no part of the body retains its power. The meaning
then is, that as God had for a long time deferred his judgment, and all nations
had hardened themselves when his long-suffering invited them to repentance, the
most dreadful vengeance was now nigh them all, a vengeance which would
compensate for the delay or the length of endurance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some interpreters hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conclude</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that the punishment of all the nations of whom the Prophet now speaks, would
be of no avail to them: but this seems not to me to be well founded. For he has
spoken of the chosen people; and it is certain that some of them repented,
however small the number was, and we shall also see that pardon and salvation
are promised even to the heathens, after the execution of God&#8217;s judgments.
I therefore thus simply interpret these words, &#8212; that they should not only
taste of the cup, but also drink to excess, so as to become like drunken men,
wholly stupified, because the heaviness of their punishment would deprive them
of reason. In no way more solid is the reason given by Jerome, when he says that
the Prophet&#8217;s discourse refers to the reprobate, because he subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And rise no
more</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jerome thought, that by this
expression extreme despair is intimated. But the Prophet, in my judgment, meant
nothing else than that God&#8217;s vengeance on all the nations would be so
great that vestiges of it would remain after a length of time; as the case is
with a drunkard, who cannot get rid of the effects of his excess in a night or
in a day, but he remains stupid for some time, or becomes frantic. This is what
the Prophet means when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall rise no
more</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">

what he had said of drunkenness and vomiting, even that so great a horror would
seize their minds, that they would lie down wholly stupified. But God declares
that he would send a sword against them, that the Jews might understand, as it
has been already stated, that when all things would be in a state of almost
entire confusion, yet God&#8217;s judgment would be within the limits of
moderation. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet intimates, that however
refractory the nations might be, yet they could effect no good by their
obstinacy, for willing or unwilling they would be constrained to drink of the
cup. But in order to render the matter more striking, he introduces them as
refusing; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they refuse to take
the cup, thou shalt say to them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says
God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Drinking ye shall
drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have before said that the
Prophet was not set a teacher over the heathens: hence what he declares here
appertained not to aliens; but the whole benefit belonged to God&#8217;s Church.
Therefore what is said was spoken for God&#8217;s people, even that they might
know that as God had determined to punish the wickedness of men, none of all
those threatened with judgment could possibly escape. Men indeed are often like
unruly horses, who kick and are ferocious, and rage against their rider, and
also bite; but the Prophet shews that God possesses a power sufficient to quell
such obstinacy. He however reminds us how rebellious most would be, nay, almost
all, when chastised by God&#8217;s hand. It is indeed a rare instance when he
who has sinned, willingly and calmly submits to God, and owns that he is justly
punished: nay, they who confess that they have deserved some heavy punishment,
do yet complain against God; for they dread his vengeance, and apprehend not his
mercy, and promise not to themselves any pardon. There is then no wonder that
the Prophet ascribes here to wicked men, both Jews and aliens, so hard and
rebellious a spirit, that they would resist God, and try to extricate themselves
from his hand, in short, that they would by all means attempt to escape his
judgment.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they refuse to take the cup

not to take the words in their literal sense: for the Prophet did not speak to
aliens, but what he had in view was the event itself, or rather the disposition
of the people. These nations had indeed some power, and doubtless they
strenuously defended their own safety; and this was the act of refusing intended
by the Prophet. For when the enemy attacked the Moabites, they did not
immediately yield; and the same was the case with others. Tyre was almost
unassailable, for it was situated in the sea; where it was easy to prevent the
approach of enemies. As then they had resolutely opposed their enemies, they are
said to have </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>refused the cup from
God&#8217;s hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for they thought that
they could keep off the coming evil. But however inconquerable they thought
themselves to be, and how much soever they trusted in their own power, yet God
says, that their efforts would be in vain and useless:

<div><font face="Palatino">A proof is added by comparing the less and the
greater; for the Prophet reasons thus, &#8212; &#8220;If God spares not the city
in which he has chosen a temple for himself, and designed his name to be
invoked, how can he spare aliens to whom he has never made any promise, as he
regarded them as strangers? If then the green tree is consumed, how can the dry
remain safe?&#8221; This is the import of the passage. The Apostle uses the same
argument in other words; for after having said that judgment would begin at
God&#8217;s house, he immediately shews how dreadful that vengeance of God was
to be which awaited his open enemies!
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence gather a useful doctrine. Since God not
only declares that he will be indiscriminately the avenger of wickedness, but
also summons in the first place his Church which he has chosen before his
tribunal, its condition may seem to be worse than that of alien nations. Hence
the minds of the godly, when they view things in this light, might be much
depressed. It seems a singular favor of God, that he unites us to himself; but
yet this honor seems only to lead to punishment: for God connives at the
wickedness of heathens, and seems to bury them in oblivion; but as soon as we
fall into sin, we perceive signs of his wrath. It would then be better to be at
a distance from him, and that he should not be so solicitous in his care for us.
Thus the faithful view the unbelieving as in a better state than themselves. But
this doctrine mitigates all the sharpness of that grief, which might otherwise
occasion great<i> </i>bitterness. For when it is represented to us, that God
begins at his Church, that he may more heavily punish the unbelieving after
having long endured them, and that they may thus be far more grievously dealt
with than the faithful, as the dry tree is much sooner consumed than the green,
&#8212; when therefore this is set before us, we have doubtless a ground for
comfort, and that not small nor common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see why Jeremiah added this, &#8212; that
how much soever the nations would resist God, they would yet be constrained,
willing or unwilling, to yield, as God was more powerful than they; and for this
reason, that since God would not spare his chosen people, the heathens could by
no means escape unpunished, and not find him to be the judge of the world. Let
then this truth be remembered by us, whenever our flesh leads us to complain or
to be impatient; for it is better for us that God should begin with us, as at
length the wicked shall in their turn be destroyed, and that we should endure
temporal evils, that God may at length raise us up to the enjoyment of his
paternal favor. And for this reason Paul also says, that it is a demonstration
of the just judgment of God when the faithful are exposed to many evils.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:4, 5.): For, when God chastises his own children, of whose
obedience he yet approves, do we not see as in a glass what is yet concealed?
even the dreadful punishment that awaits all the unbelieving. God, then,
represents to us at this day the destruction of his enemies by the paternal
chastisements with which he visits us; and they are a certain proof or a lively
exhibition of that judgment which the unbelieving fear not, but thoughtlessly
deride.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I begin to bring
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rh</font><font face="Palatino">,
ero, means properly to do evil; and it would be a strange thing to say that God
does evil, were it not that common usage explains the meaning. They who are in
any measure acquainted with Scripture know that calamities are called evils,
that is, according to the perceptions of men. The Lord then is said to bring
evil on men, not because he injures them or deals unjustly and cruelly with
them, but because what is adverse to men&#8217;s minds is thought to be by them,
and is called evil. Then he says, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>begin to do evil in the city on
which my name is
called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God&#8217;s name is called on a
people, when he promises to be their guardian and defender, and his name is said
to be called upon men, when they betake themselves to his guardianship and
protection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the real meaning, &#8212; that
God&#8217;s name is called on a people, when they are deemed to be under his
guardianship and keeping; as God&#8217;s name is called on the children of
Abraham, because he had promised to be their God; and they boasted that they
were his peculiar people, even on account of their adoption. So God&#8217;s name
was called on Jerusalem, because there was the Temple and the altar; and as God
called it his rest or habitation, his name was there well known, according to
what we say in French, <i>Se reclamer, il se reclame d&#8217;un tel, </i>that
is, such an one claims this or that as his patron, so that he shelters himself
under his protection. So also the Jews formerly called on God&#8217;s name, when
they said that they had been chosen to be his people: nay, this may also be
applied to men; for the name of Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham was called on the
twelve tribes, even for this reason, &#8212; because they regarded, when seeking
to rely on God&#8217;s covenant, their own origin, for they had descended from
the holy fathers, with whom God had made his covenant, and to whom he had
promised that he would be ever their God. All the Israelites called on Abraham,
not, that they offered him worship, but that, as they were his offspring, they
might feel justly assured that the gratuitous covenant by which God had adopted
them to himself, had been transmitted to them. But this calling may be also
taken in another sense, even because they daily appeased God by sacrifices and
prayers: when they committed their safety to God, there was a sacrifice always
added, and reconciliation was also promised. Then to be called upon or invoked,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nukora,</i> may be taken in this sense, even that they knew that God was
reconciled to them, when they from the heart repented. Since then God&#8217;s
name was called upon in that city, how was it possible that the Gentiles should
escape that judgment to which the holy city was of be exposed?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the former view seems to me the best; and there
is no doubt but that God speaks here to the free adoption by which he had chosen
that people for himself: hence was the invocation or the glorying of which he
now speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as it was difficult to make the Jews to believe
what the Prophet had said, he dwells on the subject, and repeats what was before
sufficiently clear. He not only says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall ye be treated as innocent?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but he mentions the word twice,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall ye by being treated as
innocent be treated as innocent?</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE145
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">And thus he rebuked the perverse contumacy by
which the heathens were filled, while looking on their wealth, their number, and
other things, and at the same time disregarding all that the prophets proclaimed
at Jerusalem, as though it was nothing to them. The question is in itself
emphatical, &#8220;Can ye by any means be treated as innocent?&#8221; The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuke, </i>means to be innocent, but it is applied to punishment; as the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>on, </i>which means iniquity, is used to designate punishment. So he is said
not to be innocent who cannot exempt himself from God&#8217;s judgment, nor be
free from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms this sentence when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a sword am I calling for on
all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This confirmation is by no means
superfluous, for the insolence of the nations had increased through the
forbearance of God, for they had for a long time, yea, for many ages, been in a
quiet state, and had indulged themselves in their pleasures, and slept as it
were in their own dregs, according to what is said elsewhere. The Prophet then
says now, that God was calling for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth.
For he had often and in various ways chastised his own people, while the
Gentiles were not in any danger and free from troubles.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:11.) But he says now that he was calling for a sword to destroy all those
whom he seemed to have forgiven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God is said to have called for men as well as for
a sword; for Nebuchadnezzar is said to have fought under the<b> </b>banner of
God; he is said to have been like a hired soldier. But God now speaks of the
sword, that we might know that it is in his power to excite and to quell wars
whenever it pleases him, and that thus the sword, though wielded by the hand of
man, is not yet called forth by the will of man, but by the hidden power of God.

<div><font face="Palatino">The word

eidad, </i>is rendered <i>celeusma, </i>a shout; but some render it a mournful
singing; and it often occurs when the vintage is spoken of. <i>Celeusma, </i>as
it is well known, is the shout of sailors. Its etymology is indeed general in
its meaning; for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">keleu&gt;ein</font><font face="Palatino">
is to exhort, to encourage; and then the noun is exhortation. But as this word
is only used as to sailors, I prefer to adopt the word sound, or a loud
noise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophesy thou against them all
these words, and say to them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. I
have already reminded you that no command was given to the Prophet to go to the
heathens and to address each nation among them, or, in other words, to perform
among them his prophetic office. But though he did not move a foot from the
city, yet the influence of his prophecy reached through every region of the
earth. The preaching therefore of Jeremiah was not in vain, for the Jews
understood by what happened, that there was in the language of the holy man the
power of the Spirit for the salvation of all the godly, and for the destruction
of all the unbelieving. It is, then, in this sense that God bids and commands
him again to prophesy against all nations, and to speak to them, not that he
actually addressed them; but when he taught the Jews, his doctrine had an
influence on all nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah from on high shall roar,
and from the habitation of his holiness shall send forth his
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The metaphor of roaring is
sufficiently common. It seems indeed unsuitable to apply it to God; but we know
how tardy men are, and how they indulge themselves in their own insensibility,
even when God threatens them. Hence God, adopting a hyperbolical mode of
speaking, reproves their stupidity, as he cannot move them except he exceeds<i>
</i>the limits of moderation. This then is the reason why he compares himself to
a lion, not that we are to imagine that there is anything savage or cruel in
him; but as I have said, men cannot be moved, except God puts on another
character and comes forth as a lion, while yet he testifies not in vain
elsewhere, that he is slow to wrath, inclined to mercy and long-suffering.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
86:5, 15.) Let us then know that the impious contempt, by which most men are
fascinated, is thus condemned<i>, </i>when God does as it were in this manner
transform himself, and is constrained to represent himself as a
lion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Roar, then, he says, shall Jehovah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from on high, and from the
habitation of his holiness shall he send forth his
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he speaks of <i>on high,
</i>it is probable that heaven is meant; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the habitation of his holiness
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is often taken for the sanctuary or the Temple;
but in other places, when the same words are repeated, heaven is also meant by
the habitation of his holiness. There is yet nothing unsuitable, if we say that
the Prophet here refers to the Temple, and that he thus refers to it, that he
might raise upwards the minds of the Jews, who had their thoughts fixed on the
visible Temple: nay, this seems to be required by the context. They indeed
foolishly thought that God was bound to them, because it had been
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Here is my rest
for ever; here will my name and power dwell.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They strangely thought that there was no God but he
who was inclosed in that visible and external sanctuary. Hence was that pride
which Isaiah reproves and severely condemns when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Where is the place
for my rest? the heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what place

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet there does not merely speak, as many
think, against superstition; but he rather beats down that foolish arrogance,
because the people thought that God could never be separated from the material
Temple. And yet it was not for nothing that the Temple had the name of being the
royal throne of God, provided vices were removed. So now the Prophet, though he
exalts God above the heavens, yet alludes to the visible sanctuary, when he
says, &#8220;Roar shall Jehovah from on high, and from the habitation of his
holiness shall he send forth his voice;&#8221; that is, though the Gentiles
think that God sits and rests in a corner, yet his throne is in heaven: that he
has chosen for himself a terrestrial habitation, is no reason why the government
of the whole earth should not be in his hands; and therefore he manifests proofs
of his vengeance towards all nations; but for the sake of his Church he will go
forth as it were from his Temple: and he repeats again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Roaring he shall roar on his
dwelling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or
habitation.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Jerome usually renders the last word
ornament, beauty; and yet this passage sufficiently proves that it cannot mean
any other thing than habitation, as well as many other
passages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards proceeds to another comparison, He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will respond a

the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This repetition and variety
confirm what I have said, &#8212; that God hyperbolically set forth the
vehemence of his voice in order to fill with terror the secure and the torpid.
And the Prophet seems here to intimate, that though there would be none to
cheer, yet God&#8217;s voice would be sufficiently powerful. For they who tread
the wine-press mutually encourage one another by shouting; one calls on another,
and thus they rouse themselves to diligence. There is also a mutual concord
among sailors, when they give their shouts, as well as among the workmen who
tread the grapes in the wine-press. But though God would have no one to rouse
him, yet he himself would be sufficient;

had a strife with all nations; and here the Prophet seems to obviate a question
that might have been raised, &#8220;What does this mean? that God will suddenly
raise a commotion, after having been quiet and still for so many ages, without
giving any symptom of his vengeance?&#8221; For we have said that the nations
here mentioned had been long in a tranquil state. Hence the Prophet answers this
unexpressed objection and says, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had a contention
</i></font><font face="Palatino">with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The time of contending is not always: he who does not
immediately bring his adversary before the judge, but deals kindly with him, and
seeks to obtain amicably from him what is right, does not thereby forego what is
justly due to him; but when he finds that the contumacy of his adversary is such
that his kind dealing effects nothing, he may then litigate with him. The same
thing is now expressed by the Prophet, even that God would now
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>contend with the nations and
dispute with all flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God is indeed,
properly speaking, the judge of the world; and there is no arbiter or a judge in
heaven or on earth to be found before whom he can dispute; but yet this mode of
speaking ought to be especially noticed; for God thus silences all those
complaints which men are wont to make against him. Even they who are a hundred
times proved guilty, yet complain against God when he severely punishes them,
and they say that they are made to suffer more than they deserve. Hence God for
this reason says, that when he punishes he does not exercise a tyrannical power,
but that he does as it were dispute with sinners. At the same time he sets forth
his own goodness by representing the end he has in view; for what he regards in
rigidly punishing wickedness, is nothing else than to obtain his own rights; and
as he cannot secure these by kind means, he extorts them as it were by the aid
of laws.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE148</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then observe, that nothing is detracted from
God&#8217;s power and authority, when it is said, that he disputes or contends
with men; but that in this way all those clamors are checked which the ungodly
raise against him, as though he raged immoderately against them, and also that
thus the end of all punishment is pointed out, even that God condescends to
assume the character of an opponent, and proposes nothing else than to require
what is reasonable and just, like him who having a cause to try before the
judge, would willingly agree beforehand, if possible, with his adversary; but as
he sees no hope, he has recourse to that remedy. So God contends with us; for
except we were wholly irreclaimable, we might be restored to his favor; and
reconciliation would be ready for us, were we only to allow him his
rights.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the subject which we began to
explain in the last Lecture. He had before prophesied of God&#8217;s judgments,
which were nigh many nations, and which referred to almost all the countries
near and known to the Jews, and to some that were afar off. The substance of
what has been said is, &#8212; that God, who had long spared the wickedness of
men, would now become an avenger, so that it might openly appear, that though he
had deferred punishment, he would not allow the ungodly to escape, for they
would in proper time and season be called to give an account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he adds here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go forth shall evil from nation
to nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The explanation by some is,
that one nation would make war on another, and that thus they would destroy
themselves by mutual conflicts; and this meaning may be admitted. It seems,
however, to me that the Prophet meant another thing, even that God&#8217;s
vengeance would advance like a contagion through all lands. And according to
this view he adds a metaphor, or the simile of a storm, or a tempest, or a
whirlwind; for when a tempest arises, it confines not itself to one region, but
spreads itself far and wide. So the Prophet now shews, that though God would not
at one time punish all the nations, he would yet be eventually the judge of all,
for he would pass far and wide like a storm. Thus, then, I interpret the
passage, not that the nations would make war with one another, but that when God
had executed his judgment on one nation, he would afterwards advance to another,
so that he would make no end until he had completed what Jeremiah had
foretold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this view appears still more evident from the
second clause of the verse, for this cannot be explained of intestine wars,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raised shall be a tempest from
the sides of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We hence see
that the meaning is, that God would not be wearied after having begun to summon
men to judgment, but would include the most remote, who thought themselves
beyond the reach of danger. As when a tempest rises, it seems only to threaten a
small portion of the country, but it soon spreads itself and covers the whole
heavens; so also God says, that his vengeance would come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the sides of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, from the remotest
places, so that no distance would prevent the completion of what he had foretold
by his servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this may also be accommodated to our case; for
whenever we see that this or that nation is afflicted by any calamity, we ought
to remember this truth, that God seasonably warns us, that we may not abuse his
patience, but anticipate him before his scourge passes from some side of the
earth to us. In short, as soon as God manifests any sign of his wrath, it ought
instantly to occur to us, that it may spread in a moment through all the
extremities of the earth, so that no corner would be exempted. For if he makes
known his power in the whirlwind or the storm, how will it be, when he makes a
fuller and a nearer manifestation of his judgment, by stretching forth his hand
as it were in a visible manner? This, then, is the import of this verse. It
afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse explains what I have just said; and hence
it also appears that the Prophet did not speak of mutual slaughters inflicted by
one nation on another, but that he only declared that God&#8217;s wrath would
spread like a storm so as to extend to all nations and lands. The Prophet no
doubt continues the same subject; and we see why he says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the slain, of Jehovah shall
be in that day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; he calls our
attention to God alone; he will speak otherwise hereafter, he does not set here
before us the ministers of God&#8217;s vengeance, but God himself as acting by
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the slain of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>some read, &#8220;the<i>
</i>wounded;&#8221; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chelal, </i>means to wound and to kill; but &#8220;the<i> </i>slain&#8221; is
more suitable here. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The slain
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of Jehovah shall be from one
extremity of the earth to the other</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as
though he had said, that God would not be satisfied with punishing three or four
nations, but would shew himself the judge of all the countries of the
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage is worthy of special notice; for we
often wonder why God connives at so many crimes committed by men, which none of
us would tolerate. But if we consider how dreadful was the tempest of which the
Prophet now speaks, we ought to know that God rests for a time, in order that
the ungodly and the wicked might be the less excusable. It was at the same time
doubtless a sad spectacle, when so many regions and provinces were unceasingly
suffering various calamities, when one nation thought itself better off than its
neighbors, but presently found itself more cruelly treated. And yet this was
generally the case, for God&#8217;s wrath extended to the extremities of the
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He amplifies the atrocity of the evil by mentioning
three things,<i> &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall not be lamented, nor gathered, nor buried; but they shall be as dung, and
shall thus lie on the face of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We have said in other places that lamentation does no good to the dead; but
as it is what humanity requires, the want of it is rightly deemed a temporal
punishment. So when any one is deprived of burial, it is certainly nothing to
the dead if his body is not laid in a grave; for we know that God&#8217;s holy
servants have often been either burnt or hung or exposed to wild beasts; and the
whole Church complains that dead bodies were lying around Jerusalem and became
food to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the earth. But these things do
not disprove the fact, that burial is an evidence of God&#8217;s paternal
kindness towards men. For why has he appointed that men should be buried rather
than brute animals, except that he designed it to be an intimation of an
immortal life? As, then, burial is a sign of God&#8217;s favor, it is no wonder
that he often declares to the reprobate that their dead bodies would be cast
away, so as not to be honored, with a grave.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must remember this truth, &#8212; that
temporal punishments happen in common to God&#8217;s children and to aliens; God
extends without any difference temporal punishments to his own children and to
the unbelieving, and that in order that it may be made evident that our hope
ought not to be fixed on this world. But however this may be, it is yet true
that when God punishes the unbelieving in this way, he adds at the same time
some remark by which it may be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>understood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that it happens not in vain nor undesignedly, that those are deprived of
burial, who deserve that God should exterminate them from the earth, and that
their memory should be obliterated, so that they should not be connected among
men. But we have said also in another place, that such expressions admit of
another meaning, which yet is not at variance with the former, but connected
with it, and that is, that so great would be the slaughter, that none would be
left to shew this kindness to his friend or to his neighbor or to his brother.
For when four or ten or a hundred die, they may be buried; but when God slays by
the sword a great number in one day, none are found to take care of burying the
dead, as few remain alive, and even they dread their enemies. When therefore the
prophets say that those whom God slew would be without lamentation and burial,
they intimate that so great would be the number, that all would lie on the
ground; for no one would dare to perform this humane act towards the dead, and
were all to do their utmost, they would not be able, as the number would be so
great.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus Jeremiah confirms what we have said, &#8212;
that God&#8217;s vengeance would extend to all lands and all nations, so as to
involve in ruin the nobles as well as the common people, and to leave remaining
but a small number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same purpose he adds what follows, that they
would be as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dung on the face of
the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is added by way of
contempt. It was then hardly credible, that so many illustrious, wealthy, and
powerful nations could thus in so short a time be destroyed. But the Prophet, in
order to shake off this false conceit, says that they would become like dung,
that however great their dignity and power, their wealth and strength, might be,
they could not yet escape the hand of God, for he would reduce to nothing the
glory of the whole world. We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet. It
then follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I doubt not but that the Prophet now turns his
discourse especially to his own nation, which interpreters have not observed,
and hence have not understood the meaning of the Prophet. He prophesied of
God&#8217;s judgments, that the Jews might know that they in vain looked for
impunity, as the Lord would not pardon the ignorant and destitute of all true
knowledge, who might have pretended their ignorance as an excuse; and also that
this comfort might support the minds of the godly, that the heathens, involved
in the same guilt, would be subjected to the same judgment; and lastly, that
knowing the difference between them and other nations, they might flee to
God&#8217;s mercy and be encouraged to repent by entertaining a hope of pardon.
After having then treated this general subject, he now returns to the people
over whom he was appointed a teacher. He might indeed have declared from an
eminence what was to take place through the whole earth; for so extensive was
the office of a herald which God had conferred on him. He might then by the
virtue of his office have denounced ruin on all nations; but he ought not to
neglect his special care for the chosen people. And so I explain this passage;
for he now again directs his discourse to the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl, ye pastors, and
cry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. By pastors he means the king
and his counsellors, the priests and other rulers; and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the choice of the flock
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he seems to understand the rich, whose
condition was better than that of the common people. Some in a more refined
manner consider the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>choice
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the flock to have been those void of
knowledge, unlike the scribes and priests and the king&#8217;s counsellors; but
this view seems not to be well-founded. I therefore adopt what is more probable,
&#8212; that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>choice of the
flock </i></font><font face="Palatino">were those who were rich and high in
public esteem, and yet held no office of authority in the commonwealth or in the
Church. However this may be, the Prophet shews, that as soon as God began to put
forth his hand to punish the Jews, there would be no ranks of men exempt from
lamentation, for he would begin with the pastors and the choice of the
flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their days were
fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he indirectly condemns
that wicked security which had for a long time hardened them, so that they
despised all threatenings; for God had now for many years called on them, and
had sent his Prophets one after another; when they saw the execution of judgment
suspended over them, they considered it only as a bugbear, &#8220;Well, let the
prophets continue to pronounce their terrors, if they will do so, but nothing
will come of them.&#8221; Thus the ungodly turned God&#8217;s forbearance into
an occasion for their obstinacy. As then this evil was common among the Jews,
the Prophet now says, by way of anticipation, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their days were
fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For there is to be understood
this contrast, that God had spared them, not that he had his eyes closed, or
that he had not observed their wicked deeds, but that he wished to give them
time to repent; but when he saw that their wickedness was unhealable, he now
says that their days were completed. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be killed
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or slain. I wonder that learned interpreters
render this, &#8220;that<i> </i>they may slay one another.&#8221; There is no
need of adding anything, for the Prophet meant to express no such sentiment, nor
to restrict what he denounces here on the Jews, to intestine or domestic wars;
on the contrary, we know that they were slain by aliens, even by the Chaldeans.
This sense then is forced, and is also inconsistent with history. It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and your
dispersions</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE149</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> also </i>are fulfilled, or your
breakings. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;wp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>puts, </i>means to scatter or to dissipate, and also to afflict, to tear; and
the sense of tearing or breaking is what I prefer here. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall fall as a precious
vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This simile appears not to be
very appropriate, for why should he not rather compare them to an earthen
vessel, which is of no value and easily broken? But his object was to point out
the difference in their two conditions, that though God had honored them with
singular privileges, yet all their excellency would not keep them safe; for it
often happens that a vessel, however precious, is broken. And he speaks not of
gold or silver vessels, but of fragile vessels, once in great esteem. That he
might then more grievously wound them, he says that they had been hitherto
precious vessels, or a precious vessel; for he speaks of them all in the
singular number, and that they were to be broken; and thus he confirms what I
said on the last verse, that hypocrites in vain trusted in their present
fortune, or in the superior blessings of God, for he could turn to shame
whatever glory he had conferred on them. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

miserable, when any one cannot otherwise secure his life than by seeking exile,
where he must be poor, and needy, and despised; but even this is denied by the

that he would go forth for a short time, as hungry lions are wont to do; but
this is too far-fetched. I therefore have no doubt that God sets forth his power
under the character of a lion; for the Jews would have been feared by all their
enemies, had not God changed as it were his station. But as they had expelled
him by their vices, so that he had no more an habitation among them, hence it
was that they became exposed to the plunder of all nations. The import of the
passage then is, that as long as God dwelt in the Temple he was like a lion, so
that by his roaring alone he kept at a distance all nations and defended the
children of Abraham; but that now, though he had not changed his nature, nor was
there anything taken away or diminished as to his power, yet the Jews would not
be safe, for he would forsake them.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

Judea, except that it was deprived of God&#8217;s protection? For had God
defended it, he could have repelled all enemies by a nod only. But as he had
departed, hence it was that they found an easy access, and that the land was
thus reduced<i> </i>to a waste.</font><br></div>

&#8220;dove,&#8221;<i> </i>but not correctly. They yet have devised a refined
meaning, that God is called a dove because of his kindness and meekness, though
his wrath is excited, for he is forced to put on the character of another
through the perverseness of men, when he sees that he can do nothing by his
benevolence towards them. But this is a far-fetched speculation. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hny</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>inc, </i>means to oppress, to take by force; and as it is most frequently
taken in a bad sense, I prefer to apply it here to enemies rather than to God
himself. There are many indeed who explain it of God, but I cannot embrace their
view; for Jeremiah joins together two clauses, that God would forsake his
Temple, as when a lion departs from his covert, and also that enemies would come
and find the place naked and empty; in short, he intimates that they would be
exposed to the will and plunder of their enemies, because they would be at that
time destitute of God&#8217;s aid. And as he had before spoken of the
indignation of God&#8217;s wrath, so now he ascribes the same to their enemies,
and justly so, for they were to execute his judgments; what properly belongs to
God is ascribed to them, because they were to be his

<div><font face="Palatino">This chapter contains a remarkable history, to which
a very useful doctrine is annexed, for Jeremiah speaks of repentance, which
forms one of the main points of true religion, and he shews at the same time
that the people were rejected by God, because they perversely despised all
warnings, and could by no means be brought to a right mind. We shall find these
two things in this chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that this word came to him at the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beginning of the reign, of
Jehoiakim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>of which king we have spoken
in other places, where Jeremiah related other discourses delivered in his reign.
We hence conclude that this book was not put together in a regular order, but
that the chapters were collected, and from them the volume was
formed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The time, however, is not here repeated in vain, for
we know that the miserable derive some hope from new events. When men have been
long afflicted and well-nigh have rotted in their evils, they yet think, when a
change takes place, that they shall be happy, and they promise themselves vain
hopes. Such was probably the confidence of the people when Jehoiakim began to
reign; for they might have thought that things would be restored by him to a
better state. There is also another circumstance to be noticed; though their
condition was nigh past hope, they yet hardened themselves against God, so that
they obstinately resisted the prophets. It hence appears that the reprobate were
become more and more exasperated by the scourges of God, and had never been
truly and really humbled. This was the reason why Jeremiah, according to
God&#8217;s command, spoke so sharply.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I pass by other things and come to the words, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of Jehovah came
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to him. He thus arrogated nothing to himself;
but he testifies how necessary it was, especially among a people so refractory,
that he should bring nothing of his own, but announce a truth that came from
heaven. A general subject might be here handled, which is, that God alone is to
be heard in the Church, and also that no one ought to assume to himself the name
of a prophet or teacher, except he whom the Lord has formed and appointed, and
to whom he has committed his message; but these things have been treated
elsewhere and often and much at large; and I do not willingly dwell long on
general subjects. It is then enough to bear in mind the purpose for which
Jeremiah says that the word of Jehovah came to him, even that he might secure
authority to himself; he does not boast of his own wisdom nor of anything human
or earthly, but says only that he spoke what the Lord had commanded
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, Stand in the
court of the house </i></font><font face="Palatino">(literally, but house means
the Temple) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was not allowed the people
to enter into the Temple; hence the Prophet was bidden to abide in the court
where he might be heard by all. He was, as we have seen, of the priestly order;
but it would have been but of little avail to address the
Levites.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE155
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">It was therefore necessary for him to go
forth and to announce to the whole people the commands of God which are here
recited; and he was to do this not only to the citizens of Jerusalem, but also
to all the Jews; and this is expressly required,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak to all the cities of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who come to worship in the Temple
of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God seems to have designedly
anticipated the presumption of those who thought that wrong was done to them,
when they were so severely reproved; &#8220;What! we have left our wives and
children, and have come here to worship God; we have laid aside every attention
to our private advantage, and have come here, though inconveniently; we might
have lived quietly at home and enjoyed our blessings; we have incurred great
expenses, undertaken a tedious journey, brought sacrifices, and denied ourselves
as to our daily food, that God might be worshipped; and yet thou inveighest
severely against us, and we hear nothing from thy mouth but terrors; is this
right? Does God render such a reward to his servants?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus then they might have contended with the Prophet;
but he anticipates these objections, and allows what they might have pleaded,
that they came to the Temple to offer sacrifices; but he intimates that another
thing was required by God, and that they did not discharge their duties in
coming to the Temple, except they faithfully obeyed God and his Law. We now see
why the Prophet said, that he was sent to those who came up to Jerusalem to
worship God. The deed itself could not indeed have been blamed; nay, it was
highly worthy of praise, that they thus frequented the worship of God; but as
the Jews regarded not the end for which God had commanded sacrifices to be
offered to him, and also the end for which he had instituted all these external
rites, it was necessary to remove this error in which they were
involved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Speak, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the words which I have
commanded thee to speak to them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
Prophet again confirms, that he was not the author of what he taught, but only a
minister, who faithfully announced what God had committed to him; and so the
people could not have objected to him by saying, that he brought forward his own
devices, for he repelled such a calumny. The false prophets might have also
alleged similar things; but Jeremiah had certain evidences as to his calling,
that the Jews, by rejecting him, condemned themselves, for their own consciences
fully convicted them. But from this passage, and from many like passages, we may
draw this conclusion, &#8212; that no one, however he may excel in powers of
mind, or knowledge, or wisdom, or station, ought to be attended to, except he
proves that he is God&#8217;s minister.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not diminish a
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some read, &#8220;Thou shall not
restrain,&#8221; which is harsh. The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>garo, </i>properly means to be lessened and to be consumed. And Moses makes
use of the same word in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:32, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou shalt not
add, nor diminish,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">in reference to the Law, in which the people were to
acquiesce, without corrupting it with any human devices. To diminish then was to
take away something from the word.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE156
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But we ought to consider the reason why this
was said to Jeremiah; it never entered the mind of the holy man to adulterate
God&#8217;s word; but God here encourages him to confidence, so that he might
boldly execute his commands. To diminish then something from the word, was to
soften what appeared sharp, or to suppress what might have offended, or to
express indirectly or coldly what could not produce effect without being
forcibly expressed. There is then no doubt but that God anticipates here this
evil, under which even faithful teachers in a great measure labor; for when they
find the ears of men tender and delicate, they dare not vehemently to reprove,
threaten, and condemn their vices. This is the reason why God added this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Diminish not a
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;Declare thou with closed eyes and with boldness whatever thou hast heard
from my mouth, and disregard whatever may tend to lessen thy
courage.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now easily learn the use of this doctrine; the
Prophet was not sent to profane men, who openly avowed their impiety, or lived
in gross sins; but he was sent to the very worshippers of God, who highly
regarded his external worship, and for this reason had left wives and children,
came to the Temple and spared neither labor nor expense. As, then, he was sent
to them, we must beware, lest we sleep in our vices and think that we have done
our duty to God, when we have apparently given some evidences of piety; for
except we really and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sincerely
obey </i></font><font face="Palatino">God, all other things are esteemed of no
value by him. It then follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse God briefly shows for what end he sent
his Prophet. For it would not have been sufficient for him to announce what he
taught, except it was known to have been the will of God. Here then God asserts
that he would not be propitious to the people, except they complied with what he
required, that is, to repent. Thus he testifies that what was taught would be
useful to them, because it had reference to their safety; and a truth cannot be
rendered more entitled to our love than when we know that it tends to promote
our wellbeing. Therefore God, when he saw the people rushing headlong through
blind despair into all kinds of impiety, designed to make the trial whether or
not some of them were healable; as though he had said, &#8220;What are ye doing,
ye miserable beings? It is not yet wholly over with you; only obey me, and the
remedy for all your evils is ready at hand.&#8221; We now see what God&#8217;s
design was, even that he wished to give those Jews the hope of mercy who were
altogether irreclaimable, so that they might not reject what he taught on
hearing that it would be for their good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may hence gather a general doctrine; that when
God is especially displeased with us, it is yet an evidence of his paternal
kindness when he favors us with the prophetic teaching, for that will not be
without its fruit, except it be through our own fault. But at the same time we
are rendered more and more inexcusable, if we reject that medicine which would
certainly give us life. Let us then understand that the Prophet says here, that
he was sent that he might try whether the Jews would repent; for God was ready
to receive them into favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylwa</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
auli, </i>&#8220;if<i> </i>peradventure,&#8221; he made use of a common mode of
speaking. God indeed has perfect knowledge of all events, nor had he any doubt
respecting what would take place, when the prophets had discharged their duties;
but what is pointed out here, and also condemned, is the obstinacy of the
people; as though he had said, that it was indeed difficult to heal those who
had grown putrid in their evils, yet he would try to do so. And thus God
manifests his unspeakable goodness, that he does not wholly cast away men who
are almost past remedy, and whose diseases seem to be unhealable. He also
strengthens his Prophet; for he might from long experience have been led to
think that all his labor would be in vain; therefore God adds this, that he
might not cease to proceed in the course of his calling; for what seemed
incredible might yet take place beyond his expectation. We now see why it was
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If so be that they will
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
turn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>From the context we learn,
that repentance as well as faith proceeds from the truth taught: for how is it
that those alienated from God return, confess their sins, and change their
character, minds, and purposes? It is the fruit of truth; not that truth in all
cases is effectual, but he treats here of the elect: or were they all healable,
yet God shews that the use and fruit of his truth is to turn men, as it is said
also by the Prophet,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi

<div><font face="Palatino">What follows is not without its weight,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one from his evil

enough that the whole people should ostensibly confess their sins, but that
every one was required to examine himself: for when we seek God in a troop, and
one follows another, it is often done with no right feeling. Repentance
therefore is only true and genuine, when every one comes to search his own case;
for its interior and hidden seat is in the heart. This is the reason why he

there is no need of long explanation. No change belongs to God; but when God is
said to turn away his wrath, it is to be understood in a sense suitable to the
comprehension of men: in the same way also we are to understand the words, that
he repents.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
85:5; 110:4.) It is at the same time sufficiently evident what God means here,
even that he is reconcilable,<i> </i>as soon as men truly turn to him: and thus
we see that men cannot be called to repent, until God&#8217;s mercy is presented
to them. Hence also it follows, that these two things, repentance and faith, are
connected together, and that it is absurd and an impious sacrilege to separate
them; for God cannot be feared except the sinner perceives that he will be
propitious to him: for as long as we are apprehensive of God&#8217;s wrath, we
dread his judgment; and thus we storm against him, and must necessarily be
driven headlong into the lowest abyss, hence under the Papacy they speak not
only foolishly, but also coldly of repentance; for they leave<i> </i>souls
doubtful and perplexed, nay, they take away every kind of certainty. Let us then
understand the reason why the Holy Spirit teaches us, that repentance cannot be
rightly and profitably taught, unless it be added, that God will be propitious
to miserable men whenever they turn to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I
think</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I have already said, that God
forms no contrary purposes; but this refers to those men who deserved his
dreadful vengeance; it is the same as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Their
iniquity has already ripened; I am therefore now ready to take vengeance on
them: nevertheless let them return to me, and they shall find me to be a Father.
There is, then, no reason for them to despair, though I have already manifested
tokens of my vengeance.&#8221; This is the meaning; but he repeats the reason of
his wrath, On </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>account of the
wickedness of their doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for we know
that they were proud and obstinate; it was therefore necessary to close their
mouths, otherwise they would have raised a clamor, and said, that God was
unjustly angry, or that he exceeded all bounds. Whatever evils then were at
hand, God briefly shews that they came from themselves, that the cause was their
own wickedness,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now briefly includes what he had been
teaching, what he had been commanded to declare to the people. No doubt he spoke
to them more at large; but he deemed it enough to shew in a few words what had
been committed to him. And the sum of it was, that except the Jews so hearkend
as to walk in God&#8217;s Law, and were submissive to the prophets, final ruin
was nigh the Temple and the city. This is the meaning: but it may be useful to
consider every particular.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except ye hearken to me, to walk
in my law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>God intimates, that he mainly
requires obedience, and esteems nothing as much, according to what he says, that
it is better than all sacrifices.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22.) This subject was largely treated in the seventh chapter, where he
said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Did<i> </i>I command your fathers
when they came out of Egypt to offer sacrifices to me? this only I required,
even to hear my voice.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah

<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see, that the only way of living piously,
justly, holily, and uprightly, is to allow ourselves to be ruled by the Lord.
This is one thing. Then what follows is worthy of being noticed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To walk in my
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God here testifies that his will is
not ambiguous or doubtful, for he has prescribed what is right in his law. Were
God then to descend a hundred times from heaven, he would bring nothing but this
message, that he has spoken what is necessary to be known, and that his Law is
the most perfect wisdom. Had he said only, &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; men might have
still evaded and avowed themselves ready to learn. God therefore does here
silence hypocrites, and says that he required nothing else but to follow his
Law. And for the same purpose he adds what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I have set before
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for this kind of speaking intimates
that the doctrine of the Law was by no means obscure or doubtful, as Moses
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I this day call
heaven and earth to witness, that I have set life and death before your

above the clouds? or, Who shall descend into the abyss? or, Who shall pass
beyond the sea? The word is in thy heart and in thy mouth,&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">as though he had said, &#8220;God<i> </i>has deprived
you of every excuse, for there is no reason for doubting, since he has spoken so
familiarly to you, and has explained everything necessary to be
known.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hereby is confuted the impious blasphemy of the
Papists, who impudently assert that not only the Law is obscure, but also the
Gospel. And Paul also loudly declares, that the Gospel is not obscure except to
those who perish, and who have a veil over their hearts, being visited with
judicial blindness. But as to the Law, in which there is no such plainness as in
the Gospel, we see what Jeremiah affirms here, that it was set before the eyes
of all, that they might learn from it what pleased God, and what was just and
right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what follows in the next verse ought to be
especially observed; for these two things are necessarily connected, &#8212;
that God required nothing but obedience to his Law, &#8212; and that his will
was that his prophets should be heard, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
hearken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the words of my servants, the
prophets, whom I send to you, </i></font><font face="Palatino">(it is in the
second person.) Here there seems to be some inconsistency; for if God&#8217;s
Law was sufficient, why were the prophets to be heard? But these two things well
agree together: the Law alone was to be attended to, and also the prophets, for
they were its interpreters. For God sent not his prophets to correct the Law, to
change anything in it, to add or to take away; as it was an unalterable decree,
not to add to it nor to diminish from it. What then was the benefit of sending
the prophets? even to make more manifest the Law, and to apply it to the
circumstances of the people. As then the prophets devised no new doctrine, but
were faithful interpreters of the Law, God joined, not without reason, these two
things together, &#8212; that his Law was to be heard and also his prophets; for
the majesty of the Law derogated nothing from the authority of the prophets; and
as the prophets confirmed the Law, it could not have been that they took away
anything from the Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nay, this passage teaches us, that all those who
repudiate the daily duty of learning, are profane men, and extinguish as far as
they can the grace of the Spirit; many such fanatics among the Anabaptists have
been in our time, who despised learning of every kind. They boasted that the
doctrine of the Law was the Alphabet; and they also indulged in this dream, that
wrong is done to the Holy Spirit when men attend to learning. And some dare, in
a grosser manner, to vomit forth their blasphemies; they say that Scripture is
enough for us, yea, even these two things, &#8220;Fear<i> </i>God and love thy
neighbor.&#8221; But as I have already said, we must consider how God has spoken
by his Law; whether he has closed up the way, so as not to explain his will more
clearly by the prophets, nor to apply to present use what would have otherwise
been less effectual? or that he purposed to draw continually by various channels
the doctrine which flows from that fountain? But now, since God had given his
own Law, and had added to the Law his prophets, every one who rejected the
prophets must surely </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ascribe
</i></font><font face="Palatino">no authority to the Law. Even so now, they who
think it not their duty at this day to seek knowledge in the school of Christ,
and to avail themselves of the hearing of his word, no doubt despise God in
their hearts, and set no value either on the Law, or on the prophets, or on the
Gospel. Remarkable then is this passage; it shews that the Lord would have his
Law to be our leader and teacher, and yet he adds his own
prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom I have sent to you, rising
early and sending</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he upbraids the
Jews with their slowness and insensibility; for he roused them early, and that
not once but often, and yet he spent his labor in vain.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rising
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when applied to God, means that
he called these men in due time, as though he had said, that it was not his
fault that the Jews had departed from the right way of safety, for he had been
sedulously careful of their well-being, and had in due time warned them. We
hence see how the Prophet condemned their tardiness and indifference, and then
their hardness, by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
sending</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for<i> </i>this intimates a repetition
or assiduity. He had said before, &#8220;whom I sent to you, rising
early;&#8221; now, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
sending</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that he had not sent
one prophet, or many at one time, but one after another continually, and that
yet it had been without any benefit. The end of the verse I read in a
parenthesis, (</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but ye have not
hearkened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.) </i>Indeed what follows stands
connected with the previous verses.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE158</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then will I
make</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.: the copulative is to be
rendered here as an adverb of time. What had been just said, &#8220;but<i>
</i>ye have not hearkened,&#8221; was by way of anticipation; for the Jews,
swelling with great arrogance, might have immediately said, &#8220;Oh! what new
thing dost thou bring? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except ye
hearken to my voice, saith Jehovah, to walk in my Law, which I have set before
you, </i></font><font face="Palatino">as though all this were not well known
even to children among us; and yet thou pretendest to be the herald of some
extraordinary prophecy; certainly such boasting will be deemed puerile by all
wise men.&#8221; Thus then they might have spoken, but the Prophet here briefly
checks the insolence of such a foolish censure,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but ye have not
hearkened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that
he had not been sent in vain to speak of a thing as it were new and unusual,
because the Jews had corrupted the whole Law, had become disobedient,
unteachable, and unbelieving, and had despised both the Law of God and his
Prophets.</font><br></div>

sent, &#8212; O grant, that we may not be deaf nor tardy to hear, but promptly

<div><font face="Palatino">We could not yesterday finish the words of the
Prophet, as time did not allow us to do so. We said that the Prophet had
denounced God&#8217;s vengeance on the people in such a manner, that he softened
that severity by some comfort, lest despair should have rendered more obstinate
those whom he wished to turn into obedience; we said also, that the ministers of
the word cannot otherwise speak rightly or profitably of repentance, except they
connect with it the promise of God&#8217;s mercy. But as the Prophet had to do
with refractory men and despisers of God, it behoved him to declare what at
length he subjoins, even that the destruction of the Temple and city was nigh at
band, except they repented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that house would become like
Shiloh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that by this example he
might touch their hearts; for the ark of God had been long at Shiloh, and that
place might have been deemed venerable for being ancient. Jerusalem was indeed
renowned, but Shiloh was in time before it. This place was now forsaken; nay, it
presented a sad and a degraded spectacle. He thus set before their eyes an
example of God&#8217;s vengeance, such as awaited them. We have seen the same
reference in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet recites what happened to him, after
he had declared God&#8217;s message, and faithfully warned the people by adding
threatenings, as God had commanded him. He says first that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>which is not to be deemed as commendatory, as though the priests and
prophets patiently heard what he taught; for there was no teachable spirit in
them, nor did they come prepared to learn, but they had long indulged themselves
in perverseness, so that Jeremiah was become to them an avowed enemy; and they
also audaciously opposed all his threatenings. But though they were not ashamed
to reject what the Prophet said, they yet observed a certain form, as it is
usual with hypocrites, for they are more exact than necessary, as they say, in
what is formal, but what is really important they neglect. We may hence observe,
that the priests and prophets deserved no praise, because they restrained
themselves, as though they deferred their judgment until the cause was known,
but as the whole people were present, they for a time shewed themselves
moderate; it was yet a reigned moderation, for their hearts were full of impiety
and contempt of God, as it became really manifest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be observed that he says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>priests
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets
hearkened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As to the priests, it is no
wonder that he calls them so, though they were in every way wicked, for it was
an hereditary honor. But it is strange that he mentions the prophets. At the
same time we must know, that Jeremiah thus calls those who boasted that they
were sent from above. In the twenty-third chapter he at large reproves them; and
in many other places he condemns their impudence in falsely assuming the
authority of God. He then allowed them an honorable title, but esteemed it as
nothing; as we may do at this day, who without harm may call by way of ridicule
those prelates, bishops, or pastors, who under the Papacy seek to be deemed so,
provided we at the same time strip them of their masks. But these lay hold on
the title, and thus seek to suppress the truth of God, as though to be called a
bishop were of more weight than if an angel was to come down from heaven. And
yet were an angel to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>descend
</i></font><font face="Palatino">from heaven, he ought to be counted by us as a
devil, if he brought forward such filthy and execrable blasphemies, as we see
the world is at this day polluted with by these unprincipled men. This passage
then, and the like, ought to be borne in mind, for they shew that titles are not
sufficient, except those who bear them really shew that they are such as their
calling imports. Thus, then, Jeremiah was called a Prophet, and also those
impostors were called prophets whose only religion it was to corrupt and pervert
the doctrine of the Law, but they were so called with regard to the people. It
is in the meantime necessary,<i> </i>wisely to distinguish between prophets or
teachers, as also the Apostle reminds us, we ought to inquire whether their
spirit is from God or not.

whether he had any just cause for doing so; but they took this principle as
granted, that wrong was done to God when anything was alleged against the
dignity of the Temple, and also that the city was sacred, and therefore nothing
could be said against it without derogating from many and peculiar promises of
God, since he had testified that it would be ever safe, because he dwelt in the

were, &#8220;I will make this city like Shiloh.&#8221; God seemed in appearance
to be inconsistent with himself, &#8220;This is my rest for ever,&#8221;
&#8220;this shall be a desert.&#8221; We hence see that the priests and the
prophets were not without some specious pretext for condemning Jeremiah. There
is therefore some weight in what they said, &#8220;Dost<i> </i>thou not make God
contrary to himself? for what thou denouncest in his name openly and directly
conflicts with his promises; but God is ever consistent with himself; thou art
therefore a cheat and a liar, and thus one of the false prophets, whom God
suffers not in his Church.&#8221; And yet what they boasted was wholly
frivolous; for God had not promised that the Temple should be perpetual in order
to give license to the people to indulge in all manner of wickedness. It was not
then God&#8217;s purpose to bind himself to ungodly men, that they might expose
his name to open reproach. It is hence evident that the prophets and priests
only dissembled, when they took as granted what ought to have been understood
conditionally, that is, if they worshipped him in sincerity as he had commanded.
For it was not right to separate two things which God had connected; he required
piety and obedience from the people, and he also promised that he would be the
guardian of the city, and that the Temple would be safe under his protection.
But the Jews, having neither faith nor repentance, boasted of what had been said
of the Temple, nay, they bragged, as we have seen elsewhere, and spoke false
things; and hence the Prophet derided them by repeating three
times,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Temple of
Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
7:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;This is your
silly talk, you ever cry boastingly, &#8216;The Temple of God;&#8217; but all
this will avail you nothing.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows, that

another part of the narrative, for he reminded the princes and the king&#8217;s
councillors that they were not without reason roused to go up to the
Temple.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE159</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the dispute had been between few, either Jeremiah
would have been slain, or in some way intercepted, or it might have been that
the princes would have circumvented the king and his councillors, and thus the
holy man would have been privately crushed. But here he introduced these words,
that the whole people were assembled against him. Hence it was that the report,
reached the king&#8217;s court; and so the princes and councillors were
commanded to come. In short, Jeremiah shews the reason why the princes came unto
the Temple; it was because the city was everywhere in a commotion, when the
report spread that something new and intolerable had been announced. The king
therefore could not neglect this commotion; for it is a dangerous thing to allow
a popular tumult to prevail. And therefore Jeremiah thus adds, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">We have said that the princes were roused by a
popular clamor; nor is there a doubt but; that the king had sent them to quell
the commotion. It must be especially noticed, that they were engaged in other
matters, as it was seldom the case that courtiers spent their time in hearing
the prophets. It is indeed true, that the occupations of those are sacred, who
have the care of the commonwealth, who dispense justice, and who have to provide
for the public safety; but it behoves them so to divide their time, that they
may be able to consecrate some portion of it to God. But courtiers think
themselves exempted by a sort of privilege, when yet the truth is more necessary
for them than even for the common people; for not only the duty of the head of a
family lies on each of them, but the Lord has also set them over a whole people.
If, then, private men have need of being daily taught, that they may faithfully
rule and guide themselves and their families, what ought to be done by those
rulers who are as it were the fathers of the commonwealth? But as I have already
said, such men usually exempt themselves from the yoke of the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence then it was, that none of the princes were
present, when Jeremiah had been commanded to proclaim his message, not only on
the day when few came to the Temple, but when they came from all the cities of
Judah to sacrifice at Jerusalem. It was, indeed, a very shameful sign of gross
contempt, that no one of the king&#8217;s counsellors appeared in the Temple,
when there were present, from remote places, those whom religion and the desire
to sacrifice had brought there. But he says that they came to know the cause of
the commotion; for it is said, that they

gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which some say was eastward; and
they conjecture that it was called new, because it had been renewed; the
king&#8217;s palace was also towards the east, and the eastern gate was his
tribunal. I am disposed to embrace this opinion, that they sat at the eastern
gate.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE160</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino">We hence conclude, that the people in assenting to
the sentence of the priests and prophets, had done nothing according to their
own judgment, but that all of every rank through a violent feeling condemned
Jeremiah. And as the priests and prophets directed also their discourse to the
people, it appears clear, that they were guided by them, so that they
thoughtlessly and inconsiderately gave their consent; for it often happens in a
mob that the people exclaim, &#8220;Be<i> </i>it so, be it so; amen,
amen.&#8221; Jeremiah has indeed said, that he was condemned by the whole
people; but it must be observed, that the people are like the sea, which of
itself is calm and tranquil; but as soon as any wind arises, there is a great
commotion, and waves dash one against another; so also it is with the people,
who without being excit<i>ed </i>are quiet and peaceable; but a sedition is
easily raised, when any one stirs up men who are thoughtless and changeable, and
who, to retain the same simile, are fluid like water. This, then, is what
Jeremiah now intimates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is another thing to be noticed, &#8212;
that the common people suffer themselves to be drawn in all directions; but they
may also be easily restored, as it has been said, to a right mind. &#8220;When
they see,&#8221; says Virgil, &#8220;a man remarkable for piety and good works,
they become silent and attend with listening ears.&#8221; He there describes
(Aeneid, 1) a popular commotion, which he compares to a tempest; and he rightly
speaks of a tempest; but he added this simile according to common usage. The
same thing is now set before us by the Prophet; the priests and prophets, who
thought that they alone could boast of their power and speak with authority, in
a manner constrained the people apparently to consent. The king&#8217;s
counsellors being now present, the people became as it were mute; the priests
perceived this, and we shall see by the issue that what the same poet mentions
took place, &#8220;By<i> </i>his words he rules their hearts and softens their
breasts.&#8221; For it became easy for the king&#8217;s counsellors even by a
word to calm this foolish violence of the people. We shall indeed soon see, that
they unhesitantly said, &#8220;There<i> </i>is no judgment of death against this
man.&#8221; It is hence evident how easily ignorant men may be made inconsistent
with themselves; but this is to be ascribed to their inconstancy; and noticed
also ought to be what I have said, that there was no real consent, because there
was no judgment exercised. The authority of the priests overpowered them; and
then they servilely confessed what they saw pleased their princes, like an ass,
who nods with his ears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when the subject is duly considered, it appears,
that the priests and the prophets alone spoke both to the princes and to the
whole people, that Jeremiah was guilty of
death,</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE161</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because he had prophesied against the city. We have said that they relied on
those promises, which they absurdly applied for the purpose of confirming their
own impiety, even that God had chosen that city that he might be there
worshipped. It was a false principle, and whence proceeded their error? not from
mere ignorance, but rather from presumption, for hypocrites are never deceived,
except when they determine not to obey God, and as far as they can to reject his
judgments. When, therefore, they are carried away by a perverse and wicked
impulse, they ever find out some plausible pretext; but it is nothing but a
disguise, as we clearly see from this narrative. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah pleads only his own calling and the command
of God; and thus he confutes the preposterous charge which they most impudently
brought against him. There is no doubt but that he might have spoken at large,
but he deemed it enough to include the substance of his defense. Had he made a
long discourse, the main point might have been more obscure. He now clearly
makes known the state of the question on both sides. The priests by their own
authority condemned Jeremiah, because he reduced to nothing [as they thought]
God&#8217;s promises, for he had threatened destruction to the city and to the
temple; but Jeremiah on the other side answers, that he had declared nothing but
what God had enjoined. There was need of proof, when the priests held that God
was inconsistent with himself in denouncing destruction on that city, which he
had undertaken to defend and protect. But the confutation of this was ready at
hand, &#8212; that God had never bound himself to hypocrites and ungodly men;
nay, the whole glory of the city and the majesty of the Temple were dependent on
his worship; nor is there any doubt but that Jeremiah had alleged these things.
But as it was the main thing, he was satisfied with stating that he had been
sent by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus he indirectly condemned their vain boastings,
&#8212; that God was on their side; but he says, &#8220;I come not except by
God&#8217;s command.&#8221; Now, though he declares briefly and distinctly that
he had been sent by God, he yet presents himself as ready to prove everything;
and as I have already said, there is no doubt but that he answered and discussed
that frivolous question on which the priests so much insisted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is further worthy of being noticed, that he
addressed both the princes and the people; and thus he intimated that the
priests and the prophets were deaf, and not worthy of being spoken to; for it
was their determination proudly to despise God, and to carry on war, as it were
avowedly, with his servants; for he would have otherwise no doubt gladly
endeavored to restore them to the way of safety. But as he saw that they had
closed the door against themselves, he passed them by. This is the reason why he
says, that he spoke to the princes and to the people, having passed by those, on
whom he must have spent labor in vain. And surely when they said that he was
worthy of death, they proved by such a presumption that they would not be taught
by him; and also their cruelty prevented them from being teachable. But the
Prophet had regard to the very source of evil, because their object was
obstinately to resist God and all his prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying, that he was sent to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesy
</i></font><font face="Palatino">all that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he made them judges, though he did not address them together with the
princes; for we have seen that the latter were in the king&#8217;s palace, and
had been sent for when there was a fear of some commotion. But there is no doubt
but that the address was repeated again. Jeremiah then made them judges and
arbitrators, when he said that he retracted nothing, but that what they had
heard, he had faithfully declared according to the command of God. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">He not only confirms here what he had taught, but
also reproves the hardness and obstinate wickedness of the priests and prophets;
for though he addressed the princes and the people, he yet no doubt designed to
touch more sharply those ungodly men who set themselves up against God; and at
the same time his discourse referred to them all, when he said, &#8220;How<i>
</i>have I sinned? I have endeavored to promote your safety, must I therefore
die?&#8221;<i> </i>We hence see that the Prophet not only confirmed what he had
said, but also accused his adversaries of ingratitude; for nothing could have
been more kind, and ought to have been more acceptable, than to be called to
repent, that they might receive mercy from God: &#8220;What<i> </i>was the
object of my doctrine? even that ye might repent; and what does repentance
bring? even salvation; for God is ready to forgive you. Now ye cannot bear to
hear, that God would be merciful to you. What madness is this?&#8221;<i> </i>We
now then see the design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage deserves to be noticed; for God will
render to all the ungodly their own reward; not only because they harden
themselves against every instruction, but also because they are manifest and, as
it were, sworn enemies to their own salvation, inasmuch as they refuse the
necessary remedy, and do not allow themselves to be restored to the right way,
that they may be forgiven. Very weighty, then, is what he now says, that no
fault could be found in his doctrine, except that it proved galling to the
wicked, but that they could yet obtain peace, provided they sought
reconciliation with God.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

priests, and the whole people to repent, and having shewn to them that there was
a remedy for their evil, except by their obstinacy they provoked more and more
the wrath of God, now speaks of himself, and warns them not to indulge their
cruelty by following their determination to kill him; for they had brought in a
sentence that he deserved to die. He then saw that their rage was so violent,
that he almost despaired of his life; but he declares here that God would be an
avenger if they unjustly vented their rage against him. He yet shews that he was
not so solicitous about his life as to neglect his duty, for he surrendered
himself to their will; &#8220;Do what ye please,&#8221; he says, &#8220;with me;
yet see what ye do; for the Lord will not suffer innocent blood to be shed with
impunity.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>care
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God. Christ also spoke thus when he exhorted
his disciples not to fear those who could kill the body.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401028&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:28.) There is no doubt but that the hairs of our head are numbered before
God; thus it cannot be that tyrants, however they may rage, can touch us, no,
not with their little finger, except a permission be given them. It is, then,
certain that our life can never be in the hand of men, for God is its faithful
keeper; but Jeremiah said, after a human manner, that his life was in their
hand; for God&#8217;s providence is hidden from us, nor can we discover it but
by the eyes of faith. When, therefore, enemies seem to rule so that there is no
escape, the Scripture says, by way of concession, that we are in their hands,
that is, as far as we perceive. We ought yet to understand that we are by no
means so exposed to the will of the wicked that they can do what they please
with us; for God restrains them by a hidden bridle, and rules their hands and
their hearts. This truth ought ever to remain unalterable, that our life is
under the custody and protection of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see in what sense Jeremiah regarded his
life as in the hand of his enemies, not that he thought himself cast away by<i>
</i>God, but that he acknowledged that loosened reins were given to the wicked
to rage against him. But we must at the same time bear in mind why he said this;
after having conceded<i> </i>that his life was in their hand, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet knowing know ye, that if ye
kill me, ye will bring innocent blood upon
yourselves.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But he had said before that they
might </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do what seemed them good
and
right</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Good and right here is not to be
taken for a judgment formed according to the rule of justice, but for a sentence
formed iniquitously according to their own will. This is a common mode of
speaking in Hebrew. Jeremiah then testifies that he was not solicitous about his
life, for he was prepared to offer himself, as it were, as a sacrifice, if the
rage of his enemies should go so far. But in warning them to beware of
God&#8217;s vengeance, his object was not his own safety, but it was to
stimulate them to repentance. He then plainly says that he did not fear death,
for the Lord would presently shew himself to be his avenger, and that his blood
also would be so precious in the sight of God, that the whole city, together
with the people, would be punished, were they to deal unjustly with
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us attend to what follows, even that God had
<i>sent </i>him. He now takes this principle as granted, that it could not be
that God would forsake his servants, to whom he has promised aid when oppressed
by the ungodly. God, indeed, ever exhorts his ministers to patience, and he
would have them to be prepared for death whenever there is need; yet he promises
to bring them help in distress. Jeremiah then relied on this promise, and was
thus persuaded that it could not be that God would forsake him; for he cannot
disappoint his people, nor forfeit his faith pledged to them. As, then, he was
fully persuaded of his own calling, and knew that God was the author of all his
preaching, he boldly concluded that his blood could not be shed with impunity.

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah shews here that the sentence pronounced on
him by the priests and false prophets was soon changed. They had indeed heard
him, and had given some appearance of docility, as it is the case with
hypocrites who for a time attend; but they exasperated themselves against God,
and as their minds were previously malignant, they were rendered much worse by
hearing. So it happened to the priests and false prophets, and in their blind
rage they doomed the holy Prophet to death. He now says that he was acquitted by
the princes and the king&#8217;s counsellors, and also by the votes of the
people. The people had, indeed, lately condemned him, but they had been carried
away by the vain pomp and splendor of the priests and prophets; when they saw
these so incensed against Jeremiah, they could not bring themselves to inquire
into the cause. Thus the common people are always blinded by prejudices, so that
they will not examine the matter itself. So it was when Jeremiah was condemned.
We have said that the people were of themselves quiet and peaceable; but the
prophets and priests were the farmers, and hence it was that the people
immediately gave their consent. But in the presence of the princes they went in
a contrary direction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, in short, teaches us how mischievous
are rulers when there is no regard had for equity or justice; and it also
teaches us how desirable it is to have honest and temperate rulers, who defend
what is good and just, and aid the miserable and the oppressed. But we see that
there is nothing steady or fixed in the common people; for they are carried here
and there like the wind, which blows now from this quarter and then from
that.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice this clause, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jeremiah was not worthy of

that whatever came from God ought to have been received, and that men were mad
who opposed the servants of God, for they<i> </i>hurried themselves headlong
into their own destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence deduce a useful truth, that whatever God
has commanded ought, without exception, to be reverently received, and that his
name is worthy of such a regard, that we ought to attempt nothing against his
servants and prophets. Now, to speak in the name of Jehovah is no other thing
than faithfully to declare what God has commanded. The false prophets, indeed,
assumed the name of God, but they did so falsely; but the people acknowledge
here that Jeremiah was a true prophet, who did not presumptuously thrust in
himself, nor falsely pretended God&#8217;s name, but who in sincerity performed
the duties of his office. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain whether what is here recited was
spoken before the acquittal of Jeremiah or not; for the Scripture does not
always exactly preserve order in narrating things. It is yet probable, that
while they were still deliberating and the minds of the people were not
sufficiently pacified, the elders interposed, in order to calm the multitude and
to soften their irritated minds, and to reconcile those to Jeremiah who had
previously become foolishly incensed against him; for no doubt the priests and
the false prophets had endeavored by every artifice to irritate the silly people
against the Prophet; and hence more than one kind of remedy was necessary. When
therefore the elders saw that wrath was still burning in the people, and that
their minds were not disposed to shew kindness, they made use of this discourse.
They took their argument from example, &#8212; that Jeremiah was not the first
witness and herald of dreadful vengeance, for God had before that time, and in
time past, been wont to speak by his other prophets against the city and the
temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The priests and the prophets had indeed charged
Jeremiah with novelty, and further pretended that they thus fiercely opposed him
on the ground of common justice. Jeremiah had said, that God would spare neither
the holy city nor the Temple. This was intolerable, for it had been said of the
Temple,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;This is my rest
for ever; here will I
dwell.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that Jeremiah was overwhelmed as it were
by this one expression, while the priests and the false prophets objected and
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou<i> </i>then
makest void God&#8217;s promises; thou regardest as nothing the sanctity of the
Temple.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And they further pretended that not one of the
prophets had ever thus spoken. But what do the elders now answer? even that
there had been other prophets who had denounced ruin on the city and the Temple,
and that, was falsely charged with this disgrace, that he was the first to
announce God&#8217;s judgment. We now understand the state of the case: Jeremiah
is defended, because he had not alone threatened the city and the first, but he
had others as the originators, from whose mouths he had spoken, who were also
the acknowledged servants of God, from whom credit could not be<i>
</i>withholden, such as Micah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, what is here related is found in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
3:12. The Prophet Micah had the same contest with the priests and prophets as
Jeremiah had; for they said that it was impossible that God should pour his
vengeance on the holy city and the Temple. They said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Is not Jehovah in
the midst of us?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and they said also, &#8220;No evil shall come on
us.&#8221; They were inebriated with such a security, that they thought
themselves beyond the reach of danger; and they disregarded all the threatenings
of the prophets, because they imagined that God was bound to them. We indeed
know that hypocrites ever relied on that promise, &#8220;Here will I
dwell;&#8221; and they also took and borrowed words from God&#8217;s mouth and
perverted them like cheats: &#8220;God resides in the midst of us; therefore
nothing adverse can happen to us.&#8221;<i> </i>But the Prophet said, (the same
are the words which we have just repeated,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For you Sion shall
be plowed as a field,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE166</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"> and Jerusalem shall become
heaps, and the mountain of this house as the heights of a
forest.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us now consider each clause. It is first
said, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elders from the
people of the land rose
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that they were
called elders, not as in other places on account of their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>office</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but of their age. It is indeed certain that they were men of authority; but
yet<i> </i>I doubt not but that they were far advanced in years, as they were
able to relate to the people what had happened many years before. As it is
added, that they spoke to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
whole assembly of the people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we may
hence deduce what I have already stated, &#8212; that the people were so
violent, that there was need of a calm discourse to mitigate their ardor; and
certainly when once a commotion is raised and rages, it is not an easy matter
immediately to allay it. When, therefore, the kind elders saw that the minds of
the people were still exasperated, they employed a moderating language, and
said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Micah</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE168</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Morasthite
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(they named his country)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied in the days of
Hezekiah, king of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought to notice the time, for it might seem
strange, that when that holy king was anxiously engaged in promoting the true
worship of God, things were in so disordered a state as to call for so severe a
denunciation. If there ever was a king really and seriously devoted to the cause
of religion, doubtless he was the first and chief exemplar; he spared no labor,
he never seemed to shun any danger or trouble, whenever religion required this;
but we find that however strenuously he labored, he could not by his zeal and
perseverance succeed in making the whole people to follow him as their leader.
What then must happen, when those who ought to shew the right way to others are
indifferent and slothful? In the meantime the good princes were confirmed by the
example of Hezekiah, so that they did not faint or fail in their minds when they
saw that success did not immediately follow his labors, nor any fruit. For it is
a grievous trial, and what shakes even the most courageous, when they think that
their efforts are vain, that their labors are useless, yea, that they spend
their time to no purpose, and thus it happens that many retrograde. But this
example of Hezekiah ought to be remembered by them, so that they may still go
on, though no hope of a prosperous issue appears; for Hezekiah did not desist,
though Satan in various ways put many hinderances in the way, and even
apparently upset all his labors, so that they produced no fruit. So much as to
the time that is mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The elders said, that Micah had spoken to the whole
people, saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah, Sion, shall be plowed as a field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>We have already seen on what occasion it was that Micah spoke with so much
severity; it was when hypocrites set up their false confidence and falsely
assumed the name of God, as though they held him bound to themselves.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sion shall be plowed as a
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He began with the temple, and
then he added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and Jerusalem
shall be in heaps</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or a solitude; and
lastly, he said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the
mountain, of the house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, of the
temple, etc. He repeated what he had just said, for what else was the mountain
of the temple but Sion? But as this prediction could have hardly been believed
by the Jews, the Prophet, for the sake of confirmation, said the same thing
twice. We hence conclude that it was not a superfluous repetition, but that he
might shake with terror the hypocrites, who had hardened themselves against
God&#8217;s threatenings, and thought themselves safe, though the whole world
went to ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having now related what Micah had denounced, they
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Slaying, did Hezekiah the
king of Judah and all Judah slay him? </i></font><font face="Palatino">By the
example of the pious King Hezekiah, they exhorted the people to shew kindness
and docility, and shewed that it was an honor done both to God and to his
prophets, not to be incensed against his reproofs and threatenings, however
sharply they might have been goaded or however deeply they might have been
wounded. But they further added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Did he not fear Jehovah? and
supplicate the face of Jehovah? and did not Jehovah repent?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">They confirmed what Jeremiah had previously
said, that there was no other remedy but to submit themselves calmly to
prophetic instruction, and at the same time to flee to the mercy of God; for by
the fear of God here is meant true conversion; what else is God&#8217;s fear
than that reverence by which we shew that we are submissive to his will, because
he is a Father and a Sovereign? Whosoever, then, owns God as a Father and a
Sovereign, cannot do otherwise than to submit from the heart, to his good
pleasure. Therefore the elders meant that Hezekiah and the whole people really
turned to God. Now repentance, as it must be well known, contains two parts
&#8212; the sinner becomes displeased with himself on account of his vices
&#8212; and forsaking all the wicked lusts of the flesh, he desires to form his
whole life and his actions according to the rule of God&#8217;s
righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But they added, that they <i>supplicated, </i>etc.
Though Jeremiah uses the singular number, he yet includes both the people and
the king; he seems however to have used the singular number designedly, in order
to commend the king, whose piety was extraordinary and almost incomparable.
There is no doubt but that he pointed out the right way to others, that they
might repent, and also that he humbly deprecated that vengeance, which justly
filled their minds with terror. He, indeed, ascribed this especially to the
pious king; but the same concern is also to be extended to the chief men and the
whole body of the people, as we shall presently see;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did he not then supplicate the
face of Jehovah?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This second clause deserves special notice; for a
sinner will never return to God except he has the hope of pardon and salvation,
as we shall ever dread the presence of God, except the hope of reconciliation be
offered to us. Hence the Scripture, whenever it speaks of repentance, at the
same time adds faith. They are indeed things wholly distinct, and yet not
contrary, and ought never to be separated, as some inconsiderately do. For
repentance is a change of the whole life, and as it were a renovation; and faith
teaches the guilty to flee to the mercy of God. But still we must observe that
there is a difference between repentance and faith; and yet they so unite
together, that he who tears the one from the other, entirely loses both. This is
the order which the Prophet now follows in saying that Hezekiah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>supplicated the face of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For whence is the desire to
pray, except from faith? It is not then enough for one to feel hatred and
displeasure as to his sins, and to desire to be conformed to God&#8217;s will,
except he thinks of reconciliation and pardon. The elders then pointed out the
remedy, and shewed it as it were by the finger; for if the people after the
example of Hezekiah and of others repented, then they were to flee to
God&#8217;s mercy, and to testify their faith by praying God to be propitious to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows, that Jehovah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repented of the evil which he had
spoken against them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet now
makes use of the plural number; we hence conclude that under the name of King
Hezekiah alone he before included the whole people. God then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repented of the
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE169</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As to this mode of speaking, I
shall not now speak at large. We know that no change belongs to God; for whence
comes repentance, except from this, &#8212; that many things happen unexpectedly
which compel us to change our purpose? one had intended something; but he
thought that that would be which never came to pass; it is therefore necessary
for him to revoke what he had determined. Repentance then is the associate of
ignorance.<i> </i>Now, as nothing is hid from God, so it can never be that he
repents. How so? because he has never determined anything but according to his
certain foreknowledge, for all things are before his eyes. But this kind of
speaking, that God repents, that is, does not execute what he has announced,
refers to what appears to men. It is no wonder that God thus condescendingly
speaks to us; but, while this simplicity offends delicate and tender ears, we on
the contrary wonder at God&#8217;s indulgence in thus coming down to us, and
speaking according to the comprehension of our weak capacities. We now perceive
how God may be said to repent, even when he does not execute what he had
denounced. His purpose in the meantime remains fixed, and as James
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;There is in him no
shadow of turning.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">James
1:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question may again be raised, How did God then
repent of the evil which he had threatened both to the king and to the people?
even because he deferred his vengeance; for God did not abrogate his decree or
his proclamation, but spared Hezekiah and the people then living. Then the
deferring of God&#8217;s vengeance is called his repentance; for Hezekiah did
not experience what he had feared, inasmuch as he saw not the ruin of the city
nor the sad and dreadful event which Micah had predicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this also is to be noticed, &#8212; that the
pious king is here commended by the Holy Spirit, that he suffered himself to be
severely reproved, though, as I have already said, he was not himself guilty. He
had, indeed, a burning zeal, and was prepared to undergo any troubles in
promoting the true worship of God; and yet he calmly and quietly bore with the
Prophet, when he spoke of the destruction of the city and Temple, for he saw
that he had need of such a helper. For however wisely may pious princes exert
themselves in promoting the glory of God, yet Satan resists them. Hence they
ever desire, as a matter of no small importance, to have true and faithful
teachers to help, to assist and to strengthen them, and also to oppose their
adversaries; for if teachers are silent or dissemble, a greater ill-will is
entertained towards good princes and magistrates; for when with the drawn sword
they defend the glory of God and his worship, while the teachers themselves are
dumb dogs, all will cry out, &#8220;Oh! what does this severity mean? Our
teachers spare our ears, but these do not spare even our blood.&#8221; It is,
therefore, ever a desirable thing for good and pious kings to have bold and
earnest teachers, who cry<i> </i>aloud and confirm the efforts of their princes.
Such was the feeling of pious Hezekiah, as we may conclude from this passage.
The rest I must defer.</font><br></div>

Hezekiah had done the same and was not put to death. They hence concluded that
it would be a heinous crime were they to slay Jeremiah, and that it would not
remain unpunished. They then intimated that the people would commit a most
grievous offense, if they killed Jeremiah; and they also added, that vengeance

<div><font face="Palatino">Another example is brought forward, partly different,
and partly alike, &#8212; different as to the king, the like as to a Prophet.
Uriah, mentioned here, faithfully discharged his office; but Jehoiakim could not
bear his preaching, and therefore slew him. Some explain the whole in the same
manner, as though the elders designed to shew that the wicked can gain nothing
by resisting God&#8217;s prophets, except that by contending they<i> </i>make
themselves more and more guilty. But others think that this part was brought
forward by the opposite party, and the words, &#8220;And also,&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;gw</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ugam, </i>favor this opinion; for they may be taken adversatively, as though
they said, &#8220;But<i> </i>there was another Prophet, who did not speak of the
ruin of the city and of the destruction of the Temple with impunity.&#8221; And
this opinion seems to be confirmed by what follows in the last verse of the
chapter, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the hand of Ahikam, etc.; the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ak, </i>is properly nevertheless; but it means sometimes, at least, or only.
But in this place, as I shall shew again presently, it retains, I think, its
proper meaning; for the Prophet declares, that though he was in great danger,
yet Ahikam fought so bravely for him, that at length he gained his
cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to the present passage, both expositions may
be admitted; that is, either that the malignants adduced the death of Uriah in
order to overwhelm Jeremiah, &#8212; or that God&#8217;s faithful followers
intended to shew that there was no reason of acting in this manner, for the
state of things had become worse, since King Jehoiakim had cruelly slain
God&#8217;s servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the time ought especially to be noticed. We have
seen that this prophecy was committed to Jeremiah, and also promulgated at the
beginning of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign; but this beginning is not to be confined
either to the first or second year; but as he became tributary to the king of
Babylon, he afterwards endeavored to throw off the yoke and was at length
disgracefully dethroned; hence the beginning of his reign must be during the
time that his power was entire. While then Jehoiakim retained his dignity,
Jeremiah was bidden to proclaim this message. However this may have been, the
King Jehoiakim thus enjoyed a tranquil reign; he was at Jerusalem. It is not
therefore said here, that Uriah had threatened the city in his days; but the
history is given as of a present thing. One thing then is evident, that this
discourse was delivered, when King Jehoiakim was not afar off. His palace was
nigh the Temple; his counsellors were present who had come down, as we have
seen, on account of the tumult. For the affair could not be hidden; since the
priests and the false prophets everywhere inflamed the rage of the people. The
king&#8217;s counsellors therefore came to quell the disturbances. If this part
of the address is to be ascribed to the defenders of Jeremiah, then they must
have been endued with great courage and firmness, to allege against the king a
nefarious murder, and also to condemn him for a sacrilege, for he had not only
done an injury to a holy Prophet, but had directly opposed God himself. There
are on both sides probable conjectures; for if we follow this opinion, that the
servants of God, who favored Jeremiah and sought to deliver him from danger,
spoke these words, it might be objected and said, that no such thing is
expressed But the narrative goes on continuously,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there was also a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Now when different persons
speak and oppose one another, it is usual to mark the change. It seems then that
the whole is to be read connectedly, so that they who first adduced the example
of Micah, then added on the other hand, that Uriah indeed suffered punishment,
but that thus a crime was added to a crime, so that Jehoiakim gained nothing by
furiously persecuting God&#8217;s Prophet. And that they did not speak of the
consequences, ought not to appear strange, for the condition of the city and of
the people was known to all, and a more grievous danger was nigh at hand. Hence
a simple narrative might well have been given by them; and as they did not dare
to exasperate the mind of the king, it was the more necessary to leave that part
untouched.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if the other view be more approved, that the
enemies of Jeremiah did here rise against him, and alleged the case of Uriah,
there is also some appearance of reason in its favor; the king was living, his
counsellors were present, as we have said. It might then be, that those who
wished the death of Jeremiah, referred to this recent example in order to have
him destroyed, &#8212; &#8220;Why should he escape, since Uriah was lately put
to death, for the cause is exactly the same? Uriah did not go any farther than
Jeremiah; he seems indeed to have taken the words from his mouth. As, then, the
king did slay him, why should Jeremiah be spared? Why should he escape the
punishment the other underwent, when his crime is more grievous?&#8221; It hence
appears that this view can without absurdity be defended, that is, that the
enemies of Jeremiah endeavored to aggravate his case by referring to the
punishment the king inflicted on Uriah, whose case was not dissimilar; and I do
not reject this view. If any approve of the other, that this part was spoken by
the advocates of Jeremiah, I readily allow it; but I dare not yet reject wholly
the idea, that Jeremiah was loaded with prejudice by having the case of Uriah
brought forward, who was killed by the king for having prophesied against the
city and the Temple.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE170</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now consider the words;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was also a man who
prophesied in the name of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.
If we receive the opinion of those who think that Jeremiah&#8217;s enemies speak
here, then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the name of Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is to be taken for a false pretense, as though
they had said, &#8220;It is a very common thing to pretend the name of God; for
every one who claims to himself the office of teaching, boasts that he is sent
from above, and that what he speaks has been committed to him by God.&#8221;
Thus they indirectly condemned Jeremiah; for it was not enough for him to
pretend God&#8217;s name, as Uriah, of whom they spoke, had also professed most
loudly that he was God&#8217;s prophet, that he brought nothing as his own, and
that he had a sure call. But if this part is to be ascribed to God&#8217;s true
worshippers, whose object it was to protect and defend Jeremiah, to speak in the
name of Jehovah, as we said yesterday, was not only to glory on account of the
prophetic office, but also to give evidence of faithfulness and of integrity, so
as really and by the effect to prove that he was God&#8217;s prophet, such as he
wished to be thought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then added, he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied against this city and
against this land according to all the words of
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If the adversaries of Jeremiah
were the speakers, we see that he was so overpowered, that it was afterwards
superfluous to know anything more of his cause; for another had already been
condemned, whose case was in no way dissimilar or different; &#8220;He spoke
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the words of
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he was condemned, why then
should we now hesitate respecting Jeremiah?&#8221; We see how malignantly they
turned against Jeremiah this example, as though he was condemned beforehand in
the person of another. But if these were the words of the godly, they are to be
accounted for in another way; what is intimated is, that if Jeremiah was slain,
God&#8217;s vengeance would be provoked; for it was more than enough to shed the
innocent blood of one Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when, Jehoiakim the king, and
all his mighty men and the princes, heard his
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. This verse seems to favor
the opinion of those who conclude that godly men were the speakers; for they
spoke dishonorably of the king and his counsellors; the king heard and his
mighty men, (powerful men, literally,) and also all the princes; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king sought to slay
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These words, however, may also be
ascribed to the ungodly and the wicked, for they wished to terrify the common
people by first mentioning the king and then the mighty men and the princes. And
to seek to kill him, might also have been excused, even that the king could not
bear such a reproach without revenging it; for he saw that the Prophet had taken
such a liberty as not, to spare the holy city nor the Temple:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard, and his mighty men and
princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king sought to slay
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when Uriah heard it, he feared
and fled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage teaches us that
even the faithful servants of God, who strive honestly to fulfill their office,
are yet not always so courageous as boldly to despise all dangers; for it is
said that the Prophet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>but he was not on this account condemned. This fear was not indeed
blameless; but his fear was such, that he yet continued in his vocation. He
might indeed have pleased the king, but he dreaded such perfidy more than death.
He, therefore, so feared, that he turned not aside from the right course, nor
denied the truth., nor admitted anything unworthy of his dignity or of the
character he sustained. His fear then, though wrong, did not yet so possess the
Prophet, but that he was ever faithful to God in his vocation. It then follows,
that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went into
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We hence conclude, that the
king&#8217;s wrath and cruelty were so great, that the holy man could not find a
corner to hide himself in through the whole land of Judea, nor even in other
regions around. He was therefore forced to seek a hiding place in
Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards added that the king
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elnathan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the chief of the legation, with others.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is no doubt but that Jehoiakim
sent to the king of Egypt and complained that a turbulent man had fled, and that
he asked him to deliver him up as a fugitive. So then he was brought back, not
through power, but through a nefarious compact, for he was betrayed by the king
of Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is at length added, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>led up Uriah from Egypt, and
brought him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead
body into the graves of the common people, </i></font><font face="Palatino">by
way of dishonor; for Jeremiah here calls them the graves of the common people,
as we in French call shambles <i>des charniers. </i>The rich are honorably and
splendidly buried at this day, and every one has his own grave; but when there
is a vast number, the bodies are thrown together, for it would be too expensive
to dig a grave for each. It seems also that there was such a practice in Judea,
and that God&#8217;s Prophet was buried in this ignominious
manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus they who spoke intimated that the king&#8217;s
wrath so burned, that he not only put him to death, but followed up his
vengeance, so that a new disgrace awaited the Prophet, even when dead, for he
was cast among the obscure and ignoble common people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have hitherto so explained this passage as to leave
it doubtful whether the probability is that the speakers were Jeremiah&#8217;s
enemies or his advocates. And though, as I have declared twice or three times, I
reject not the view which is different from that which I embrace, yet it seems
most probable to me that the words were spoken by the godly men who defended the
cause of Jeremiah. All the various reasons which lead me to this conclusion I
will not here specify; for every one may himself see why I prefer this view. The
common consent of almost all interpreters also influences me, from which I wish
not to depart, except necessity compels me, or the thing itself makes it evident
that they were mistaken. But we have seen from the beginning, that the two
examples consecutively follow one another, and that nothing intervenes; it may
hence be supposed, that the enemies of Jeremiah had previously performed their
part. The words themselves then shew that those who commenced the discourse were
those who carried it on. And that they did not mention the reason why they
adduced this example is not to be wondered at; for the displeasure of the king
was feared, and he had given no common proof, in his treatment of the holy
Prophet, how impatiently he bore anything that trenched on his own dignity. They
therefore cautiously related the matter, and left what they did not express to
be collected by those who heard them. But it was easy from their words to know
what they meant, &#8212; that God&#8217;s vengeance was to be dreaded; for one
Prophet had been slain; what if there was to be no end to cruelty? would not God
at length arise to execute judgment when his servants were so unworthily
treated? As, then, the words are not completed, it seems probable to me that
God&#8217;s true servants spoke thus reservedly and cautiously, because they
dared not to express their thoughts openly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Further, these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king sought to slay
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king sent
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc., are more suitable when
considered as spoken by the defenders of Jeremiah than by the ungodly and the
wicked; and they also named Elnathan, that they might hand down his name with
infamy to future ages. And they lastly added that the Prophet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was brought up from
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> What was very<i> </i>shameful
seems certainly to be set here before us, that he was forcibly brought back<i>
</i>from that land to which he had fled for an asylum, and also that he was
brought to the king, that he smote him with the sword, that is, cruelly killed
him; and further, that being not satisfied with this barbarous act, he caused
him to be ignominiously buried. All these particulars, as I have said, seem to
shew that these words may be more suitably applied to the holy men who defended
the cause of Jeremiah than to his enemies. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">There is here an adversative particle, and not
without reason; for the contention is pointed out which had so raged that it
became difficult to extricate the holy Prophet from danger. We hence conclude
that Jeremiah was in so much peril that it was with great and arduous effort
that Ahikam saved him. There is a frequent mention of this man in sacred
history, and his name will hereafter be found in several places, and he was left
to govern the remnant of the people after the demolition of the city.

what is honorable to him. It was indeed an extraordinary act of courage that he
dared to oppose the fury of the whole people, and to check the priests and the
false prophets who had conspired to put the holy man to death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why it is in the last place added,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of Ahikam was with
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>though the people were
furious, and the priests would by no means be restrained from persecuting the
holy man, yet Ahikam could not be turned from his holy purpose, but persevered
to defend a good cause until Jeremiah escaped in safety. It is hence said, that
his </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand was with
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for by hand in Scripture is
meant effort, <i>(conatus;) </i>for where there is anything to be done, or any
difficulty, the Scripture uses the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But as Ahikam exerted himself to the uttermost, not only in aiding the holy
Prophet by his words, but also in repressing the fury of the people, and in
boldly resisting the priests and the false prophets, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand

<div><font face="Palatino">It hence<i> </i>also appears, as we said yesterday,
that the tumult of the people was not immediately allayed, for the false
prophets and the priests had so roused their virulence that they became almost
implacable. Here, then, is set before us an example of courage and perseverance;
for it is not enough for us to defend a good cause when we may do so with
safety, except we also disregard all ill-will and despise all dangers, and
resist the fury of the wicked, and undergo contentions and dangers for
God&#8217;s servants whenever necessary. We are also taught at the same time how
much weight belongs to the influence of one man when he boldly defends a good
cause and yields not to the madness of the wicked, but risks extremities rather
than betray the truth of God and his ministers. Now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah prefaces this prediction by saying, that it
was delivered to him at the beginning of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign. But this
beginning, as we have said, extended to the whole of his reign while it was
prosperous and entire. While, then, Jehoiakim enjoyed a quiet possession of the
kingdom, Jeremiah was bidden to make known what had been committed to him, not
to Jehoiakim himself, but, as we learn from the third verse, to Zedekiah who had
not immediately succeeded him, but became at last king after various changes.
God, then, committed this prophecy to his servant, but did not design it to be
immediately promulgated. If it be asked, why God designed what he purposed to be
made known to be concealed for so long a time? the answer is this, &#8212; that
it was done for the sake of the Prophet himself, in order that he might with
more alacrity perform his office, knowing of a certainty that no one thought
that it could ever happen, and certainly the thing was
incredible.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE173</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God&#8217;s design then was to communicate this to
his Prophet himself, that he might see afar off what no one, as I have just
said, had thought could ever come to pass. This is the reason, as I think, why
this prophecy was not immediately published, but was like a treasure deposited
in the Prophet&#8217;s bosom, until the ripened time came. I shall defer till
tomorrow the explanation of this prophecy.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that when at any
time thou grievously threatenest us, we may not, on that account, become angry,
but learn to acknowledge our sins, and truly to humble ourselves under thy
mighty hand, and also to deprecate thy wrath, and to prove by true repentance,
that we profit by thy word, and believe thy denunciations, so that we may become
partakers of that mercy, through which thou promisest to be propitious to all
who turn to thee: and may we thus advance more and more, and persevere in the
right course of repentance, until having at length put off all the vices of the
flesh, we shall attain to a perfection of righteousness and the fruition of that
glory which has been laid up for us in heaven by Jesus Christ our Lord. &#8212;

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND THIRD</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We explained yesterday why this command was given to
Jeremiah at the beginning of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign, which was not yet to be
executed until the time of Zedekiah: it was God&#8217;s design to strengthen him
in the meantime, lest he should faint in his course. Let us now see what was the
object of this prophecy and what is its meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems to have addressed the ambassadors
who were sent by neighboring kings to King Zedekiah; and he was bidden to
command them to declare each to his master, that they were all to come under the
yoke of the king of Babylon. There is, moreover, no doubt but that God designed
especially and chiefly to give a lesson to Zedekiah and to the Jews; for these
legations mentioned here might have so emboldened them as to despise all
prophecies, and to think themselves beyond all danger. For the purpose for which
these legations were sent by the king of Sidon, by the king of Tyrus, by the
king of Moab and Ammon, ought to be particularly observed: when they saw that
the king of Babylon would not spare them, they began to join their forces. Every
one at first consulted his own advantage, and saw no need of mutual help; and so
it was that the Chaldeans easily overcame them while they were disunited.
Experience at length taught them, that neither the king of Judah nor ally of the
neighboring kings could sustain the contest unless they formed a confederacy.<i>
</i>Thus, then, it happened that the king of Tyrus, the king of Sidon, the king
of Moab, and the king of Ammon, offered their forces and their money to the king
of Judah, and that he also promised to help them in return, if the Chaldean
attacked them. It was therefore a new occasion for confidence to the Jews, so
that they gathered courage, and thus were emboldened to resist, relying on so
many neighboring kings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Chaldeans had been hitherto successful, for they
had assailed each by himself; but when all of them were ready by their united
forces to oppose and restrain their attacks, it was hardly credible that they
could be conquered. It was therefore God&#8217;s purpose to remove this false
confidence, and to warn Zedekiah and the whole people, lest they should be
deceived by such allurements, but that they might know that they were patiently
to endure the punishment inflicted on them by God. This therefore was the reason
why the Prophet was sent to the ambassadors who had come to Jerusalem. He was
not set a teacher over them; but this was done with reference to Zedekiah and
the people. It is yet probable that these commands were set forth before the
king,<i> </i>that the king might know<i> </i>that he had been wholly deceived,
and that he still foolishly trusted to the subsidies which had been
offered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may easily imagine how grievous it must have been
to the king and to the people to hear this prophecy. The ambassadors were in a
manner dishonored; the kings, by whom they had been sent, might have complained
that they were treated with great indignity. Hence the king and the people must
have been very incensed against Jeremiah. But the Prophet boldly performed what
God commanded him, as it behoved him. And we shall hereafter see, that his words
were addressed to King Zedekiah rather than to these heathens.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the reason why God would have his
Prophet to give these commands to the ambassadors, who had been sent by heathen
kings to King Zedekiah: it was that the king might know that it was wholly
useless for these kings to promise their assistance; for he had to do, not with
the Chaldean king, but rather with the judgment of God, which is irresistible,
and which men in vain struggle with.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though the Prophet was bidden to command the
ambassadors to say to the kings by whom they had been sent,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE174</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they yet might have refused to
do so, and that with indignation: &#8220;What! Are we come here to be
ambassadors to thee? and who indeed art thou who commandest us? besides, dost
thou think that we are so mad as to threaten for thy sake, our kings and
masters, and to declare to them what thou biddest, that they are shortly to
become the servants of the Chaldean king?&#8221; The ambassadors then might have
thus treated the holy Prophet with derision and laughter: but, as we have said,
the whole was done for the sake of Zedekiah and the people, in order that the
Prophet might dissipate that vain splendor and pomp, by which he saw that
Zedekiah and all the Jews were deceived; for they thought that they had as it
were high and large mountains to be set in opposition to the Chaldean king and
his army: &#8220;On what part can they assail us, since the king of Tyrus is on
our side, and also the king of Sidon, the king of Moab, and the king of Ammon?
these rule widely, and their cities are impregnable.&#8221; Thus, then, the Jews
were convinced that they would be exempt from every trouble and molestation; but
in order that they might not deceive themselves with that vain display, Jeremiah
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Declare, ye
ambassadors, to your masters what God has spoken, even that ye must submit to
the yoke of the king of Babylon.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And a visible symbol was added in order to confirm
the prediction: the Prophet was bidden to put a yoke on his neck, or yokes, for
he speaks in the plural number.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fwm</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>muth, </i>means a pole, a yoke, a transverse piece of wood: and no doubt he
applied some pieces of wood to his neck, like the yoke laid on oxen; and then he
tied this yoke or crossbar; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rsy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>isar, </i>means to bind or tie, and so
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twrswm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>musarut, </i>are bands;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rswm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>musar, </i>also means sometimes a girdle; but here it is to be taken for
bands or ligaments. It was a sad spectacle to see on the neck of Jeremiah, when
he went forth, the symbol of the bondage of all kings and nations: he was as it
were in the place of all a captive before the time: but when God laid a yoke on
the Jews and on all other nations, Jeremiah was then a free man; for though he
bore this mark of bondage, he yet expected God&#8217;s judgment with a resigned
mind, while others disregarded it. But this confirmation rendered them more
inexcusable, as the case is, when God, to strengthen faith, adds sacraments or
other helps to his word, by which means he impresses us the more, for he thus
teaches not only our ears, but also our eyes and all our senses: when God thus
omits nothing that may tend to strengthen our faith in his word, a heavier
condemnation awaits us, if such signs avail not.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then perceive the reason why the Prophet applied
to his neck the symbol of future bondage: were there any teachable among the
people, to see such a sign with their eyes must have been useful to them. But as
the greater part had hardened themselves in their obstinacy, what ought to have
done them good, by humbling them in time before God, so as to anticipate his
judgment, had no other effect but to render their punishment more
grievous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follow these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have made the earth, the man
and the beast, which are on the face of the earth, by my great power, and by
mine extended arm.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE175</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The spectacle would have been
unmeaning and to no purpose, had Jeremiah only put the yoke on his neck, and
added no instruction; for we know that all signs are as it were dead, except
life is given them by the word. As then an image avails not much, so whatever
signs may be set before our eyes, they would be frivolous and without meaning,
were no doctrine added as the life. And hence also is condemned the madness of
the Papists, who amuse the minds of the people with many signs, while no
doctrine is conveyed. It therefore follows that they are mere figments, and
attended with no profit. God, then, has ever added to signs his doctrine, which
may therefore be truly compared to the soul, which gives life to the body, that
would otherwise be without motion or strength. On this account Jeremiah shews
what the yoke meant. He also speaks of the power and sovereign authority of God;
for kings, though they confess that God holds the government of the world,
cannot yet entertain the idea that they can be in a moment overwhelmed and cast
down from their dignity. For they seem to themselves to be fixed in their nests,
and so they promise to themselves a permanent condition, and imagine that they
are not subject to the common lot of mortals.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, kings are so inflated with pride, the Lord
used this preface, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made
the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and all living beings. He
speaks not of heaven, but mentions only that he made the earth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and man, and the animals which
are on the face of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by my great power and extended
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Why was this said, except that men
might be awakened on hearing that the earth continues not as it is, but as it is
sustained by God&#8217;s power by which it was once created? The same power
preserves men and animals; for nothing can remain safe except God exercises from
heaven his hidden power. This, then, was the reason why these words were
introduced. God set his own arm and power in opposition to the pride of those
who thought that they stood by their own power, and did not acknowledge that
they were dependent on the nod of God alone, who sustained them as long as he
pleased, and then overthrew and reduced them to nothing when it seemed good to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine, then, ought to be applied to
ourselves: for Jeremiah did not speak generally and indiscriminately of
God&#8217;s power, but accommodated to the subject in hand what he said of
God&#8217;s power, that men might, know that there is nothing fixed or permanent
in this world, but that God preserves men and animals, and yet in such a way,
that at any moment he can by a single breath reduce to nothing all those who
exist and all that they have. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God, after having claimed to himself the government
of the whole earth, and shewn that it is in his power to transfer kingdoms to
whom he pleases, now declares his decree &#8212; that he would subject to the
king of Babylon all the neighboring lands, even Tyrus and Sidon, the country of
Moab, the country of Ammon, the country of Edom, and even Judea itself. If
Jeremiah had begun by saying, that God had given to King Nebuchadnezzar these
lands, the prediction would not have been so easily received, for pride would
have been as it were an obstacle to bolt up their minds and hearts. But the
preface, as it has been stated, served to shew that they were not to think that
they could stand against the will of God. After having then brought down the
great height which seemed fixed in their hearts, he now declares that King
Nebuchadnezzar would be the lord over Judah as well as over all the countries
around, for God had set him over these lands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He extends also this subjection, of which he speaks,
over the very beasts, and not without reason; for he thus indirectly condemns
the hardness of men, if they resisted, as though he had said, &#8220;What<i>
</i>will it avail you to attempt with refractory hearts to shake off the yoke?
for the very beasts, tigers, wolves, lions, and every fierce and savage animal
in the land, even all these beasts shall know that the King Nebuchadnezzar is
their master, even by a hidden instinct. Since, then, these beasts shall obey
King Nebuchadnezzar, because he has been raised by God to that dignity, how
great must be the stupidity of men in not acknowledging what the very beasts
understand?&#8221; We hence see the design of mentioning the beasts; the Prophet
upbraided men with their madness, if they ferociously resisted the King
Nebuchadnezzar; for in that, case the beasts of the field were endued with more
intelligence than they. For whence is it that beasts have fear, except that God
has imprinted certain marks of dignity on kings, according to what is said by
Daniel.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270238&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:38.) As, then, the majesty of God appears in kings, the very beasts, though
void of reason and judgment, yet willingly obey through a hidden impulse of
nature. Hence inexcusable is the pride of men, if at least they do not imitate
the example of the very beasts.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE176</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nebuchadnezzar is afterwards called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the servant
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God, not that he was worthy of such an
honor, as it had never been his purpose to labor for God; but he was called a
servant, because God designed to employ him in his service, as those are called
in the Psalm the sons of God, to whom the word of God was addressed, that is, to
whom he gave authority to rule.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
82:6;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431035&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:35.) So also Nebuchadnezzar was God&#8217;s servant, because he was divinely
endued with sovereign power. This he did not know, nor was this said for his
sake, nor was he honored with such a name, as though God regarded him as one of
his own people; but this had a reference to the Jews and to all the other
nations, in order that they might be fully persuaded that they were obeying God
in humbling themselves and in undertaking the yoke of the king of Babylon, for
this pleased God. There is no power, says Paul, but from God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1,) and that sentence is derived from this principle, that all power is from
God; for he gives the power to rule and to govern to whom he pleases. Whosoever,
then, are endued with the power of the sword and public authority, are
God&#8217;s servants, though they exercise tyranny and be robbers. They are
servants, not with respect to themselves, but because God would have them to be
acknowledged as his ministers until their time shall come, according to what
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Serve him shall all nations, and
his son, and the son of his son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
greater part think that Nebuchadnezzar had only two successors of his own
posterity, Evil-merodach and Belshazar; others name five, and two of them
between Evil-merodach and Belshazar. Those who think that there were no more
than three, quote this testimony of the Prophet, for he names only the
king&#8217;s son and his grandson; but this would be no sufficient reason. I am,
however, disposed to follow what has been more commonly received, that
Belshazar, the last king of Babylon, who was slain by Cyrus, was the third from
Nebuchadnezzar.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE177</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is not the main thing; for the Prophet
speaks of the time of the Chaldean monarchy as well as of the king,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until the time of his land shall
come. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The time of the land was that determined
by heaven; for as to every one of us there is a limit fixed beyond which no one
can pass, so we ought to judge of kingdoms. As, then, the life of every
individual has its fixed limits, so God has determined with regard to the
empires of the whole earth; thus the life and death of every kingdom and nation
are in the hand and at the will of God. For this reason it is now said, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Chaldea would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and then it is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and of
the king himself.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE178</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This ought not to be confined to
Nebuchadnezzar himself; but as his grandson represented him, the time, though
not strictly, may yet be aptly said to have been that, when God had put an end
to him and to his power when Babylon was taken by the Medes and Persians. This
was, however, at the same time for the comfort of the godly; for it was not
God&#8217;s design to leave the faithful without some alleviation in their
trouble, lest grief should overpower them; when they found themselves oppressed
by the Chaldeans, and in a manner overwhelmed, doubtless despair might have
crept in, and hence murmurings and blasphemies might have followed. It was,
therefore, God&#8217;s purpose to mitigate in some measure their bitterness when
he added, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Nebuchadnezzar himself
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the time in which he was
to perish. When, therefore, the faithful saw him taking possession of all lands,
and dreaded by all nations, they were not to despond, but rather to extend their
thoughts to that time of which Jeremiah had predicted, that they might receive
some alleviation to their grief, and be enabled to bear with more resignation
the cross laid on them. In this expression, then, is included a promise; for the
hope of deliverance<i> </i>was set before them, when they understood that
reverses would soon happen to King Nebuchadnezzar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">After having promulgated his decree by the mouth of
Jeremiah, God now adds a threatening, in order that the Jews as well as others
might willingly, and with resigned and humble minds, undertake the yoke laid on
them. The Prophet, indeed, as we have said, had the Jews more especially in
view; but he extended, as it were by accident, his prediction to aliens. We
hence see why this denunciation of punishment was added. It ought, indeed, to
have been enough to say, that Nebuchadnezzar was God&#8217;s servant to subdue
Judea; but as it was a hard thing for the Jews to receive that enemy, nor could
they be induced to submit to him, it became necessary to add this threatening,
&#8220;See what ye do, for ye cannot be stronger than God.&#8221; This
threatening is indeed included in the former verse; but we know how tardy men
are to learn, especially when any false impression has preoccupied their minds.
As, then, the Jews refused the authority of Nebuchadnezzar, though the Prophet
had testified to them that he was God&#8217;s servant, they would not have
hesitated still to evade and to be refractory, had not their hardness and
obduracy been broken by this commination.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be, that the nation
and kingdom, which will not serve him, </i></font><font face="Palatino">even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar, and not put their
neck under his yoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it shall be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I shall visit that
nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. God speaks without
distinction of all nations; but the Jews<i> </i>ought to have reasoned from the
less to the greater; for if God would so severely punish the pride of the
Gentiles, in case they withdrew themselves from under the yoke of
Nebuchadnezzar, how much heavier and more dreadful vengeance ought the Jews to
have dreaded, who had been warned by the Prophet, and who doubtless knew that
this happened not to them by chance, but that it was God&#8217;s righteous
judgment, by which their sins were punished? Were they obstinately to attempt to
shake off the yoke from their neck, would not this have been to fight against
God? We now, then, perceive that the Prophet spoke thus indiscriminately of all
nations, that he might sharply rebuke the Jews; and he showed that their
ferocity would be inexcusable were they not willingly to humble
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By mentioning twice,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he seems to imply something
important; for they might have objected and said, &#8220;What<i> </i>have we to
do with a king so distant? and by what right does he now invade our countries?
why is he not content with his own burdens? why does he not abide in his own
city and in his own land?&#8221; And the name of Babylon was at the same time
hateful, for they had carried on war with many nations, and reduced the
Assyrians under their yoke, who were neighbors to the Jews, and the Assyrians
were also in a manner connected with them; and their name was no doubt abhorred
by the Jews, on account of the wars perpetually carried on by them. Hence God
meets here these objections, and shows that however odious Babylon might be to
the Jews, and that however remote Nebuchadnezzar might be from Judea, yet his
yoke was to be borne, as it had been so appointed by God. This seems to me to be
the reason why Jeremiah repeated the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also a denunciation of punishment, that God
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>visit with pestilence,
famine, and the sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We know that
these words are commonly mentioned in Scripture, when it is God&#8217;s purpose
to set forth the signs of his wrath. He has indeed various and innumerable ways
by which he chastises us; but these are his most remarkable and most known
scourges, the pestilence, the sword, and the famine. He then says, that he would
visit the nations who would not obey King Nebuchadnezzar with these three
scourges; and at the same time he shews what the end would be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until I
slay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or consume
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them by his
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He not only threatens them with
pestilence, famine, and the sword, but he also shows that the end would be such,
that the nations who might at first obstinately resist, would yet be constrained
to undertake the yoke, and to acknowledge Nebuchadnezzar as their king and
master. This is the reason why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by his
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Death might have seemed lighter, if only they could
have escaped the tyranny of Nebuchadnezzar; but since both would happen to them,
even to be consumed by famine, the sword, and the pestilence, and yet not to be
able to escape bondage, it was a miserable prospect indeed. We now then perceive
why God speaks of the hand of the King Nebuchadnezzar; it was, that the Jews
might know that they could effect nothing by seeking means to escape, for they
would at length, willing or unwilling, be brought under the hand and under the
yoke of this king.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As Jeremiah had declared to the king, as well as to
the citizens, that they could not escape the punishment that was at hand, he now
shakes off from them that vain confidence, which was as an obstacle in the way,
so that they were not touched by threatenings, nor received wholesome warnings.
For the false prophets deceived them by their flatteries, and promised that all
things would happen prosperously to them. As then the Prophet saw that the ears
both of the king and of the people were closed against him, so that he could do
little or nothing by exhorting and threatening them, he added what he deemed
necessary, even that all the things which the false prophets vainly said were
altogether fallacious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore said,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynn[</font><font face="Palatino">

<i>onnim, </i>who divined by the stars, and hence took counsel as to what was to
be done.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE180</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us now inquire, whether Jeremiah speaks of
such dreamers, and others as were among the Jews, or whether he includes also
such as were found among the neighboring nations. It seems probable to me, that
what he says ought to be confined to the Jews; for I take the word <i>ye, </i>as
emphatical, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>There follows afterwards an
explanation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to these
words have I spoken to the king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and
then he adds, that he spoke to the priests and to the people. Hence then we
conclude, that the whole of this part was probably addressed to the Jews alone.
Divinations,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">auguries, and incantations, were indeed prohibited in
the Law; but we well know how often the Jews gave up themselves to these tricks
of the devil, the Law of God being wholly despised by them. It is then no wonder
if at this time there were among them magicians, as well as augurs and diviners,
notwithstanding the manifest prohibition of the Law. We may, however, so
understand these words, as that the Prophet compared these false prophets to
diviners, as well as to augurs and sorcerers. He sets, in the first place, the
prophets, but in mentioning them, he seems to mark them with disgrace, because
they had departed from their own office, and had assumed another character, for
they deceived the people, as augurs, diviners, and magicians were wont to
deceive the nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed certain, as I have before reminded you,
that the Prophet spoke, not for the sake of other nations, but that the <i>Jews
</i>might be rendered inexcusable, or, if there was any hope of repentance, that
they might be reminded not to proceed in their usual course. We hence see the
meaning of the words, and at the same time perceive the design of the Prophet,
or rather of the Holy Spirit, who spoke by his mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I said at first that the Prophet met an objection,
which might have lessened or taken away the authority of his doctrine; for it
was not a small trial, that the prophets denied that any evil was at hand. For
the prophetic name was ever held in great repute and respect among the Jews. But
we see also at this day, and experience sufficiently teaches<i> </i>us, that men
are more ready to receive error and vanity, than to receive the word of God; and
so it was then, and the Jews imagined that they honored God, because they
regarded his Prophets. But when any one faithfully performed the prophetic
office, he was often despised. The Jews therefore were taken up only with a mere
name, and thought that they did all that was required by saying that they
attended to the prophets, while at the same time they boldly despised the true
servants of God. It is so at this day; while the name of the Catholic Church is
boasted of under the Papacy, it seems that a regard is had for God; but when the
word of God is brought forward, when what has been spoken by apostles and
prophets is adduced, it is regarded almost as nothing. We hence see that the
Papists separate God as it were from himself, as the Jews formerly
did.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence also we see how necessary it was for
Jeremiah to remove such a stumblingblock; for the Jews might have pertinaciously
insisted on this objection,<i> &#8212; </i>&#8220;Thou alone threatenest us with
exile; but we have many who glory in being prophets, and who promise safety to
us: wouldest thou have us to believe thee alone rather than these who are
many?&#8221;<i> </i>Thus the Prophet, being alone, had to contend with the false
prophets, who were many. And we have now a similar contest with the Papists; for
they boast, of their number; and then they object, that nothing would be
certain, if it was allowed to every one to appeal to the word of God. They hence
conclude that we ought simply to believe the Church, and to receive whatever is
brought under the pretense of being Scripture. But Jeremiah had confidence in
his own vocation, and had really proved his divine mission, and also that he
proclaimed the messages which he had received from the mouth of God. As then he
had given certain proofs of his vocation, he had a right to oppose all those
false prophets, and not only to disregard their lies, but also in a manner to
tread them under his feet, as he seems to have done,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He concedes to them an honorable name, but
improperly. It is therefore a catachristic way of speaking, when he names them
prophets; but he leaves them their title, as it was not necessary to contend
about words. Yet he shews at the same time that they were wholly unworthy of
being heard. Hence no authority was left them, though a mere empty name was
conceded to them. It is the same at this day, when we call those priests,
bishops, and presbyters, who cover themselves with these masks, and yet shew
that there is in them nothing episcopal, nothing ecclesiastical, and, in short,
nothing that belongs to the doctrine of Christ, or to any lawful
order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who say to yote, saying, Ye shall
not serve the king of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have
said that the last clause is rendered by some as an exhortation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Serve ye not the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though the false prophets
stimulated the Jews to shake off the yoke.: But the proper meaning of the verb
may be still retained, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall
not serve</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for we know that the false
prophets, when they came forth, pretended to be God&#8217;s ambassadors, sent to
promise tranquillity, peace, and prosperity to the Jews. Thus they reigned to
do, when yet God, as it has been stated, and as we shall again see presently,
had testified that there was no other remedy for the people but by submitting to
the king of Babylon. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse also confirms what I have said, &#8212;
that this discourse was designed for the Jews, and that it was peculiarly for
them; for what is said here could not be applied to heathen nations. What then
had been lately said of augurs, magicians, and diviners, ought no doubt to be
understood of those impostors who, under the name of prophets, deceived that
miserable people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Many, no doubt, adduced, for
the purpose of opposing him, their own evasions: &#8220;Art<i> </i>thou alone to
be believed? dost thou alone tell the truth? how dost thou prove that what thou
teachest is an oracle from heaven, and that these deceive us?&#8221; For so do
the ungodly usually clamor, as we see to be the case at this day with the
Papists, who cover themselves with a pretense of this kind: for whatever
abomination there may be, they cover it over by means of this sophistry alone
&#8212; that the Scripture is obscure, and that controversy is uncertain, and
that therefore nothing is to be believed but what the Church has decreed: so
with them the definition of men, as they say, is the only rule of faith; and
hence, also, the whole authority of Scripture is by them trodden under foot, as
though God had in vain spoken by his own prophets and apostles. There is no
doubt but the doctrine of Jeremiah was opposed by such clamors: he however
persevered in the course of his office, and boldly condemned the prophets, that
they only deceived the Jews by their lies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may remove you far from
your land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have said that this cannot
be applied to other nations: but God gave a hope of mercy to his people,
provided they willingly obeyed the king of Babylon. It was not indeed a full
pardon; yet it was owing to his kindness that God did not treat the Jews with
strict justice, but chastised them with gentleness and paternal moderation: for
it was an endurable punishment, to remain in their own country and to pay
tribute to the king of Babylon. God then would have mitigated the punishment of
the people, if only they had willingly undertaken the yoke., This is what
Jeremiah now says: &#8220;The false prophets seek only this, to drive you far
from your country; for they would have you to think that you shall be free from
all punishment: but God is prepared to deal gently with you; though he will not
wholly pass by your vices, yet your chastisement will be one easily borne, for
ye shall remain in your own country. But if ye will believe these impostors,
they will lead you away into distant exile; for God says, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will cast you away, and ye shall
perish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE181</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected again that the Jews could not form
a certain opinion, whether Jeremiah was to be believed rather than the others
who were many, the answer is at hand: they were themselves conscious of being
wicked, and there was no need of long debates to ascertain what was true; for
every one found God&#8217;s judgment to be against himself, as they had departed
from the pure worship of God, and had polluted themselves with many ungodly
superstitions, and a license in all kinds of sins had also prevailed among them:
they had been warned, not once, nor for one day, but by many prophets, and also
continually and for a long time. As then they had thus provoked God&#8217;s
vengeance by their obstinate wickedness, how could they be in doubt respecting
Jeremiah, whether he had, as from the mouth of God, and as a celestial herald
declared to them what they deserved? And surely whenever men pretend that they
have fallen through error or ignorance, they can always be deprived of this
evasion; for their own conscience convicts them, and is sufficient to condemn
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God adds, that the Jews would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>except they anticipated extreme judgment, that is, except they submitted to
paternal chastisement. This passage deserves to be specially noticed, as we
shall presently see again; for we are here taught that whenever God shews some
signs of displeasure, there is nothing better for us than to prepare ourselves
for patience; for we shall thus ever give place and a free passage to his mercy:
but by pertinacity we gain nothing, and do nothing but kindle his wrath more and
more. This then is what Jeremiah means when he declares, that they who submitted
not to the king of Babylon would perish. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He seems indeed to speak here indiscriminately of all
nations; but the admonition belongs to the Jews alone, as we have said, and as
it appears from the context. He seems however to mention the nations, that he
might more sharply touch the Jews, as though he had said, &#8220;Though<i>
</i>God&#8217;s promises are not to be extended to heathen nations, yet God will
spare the Tyrians and the Moabites, if they submit quietly to the king of
Babylon, and take upon them his yoke. If God will spare heathen nations, when
yet he has promised them nothing, what may his chosen people expect? But if he
will punish nations who err in darkness, what will become of a people who
knowingly and wilfully resist God and his judgments?&#8221; For obstinacy in the
Jews was mad impiety, as though they avowedly designed to carry on war with God;
for they knew that Nebuchadnezzar was the executioner of God&#8217;s vengeance.
When therefore they ferociously attempted to exempt themselves from his power,
it was to fight with God, as though they would not submit to his
scourges.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive why Jeremiah spoke what we here
read, not only of the Jews, but also generally of all nations,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The nation that brings its neck
under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serves him, I will leave it in its
own land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We must yet bear in mind what
I have before said, that the Jews were the people especially regarded. If, then,
they had given place to God&#8217;s kindness, he would have graciously spared
them, and they would have perpetually enjoyed their own inheritance; but it was
their obstinacy that drove them far into exile. And hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will leave it in its land; and
it shall cultivate it and dwell in
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a striking allusion in the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">db[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>obed, </i>for it means to serve, and also to cultivate; but there is to be
understood a contrast between cultivating the land and that subjection, to which
he exhorted the Jews, as though he had said,<i> &#8212; </i>&#8220;Serve the
king of Babylon, that the land may serve you; it will be the reward of your
obedience, if you will submit yourselves to the power of the king of Babylon,
that the land will submit, to you, and you will compel it to serve you, so that
it will bring forth food for you.&#8221; We hence see that God promised that the
land would serve the people, if they refused not to serve the king of
Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence also we may gather useful instruction,
&#8212; that all the elements would be serviceable to us, were we willingly to
obey<i> </i>God, but that on the contrary, the heaven, and the earth, and all
the elements will be opposed to us, if we pertinaciously resist God. But
Jeremiah speaks here more expressly of the submission which men render to God,
when they calmly receive his correction, and acknowledge, while he inflicts
punishment, that they justly deserve it, and do not refuse to be chastised by
his hand. When, therefore, men thus submit to God&#8217;s judgment, they obtain
his favor, so that the earth, and heaven, and all the elements will serve them.
But the more perversely men exalt themselves and raise their horns against God,
the more bondage shall they feel; for their own chains bind them stronger than
anything else, when they thus struggle with God and do not humble themselves
under his mighty hand. The same thing the Prophet still more clearly confirms
when he says, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse proves with sufficient clearness that what
we have hitherto explained was spoken especially to the chosen people; for
Jeremiah tells us here, that he spoke to the King Zedekiah, and in the sixteenth
verse he adds that he spoke to the priests and to the people. He was not then
sent as a teacher to the Moabites, the Tyrians, and other foreign nations; but
God had prescribed to him his limits, within which he was to keep. He therefore
says, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoke to the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn what he had before said, that he was
set over kingdoms and nations; for the doctrine taught by the prophets is higher
than all earthly elevations. Jeremiah was, indeed, one of the people, and did
not exempt himself from the authority of the king, nor did he pretend that he
was released from the laws, because he possessed that high dignity by which he
was superior to kings, as the Papal clergy do, who vauntingly boast of their
immunity, which is nothing else but a license to live in wickedness. The Prophet
then kept himself in his own rank like others; and yet when he had to exercise
his spiritual jurisdiction in God&#8217;s name, he spared not the king nor his
counsellors; for he knew that his doctrine was above all kings; the prophetic
office, then, is eminent above all the elevations of kings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And skilfully no less than wisely did the Prophet
exercise his office by first assailing the king, as he had been sent to him. At
the same time he addressed him in the plural number,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring ye your
neck</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says; and he did so, because
the greater part of the people depended on the will of their king. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Serve ye his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was, indeed, a thing very
unpleasant to be heard, when the Prophet commanded the Jews to submit, not only
to the king of Babylon, but also to all his subjects; it was an indignity that
must have greatly exasperated them. But he added this designedly, because he saw
that he had to do with men refractory and untamable. As, then, they were not
pliant, he dealt the more sharply with them, as though he wished to break down
their foolish pride. It was not therefore a superfluous expression, when he bade
the Jews to obey all the Chaldeans; for they had been so blinded by perverse
haughtiness, that for a long time they had resisted God and his prophets, and
continued untamable.</font><br></div>

mighty hand of God; for thus it happens, that evils are turned into medicines,
and thus become salutary to us. Whatever punishment is inflicted on us for our
sins, as it is a sign of God&#8217;s wrath, so in a manner it places death
before our eyes. Punishment, then, in itself can do nothing but fill us with
dread, nay, overwhelm us with despair; and I speak of punishment even the
slightest; for we suffer nothing which does not remind us of our sin and guilt,
as though God summoned us to his tribunal. How dreadful surely it must be to
sustain this, and to fall into the hands of the living God? Hence, when God
touches us as it were with his little finger, we cannot but fall down through
fear. But this comfort is given to us, that punishment, though in itself
grievous and as it were fatal, becomes profitable to us, when we allow God to be
our judge, and are prepared to endure whatever seems good to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what the Prophet means, when he promises that
the Jews would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>if they submitted to the king of Babylon; not that they could merit life by
their obedience; but the only way by which we can obtain God&#8217;s favor and
be reconciled to him, is willingly to condemn ourselves; for we anticipate
extreme judgment, as Paul says, when we condemn ourselves; and then we shall not
be condemned by God.

that they wish to be forgiven while in their sins? But this is to pull him down
from his throne, for he is not the judge of the world, if the ungodly escape
unpunished and laugh at all his threatenings. So also on the other hand, when in
true humility we suffer ourselves to be chastised by God, he becomes immediately
reconciled to us. This, then, is the life mentioned

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is a threatening added; for all means were used
not only to invite the Jews, but also to stimulate them to repent. The Prophet
offered them pardon, if they quietly submitted to be chastised by God. It was to
be their life, he said, when the Lord punished them according to his will. As
they could not be sufficiently moved by this kindness, he now adds, &#8220;See
ye to it, for except ye receive the life offered to you, you must inevitably
perish. Therefore thou, Zedekiah, wilt precipitate thyself with all thy people
into eternal destruction, if ye continue to be perverse and obstinate against

<div><font face="Palatino">We said yesterday,<i> </i>that as the Prophet saw
that there was great insensibility in the Jews, so that they disregarded all
God&#8217;s promises, he added terror to the hope of mercy. Hence he said,
&#8220;Ye<i> </i>shall perish, thou and thy people.&#8221; He was, no doubt,
constrained by necessity to speak in this severe way; for the kind exhortation
which he had used availed nothing; and yet God shewed at the same time by his
threatening how much he loved the people; for he had a sympathy for them, and as
it is said elsewhere, he willed not the death of the sinner, but sought to
induce those who were not wholly irreclaimable to repent that they might live.
The same thing we now from these words of the Prophet; for God assumes the
character of a man ready to give help, and sympathizes with the miseries of a
people whom he saw rushing headlong into destruction. It now follows, &#8212;

in matters of such perplexity there was nothing certain or clear. As therefore

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he had said, that they had not been
sent by God. The object is to shew the Jews, that they were not to receive
thoughtlessly everything presented to them under God&#8217;s name, but that they
were to exercise discrimination and judgment. This is a passage worthy of
special notice, for the devil has ever falsely assumed God&#8217;s name; and for
all the errors and delusions which have ever prevailed in the world, he has not
obtained credit otherwise than by this false pretense. And at this day we see
that many are wilfully blind, because they think they are excused before God if
they can pretend ignorance, and they say that they are not wickedly credulous,
but they dare not make curious inquiries. As then there are many who wilfully
put on nooses and also wish to be deceived, we ought to notice what the Prophet
says here, that we ought to distinguish the true from false prophets; for what
purpose? even that we may receive them only, and depend on their words who have
been sent by the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be here asked, how comes this difference? It
was formerly necessary for prophets to be raised in a special manner, for it was
a special gift to predict future and hidden events, hence the prophetic was not
an ordinary office like the sacerdotal. That promise indeed ever continued in
force,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;A<i> </i>prophet
will I raise to thee from the midst of thy brethren.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
18:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though this was a perpetual favor conferred by
God on the Israelites, yet the prophets were ever called in a special manner; no
one was to take this office except endued with an extraordinary gift. Though
Jeremiah was a priest, yet he was not on that account a prophet; but God, as we
have seen, made him a prophet. But with regard to us, the matter is different,
for God does not at this day predict hidden events; but he would have us to be
satisfied with his Gospel, for in it is made known to us the perfection of
wisdom. As then we live in &#8220;the fullness of time,&#8221; God does not
reveal prophecies so as to point out this or that thing to us in particular. We
may now obtain certainty as to the truth, if we form our judgment according to
the Law, and the Prophets, and the Gospel. There is indeed need of the spirit of
discernment; but we shall never go astray, if we depend on the mouth of God, and
follow the example of the Bereans, of whom Luke speaks in the Acts, who says,
that they carefully read the Scriptures, and searched whether things were as
they were taught by Paul.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:11.) No wrong was done to Paul, when the disciples, in order to confirm their
faith, inquired whether his preaching was agreeable to the Law and to the
Prophets. So also now, all doctrines ought to be examined by us; and if we
follow this rule, we shall never go astray.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the ancient people, they could not, as it was
said yesterday, be deceived, for the prophets were only interpreters of the Law.
With regard to future things, this or that was never predicted by the prophets,
unless connected with doctrine, which was as it were the seasoning, and gave a
relish to the prophecies; for when they promised what was cheering, it was
founded on the eternal covenant of God; and when they threatened the people,
they pointed out their sins, so that it was necessary for God to execute his
vengeance when their wickedness was incurable. Ever to be borne in mind then is
that which is said in Deuteronomy, that God tried his people whenever he gave
loose reins to false prophets,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:3,) for every one who sincerely and undissemblingly loves him shall be guided
by his Spirit. This then is the sure trial which God makes as to his faithful
people, according to what Paul also says, who refers to this testimony of Moses,
that heresies arise in order that they who are the faithful and sincere servants
of God, might thereby shew what they really are,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:19; ) for they do not fluctuate at every wind of doctrine, but
remain firm and constant in the pure obedience of faith. Rightly then does
Jeremiah say, that they who gave hope of impunity to the people, had not been
sent by the Lord; for every one had his own conscience as his
judge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They prophesy falsely in my
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see how sedulously and
prudently we ought to take heed lest the devil should fascinate us by his
charms, especially when the name of God is pretended. It is then not enough for
us to hear, &#8220;Thus has God spoken,&#8221; unless we are fully persuaded
that those who use such a preface have been called by him, and that they also
afford a sure evidence of their call, so that we may be certain that they are as
it were the instruments of the Spirit. Ungodly men will find here an occasion
for clamoring, because God does in a manner make a mock of the anxiety of men,
for he might send angels from heaven, he might himself speak; but when he
employs men, and permits false prophets to boast of this word and of that, while
they wholly dissemble, he seems in this way as though he designedly bewildered
miserable men. But there is nothing better for us than to acknowledge that our
obedience is tried by God, when he addresses us by men; for we know that nothing
is more contrary to faith than pride, as also humility is the true principle of
faith and the real entrance into God&#8217;s kingdom. This then is the reason
why God makes use of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, when impostors creep in and boast
that they are true legitimate prophets, it is indeed a grievous trial, and much
to be feared; yet. God, as I have said, will ever relieve us, provided we trust
not to our own judgment, and assume not to ourselves more than what is just and
right, but look to him as the judge, and submit ourselves to his word; and
further, if we suffer ourselves to be ruled by his Spirit, he will ever give us
wisdom, which will enable us to distinguish between true and false prophets.
However this may be, we clearly see that it is no new thing for Satan&#8217;s
ministers to prophesy in God&#8217;s name, that is, falsely to assume his name,
when in reality and truth they are vain pretenders.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I might drive you out, and
that ye might perish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as well as they.
Here Jeremiah reminded them, that the prophets who promised impunity could not
at length escape, but that they would have to suffer punishment not only for
their presumption, but also for those sins by which they, together with the
whole people, had already provoked the wrath of God; for their crime was
twofold: despising God, they had promised all liberty to indulge in sin; and
they had also dared to come forth and to pretend God&#8217;s name, though they
had not been called, nor did they bring, as we have said, any message from God.
But the Prophet again repeated, that such prophets were instigated by the
devil&#8217;s artifice, in order to aggravate God&#8217;s judgment; for the
people, inebriated with joy, added sins to sins, as security is wont to lead men
to all kinds of wickedness. There is therefore nothing more ruinous than for
false teachers to flatter sinners, and so to cajole and wheedle them as to make
them to think that they have nothing to do with God; for the devil rules then
indeed, when men&#8217;s consciences are thus asleep in a deadly lethargy. He
afterwards adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah, as we have seen, did not deal privately
with the king alone, for he did not separate him from the people; but as he had
directed his words chiefly to him, he therefore expresses now what might have
seemed obscure, that though he had begun with the king, he yet included all the
Jews. It was indeed necessary to begin with the king, for we know that earthly
kings think much of their own dignity, and that the whole people are dependent
on their will. Hence Hosea condemned them, because they rendered a too willing
obedience to royal edicts, and worshipped God according to what it pleased the
king and his counsellors to dictate.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
5:11:
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
6:16.) As then the royal name served to dazzle the eyes of the simple, Jeremiah
was bidden to address first the king himself; but he now shews that the priests
and the people were included.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was indeed like something monstrous, that the
priests, whom God had designed to be the interpreters of his Law, should have
become so stupid as thoughtlessly to receive, together with the common people,
what they had heard from the false prophets. This surely was by no means
compatible with that high encomium by which they are honored by Malachi, that
the priest&#8217;s lips should keep knowledge, and that from him the Law is to
be sought, because he is the messenger of the God of hosts.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7.) As then they were the guardians of the Law and of knowledge, as they were
messengers from God himself to the people, how was it that their stupidity was
so monstrous, that they did not distinguish between truth and falsehood, but
were led astray, together with the most ignorant, by what the false prophets
delivered!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully noticed, that we may not
at this day be too much disturbed, when we see the pastoral office<i>
</i>assumed by ignorant asses, and that those who are called, and wish to be
thought ministers, are so inexperienced in Scripture that they are deficient as
to the first elements of religion. And we see the very thing happening at this
day especially under the Papacy, as existed among the ancient people; for the
Papal bishops are for the most part extremely stupid and presumptuous. There are
to be found many husbandmen and artisans, who know nothing of learning, but have
only heard what is obscure and indistinct, and yet they can speak better on the
general principles of faith than these haughty prelates in all their splendor.
How is this? even because the just reward for their sloth is rendered to them.
They are verily ignorant of what should qualify them to be bishops, and yet they
glory in the name! Yea, though they do not think that Episcopacy consists in
anything but in revenues, and also in vain symbols, such as to be mitred, to
wear an episcopal ring, and to exhibit other like trumperies, they yet suppose
themselves to be a sort of half-gods. Hence it is, that God exposes them to the
utmost reproach. The same was the case with the priests under the Law, as
Jeremiah now shews; for they were not ashamed of their ignorance, but encouraged
the people to believe the false prophets; so at this day do the bishops; they
scud forth their monks and such like brawlers, who run here and there to deceive
the ignorant people, and they secure a hearing to them. And what is the burden
of their message? to bid men to attend to the holy Catholic Church; and what is
the Catholic Church? The Synod which the Pope assembles, where the mitred
bishops sit; for what purpose? That they may know what pleases these brawlers,
to whom is committed the office<i> </i>of disputing. We hence see that all
things under the Papacy are at this day in great disorder; and yet this horrible
disorder differs nothing from that of old. And it is, as I have said, what ought
to be particularly noticed, that our faith may not fail, when we see all things
in a confusion and hardly any order remaining.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now also is added a clearer explanation, &#8212; that
the Jews were warned, lest they should receive the false prophecy respecting the
restoration of the vessels of the Temple; for in order to render the people
secure as to the future, the false prophets boasted in this manner,
&#8220;The<i> </i>splendor of the<i> </i>Temple shall shortly be restored; for
the vessels, which Nebuchadnezzar has taken away, shall return together with the
captives, and everything decayed shall be repaired.&#8221; But Jeremiah said,
that what they promised was false; &#8220;Believe them not,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;when they say to you,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the vessels of
Jehovah&#8217;s house shall be brought back</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>(or restored, that is, shall return hither; ) for the king of Babylon shall
either be constrained to restore what he has taken away, or he will of his own
accord restore it.&#8221; And they also added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now
soon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that the shortness of
time might be all additional chain to captivate the minds of the people; for had
a long time been mentioned, the prophecy would have been less plausible and by
no means acceptable to them; but they said, &#8220;Almost<i> </i>within a day
the vessels of the Temple shall be brought back here.&#8221; And Jeremiah also,
as we have already seen, and shall presently see again, did not deprive the
people of every hope, but had assigned seventy years for their exile. Now these
prophets, in order to dissipate this fear, said, &#8212; &#8220;Shortly shall
the vessels be restored;&#8221; but he declared that they prophesied falsely to
them. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is not to be wondered at that Jeremiah said the
same things so often, for, as we have seen, he had to contend with false
prophets. When any one speaks, and there be no dispute and no adversary opposing
him, he may calmly deal with the teachable and confine himself to a few words;
but when contention arises, and opponents appear, who may seek to subvert what
we say, then we must exercise more care, for they who are thus driven different
ways, will not be satisfied with a few words. As, then, Jeremiah saw that the
people were fluctuating, he found it necessary, in order to confirm them, to use
many words; not that prolixity is in itself sufficient to produce conviction;
yet there is no doubt but that Jeremiah spoke efficiently so as to influence at
least some portion of the people. Besides, it was necessary to dwell more
expressly on a subject not very plausible; the false prophets were heard with
favor, and the greater part greedily devoured what was set forth by them; for
the hope of impunity is always pleasing and sought after by the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what did Jeremiah say?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Serve ye the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;No<i>
</i>better condition awaits you than to pay tribute to the king of Babylon; be
subject to his authority, and patiently endure whatever he may prescribe to
you.&#8221;<i> </i>This was indeed a very hard speech; for subjection was not
unaccompanied with reproach; besides, he bade them to surrender themselves to a
most cruel enemy, as though they were to expose their life to him; and lastly,
they were to risk the danger of being spoiled of all that they had. What
Jeremiah taught then was very much disliked, as he thus exhorted the people to
endure all things. This was, then, the reason why he had not declared in a few
and plain words what God had committed to him; it was difficult to persuade the
people to undergo the yoke of the king of Babylon, and to submit to his
tyranny.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that there were two very just reasons
why the Prophet insisted so much on this one subject, and confirmed what he
might have briefly said without any prolixity;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hearken, ye to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says;

we said yesterday, that patiently to humble ourselves under God&#8217;s mighty
hand is the best remedy for mitigating punishment, and that in this way
punishment is turned into medicine; so on the other hand, when we are like
refractory and ferocious horses, whatever punishment God inflicts on us, is only
a prelude to endless destruction. Let us then lay hold on this truth and
constantly meditate on it, &#8212; that our punishment becomes vivifying to us,
when we acknowledge God to be a righteous judge and suffer ourselves to be
corrected by him. But I refer only briefly to this subject now, for I spoke of
it more at large yesterday.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why should this city be a
desolation? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He set before them the city in
which God&#8217;s sanctuary was, and by the sight of it he tried to turn them to
repentance; for it was extremely base to harden themselves against the warnings
of the prophets, so as to cause the Temple of God to be demolished, and also the
holy city to be reduced to a waste, in which God designed to have his dwelling,
as he had said,</font><br></div>

condemnation awaited them, if they suffered the city to perish through their own
fault, and that they would be the authors of their own ruin, if they undertook
not the yoke<i> </i>of the king of Babylon. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet laughs to scorn the foolish
confidence with which the false prophets were swollen, when they promised all
happiness in time to come. He hence says, that they were not to be believed as
to the prosperity of which they prophesied, but that on the contrary they ought
to have dreaded a most grievous punishment.</font><br></div>

remains may not be taken away from Jerusalem. They promised the return of the
vessels, which had been already carried away to Babylon; and yet what still
remained in the Temple and in the palace of the king and in the whole city, was
to be removed to Babylon. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design; he
compares the future with the past, and shews that these impostors foolishly
promised some better state of things, even when God&#8217;s heavy judgment was
impending over them; for the city and the Temple were doomed to entire ruin. The
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gp</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
pego, </i>means to meet, to go to meet, and is taken metaphorically in the sense
of interceding; for he who meets one as an intercessor, in a manner restrains
the opponent; and the Scripture uses this word, when it speaks of the saints as
supplicating God; the proper word is
interceding.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE185</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this passage we learn that these two things are
united &#8212; teaching and praying. Then God would have him whom he has set a
teacher in his Church, to be assiduous in prayer. And so the Apostles said, when
they spoke of appointing deacons, that they could not attend to tables; for they
said that they were sufficiently engaged in teaching, and they mentioned also
prayers.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
6:2-4.) The same also we learn from this place, where Jeremiah ascribes the
office of interceding to God&#8217;s true and faithful servants who
conscientiously discharged the office of teaching;

this he also shews who are to be counted true prophets, even those who have the

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah said, in the passage we considered
yesterday, that it was more to be desired that God should keep what remained at
Jerusalem, than that what had been taken away should be restored, for the time
of punishment had not yet passed away; and thus he condemned the false teachers,
because they had presumptuously and boldly promised a quick return as to the
king as well as to those who had been led with him into exile, he now confirms
the same thing, and says that what remained as yet at Jerusalem was already
destined for their enemies the Babylonians, and would become their prey.
Nebuchadnezzar had in part spared the Temple and the city; he had taken away
chiefly the precious vessels, but had not entirely spoiled the Temple of its
ornaments. As, then, some splendor was still to be seen there, the Jews ought to
have learned that he had acted kindly towards them. He now says, that the Temple
and the city would be destroyed; and this may be gathered from his words when he
says, that there would be nothing remaining.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah concerning the
pillars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. There is no doubt but that
Solomon spent much money on the pillars, as the Scripture commends the work. He
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>concerning the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which was a very large vessel, for
from it the priests took water to wash themselves whenever they entered the
Temple to perform their sacred duties. And though it was made of brass, it was
yet of no small value on account of its largeness; and for this reason it was
called sea. He mentions, in the third place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
bases</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerome
</i></font><font face="Palatino">reads, &#8220;To<i> </i>the bases,&#8221; for
the preposition is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">,
but it means often <i>of</i>, or concerning, as it is well known. He then
declares what God had determined as to the pillars as well as the sea and the
bases. There were, indeed, other vessels besides; but he specified these in
order that the king, and also the people, might know that nothing would be left
remaining in the Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he also adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The residue of the vessels which
remains, in this city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By adding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon took not away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he indirectly
condemned the Jews, because they did not acknowledge that the cruelty of their
enemy had been moderated by divine power. For we know how cruel were
Babylonians, and how insatiable was their avarice, and that nothing would have
been left in the Temple had not their hands been in a manner restrained by the
hidden power of God. The Jews ought to have duly considered this, and therefore
the Prophet alludes to their ingratitude when he says, that Nebuchadnezzar had
not taken away the vessels when yet he led captive the king and all the chief
men,<i> </i>both of the city and the whole land. There is, indeed, to be
understood here a comparison between the less and the greater, as though he had
said, &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar would not have been so gentle had not God moderated
his spirit, for he spared not your king, he led into exile all your chief men;
how, then, was it that he left anything to remain in your city, and that the
pillars were not taken away? Did he despise them? They have been polished with
exquisite skill, and the materials are very costly. Ye hence see that God gave
you a proof of his mercy, for some things still remain safe in the city as well
as in the Temple; yet ye disregard this so great a benefit bestowed on you by
God; what, then, will at length happen to you?&#8221;<i> </i>We now perceive the
Prophet&#8217;s design in these words when he says, that the vessels were not
taken away, even when the king was taken captive, and when the chief men of the
land were led into exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Useful instruction may also be hence gathered.
Whenever God chastises us, let us ever consider that he does not proceed to
extremities; for the cause of murmuring, and often of despair, is this, &#8212;
because we think that he deals with us with extreme rigor. But this happens
through our sinful and perverted judgment; for God never afflicts us so severely
but that some portion of kindness and of moderation ever appears; in a word, his
judgments are always founded on his goodness. Were any one, therefore, rightly
to call to mind how far he is from suffering extreme evils, it would conduce
much to alleviate his sorrows. But when we reject every knowledge of God&#8217;s
goodness, and only consider his severity, we either murmur or in a manner become
furious against him. But this passage teaches us, that when God leaves some
residue to us, it is an evidence of his paternal favor, and that therefore
something more may be hoped for, provided we from the heart
repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The design, then, of the Prophet&#8217;s warning was,
that the Jews might receive this remaining favor of God, and not proceed in
their obstinacy until God again stretched forth his hand to destroy
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats again the same words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; for so ought the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, to </i>be rendered in this place.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And he emphatically expresses what was
of itself sufficiently clear, that he might deeply imprint on their minds this
declaration of God, and that thus some terror might penetrate into the hearts of
those who were so obdurate that it was not easy to effect anything by a simple
statement of the truth.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saith Jehovah of the
vessels which yet remain in the Temple of Jehovah and in, the palace of the
king, They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>Jeremiah intimates that the
Jews had no hope, as they were perversely resisting God and refusing to be
chastised by his hand. And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until the day in which I shall
visit them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the vessels; for so the
reference may suitably be made; but as it is often the case in Hebrew to put a
pronoun when anything remarkable is spoken without any noun, or a subject, as
they say, preceding it, I am inclined to refer it to the Jews themselves; for
the restoration of the vessels depended on that of the people. He means, then,
that the vessels would be held captive until God allowed a free return to the
people, which happened through the edict of Cyrus, after he had obtained power
in Chaldea and Assyria.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was the same thing as though the Jews were
reminded that the exile which had been predicted would be long, and that they
foolishly hoped for what the false prophets had promised as to the vessels; for
God had no greater care for the vessels than for his chosen people, as the
vessels were acceptable to God for the people&#8217;s sake. Here, then, Jeremiah
confirms what he has said elsewhere, and that often, that the people would be
captives until the day of visitation, that is, till the end of seventy years.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, says God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall
visit </i></font><font face="Palatino">the Jews themselves, I will then bring
back also the vessels; and so it was permitted by the command of Cyrus. We now
understand the simple meaning of the words. Another narrative follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet relates here with what haughtiness, and
even fury, the false prophet Hananiah came forward to deceive the people and to
proclaim his trumperies, when yet he must have been conscious of his own
wickedness.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe188</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It hence clearly appears how great must be the madness of those who, being
blinded by God, are carried away by a satanic impulse. The circumstances of the
case especially shew how great a contempt of God was manifested by this
impostor; for he came into the Temple, the priests were present, the people were
there, and there before his eyes he had the sanctuary and the ark of the
covenant; and we know that the ark of the covenant is everywhere represented as
having the presence of God; for God was by that symbol in a manner visible, when
he made evident the presence of his power and favor in the Temple. As Hananiah
then stood before God&#8217;s eyes, how great must have been his stupidity to
thrust himself forward and impudently to announce falsehood in the name of God
himself! He had yet no doubt but that he falsely boasted that he was God&#8217;s
prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he used the same words as Jeremiah did,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the
God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Surely these words ought
to have been like a thunderbolt to him, laying prostrate his perverseness, even
had he been harder than iron; for what does Jehovah of hosts mean? This name
expresses not only the eternal existence of God, but also his power, which
diffuses itself through heaven and earth. Ought not Hananiah then to have
trembled when any other had alleged God&#8217;s name? But now, though he derided
and laughed to scorn the prophetic office as well as God&#8217;s holy name, he
yet hesitated not to boast that God was the author of this prophecy, which was
yet nothing but an imposture. And he added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that he might be in nothing
inferior to Jeremiah. This was a grievous trial, calculated not only to
discourage the people, but also to break down the firmness of the holy Prophet.
The people saw that God&#8217;s name was become a subject of contest; there was
a dreadful conflict, &#8220;God<i> </i>has spoken to me;&#8221; &#8220;Nay,
rather to me.&#8221;<i> </i>Jeremiah and Hananiah were opposed, the one to the
other; each of them claimed to be a Prophet. Such was the conflict; the name of
God seemed to have been assumed at pleasure, and flung forth by the devil as in
sport.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to Jeremiah, his heart must have been grievously
wounded, when he saw that unprincipled man boldly profaning God&#8217;s name.
But, as I have already said, God in the meantime supported the minds of the
godly, so that they were not wholly cast down, though they must have been<i>
</i>somewhat disturbed. For we know that God&#8217;s children were not so
destitute of feeling as not to be moved by such things; but yet God sustained
all those who were endued with true religion. It was indeed easy for them to
distinguish between Jeremiah and Hananiah; for they saw that the former
announced the commands of God, while the latter sought nothing else but the
favor and plaudits of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But with regard to Hananiah, he was to them an awful
spectacle of blindness and of madness, for he dreaded not the sight of God
himself, but entered the Temple and profaned it by his lies, and at the same
time assumed in contempt the name of God, and boasted that he was a prophet,
while he was nothing of the kind. Let us not then wonder if there be many
mercenary brawlers at this day, who without shame and fear fiercely pretend
God&#8217;s name, and thus exult over us, as though God had given them all that
they vainly prattle, while yet it may be fully proved that they proclaim nothing
but falsehoods; for God has justly blinded them, as they thus profane his holy
name. We shall now come to the words:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it was in the same
year</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the fourth of Zedekiah&#8217;s
reign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The fourth year seems to
have been improperly called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of his reign. We have said elsewhere, that it may have been that God had
laid up this prophecy with Jeremiah, and did not design it to be immediately
published. But there would be nothing strange in this, were the confirmation of
his reign called its beginning. Zedekiah was made king by Nebuchadnezzar,
because the people would not have been willing to accept a foreigner. He might
indeed have set one of his own governors over the whole country; and he might
also have made a king of one of the chief men of the land, but he saw that
anything of this kind would have been greatly disliked. He therefore deemed it
enough to take away Jeconiah, and to put in his place one who had not much power
nor much wealth, and who was to be his tributary, as the case was with Zedekiah.
But in course of time Zedekiah increased in power, so that he was at peace in
his own kingdom. We also know that he was set over neighboring countries, as
Nebuchadnezzar thought it advantageous to bind him to himself by favors. This
fourth year then might well be deemed the beginning of his reign, for during
three years things were so disturbed, that he possessed no authority, and hardly
dared to ascend the throne. This then is the most probable
opinion.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE189</font></sup><br></div>

touched and moved when he heard Jeremiah speaking, he himself had no proof of
his own call; nay, he was an impostor, and he knew that he did nothing but
deceive the people, and yet he audaciously persisted in his object, and, as it
were, avowedly obtruded himself that he might contend with the Prophet, as
though he carried on war with God. He said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Broken is the yoke of the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the tyranny by which
he has oppressed the people shall be shortly broken. But he alluded to the yoke
which Jeremiah had put on, as we shall presently see. The commencement<i> </i>of
his prophecy was, that there was no reason for the Jews<i> </i>to dread the
present power of the king of Babylon, for God would soon overthrow him. They
could not have entertained hope of restoration, or of a better condition, until
that monarchy was trodden under foot; for as long as the king of Babylon bore
rule, there was no hope that he would remit the tribute, and restore to the Jews
the vessels of the Temple. Hananiah then began with this, that God would break
the power of the king of Babylon, so that he would be constrained, willing or
unwilling, to let the people free, or that the people would with impunity
extricate themselves from the grasp of his power. He then adds, &#8212;

just predicted<i> </i>respecting the vessels of the Temple and of the palace.
But it may be asked, how did he dare to give hope as to the restoration of
Jeconiah, since that could not have been acceptable to Zedekiah? for Jeconiah
could not have again gained what he had lost without the abdication of
Zechariah; but he would have never submitted willingly to lose his own dignity
and to become a private man, and to allow him who had been deprived of this high
honor to return again. But there is no doubt but that he relied on the favor of
the people, and that he was fully persuaded that if Zedekiah could ill bear to
be thus degraded, he would yet be constrained to shew a different feeling; for
Zedekiah himself regarded his own reign as not honorable, as he sat not in
David&#8217;s throne by the right of succession. He had been set on the throne
by a tyrant, and he dared not to make any other pretense to the people than that
he wished Jeconiah to return and to possess the kingdom of which he had been
deprived. As then this impostor knew that the king dared not to shew any
displeasure, but that his prophecy would be gratifying and acceptable to the
people, he boldly promised what we here read respecting the return of

would not stand longer than two years, the Jews might have supposed that they
would become free, and might thus have hoped for a happy state of things; and
this was the design of the impostor; but what was the answer of Jeremiah? His
opposition to him was frank and firm; but as he saw that he had incurred the
ill-will of the people, he was anxious to remove it; and before he repeated what
he had said of their seventy years in exile, he shewed that he had not eagerly
received his commission, as though he had been alienated from his people, or had
disregarded their welfare, or had been carried away by some morbid feeling to
bring a sad and mournful message. He therefore said, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I have shortly reminded you of the design of the
Prophet; for it was to be feared that the people would not hear him, or at least
that they would not well receive him, as he had threatened them and handled them
roughly and severely. We know that men ever seek to be flattered; hence
adulations are ever delightfully received. Such is the pride of men, that they
cannot bear to be called to an account for what they have done; and <i>they
</i>become also indignant, when they see their crimes and vices brought to
light; besides, they are so delicate and tender, that they avoid as much as they
can all adverse rumors; and if any fear assails them, they instantly
resist.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Jeremiah had been furnished with a twofold
message, to expose the vices of the people, to shew that the Jews were unworthy
to inherit the land, as they were covenant-breakers and despisers of God and of
his Law; and then, as they had been so often refractory and perverse, he had
another message, that they would not be suffered to escape unpunished, as they
had in so many ways, and for so long a time continued to provoke God&#8217;s
wrath; all this was very displeasing to the people. It was therefore
Jeremiah&#8217;s object to turn aside the false suspicion under which he
labored, and he testified that he desired nothing more than the well-being of
the people; &#8220;Amen,&#8221;<i> </i>he said, &#8220;may it thus happen, I
wish I were a false prophet; I would willingly retract, and that with shame, all
that I have hitherto predicted, so great is my care and anxiety for the safety
of the public; for I would prefer the welfare of the whole people to my own
reputation.&#8221; But he afterwards added, as we shall see, that the promise of
Hananiah was wholly vain, and that nothing would save the people from the
calamity that was very near at hand.</font><br></div>

continuest to invite us to thyself, and often to remind us of our sins, that we

thee in real humility and true repentance, and that trusting in thine infinite
goodness, we may not doubt but that thou wilt be propitious to us, so that we
may be kindled with the desire for true religion, and in all things obey thy
word, that thy name may be glorified in us, until we shall at length come into

Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began in the last Lecture to explain the answer of
Jeremiah, when he said to Hananiah, &#8220;May God confirm thy words, and may
the vessels of the Temple be restored to this place and return together with the
captive people.&#8221; We briefly stated what is now necessary again to repeat,
that there were two feelings in the Prophets apparently contrary, and yet they
were compatible with one another. Whatever God had commanded them they boldly
declared, and thus they forgot their own nation when they announced anything of
an adverse kind. Hence, when the Prophets threatened the people, and said that
war or famine was near at hand, they doubtless were so endued with a heroic
greatness of mind, that dismissing a regard for the people, they proceeded in
the performance of their office; they thus strenuously executed whatever God had
commanded them. But they did not wholly put off every<i> </i>humane feeling, but
condoled with the miseries of the people; and though they denounced on them
destruction, yet they could not but receive sorrow from their own prophecies.
There was, therefore, no inconsistency in Jeremiah in wishing the restoration of
the vessels of the Temple and the return of the exiles, while yet he ever
continued in the same mind, as we shall hereafter see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one objects and says that this could not have
been the case, for then Jeremiah must have been a vain and false prophet; the
answer to this is, that the prophets had no recourse to refined reasoning, when
they were carried away by a vehement zeal; for we see that Moses wished to be
blotted out of the book of life, and that Paul expressed a similar wish, even
that he might be an anathema from Christ for his brethren.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:32;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:3.) Had any one distinctly asked Moses, Do you wish to perish and to be cut
off from the hope of salvation? his answer, no doubt, would have been, that
nothing was less in his mind than to cast away the immutable favor of God; but
when his mind was wholly fixed on God&#8217;s glory, which would have been
exposed to all kinds of reproaches, had the people been destroyed in the Desert,
and when he felt another thing, a solicitude for the salvation of his own
nation, he was at the time forgetful of himself, and being carried away as it
were beyond himself, he said, &#8220;Rather blot me out of the book of
life,<i>&#8221; </i>and the ease of Paul was similar. And the same view we ought
to take of Jeremiah, when he, in effect, said, I would I were a false prophet,
and that thou hast predicted to the people what by the event may be found to be
true.&#8221; But Jeremiah did not intend to take away even the least thing from
God&#8217;s word; he only expressed a wish, and surrendered to God the care for
the other, the credit and the authority of his prophecy, he did not, then,
engage for this, as though he ought to have made it good, if the event did not
by chance correspond with his prophecy; but he left the care of this with God,
and thus, without any difficulty, he prayed for the liberation and return of the
people. But it now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah, having testified that he did not wish for
anything adverse to his own people, but had a good will towards them, now adds
that what he had predicted was yet most true. Here is seen more fully what I
have said of his twofold feeling; for though the Prophet wished to consult the
welfare of the people, he did not yet cease to render full obedience to God, and
to announce those messages which were at the same time very grievous: thus
Jeremiah did not keep silence, but became an herald of God&#8217;s vengeance
against the people. On the one hand, then, he showed that he desired nothing
more than the welfare and the safety of his people, and that yet it was not in
his power nor in that of any mortal to change the celestial decree which he had
pronounced. We hence see that God so influenced the minds and hearts of his
servants, that they were not cruel or barbarous; and yet they were not made soft
and pliable through the influence of humanity, but boldly declared what God had
commanded them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless, hear thou this word
which I pronounce in thine ears, and in the ears of all the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words Jeremiah
indirectly condemned the vanity of Hananiah, who sought to flatter the people,
and by his adulations hunted for favor and applause, as it is usual with such
impostors, he then said that it availed him nothing to give the people the hope
of a near deliverance, for God had not changed his purpose. And Jeremiah now
boldly and openly opposed him, as he had sufficiently rebutted that ill-will
with which he was unjustly loaded; for impostors ever find out calumnies by
which they assail the faithful servants of God. He might at the beginning have
objected to Jeremiah and said, &#8220;Thou art alienated from thine own nation,
thou art not touched by the many miseries by which we have been hitherto
distressed, nor carest thou for what may happen to us in future.&#8221; Thus he
might have kindled hatred against Jeremiah, had he not cleared himself. But
after he had testified that he felt kindly and was well affected towards his own
nation, he assailed the impostor himself, and hesitated not to assert what
seemed very grievous, that the people would become captives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet Jeremiah seems here to have been smitten in some
measure with fear; for he did not confirm his own prophecy, but left that as it
were in suspense; and yet he doubtless exposed the false declaration of
Hananiah. But we know that the whole of what the Prophet said is not recited;
for he only in a brief way records the heads or the chief things; and further,
as we shall presently see, Jeremiah could not act as he wished in the midst of
such a tumult, for he would have spoken to the deaf; and as Hananiah had
prejudiced the minds of almost all, the holy Prophet would not have been
listened to while there was such a confusion. He was therefore satisfied with
the brief assertion, that God would soon shew that Hananiah was a false witness
in promising so quick a return to the captives and exiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he makes here only a general statement,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Prophets who have been
before, me and thee, and prophesied against many
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(or great)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lands, and against great

pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>roe, evil, </i>is placed between two other kinds of evil; but it is to be
taken here no doubt for famine, as it is evident from many other
passages.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE193</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Then he adds, changing the number,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When any prophet
spoke of peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the event proved whether
or not he was a true prophet.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, experience itself will shortly
prove thee to be false, for after two years the people who are now in Babylon
will be still there under oppression, and the condition of the residue will be
nothing better, for those who now remain in the city and throughout all Judea
shall be driven into exile as well as their brethren.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah seems here to conclude that those alone are
to be deemed true prophets who prove by the event that they have been sent from
above; and it not only appears that this may be gathered from his words, but it
may also be shewn to be the definition of a true prophet; for when the event
corresponds with the prophecy, there is no doubt but that he who predicted what
comes to pass must have been sent by God. But we must bear in mind what is said
in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:1, 2, where God reminds the people that even when the event answers to the
prophecy, the prophets are not to be thoughtlessly and indiscriminately
believed, as though they predicted what was true;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;for God,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;tries thee,&#8221; that is, proves thy faith, whether thou wilt be
easily carried away by every wind of doctrine.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there are two passages, spoken by Moses himself,
which at the first sight seem to militate the one against the other. We have
already quoted the first from Deuteronomy 13; we have the other in the
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:18,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The prophet who
has predicted what is found to be
true,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I have sent
him.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God seems there to acknowledge as his faithful
servants those who foretell what is true. But Moses had before reminded the
people that even impostors sometimes speak the truth, but that they ought not on
this account to be believed. But we must remember what God often declares by
Isaiah, when he claims to himself alone the foreknowledge of
things,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;and inquire whether the gods of the Gentiles will answer as to
future things.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
44:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that God ascribes to himself alone this
peculiarity, that he foreknows future events and testifies respecting them. And
surely nothing can be more clear than that God alone can speak of hidden things:
men, indeed, can conjecture this or that, but they are often
mistaken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the devil, I pass by those refined
disquisitions with which Augustine especially wearied himself; for above all
other things he toiled on this point, how the devils reveal future and hidden
things? He speculated, as I have said, in too refined a manner. But the solution
of the difficulty, as to the subject now in hand, may be easily given. We first
conclude, that future events cannot be known but by God alone, and that,
therefore, prescience is his exclusive property, so that nothing that is future
or hidden can be predicted but by him alone. But, then, it does not follow that
God does not permit liberty to the devil and his ministers to foretell something
that is true. How? As the case was with Balaam, who was an impostor, ready to
let on hire or to sell his prophecies, as it is well known, and yet he was a
prophet. But it was a peculiar gift to foretell things: whence had he this? Not
from the devil any farther than it pleased God; and yet the truth had no other
fountain than God himself and his Spirit. When, therefore, the devil declares
what is true, it is as it were extraneous and adventitious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as we have said, that God is the source of
truth, it follows that the prophets sent by him cannot be mistaken; for they
exceed not the limits of their call, and so they do not speak falsely of hidden
things; but when they declare this or that, they have him as their teacher. But
these terms, as they say, are not convertible &#8212; to foretell what is true
and to be a true prophet: for some, as I have said, predict what is found
afterwards by trial and experience to be true, and yet they are impostors; nor
did God, in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, intend to give a certain
definition by which his own prophets are to be distinguished; but as he saw that
the Israelites would be too credulous, so as greedily to lay hold on anything
that might have been said, he intended to restrain that excess, and to correct
that immoderate ardor. Hence he commanded them to expect the event, as though he
had said, &#8220;If any arise among you who will promise this or that in my
name, do not immediately receive what they may announce; but the event will shew
whether I have sent them.&#8221; So also, in this place, Jeremiah says, that the
true prophets of God had spoken efficiently, as they had predicted nothing but
what God had ratified and really proved to have come from him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, then, we ought to think of most, that is, that
those who predict what is true are for the most part the prophets of God: this
is to be taken as the general rule. But we cannot hence conclude, that all those
who apparently predict this or that, are sent by God, so that the whole of what
they teach is true: for one particular prophecy would not be sufficient to prove
the truth of all that is taught and preached. It is enough that God condemns
their vanity who speak from their own hearts or from their own brains, when the
event does not correspond. At the same time he points out his own prophets by
this evidence, &#8212; that he really shews that he has sent them, when he
fulfils what has been predicted by them. As to false prophets there is a special
reason why God permits to them so much liberty, for the world is worthy of such
reward, when it willingly offers itself to be deceived. Satan, the father of
lies, lays everywhere his snares for men, and they who run into them, and wish
to cast themselves on his tenterhooks, deserve to be given up to believe a lie,
as they will not, as Paul says, believe the truth.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:10, 11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what was the object of Jeremiah: his
design was not to prove that all were true prophets who predicted something that
was true, for this was not, his subject; but he took up another point, &#8212;
that all who predicted this or that, which was afterwards found to be vain, were
thus convicted of falsehood. If then any one predicted what was to be, and the
thing itself came not to pass, it was a sufficient proof of his presumption: it
hence appeared, that he was not sent of God as he boasted. This was the object
of Jeremiah, nor did he go beyond it; for he did not discuss the point, whether
all who predicted true things were sent from above, and whether all their
doctrines were to be credited and they believed indiscriminately; this was not
the subject handled by Jeremiah; but he shewed that Hananiah was a false
prophet, for it would appear evident after two years that he had vainly spoken
of what he had not received from God&#8217;s Spirit. And the same thing Moses
had in view, as I have already explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>who had been in all ages and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied
</i></font><font face="Palatino">respecting many lands and great kingdoms, they
must be considered as exclusively the true prophets: for though there had been
some prophets among heathen nations, yet Jeremiah would not have thought them
worthy of so great an honor; and it would have been to blend together sacred and
profane things, had he placed these vain foretellers and the true prophets in
the same rank. But we know that all God&#8217;s servants had so directed their
discourse to the elect people, as yet to speak of foreign kingdoms and of far
countries; and this has not been without reason distinctly expressed; for when
they spoke of any monarchy they could not of themselves conjecture what would
be: it was therefore necessary for them thus to speak by the impulse of the Holy
Spirit. Were I disposed to assume more than what is lawful, and to pretend that
I possess some special gift of prophesying, I could more easily lie and deceive,
were I to speak only of one city, and of the state of things open before my
eyes, than if I extended my predictions to distant countries: when therefore
Jeremiah says that the prophets had spoken of divers and large countries, and of
most powerful kingdoms, he intimates that their predictions could not have been
ascribed to human conjectures; for were any one possessed of the greatest
acuteness, and were he to surpass angels in intelligence, he yet could not
predict what is hereafter to take place in lands beyond the seas But whatever
had been predicted by the prophets, God sanctioned it by the events of time. It
then follows that their call was at the same time sanctioned; that is, when God
as it were ratified from heaven what they had spoken on earth. Whether therefore
the prophets spoke of peace, that is, of prosperity, or of war, famine, and
pestilence, when experience proved that true which they had said, their own
authority was at the same time confirmed, as though God had shewed that they had
been sent by him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tmab</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

which impostors ever assume; for they surpass God&#8217;s faithful servants in
boasting that they have been sent. As then they were thus insolent, and by a
fallacious pretense of having been called to their office, deceived unwary men,
the Prophet adds here this clause, intimating that they were not all sent in
truth. He thus conceded some sort of a call to these unprincipled men, but yet
shewed how much they differed from God&#8217;s servants, whose call was sealed
by God himself. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It was not enough for the impostor to resist the holy
servant of God to his face, without laying sacrilegious hands on that visible
symbol, by which it had pleased God to testify that the Prophet&#8217;s message
was true. For such was the tardiness of the people, nay, their insensibility,
that they could not be much moved by words; therefore God added a symbol, for
Jeremiah carried cords or bands around his neck: and it was a sign of reproach
before men, yet, in order to touch the people, he refused not to undergo that
reproach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The band then on the neck of Jeremiah was like a
sacrament; for it was a visible sign to establish the credit of his message. And
what did Hananiah do? After having insolently inveighed against Jeremiah, and
promised deliverance to the people after two years, he violently broke and took
off the cord or the band which Jeremiah had around his neck.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how great and how impetuous is the fury
of those whom the devil impels: for when once they arrive at that degree of
temerity as to dare to resist the word of God, and, were it possible, to cast
him from his own throne, they spare no symbols of his power and glory. We ought
especially to notice this madness of Hananiah; for he not only resisted
God&#8217;s servant, and endeavored to subvert his prophecy, but also snatched
away the bands, that he might set up the falsehood of the devil in opposition to
the true sacrament. This sign, as we have said, availed to confirm the prophecy
of which we have heard; but what was done by Hananiah? he not only took away
that sign, but by breaking the bands he attracted the attention of men, and by
such a representation made them to believe that there would be in two years a
deliverance. Then Hananiah displayed his furious zeal in two ways; for he
profaned that symbol which Jeremiah had adopted according to God&#8217;s
command, and he also took it away, as though he aimed to be above God, and to
overthrow his truth, and would triumph over it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same thing we now see done under the Papacy: for
we know that what Christ had commanded has been either corrupted, or obscured,
or blotted out by them; and they have also devised fictitious sacraments and
innumerable pompous rites, by which they fascinate foolish and credulous men.
The same did Hananiah; and therefore his disciples and imitators are the
Papists; who not only reject or extenuate the testimonies which have come from
God, but plainly dishonor his sacraments by arrogantly bringing forward their
own devices and inventions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice how craftily this impostor
insinuated himself; for he seemed to imitate the true prophets of God, for he
set a sign before the people, and then added a doctrine. The Papists have their
empty signs, but they only delight the eyes, while yet they have no care nor
concern for the ears. But Hananiah came still nearer to God&#8217;s servants, so
that he might deceive even those who were not stupid. What, indeed, could we
desire more in this man than that he should set forth a sign? He also added the
name of God and declared what was his purpose,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in this manner will 1 break the
yoke of Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>nor did he speak
in his own name, but assumed the person of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I will break the yoke of
Nebuchadnezzar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as we have elsewhere said, this preposterous
imitation of the devil ought not to disturb pious minds; for God ever supplies
his own people with the spirit of discernment, provided they humbly pray to him.
And therefore whenever Jeremiah repeated the word prophet, which he conceded to
Hananiah, as he assumed it himself, for whenever he spoke of Hananiah, he
honored him with this name, even that he was a prophet, &#8212; the holy man was
not ignorant what an occasion of offense it was, when a prophet, who is so
acknowledged in the Church of God, is yet the minister of Satan, a liar and an
impostor. But his object was to warn us in due time, lest novelty should
frighten us when any boasts of the title of a prophet. So the Papists brag that
they are prelates and bishops, and boast that they are the successors of the
Apostles: but the devil is their chief, who calls himself the Vicar of Christ on
the earth. Then Jeremiah designedly called Hananiah so many times a prophet, so
that our faith, when any such thing happens to us, may not fail, as though some
new thing had taken place. I cannot to-day finish the last part of the
verse.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Hananiah, after having broken the bands of Jeremiah,
predicted that God would liberate the Jews as well as other nations from under
the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar; and it is at length added, that Jeremiah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went his
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which words the Prophet
intimates that he left the place, for he was unwilling contentiously to dispute
with a violent man, or rather with a wild beast; for it is probable, nay, it may
be concluded as certain, that Hananiah had great power in the Temple, for his
prophecies were plausible. For as men always seek flatteries, when they heard
promised to them what was especially desirable, even an end to all their evils
and calamities after two years, all of them greedily received what the impostor
had said. Besides, not only his tongue fought against Jeremiah, but also his
hands, for he violently assailed the holy man when he broke his bands. Hence
Jeremiah could not have acted otherwise than to turn aside as it were from the
storm; nor did he do this through fear, but because he saw that his adversary
would be his superior in wrangling, nor did he hope to be heard amidst noise and
clamors; for he saw that a great tumult would immediately rise if he began to
speak. He found it therefore necessary to withdraw from the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are hereby reminded that we ought wisely to
consider what occasions may require; for it is not right nor expedient to speak
always and everywhere.<i> </i>When, therefore, the Lord opens our mouth, no
difficulties ought to restrain us so as not to speak boldly; but when there is
no hope of doing good, it is better sometimes to be silent than to excite a
great multitude without any profit. True indeed is that saying of Paul, that we
ought to be instant out of season,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 4:2;) but he means, that the ministers of Christ, though they may
sometimes offend and exasperate the minds of many, ought not yet to desist but
to persevere. But Jeremiah had no hearers, and the whole people were so
incensed, that he could do nothing against that impostor even if he exposed
himself to death. He therefore was silent, for he had already discharged the
duties of his office; he might have also withdrawn, that he might come furnished
with new messages, and thus endued with new authority, as, indeed, it appears

common benefit of the people, and that he wisely kept silence for a time, that
he might not throw pearls before swine, and thus expose in a manner the holy
name of God to the insolence of the ungodly. He therefore waited until he might
again go forth with new messages, and thus secure more credit to himself. For
had he contended longer with Hananiah, contentions would have been kindled on
every side, there would have been no hearing in a tumult, and the Jews would
have wholly disregarded anything he might have then spoken. But as he had
withdrawn from the crowd, and was afterwards sent by God, the Jews could not
have so presumptuously despised him or his doctrine. This, then, was the reason
why he was for a short time silent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If he feared and trembled in the midst of these
commotions, God in due time confirmed him by giving him new commands:

from his neck. By these words he intimates, that the ungodly, however insolently
they may rise up against God, ever depart with shame and reproach. For Hananiah
had not only opposed Jeremiah by his words and tongue, but had also broken the
cords or bands from his neck. This, then, the Prophet now repeats, in order that
he might shew, as it were by his finger, that Hananiah by his audacity gained
nothing, except that he rendered his vanity more notorious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is an abrupt sentence when he says,

bands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>Jeremiah does not keep to the
same point; for in the first clause he relates what he had been commanded to say
to Hananiah; and in the second he relates what God had commanded him to do, even
iron bands. But there is no obscurity as to the meaning; for doubtless the

<div><font face="Palatino">It would have been a vain spectacle, had Jeremiah
brought only his iron band around his neck;<i> </i>but when he added an
explanation of the symbol, he no doubt prevailed on many to believe his
prophecy, and rendered those inexcusable who had hardened themselves in their
wickedness. But it is worthy of being observed, that God replaced the wooden
bands with iron bands; and he did this, because the whole people had through
their foolish and wicked consent approved of the madness of that impostor, who
had dared to profane that symbol, by which God had testified that he did not
speak in vain, but seriously by the mouth of his servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A profitable doctrine may be hence elicited, &#8212;
that the ungodly by barking against God gain nothing, except that they kindle
more and more his wrath, and thus render double their own evils, like a dog, who
being ensnared obstinately strives to extricate himself from the snare and to
shake it off, and thus strangles himself. In like manner the ungodly, the more
they resist God, the heavier judgment they procure for themselves. And,
therefore, whenever God declares to us that he is offended with our sins, we
ought to take heed, lest while we seek to break the wooden bands, he be
preparing and forming for us iron bands. Our condition will ever become worse,
unless we humbly deprecate God&#8217;s wrath as soon as it appears, and also
patiently submit to his scourges when he chastises us for our offenses. We ought
then to bear this in mind as to the wooden and iron bands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon the neck of all these
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Jews, as it has been
stated, hoped that Nebuchadnezzar could be in a moment driven back beyond the
Euphrates, and would be made to surrender other countries which he had occupied;
and all the neighboring nations had conspired, and sent ambassadors here and
there; and when the Amorites, the Moabites, and other nations gave encouragement
to the Jews, they also in their turn animated others, so that they might all
make an assault on the Babylonians. As, then, such a secret conspiracy gave
courage to the Jews, this was the reason why the Prophet spoke of other nations.
He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall serve
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had, indeed, already subdued all
these countries; but the Prophet means, that the domination of the king of
Babylon would continue, though Hananiah had said, that it would stand only for
two years. Continuance, then, is set in opposition to a short time, as though
the Prophet had said, &#8220;Let,<i> </i>indeed, the nations chafe and fret, but
they shall abide under the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar, and in vain shall they
attempt to extricate themselves, for God has delivered them up to
bondage.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This servitude may at the same time be explained in
another way; the condition of these nations was bearable, as long as
Nebuchadnezzar ordered tribute to be paid; and when he sent his prefects, the
object was no other than to retain possession; but when he found that they could
not be otherwise subdued than by a harder servitude, he began to exercise great
tyranny, though he had been before an endurable master. The same thing may be
also said of the Jews; for we know that they had been tributaries to the king of
Babylon; and as he had spared them, his humanity might have been deemed a sort
of liberty; but when he found that a hard wood could not be split but by a hard
wedge, he began more violently to oppress them. Then that servitude began which
is now mentioned. The Jews, therefore, began then really to serve the king of
Babylon, when he saw that they would not endure that bearable yoke which he had
laid on them, but in their obstinacy and pride ever struggled against
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The beast of the field have 1
also given him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he
indirectly upbraids the Jews, as we have before reminded you, with their
perverseness, because they perceived not that it was the righteous judgment of
God, that Nebuchadnezzar imposed laws on them as a conqueror; for they would
have been defended by a celestial aid, as it is said by Moses, had they not
deprived themselves of it.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052925&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

that Nebuchadnezzar invaded their country and conquered them. As they now
continued to bite and champ their bridle, the Prophet exposes their madness; for
they did not humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, while wild beasts,
void of reason and understanding, perceived that it happened through God&#8217;s
secret and wonderful providence, that Nebuchadnezzar took possession of these
lands. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet expressly mentioned wild
beasts, as though he said, that the Jews were so refractory, that there was in
them less reason, humility, and solicitude than in lions, bears, and animals of
the like kind; for through the secret impulse of God the wild beasts submitted
to the authority of King Nebuchadnezzar, while the Jews became more and more
insolent. It was the highest madness not to acknowledge God&#8217;s judgment,
while this was done by wild and savage animals. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">There would not have been weight enough in the plain
teaching of Jeremiah had he not confronted his adversary, as the case is at this
day with us; when insolent and unprincipled men rise up and dare to vomit forth
their blasphemies, by which they darken and degrade the doctrines of true
religion, we are under the necessity to contend with them, otherwise what we
teach would be ineffectual; for the minds of many, I mean the simple, are in
suspense and fluctuate when they see a great conflict between two contrary
parties. It was therefore necessary for the holy man to expose the lies of
Hananiah, for he ever vaunted himself and boasted of his own
predictions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what did Jeremiah say?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath not sent
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This refutation ought to be
noticed whenever we contend with Satan&#8217;s ministers and false teachers; for
whatever they may pretend, and with whatever masks they may cover their lies,
this one thing ought to be more than sufficient to put an end to their
boastings, &#8212; that they have not been sent by the Lord. Jeremiah might have
contended in a long speech with Hananiah, for he might have been made
sufficiently eloquent through the Holy Spirit suggesting and dictating whatever
was needful on the subject; but this concise brevity produced much greater
effect than if he had made great display and used many words. Let this, then, be
borne in mind, that wherever there is a controversy about religion, we ought
ever to ask whether he who speaks has been sent by God; for whatever he may
babble, though the most acute, and though he may talk things which may fill with
wonder the minds of the simple, yet all this is nothing but smoke when his
doctrine is not from God. So also we ought at this day to deal in a brief manner
with those mercenary dogs of the Pope who bark against the pure truth of the
Gospel; we ought to be satisfied with this compendious answer, &#8212; that God
is not their master and teacher. But as our state now is different from that of
the ancient people, we must observe that sent by the Lord is he only whose
doctrine is according<i> </i>to the rule of the Law, and of the Prophets, and of
the Gospel. If, then, we desire to know whom the Lord has sent, and whom he
approves as his servants, let us come to the Scripture, and let there be a
thorough examination; he who speaks according to the Law, the Prophets, and the
Gospel, has a sure and an indubitable evidence of his divine call; but he who
cannot prove that he draws what he advances from these fountains, whatever his
pretences may be, ought to be repudiated as a false prophet. We hence see what
an important instruction this passage contains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast made this people to
rely on falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They pervert the
meaning of the Prophet who thus render the words, &#8220;Thou hast falsely
rendered this people secure,&#8221; at least they lessen by one half what the
Prophet intended to express; for not only is Hananiah condemned because he
vainly and falsely pretended God&#8217;s name, but the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rq&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
shicor, </i>is introduced, the very thing employed; as though he had said,
&#8220;Thou feedest this people with a vain hope which thou hast formed in thine
own brains; therefore thy fictions make this people to go astray.&#8221; Hence
Jeremiah not only accused this impostor that he by his fictions deceived the
people, but also that he brought forward his prophecies in God&#8217;s name; and
these removed their fear and gave them some hope, so that the people became
torpid in their security.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this passage that we ought
especially to take heed when the ground of trust is the subject, lest we rely on
any empty or perishable thing, like wretched hypocrites who devour shadows only,
and afterwards find nothing solid in their own fictions. But when we refer to
trust, let there be something solid on which we can safely rely; and we know
that we cannot possibly be disappointed, if we look to God for all things, if we
recumb on his mercy alone; for there is no rest nor peace for us anywhere else
but in Christ. Let us then retain this object of trust, and let it be our only
support. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">All those who had disregarded Jeremiah saw, in a
manner, before their eyes the judgment of God. No surer confirmation could have
been expected by the Jews, had they a particle of understanding, than to see the
impostor slain by the word of Jeremiah alone; for he never touched him with a
finger, nor caused him to be led to punishment, though he deserved this; but he
drove him out of the world by the mere sound of his tongue. As, then, the word
of the holy Prophet had a celestial and divine power, as though God himself had
fulminated from heaven, or with an armed hand had slain that ungodly man, how
great was their blindness not to be moved! However, they were not moved; hence
some of the Rabbins, wishing to conceal, as their manner is, the reproach of
their own nation, imagine that the disciples of Hananiah secretly took away his
body, and that then the people knew nothing of his death. But what need is there
of such an evasion as this? for Jeremiah says no such thing, but speaks of the
event as well known; it was indeed a sure testimony of his own call. It hence
follows that it was not unknown to the Jews; and yet the devil had so blinded
the greatest part of them, that they paid no more attention to the holy man than
before; on the contrary, they wholly disregarded those threatenings of which he
had been the witness and herald.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how does this appear? the greatest part of the
people often rose up against him as though he was the most wicked of men; he was
accused as the betrayer of his country, and hardly escaped, through the clemency
of. a cruel king, when he was cast into a dungeon as one half-dead. Since, then,
the Jews thus pertinaciously raged, we hence understand what the Prophet so
often threatened them with, even with the spirit of giddiness, and of fury, and
of madness, and of stupor, and of drunkenness. Moreover, it was needful for that
small portion which was not wholly irreclaimable to be restored to the right
way; and this was done by this manifest proof of Jeremiah&#8217;s call. It was
also necessary on the other hand that the unbelieving should be more restrained,
so that they might be condemned by their own conscience, as Paul calls heretics
self-condemned who were become fixed in their own perverseness, and had
willingly and designedly sold themselves as slaves to the
devil.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet begins a new discourse, even that he
not only cried out constantly at Jerusalem, that the Jews who still remained
there should repent, but that he also mitigated the grief of the exiles, and
exhorted them to entertain the hope of returning, provided they patiently
endured the chastisement allotted to them. The design of the Prophet was at the
same time twofold; for he not only intended to mitigate by comfort the sorrow of
the exiles, but designed also to break down the obstinacy of his own nation, so
that they who still remained at Jerusalem and in Judea might know that nothing
would be better for them than to join themselves to their other brethren. The
Jews, as it has already appeared, and as we shall hereafter in many places see,
had set their minds on an unreasonable deliverance; God had fixed on seventy
years, but they wished immediately to break through and extricate themselves
from the yoke laid on them. Hence Jeremiah, in writing to the captives and
exiles, intended to accommodate what he said to the Jews who still remained at
Jerusalem, and who thought their case very fortunate, because they were not
driven away with their king and the rest of the multitude. But at the same time
his object was to benefit also the miserable exiles, who might have been
overwhelmed with despair, had not their grief been in some measure mitigated.
The Prophet, as we shall see, bids them to look forward to the end of their
captivity, and in the meantime exhorts them to patience, and desires them to be
quiet and peaceable, and not to raise tumults, until the hand of God was put
forth for their deliverance.</font><br></div>

conclude that his prophecy was designed for them all; and yet he afterwards
says, &#8220;Take wives and propagate;&#8221; but this, as we shall see, is to
be confined to those who were at that time in a fit age for marriage. He did not
however wish to exclude the aged from the comfort of which God designed them to
be partakers, and that by knowing that there would be a happy end to their
captivity, provided they retained resignation of mind and patiently bore the
punishment of God justly due to them for having so often and in such various
ways provoked him. Then he adds,

fE200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is yet probable that they are also
included here who were endued with God&#8217;s Spirit, either because the spirit
was languid in them, or because God did not always grant to them the knowledge
of everything. It might then be that the prophets, to whom God had not made
known this, or whose minds were oppressed with evils, were to be
taught.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the priests, we hence conclude that they had
from the beginning neglected their office, for they would have been God&#8217;s
prophets, had they faithfully performed their sacerdotal office; and it was, as
it were, an extraordinary thing when God chose other prophets, and not without
reproach to the priests; for they must have become degenerated and idle or
deceptive, when they gloried in the name alone, when they were destitute of the
truth. This then was the reason why they were to be taught in common with the

<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions the time when the book was sent, even
after the calamity which had happened, when King Jeconiah and his mother were
driven into exile, and Zedekiah, his successor, was made governor in his place,
as we shall presently see. It was then during these beginnings of a change that
Jeremiah wrote. All things were then in such a ferment, that some feared more
than what was necessary, and others entertained vain hopes, as the case usually
is in a disordered state of things. It was then after this fresh calamity that
Jeremiah wrote, as his words most especially shew. He might indeed, as in other
instances, have mentioned the year; but as he plainly declares that this
happened after the departure of Jeconiah, his purpose is sufficiently evident,
even that he wished in due time to give some relief to their sorrow, who might
have succumbed under it, had not God in a manner stretched forth his hand to
them. For we know that fresh grief is difficult to be borne; and hence it is
that it is called a bitter grief; for it was a grievous novelty, when they were
violently and suddenly dragged out of their quiet nests. It was then
Jeremiah&#8217;s object at that time to give them some comfort; he also saw that
those who were left in Judea were greatly disturbed and continually agitating
new schemes; for Zedekiah&#8217;s kingdom was not as yet established, and they
despised him and were ever looking for their own king. As, then, things were
thus in disorder at home, and as the miserable exiles especially, were at first
very grievously afflicted, Jeremiah set before them a seasonable remedy. This

doubt but that in sending his ambassadors he intended to obtain favor with King
Nebuchadnezzar, by whose nod he had come to the throne; for he was not of such
dignity as to be made king, though of the royal seed, had not Nebuchadnezzar
thought that it would be more advantageous to himself. For had he appointed any
other governor over the Jews, a sedition might have been easily raised; he
therefore intended in a measure to pacify them, for he knew that they were a
very refractory people. However, Zedekiah ruled only by permission, not through
his own power, nor on account of his wealth, but through the good pleasure of a
conqueror. He then sent his ambassadors to promise all kinds of homage, and to
know what was to be done in future. As, then, he did not wish the return of
Jeconiah, he permitted his ambassadors to carry the letter of Jeremiah, not
indeed that he wished to obey God. It was not, then, owing to any sincere regard
for religion, but because he thought that it would be advantageous to him, that
the Jews<i> </i>should remain in Chaldea till the death of Jeconiah; for he thus
hoped that his kingdom would be confirmed, for Jeconiah was, as it were, his
rival. Nor is there a doubt, but that Nebuchadnezzar wished to hold Zedekiah
bound by this fetter; for he could any day restore Jeconiah, who was his
captive, to his former state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, then, we understand why Zedekiah did not
prohibit Jeremiah&#8217;s letter to be carried to the captives: he thought that
it would serve to tranquilize his kingdom. But the holy Prophet had another
thing in view; for his anxious object was, not to gain the favor of the king,
but to shew, as God had commanded him, how long the captivity would be. Zedekiah
indeed might have wished that a permission should be given to the exiles to
return; for those who remained in Judea were only the dregs and offscourings of
society; it was not an honorable state of things: and it may be that he had also
this in view, in sending ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar, that Jerusalem might not
remain desolate, but that a portion at least of the exiles might return, and
that there might also be some to cultivate the land which had been nearly
stripped of its inhabitants. But Jeremiah declared what he knew was by no means
acceptable to the king, that a return was in vain expected before the
termination of seventy years. We hence see that he spoke nothing to gain the
favor of the king; and yet the king did not regard with displeasure, that the
letter was sent to allay all commotions, and to restrain all the violence of
those who would have been otherwise too prone to make some new attempts. This
accounts for the circumstance, that the letter was sent by the hand of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elasah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gemariah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, at the same time, that they were sent by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zedekiah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, to gain the favor of King Nebuchadnezzar, or, at least, to secure
his friendship. I now come to the message itself:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God commanded the captives to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>build houses
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in Chaldea, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plant
vineyards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and also to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>marry
wives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beget
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though they were at home.
It was not, indeed, God&#8217;s purpose that they should set their hearts on
Chaldea, on the contrary, they were ever to think of their return: but until the
end of the seventy years, it was God&#8217;s will that they should continue
quiet, and not attempt this or that, but carry on the business of life as though
they were in their own country. As to their hope, then, it was God&#8217;s will
that their minds should be in a state of suspense until the time of
deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the first view these two things seemed
inconsistent, &#8212; that the Jews were to live seventy years as though they
were the natives of the place, and that their habitations were not to be
changed, &#8212; and yet that they were ever to look forward to a return. But
these two things can well agree together: it was a proof of obedience when they
acknowledged that they were chastised by God&#8217;s hand, and thus became
willingly submissive to the end of the seventy years. But their hope, as I have
just observed, was to remain in suspense, in order that they might not be
agitated with discontent, nor be led away by some violent feeling, but that they
might so pass their time as to bear their exile in such a way as to please God;
for there was a sure hope of return, provided they looked forward, according to
God&#8217;s will, to the end of the seventy years. It is then this subject on
which Jeremiah now speaks, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Build houses, and dwell in them;
plant vineyards, and eat of their fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For this whole discourse is to be referred to the time of exile, he having
beforehand spoken of their return; and this we shall see in its proper
place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Jews could not have hoped for anything good,
except they were so resigned as to bear their correction, and thus really proved
that they did not reject the punishment laid on them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that Jeremiah did not encourage the Jews
to indulge in pleasures, nor persuade them to settle for ever in Chaldea. It
was, indeed, a fertile and pleasant land; but he did not encourage them to live
there in pleasure, to indulge themselves and to forget their own country; by no
means: but he confined what he said to the time of the captivity, to the end of
the seventy years. During that time, then, he wished them to enjoy the land of
Chaldea, and all its advantages, as though they were not exiles but natives of
the place. For what purpose? not that they might give themselves up to sloth,
but that they might not, by raising commotions, offend God, and in a manner
close up against themselves the door of his grace, for the time which he had
fixed was to be expected. For when we are driven headlong by a vehement desire,
we in a manner repel the favor of God; we do not then suffer him to act as it
becomes him: and when we take away from him his own rights and will, it is the
same as though we were unwilling to receive his grace. This would have been the
case, had they not quietly and resignedly endured their calamity in Chaldea to
the end of the time which had been fixed by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive that the Prophet&#8217;s message
referred only to the time of exile; and we also perceive what was the design of
it, even to render them obedient to God, that they might thus shew by their
patience that they were really penitent, and that they also expected a return in
no other way than through God&#8217;s favor alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In bidding them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take wives
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for their sons, and to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give
</i></font><font face="Palatino">their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughters
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in marriage, he speaks according to the usual
order of nature; for it would be altogether unreasonable for young men and young
women to seek partners for themselves, according to their own humor and fancy.
God then speaks here according to the common order of things, when he bids young
men not to be otherwise joined in marriage than by the consent of parents, and
that young women are not to marry but those to whom they are
given.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ye multiplied there and not
diminished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that
the time of exile would be so long, that except they propagated, they would soon
come to nothing: and God expressed this, because it was not his will that
Abraham&#8217;s seed should fail. It was indeed a kind of death, when he had
driven them so far, as though he had deprived them of the inheritance which he
had promised to be perpetual: he, however, administers comfort here by
commanding them to propagate their kind: for they could not have been encouraged
to do so, except they had their eyes directed to the hope of a return. He then
afforded them some taste of his mercy when he bade them not to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>diminished

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes still farther, even that the Jews had
been led to Babylon, on the condition of rendering willing obedience to the
authority of King Nebuchadnezzar, and of testifying this by their prayers. He
not only bids them patiently to endure the punishment laid on them, but also to
be faithful subjects of their conqueror; he not only forbids them to be
seditious, but he would have them to obey from the heart, so that God might be a

he would have them to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pray

for we must bear in mind that the Prophet had ever that time in view. We hence
learn that he exhorted the exiles to bear the yoke of the king of Babylon,
during the time allotted to the captivity, for to attempt anything rashly was to
fight against God, and that he thus far commanded them quietly to bear that
tyrannical government.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats again what he had said, (though I had

might not regard only the avarice, or the ambition, or the pride of King
Nebuchadnezzar, but that they might raise up their eyes to heaven, and
acknowledge Nebuchadnezzar as the scourge of God, and their exile as a
chastisement for their sins. God thus testified that he was the author of their
exile, that the Jews might not think that they had to do with a mortal man, but
on the contrary, understand that they were kicking against the goad, if they
murmured and complained, because they lived under the tyranny of a foreign king.
That they might not then be agitated with vain thoughts, God comes forth and
says, that the exile was imposed on them by his just judgment, in order that
they might know that they would gain nothing by their perverseness, and that
they might not be disturbed by an anxious disquietude, nor dare to attempt
anything new, for this would be to resist God, and as it were to carry on war
with heaven. I will finish here.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND TENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last Lecture we did not finish the seventh
verse, in which the Prophet says that the Jews, as long as God would have them
to be exiles, were to be so fixed in Babylon, that they ought to have deemed
their union such, as though they were of the same body. For by saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their peace
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would be in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Babylon, he intimates that they could not be
considered as a separate people until the time of seventy years was completed.
He therefore commanded them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pray
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for the prosperity of Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the first view this may seem hard; for we know how
cruelly that miserable people had been treated by the Chaldeans. Then to pray
for the most savage enemies, might have appeared unreasonable and by no means
suitable. But the Prophet mitigates the hardness of the work by saying, that it
would be profitable to them to pray for the happy condition of Babylon, inasmuch
as they were the associates of their fortune. We know how much the prospect of
what is profitable avails to persuade us, as we think not of undertaking
anything except what we deem will be successful. For this reason then the
Prophet teaches the Jews that they ought not to refuse what was required from
them, when God bade them to pray for Babylon, because the prosperity of that
kingdom would be for their benefit, he intimates also, as I have already hinted,
that they were so connected with</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Babylon, that they could not expect to be exempt from
all trouble and annoyance, if any adversity happened to Babylon, for they were
of the same body. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may hence deduce a very useful doctrine,
&#8212; that we ought not only to obey the kings under whose authority we live,
but that we ought also to pray for their prosperity, so that God may be a
witness of our voluntary subjection. For if it was the duty of the Jews to pray
for the wellbeing of the Chaldeans for this reason, because they were for a
certain time under their authority, there is no excuse for us, when we live
under any legitimate prince, and that not only for a few days, unless we testify
our voluntary submission before God; and he who prays to God for the happy state
of the country in which he lives, will not surely neglect his other
duties.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE206</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The principal thing indeed is to
testify before God what our feeling is; and then other things must be added,
such as promptitude to perform all duties of obedience and everything of the
like kind. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As the minds of almost all were taken up, as we have
seen, with that vain and false confidence which they had imbibed from false
prophecies, that they should return after two years, the Prophet gives this
answer, and reminds them to beware of such impostures. And thus we see that it
is not sufficient for one simply to teach what is right, except he also restores
from error those who have been already deceived or are in danger of being
deceived. For to assert the truth is only one-half of the office of teaching,
because Satan ever leads his ministers to corrupt the pure doctrine with
falsehoods. It is not then enough to proclaim the truth itself, except all the
fallacies of the devil be also dissipated, of which there is at this day a
manifest instance under the Papacy; for as the minds of almost all are there
inebriated with many corrupt inventions, were any one only to shew that this or
that is right, he would certainly never in this way eradicate errors from the
hearts of men. And hence Paul bids bishops not only to be furnished with
doctrine in order to shew the right way to the teachable, but also to be so
armed as to be able to resist adversaries and to close their mouths.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Inasmuch then as from the beginning of the world
Satan has never ceased to try and attempt, as far as he could, to corrupt the
truth of God, or to immerse it in darkness, it has hence been always necessary
for God&#8217;s servants to be prepared to do these two things &#8212;
faithfully to teach the meek and humble, &#8212; and boldly to oppose the
enemies of truth and break down their insolence. This is the rule which the
Prophet now follows; he had exhorted the Jews to bear patiently the tyranny to
which they were subject, because it was God&#8217;s yoke; but as on the other
hand the false prophets boasted that there would be a return in two years, it
was necessary for him to oppose them; on this point then he now
speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that what he was going to say might have more
weight, he speaks again in God&#8217;s name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not your prophets who are in
the midst of you deceive you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For while
Jeremiah had many adversaries at Jerusalem, the devil was also deceiving the
miserable exiles in Chaldea. He then warns them not to believe these impostors;
and though by way of concession he calls them prophets who were wholly unworthy
of so honorable a name, he yet by way of reproach gives them afterwards the name
of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>diviners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Then the first name refers to that outward profession in which they gloried,
when they boasted that they were sent by God and brought his commands. He then
conceded to them the name of prophets, but improperly, or as they say,
catachristically; as the case is at this day; for we do not always fight about
names, but we call those priests, bishops or prelates, who are so brutal that
they ought not to be classed among men. In like manner, as it has already often
appeared, the prophets spoke freely, and never hesitated to call those prophets
who had already gained some estimation among the people. But that they might not
be proud of such fallacious boasting, he afterwards designated them by another
name; he called them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>diviners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dreamers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and afterwards he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Attend not to your
dreams</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He addresses here the whole
people; and there were a few who, under the color and pretense of having a
prophetic spirit, announced prophecies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah did not without reason transfer to the
whole people what belonged to a few; for we know that the devil&#8217;s
ministers are cherished not only through the foolish credulity of men, but also
through a depraved appetite. For the world is never
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceived
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but willingly, and men, as though they were
given up to their own destruction, seek for themselves falsehoods in every
direction, and though unwilling to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>they yet for the most part seek to be deceived. Were any one to ask, does
the world wish to be deceived? all would cry out, from the least to the
greatest, that they shun and fear nothing so much; and yet whence is it that as
soon as Satan gives any sign, he attracts vast multitudes, except that we are by
nature prone to what is false and vain? Then there is another evil, that we
prefer darkness to light. Jeremiah then did no wrong to the people by telling
them to beware of the dreams which, they dreamt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some indeed take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymljm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mechelmim, </i>in a transitive sense, as it is in <i>Hiphil, </i>and ought to

mechelimim; </i>but it may be taken in the neuter
gender.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fE207</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, the meaning of the Prophet is
not ambiguous; for he imputes this to all the Jews, that they were deceived by
vain dreams, and that the fault could not be confined to a few impostors, for it
was an evil common to them all. And the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ta</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
atere, </i>is emphatical,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>,
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he sets these false dreams in
opposition to prophecies. We know that God formerly revealed his will either by
visions or by dreams. There were then dreams, which were divine, of which God
was the author. But he shews here that the people devised all these impostures
for themselves, so that it availed them nothing to pretend that they were
prophets, the interpreters of God, and that they announced what they had
received by dreams; for what makes the difference is, whether one dreams from
his own brain, or whether God reveals to him in a dream what ought to be deemed
oracular. We now then understand the design of the Prophet. It follows, &#8212;

23:21. He then repudiates these false prophets, for they spoke not from the
mouth of God. But the difference was rendered very obscure and indistinct, when
they pompously alleged the name of God and professed that they brought forward
nothing but what they had learnt from him; yet as we have elsewhere said, no one
can be deceived except willingly and knowingly; for God never leaves his
faithful people destitute of the spirit of discernment, provided they offer
themselves cordially and sincerely to be taught by his true and legitimate
servants. And then the Jews ought to have examined all the doctrines and all the
prophecies by the rule of the Law. But if the Law was difficult to be
understood, they ought, as I have said, to have sought of God the spirit of
wisdom and discernment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah then did not without reason reject whatever
the false prophets boasted of, for the purpose of gaining the approbation and
applause of the people; for they were not sent nor approved by God. So also at
this day, every one who wishes to distinguish with certainty between various
doctrines, by which the world is agitated, nay, shaken, can without difficulty
attain his object, provided he offers himself as a scholar to Christ, and
connects the Law and the Prophets with the Gospel, and makes use of this rule to
prove all doctrines; and provided in the meantime he trusts not to his own
acumen, but submits himself to God and seeks of him the spirit of judgment and
discrimination. It ought also to be observed, that in the same way the false
prophets can be abundantly exposed when we thus shew that they are not sent by
God; and we further convince them of vanity, when we prove their doctrine to be
inconsistent with the Law and the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, this principle ought to be held,
that none ought to be attended to, but those who can shew that they bring
messages from God and are furnished with his word. We have said elsewhere, that
in order that any one may be <i>accounted </i>as sent by God, it is necessary,
first, that he should be rightly called, and secondly, that he should faithfully
execute his office; for whosoever thrusts in himself without the command of God,
though he may speak what is true and holy, he yet deserves not the name of a
Prophet or teacher; and then vocation itself will not be sufficient, except
there be faithfulness and integrity. But what Jeremiah mainly insists on here
is, that those who promised the people a return in a short time did not speak
from the mouth of God: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
prophesy falsely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">In order to expose the dreams by which the false
prophets had inebriated the people, he again repeats what he had said, that the
end of their exile could not be expected until the end of seventy years. And
this way of teaching ought to be particularly observed, for the truth of God
will ever avail to dissipate all the mists in which Satan never ceases to
envelop the pure truth. As then we have before seen, that when the people are
imbued with any error, it ought to be boldly resisted; so now we see with what
weapons all God&#8217;s servants ought to fight, in order to expose all those
fallacies by which pure doctrine is assailed, even by setting in opposition to
them the word of God: for this is the way which Jeremiah points out to us by his
own example. He had spoken of the false prophets, he warned the people not to
believe them; but as the minds of many were still vacillating, he confirms what
he had said that they were not sent by God, because God never varies in his
purpose, and never changes, and is never inconsistent with himself: &#8220;Now
he has prefixed seventy years for your exile; whoever, then, tries to impugn
that truth, is a professed and an open enemy to God.&#8221; We now perceive<i>
</i>the object of the Prophet;

fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">  fE208</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here puts a restraint on the Jews, that
they might not hasten before the time; and then he gives them the hope of a
return, provided they quietly rested until the end fixed on by God. There are
then two things in this verse, &#8212; that the people would ill consult their
own good, if they hastened and promised to themselves a return before the end of
seventy years, &#8212; and that when that time was completed, the hope of a
return would be certain, for God had so promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will raise up my good word
towards you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good word
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he means what might bring joy to the Jews.
Though God&#8217;s word is fatal to the unbelieving, yet it never changes its
nature; it ever remains good. And hence Paul says that the Gospel is a fatal
odor to many, but that it is, nevertheless, a sweet odor before God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16;) for it ought to be imputed to the fault of those who perish,
that they receive not the doctrine of the Gospel to their own salvation. The
word of God is then always good: but this commendation is to be referred to
experience, that is, when God really shews that he is propitious to us. And a
shorter definition cannot be given, than that the good word denotes the
promises, by which God testifies his paternal favor. But we have seen elsewhere
that threatenings are called an evil word: why so? This character cannot,
indeed, as it has been just said, be suitably applied to God&#8217;s word; yet
God&#8217;s word which threatens destruction is called evil, as it is
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am he who create
good and evil,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
45:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but it is so according to our apprehension of its
effects. And all this reasoning seems nearly superfluous, when we understand
that God by the word of evil strikes the unbelieving with fear, but that the
Prophet now means no other thing than to bear testimony to God&#8217;s favor to
the Jews: and hence he says, that they would find by experience, that God had
not in vain promised what he had before mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he is said to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rouse
up</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE209</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>his good word, that is, when it
produced its effects before their eyes; for when God only speaks, and the thing
itself does not yet appear, his word seems in a manner to he dormant and to be
useless. And for seventy years the Jews could perceive no other thing than that
God was displeased with them, and thus they were continually in fear; for the
promise continued as it were dormant, as its effects were not as yet visible.
God then is said to rouse up his word, when he proves that he has not promised
anything in vain. The meaning is, that the prophecy which Jeremiah had related
would not be fruitless; but if the people did not soon know this, yet God, when
the time came, would really prove that he deceives not his people, nor allures
them when he promises anything, by vain hopes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet explains himself, for he says that
God would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>restore
</i></font><font face="Palatino">them to their own country: for this was the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the promise of deliverance, as the
word, according to what the people felt, was evil, and bitter, and bad, when God
had threatened that he would cast away the reprobate. But it is an accidental
thing, as I have said, that men find God&#8217;s word to be evil for them or
adverse to them; for it proceeds from their own fault, and not from the nature
of the word. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same thing, and employs many words,
because it was difficult to raise up minds wholly broken down. For the world
labors under two extreme evils, &#8212; they sink in despair, or are too much
exalted by foolish pride: nay, there is no moderation except when ruled by
God&#8217;s Spirit we recumb on his word; for when they devise vain hopes for
themselves, they are immediately rapt up above the clouds, fly here and there,
and in short think that they can climb into heaven; this is the excess of vain
and foolish confidence: but when they are dejected, then they fall down wholly
frightened, nay, being astonished and lifeless they lose every feeling, receive
no comfort, and cannot taste of anything which God promises. And both these
evils prevailed evidently among the Jews. We have seen how much the Prophet
labored to lay prostrate their pride and arrogance; for they laughed at all
threatenings, and remained ever secure; though God, as it were, with an armed
hand and a drawn sword menaced them with certain destruction, yet nothing moved
them. And when they were driven into exile, they were extremely credulous when
the false prophets promised them a quick return; while, in the meantime, God, by
his servants, shewed to them that he would be gracious to them, and after
seventy years would become their deliverer; but they were deaf to all these
things, nay, they rejected with disdain all these promises, and
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What!<i> </i>will
God, forsooth, raise up the
dead!&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
37:12)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is the reason why the Prophet now speaks
so largely of their future redemption: it was difficult to persuade the Jews;
for as they thought that they would soon return to their own country, they could
not endure delay, nor exercise the patience which God commanded. They were at
the same time, as we have said, quite confident, inasmuch as the false prophets
filled their minds with vain hopes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I know the thoughts which I think
towards you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some think that God claims
here, as what peculiarly belongs to him, the foreknowledge of future things; but
this is foreign to the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. There is here, on the contrary,
an implied contrast between the certain counsel of God, and the vain
imaginations in which the Jews indulged themselves. The same thing is meant when
Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;As<i> </i>far as
the heavens are from the earth, so far are my thoughts from your
thoughts,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
55:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for they were wont absurdly to measure God by their
own ideas. When anything was promised, they reasoned about its validity, and
looked on all surrounding circumstances; and thus they consulted only their own
brains. Hence God reproved them, and shewed how preposterously they acted, and
said, that his thoughts were as remote from their thoughts as heaven is from the
earth. So also in this place, though the two parts are not here expressed; the
Prophet&#8217;s object was no other than to shew, that the Jews ought to have
surrendered themselves to God, and not to seek to be so acute as to understand
how this or that would be done, but to feel convinced that what God had decreed
could not be changed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must yet be remarked, that he speaks not here of
his hidden and incomprehensible counsel. What then are the thoughts of which
Jeremiah now speaks? They were those respecting the people&#8217;s deliverance,
after the time was completed, for God had promised that he would then be
propitious to his Church. We hence see that the question here is not about the
hidden counsels of God, but that the reference is simply to the word which was
well known to the Jews, even to the prophecy of Jeremiah, by which he had
predicted that the Jews would be exiles for seventy years, and would at last
find that their punishment would be only a small chastisement, as it would only
be for a time: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I know
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my
thoughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But still he indirectly
condemns the Jews, because they entertained no hope of deliverance except from
what came within the reach of their senses. He then teaches us that true wisdom
is to obey God, and to surrender ourselves to him; and that when we understand
not his counsel, we ought resignedly to wait until the due time shall
come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thoughts of

<div><font face="Palatino">that is, if Babylon be prosperous, you shall be
partakers of the same happiness. So now, in this place, God declares that his
thoughts were those of peace, for he designed really to shew by the effect his
paternal kindness towards his people.</font><br></div>

the end, as though he had said, that it was to be deemed as final ruin, when
people had been driven away to a foreign land. For it was no small trial when
the Jews were deprived of that land which was the rest and habitation of God; it
was the same as though they had been cut off from every hope: it was then a sort
of repudiation, and repudiation was a kind of death. But here God declares that
he would put an end to their exile, as it was to be only for a time. It is hence
to be inferred, that the people did not perish when they were led into exile,
but that they were only chastised by God&#8217;s hand.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah pursues the same subject, even that the
Jews, after having undergone the punishment allotted to them by God, would at
length return to their own country and find God merciful, and hence learn that
their chastisement in exile would prove useful to them. He had indeed in the
last verse explained this with sufficient clearness, but he now expresses the
manner; and that would be by calling on God. he uses two words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall call on
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, and pray. The verb put
between these two
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;tklh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>elcatem, </i>is regarded almost by all as referring to a right course of
life, as though the Prophet had said, that those who before wandered after their
own lusts would now walk in the way of God, that is, in his Law; but this seems
to me to be too forced an explanation. I doubt not then, but that the Prophet
here indirectly reproves the indifference of the people in not immediately
acknowledging that they were chastised by God&#8217;s hand, that they ought in
due time to repent. To <i>go </i>then or to walk is the same thing, in my
judgment, as though he had said, &#8220;After having suffered the exile, not of
one year, but of seventy years, ye shall then begin to be
wise.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was not only sloth but stupidity, that they were
not subdued by God&#8217;s scourges so as to call on him; but as they were of a
disposition so rude and refractory the Prophet here briefly reminds them that
many years had been necessary to subdue them, as twenty or thirty years were not
sufficient. We now then understand the design of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qlh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>elek, to </i>walk.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> 
fE212</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The meaning then is, that after having
profited under the scourges of God, they would become humble so as to deprecate
his wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is added a promise, that God would <i>hear
</i>them. It may however appear, that God promised conversion even in the first
clause; and, no doubt, prayer is the fruit of repentance, for it proceeds from
faith; and repentance is the gift of God. And further, we cannot call on God
rightly and sincerely except by the guidance and teaching of the Holy Spirit;
for he it is who not only dictates our words, but also creates groanings in our
hearts. And thus <i>Augustin, </i>writing against the Pelagians, understands the
passage, and proves that it is not in the power of man either to convert himself
or to pray; &#8220;for God,&#8221; he says, &#8220;would in vain promise what is
in the power of man to do; and this is the promise, <i>ye shall pray; </i>it
then follows, that we do not pray through the impulse of our own flesh, but when
the Holy Spirit directs our hearts, and in a manner prays in us.&#8221; I<i>
</i>do not, however, know whether the Prophet intended to speak in so refined a
manner. From other passages of Scripture it is easy to prove, that we cannot
pray to God, except he anticipates us by his own Spirit. But as to this passage,
I prefer to take a simpler meaning, that God would <i>hear, </i>when they began
to pray; but yet he shews that it would not be after a short space of time,
because they were almost untameable, and would not repent until after many
years. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms in other words the same thing; and yet
the repetition, as we said yesterday, is not useless; for as the Jews perversely
despised all threatenings, so it was difficult for them to receive any taste of
God&#8217;s goodness from his promises. This then is the reason why the Prophet
employs many words on this subject. By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he means prayers and supplications, as mentioned in the last verse. And
Christ also, exhorting his disciples to pray, says, &#8220;Seek<i> </i>and ye
shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you.&#8221;<i> </i>There is no doubt
but that he speaks there of prayer; he yet adopted various modes of speaking,
derived from the common habits of men. But to seek, when we feel the need of
God&#8217;s grace, is nothing else than to pray. Hence the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall seek me and ye shall
find me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And though he addresses here
the Israelites, yet this doctrine ought to be extended to the whole Church; for

him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as hypocrites are abundantly noisy, and seem to
surpass the very saints in the ardor of their zeal, when the external profession

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall seek me with your

the Jews groaned a thousand times every year when oppressed by the Chaldeans;
for they had to bear all kind of reproaches, and then they had nothing safe or
secure. They were therefore under the necessity, except they were harder than
iron, to offer some prayers. But God shews that the seasonable time would not
come, until their prayers proceeded from a right feeling; this he means by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is indeed certain that men
never turn to God with their whole heart, nor is the whole heart ever so much
engaged in prayer as it ought to be; but the Prophet sets the whole heart in
opposition to a double heart. Perfection, then, is not what is to be understood
here, which can never be found in men, but integrity or
sincerity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the
Prophet&#8217;s words, &#8212; that the Jews, when they began in earnest to flee
to God, would find him propitious, provided only they did this in sincerity of
heart and not in dissimulation; and also that this would not take place soon,
for their hardness and obstinacy were greater than that they could be brought to
repent in a short time. Therefore God reminds them that there was need of many
evils, so that they might at length turn and divest themselves of that
perverseness to which they had wholly surrendered themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the whole of this, as I have already observed,
ought to be applied to the benefit of the Church; for this promise is to be
extended to all the godly, &#8212; that when they call on God in their miseries,
he will hear them. And Jeremiah seems to have taken this sentence from
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;As soon as thou
callest on me, I will hear thee; before thou speakest, I will stretch forth my
hand.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
58:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this circumstance also ought to be noticed, that
the Prophet addressed the Jews who were miserably oppressed. Let us then know
that this sentence is rightly addressed to those in distress, who seem to have
God against them and displeased with them; and this is the seasonable time which
is mentioned by David in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
32:6.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage also teaches us, that it is no wonder
that the Lord doubles his scourges and does not immediately pardon us, because
we are not so ready to bend as to return to him on the first day. He is
therefore constrained by our perverseness to chastise us for a longer time; and
yet this promise is still to be held valid, that if we even late repent, God
will be still propitious to us, only that the reprobate are not under this
pretext to indulge in their vices; for we see that profane men trifle with God,
and wickedly abuse his paternal indulgence. Let the sinner then beware lest he
should lay up for himself a store of vengeance, if he waits till the end of
life. But there is still a hope set before those who have been long torpid in
their sins, that if they at length come, though late, they shall still come in
time, for God will hear them. But the exception ought to be carefully observed,
that God will not be intreated, except he is sought with the whole heart, that
is, in sincerity. So there is no reason for us to wonder that his ears are often
closed to our prayers, because we only pretend to seek him, and that we are
endued with no sincerity appears from our life. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now applies what he seemed to have spoken
generally. He then shews the effect of God&#8217;s favor, after having been
reconciled to his people, even that he would re<i>store </i>their captivity, and
gather them from all places. This was particularly said to the Jews; but the two
former verses contain, as I have said, a general doctrine. He had before said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall find
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but he says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall be found by
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, I will shew myself to you.
There is an implied contrast between the hiding and the manifestation, for God
had in a manner hid himself during the time of exile; but he suddenly made his
face to shine forth, and thus manifested himself as a Father, after having
apparently forgotten his people. Suitably then does the Prophet speak here; for
though the Lord ever looks on us, we on the other hand do not see him, nay, we
think that he is far from us. But he then only appears to us, when we perceive
that he cares for our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from all nations and from all
places</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he evidently obviated a doubt
which otherwise might have crept into the minds of many, &#8220;How can it ever
be that God will gather us after we have been thus dispersed?&#8221; For no
certain region had been allotted to them, in which they might dwell together so
as to form one body; but they had been scattered as by a violent whirlwind like
chaff or stubble; and God had so driven them away that there was no hope of
being again gathered. As then it was incredible, that a people so dispersed
could be collected together, the Prophet says, &#8220;from all nations and from
all places.&#8221; The same thing is declared in the Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He<i> </i>will
gather the dispersions of Israel.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
147:2)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For when the Jews looked on their dreadful
dispersion, they could entertain no hope. We see then how the Prophet encouraged
them still to hope, and bade them to struggle against this trial. The sentence
seems to have been taken from Moses, for he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though you be
scattered through the extreme parts of the world, yet God will gather
you.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:1-3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that Moses there expressly reproves the
unbelief of the people, if they despaired of God&#8217;s mercy and salvation,
because they were torn and scattered. he therefore shews that God&#8217;s power
was abundantly sufficient to collect them again, though they were scattered to
the four quarters of the world. We now perceive the object of the
Prophet.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">  fE213</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence we may gather a useful doctrine, &#8212;
that<i> </i>God in a wonderful manner gathers his Church when scattered, so as
to form it into one body, however he may for a time obliterate its name and even
its very appearance. And of this he has given us some proof in our time. For who
could have thought that what we now see with our eyes, would ever take place?
that God would in a secret manner gather his elect, when there was everywhere a
dreadful desolation, and no corner found in the world where two or three
faithful men could dwell together. We hence see that this prophecy has not been
fulfilled only at one time, but that the grace of God is here set forth, which
he has often manifested, and still manifests in gathering his Church. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Many interpreters connect the first of these verses
with the preceding ones, and they seem not to think so without reason; for the
reason given is not unsuitable, if we refer to what the Prophet had said, even
that the Jews were by no means to hope for a return until the end of seventy
years. But the meaning I adopt is more probable; the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>is repeated; the first is causal, and the second an
illative;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE214</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and consistently with the usage of
Scripture the learned and the experienced think that this is the real meaning of
the Prophet. He then says, that the captives were very foolish who hoped for a
quick end to their exile, because they had false prophets who gave them such a
promise; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said, that prophets have been
given you, in Chaldea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that God had
there pitied you, because there are those who prophesy of a return in a short
time. As then ye are so foolishly credulous,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah to your
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he then turns his discourse to
the exiles, and exhorts them not to suffer themselves to be led astray. But here
he indirectly reproves them, because they could not bear a condition which was
even better than that of the residue, as though he had said, &#8220;What means
this your unreasonableness! that when all your ways are closed up against you,
and the power of your conqueror is so great that ye cannot move a finger without
his nod, ye should yet think that you shall be set free in two years! and surely
if you were before foolishly secure and confident, your calamities ought now to
make you humble. But your brethren, who seem yet to enjoy liberty because they
dwell at Jerusalem, (for those alone were then remaining,) even these your
brethren suffer far more grievously than ye do.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive for what purpose the Prophet, after
having addressed the captives, turned his discourse to King Zedekiah and to the
Jews, who as yet remained at home or in their own country; it was, that the
captives might hence know how great was their madness to promise to themselves a
return, after having been driven to remote lands, when final ruin was nigh both
the king and the people, who as yet remained at Jerusalem;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saith Jehovah to the king who
sits on the throne of David, and to all the people who sit in this city,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To <i>sit, </i>as I have already said, is to be taken
here in two different senses; the king is said to sit on his throne while he
retains his dignity; but the people are said to sit while they rest and dwell
quietly in any place. It is not without reason that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is here expressly mentioned, for the exiles
were ever wont to connect it with the hope of their return; &#8220;The<i>
</i>Temple still remains, God is there worshipped, and the kingdom still exists;
these things being secure, it cannot be all over with our nation.&#8221; The
safety of the people depended on the kingdom and the priesthood. When therefore,
on the one hand, they fixed their eyes on royalty, and on the other hand, on the
priesthood and sacrifices, they felt persuaded that it could not be otherwise
but that God would soon restore them; for God had promised that the kingdom of
David would be perpetual, as long as the sun and moon would shine in heaven.
Except then this splendor or glory had been extinguished, the Israelites could
not have been humiliated, especially as those who had been led into exile were
of the tribe of Judah. We now understand why the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was expressly mentioned. Though, then, a king
still sat on the throne of David, he yet declares that his condition and that of
his people was harder than that of the captive multitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pursue them with the
sword, and famine, and pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
surrender of Jeconiah, as we have elsewhere seen, was voluntary; he was
therefore more kindly received by the king of Babylon. At length the city was
attacked, and as the siege was long, there was more rage felt against the king
and the whole people, for the Chaldeans had been wearied by their obstinacy.
Hence it was, that they dealt more severely with them. But nothing happened
except through the just vengeance of God; for though they exasperated the
Chaldeans, there is no doubt but that God blinded their minds so that they
procured for themselves a heavier judgment. It was, then, a punishment inflicted
on them by God; and hence rightly does Jeremiah testify that God was the author
of those calamities, for the Chaldeans, as we have seen elsewhere, were only
ministers and executioners of God&#8217;s vengeance;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of hosts
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>says, Behold, I will pursue
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will make them like
worthless figs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He calls the figs here
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yr[&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sherim, </i>worthless; but in the twenty-fourth chapter he called them bad;
still the meaning is the same. There is no doubt but that he refers to the
prophecy which we there explained. For the Prophet saw two baskets of figs, in
one of which were sweet figs, and in the other bitter. God asked, &#8220;What
seest thou?&#8221; he said, &#8220;Good figs, very good, and bad figs, very
bad.&#8221; God afterwards added, &#8220;The<i> </i>good and sweet figs are the
captives; for I will at length shew mercy to them, and liberty to return shall
be given them. They shall then be good figs, though now a different opinion is
formed; for they who still lived at Jerusalem, think themselves more happy than
the exiles; but the bad and bitter figs,&#8221; he says, &#8220;are this people
who pride themselves, because they have not been led into captivity; for I will
consume them with the pestilence, and the famine, and the sword.&#8221; This was
the Prophet&#8217;s language in that passage. He now again declares that King
Zedekiah and all the people would be like bitter and putrid figs, which, being
so bad, are not fit to be eaten. He then adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, &#8212; that he
would not cease to consume them with pestilence, famine, and the sword, until he
wholly destroyed them, according to what we find in the twenty-fourth chapter.
He repeats what is in that chapter; but the words are taken from the
twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy, and from the twenty-ninth. The prophets,
we know, drew the substance of their doctrine from the fountain of the Law, and,
strictly speaking, brought forward nothing new, but accommodated the doctrine of
Moses to the circumstances of the time in which each lived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we find among the curses of the Law these
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set them for a
commotion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or a concussion. The word may
be explained in two ways, &#8212; either that the nations would tremble at such
a sad spectacle, &#8212; or that they would shake their head. The second view is
to be preferred, according to what I have stated elsewhere,

reproach among all the heathens; for all will acknowledge that ye suffer most
justly for your sins.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a
curse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ale, </i>is properly an oath, but is taken in many places for a curse, which
is introduced or understood when we swear. But as men often expose themselves to
punishment for perjury, the word means, frequently, a curse; and what is to be
understood, as it has been explained elsewhere, is a pattern or formula of a
curse; and we have seen in what sense the Prophet said this, that is, that every
one who wished to curse himself or others, or to imprecate, as they say, some
dire things, would take the Jews for an example, &#8220;May God curse thee as he
did the Jews;&#8221; or, &#8220;May he draw forth his severity to thy ruin, as
he did to the Jews.&#8221; He then says that they would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a

miserable that they would be taken as an example in
imprecations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for an
astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as he had spoken of the
shaking of the head, so now he mentions astonishment, which is something more
grievous, that is, when such a spectacle presents itself as makes all men to
stand astonished, as not knowing what it means.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hissing

would be a proverb,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I sent them by my servants
the prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Jews might have
otherwise objected and said, that they did not intend to be rebellious against
God, but that there were many contentions among the prophets. Lest, then, they
should seek an evasion by a pretense of this kind, he says that the word,
brought by his ministers and witnesses the prophets, was worthy of no less
reverence than if angels came down from heaven to them. And this passage serves
to shew the use of external doctrine, which fanatical men despise, thinking the
hidden word sufficient, that is, whatever they may dream. But God thus proves
the obedience of our faith, while he rules us by the hand and labor of men.
Whosoever then rejects the faithful teachers of the word, shews that he is a
despiser of God himself. The meaning is, that God defines his word, not as an
oracle of any kind, but as the doctrine which has been deposited with faithful
teachers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising up early and
sending</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The metaphor is taken from men
who are sedulous and diligent. We indeed know that God never awakes and never
changes place; but he could not otherwise express his paternal care toward his
people, as though he had said, that he was sedulously engaged in admonishing
them. And thus the more inexcusable was rendered the sloth of the people; for
God hastened as it were to rise up early, as they who spare no labor, but
willingly deprive themselves of some portion of their sleep, that they may
complete their work or their journey. As God then manifested so much diligence
in securing the wellbeing of men, the more shameful is the sloth of men, when
they become deaf, or are not moved, but remain in their indifference. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah announces a special prophecy, but in
confirmation of his former doctrine. His object is still the same, to prevent
the captives, as they had begun, to listen to flatteries, and to make them feel
assured that they were to bear their exile till the end of seventy years. But he
speaks here of three impostors; he connects two of them together, and mentions
the third by himself. He directs his discourse especially to all the captives,
for he deigned not to address those who professed to be God&#8217;s enemies, and
sold themselves as slaves to the devil for the purpose of deceiving. It was
therefore useless to spend labor on them. But he addressed the whole people, and
at the same time foretold what would happen to these two false prophets, even
Ahab and Zedekiah. He calls one the son of Kolaiah, and the other the son of
Maaseiah; for Ahab was a name then in frequent use, and Zedekiah was a name
which, on account of the memory of a pious and godly king, was in high esteem
among the good. To prevent then any mistake, he mentioned their
fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the prophecy is, that a judgment would
soon overtake them, as they would be killed by King Nebuchadnezzar. They were in
exile, but such madness had possessed them, that they hesitated not to provoke
the wrath of that tyrant whom they knew to be cruel and bloody. Then Jeremiah
declares, that as they thus deceived the people, they would soon be punished, as
Nebuchadnezzar would slay them. There is yet no doubt but that Nebuchadnezzar
had regard to his own private advantage; for before they were brought before
him, he wished to allay every cause of tumult. As they ceased not to encourage
the hope of a speedy return, without some check, it could not be otherwise but
that frequent disturbances would arise. Therefore Nebuchadnezzar, as it is usual
with earthly kings, consulted his own benefit. But he was in the meantime the
servant of God; for those two impostors who had promised a return to the people,
were to be exposed to contempt. Their death then disclosed their vanity, for it
thereby appeared that they were not sent by God. It is indeed true that
God&#8217;s faithful servants are often cruelly treated, nay, even slain by the
ungodly. But the case was different as to these two. For they were not proved
guilty of falsehood, because they happened to have unhappily prophesied, but
because they raised up a standard as it were, and said, that the people would
soon return to their own country; and hence<i> </i>it was that they were slain.
We then see that what would take place was not without reason foretold by
Jeremiah; for from their death it might have been concluded, that whatever they
had promised respecting the return of the people, were mere fallacies; and they
were slain even before the time which they had predicted. We now perceive the
meaning. We shall now notice the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye, the, whole captivity,
the word of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He would have the
Jews to be attentive, for if a thousand impostors had been killed, yet their
faith in falsehood would never have been destroyed, had not Jeremiah prophesied
before the time what would take place. He then sits here as a judge; for though
Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to be killed, yet it appears evident that it was
ordained by God, and indeed for this end, that the people might learn to repent.
We hence see that Jeremiah was their judge; and Nebuchadnezzar afterwards
executed what God by the mouth of his servant had pronounced as a judgment. This
is the reason why he addressed his words to the whole people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He yet at the same time adds, that they had been
<i>sent </i>by God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom I have
sent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>and he said this, in order
that they might not imagine that they went there by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chance or
</i></font><font face="Palatino">by adverse fortune, and that they might
acknowledge that when they were deprived of their own country, it was a just

clearly expresses what I have just said, that they would be thus slain by the
order of the king, because God had determined what was to be done to them. And
he assigns the cause of their death or mentions its author, that the Jews might
not fix their eyes on the king of Babylon. What had Nebuchadnezzar in view? to
preserve a peaceable kingdom; he saw the danger of a tumult if he pardoned these
two men, who had disturbed the people. Lest, then, the Jews should look only on
the design of the king, God here sets before them another and a higher reason,
even because they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied

<div><font face="Palatino">Here we are to notice the circumstances; for if
Jeremiah had only spoken of their death, the Jews might still have been doubtful
whether he had delivered a prophecy; but when now is added what kind of
punishment was inflicted on them, Jeremiah points out as by the finger what was
as yet unknown, and even incredible. It might indeed have happened to the
captives that the king should order them to be slain, but it could not have
occurred to any man to suppose what Jeremiah declares, that they would be

might turn away the eyes of the people from the immediate cause, which was

raised in his dominions; that they might therefore acknowledge God to be the

<div><font face="Palatino">We perceive why the Prophet mentions the cause of
their death; it was, that the Jews might regard the event, not according to
their own thoughts, but that they might feel assured that God took vengeance on
the impiety of those who had falsely pretended his name. For we know that we
always look here and there, and that when we find an immediate cause, we neglect
and esteem as nothing the judgments of God. In order then to correct this evil,
Jeremiah again repeats that Zedekiah and Ahab were not punished by the king of
Babylon, but by God himself,

<div><font face="Palatino">By the first clause we see how great was the
stupidity of the people, for they did not consider what was the life of those
who pretended to be witnesses for God, as though they were angels come down from
heaven. Their wickedness might indeed have been concealed; but there is no doubt
but that the Jews were extremely stupid, for they had willingly seized on the
vain promises, which afforded them gratification. As, then, they were anxious to
return, and wished to be restored to their own country as it were against the
will of God, and sought to break through all obstacles by the force of their own
obstinacy; it was a just punishment, that they were so blinded as not to see
what was yet sufficiently manifest, even that these vaunting prophets were
adulterers, and that the filthiness of their life was so great, that it was
certain that they had nothing divine or heavenly in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then there is another kind of evil added, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied falsely
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in God&#8217;s name. This was an atrocious
crime; for as his truth is precious to God, so it is a sacrilege that he cannot
bear, when his truth is turned into falsehood. But as the minds of them all were
so corrupted, that no one would open his eyes, God testifies, that though their
adulteries might be unknown to the people, that though their vanity in their
false prophecies might not be perceived, yet it was enough that he

hypocrites, until they find that they are proved guilty before men, fear
nothing, nay, they haughtily exalt themselves, even when things are justly laid
to their charge. Since, then, the hardness and dishonesty of hypocrites are so
great, it is necessary to summon them before God&#8217;s tribunal, that they may
know that they may a hundred times be acquitted by the world, and yet that this
derogates nothing from God&#8217;s judgment. It now follows &#8212;

who had written a letter to the priests and to the whole people against himself,

had, with impunity, long exhorted the people to bear their long exile. This is
the import of the passage; but as to his punishment we shall see what it was at
the end of the chapter. I did not wish to give the whole, because I cannot
finish this prophecy today. I have therefore taken the former part only, even
that Shemaiah had not only encouraged the people, as others did, to hope for a
return, and to raise a commotion, but had also scattered his poison at

his crime was doubled, for he dared to pretend the authority of God, and to
boast that he was as it were his scribe, as though he had said that his letter
had been dictated by the Holy Spirit, that he had not spoken his own thoughts,
or presumptuously, but that God could not endure the liberty given to Jeremiah;
for though he continually preached of long exile, yet the chief-priest suffered
him, and no one of the whole priestly order opposed him; and at the same time he
blames the people for their indulgence. That he did all this in God&#8217;s name
was far more grievous than if he had written as a private individual. And it is
said that he had written to the whole people, even in order that they might all
in a body unite against Jeremiah. For, had he written only to the priests, they
might have objected that they were not at liberty to act so violently against
Jeremiah, as sedition might be raised. We hence see the craft of this base man;
though he despised the people, yet that all of them, even the least, might help
the priests to do this act of cruelty, and that there might be the union of all,
he included the whole people in his letter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards mentioned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the priest

singular number, meant the high-priest: then the <i>priests </i>were not only
those descended from Aaron, but all the Levites. There was the high-priest, and
then the descendants of Aaron were the chief, and, as it were, the colleagues of
the high priest; but the Levites were an inferior order, though here by the
priests he means also the Levites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here follows the subject of the letter,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath made thee a
priest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Here the impostor Shemaiah
accuses the high-priest of ingratitude, because he had been chosen in the place
of another. For it is probable that Jehoiada was still living, but that he had
been led away into Chaldea with the other exiles. As then so high a dignity had,
beyond hope, and before the time, come to the high-priest, the false prophet
reproves him, because he did not rightly acknowledge this favor of God, as
though he had said, that he was rendering an unworthy reward to God, who had
raised him to that high station: God, he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath made thee a priest in the
place of Jehoiada the priest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Thus the
ministers of Satan transform themselves into angels of light; and yet they
cannot so dexterously imitate God&#8217;s servants, but that their deceit makes
itself presently known; for craftiness is very different from a right and
prudent counsel. God endues his servants with counsel and wisdom; but Satan,
with craft and guile. Though, then, at the first view, some artifice appears in
this letter of the false prophet, yet we may gather from its contents, that he
falsely pretended the name of God, that he falsely alleged that the chief priest
was chosen in the place of Jehoiada.

<i>meshego, </i>is rendered by Jerome, and I think not unsuitably; for the word
means properly one that is insane: but this was applied to false teachers,
because they boasted that they were under a divine impulse, when they spoke
their own thoughts. This appears evident from the ninth chapter of Hosea, where
it is said that the people would at length acknowledge that the prophets, who
had flattered them, were insane, and that the men of the Spirit were mad. The
Prophet conceded to them both names, that they were prophets and men of the
Spirit, that is, spiritual; but he proved that they had only the names and not
the reality: for prophets were called spiritual men, because God inspired them
with his Spirit; but the ungodly, when they wished to revile the true prophets,
called them mad. So did they speak who were with Jehu, when a prophet came to
anoint him, &#8220;What means this mad fellow?&#8221; this word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[g&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshego, </i>is what they used; and they called him in contempt mad, who had
yet spoken by the secret impulse of the Spirit.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 9:11.) So, in like manner, do the ungodly rave in contempt of God against
everything found in Scripture.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fE221</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as it has been already stated, it was necessary
to distinguish between the true servants of God and those only in name; for many
boasted that they were called by God, and yet were impostors. God then called
these mad and insane; but what did the ungodly do? they transferred the reproach
to the lawful servants of God. So, in this place, Shemaiah says, that Jeremiah
was mad, who falsely pretended the name of God, and prophesied
falsely.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou shouldest put him in
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or cast him into prison or the
stocks, as some render the word. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
manacles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, thou shouldest bind
him, until his impiety be known, so that thou mayest detain him in
prison.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> 
fE222</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is, indeed, probable that the chief
priests had assumed this power during the disordered state of things. This
proceeding no doubt resulted from a good principle; for God ever designed that
his Church should be well governed: he therefore commanded in his Law, that when
any dispute or question arose, the chief priest was to be the judge,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:8, 9; ) but when mention is here made of prison and of manacles, it: was an
act, no doubt, beyond the Law. It is therefore probable that it was added to the
Law of God when the state of things was in disorder and confusion among the
Jews. And whence was the origin of the evil? from the ignorance and sloth of the
priests. They ought to have been the messengers of the God of hosts, the
interpreters of the Law, the truth ought to have been sought from their mouth;
but they were dumb dogs, nay, they had so degenerated, that nothing priestly was
found in them; they had forgotten the Law, there was no religion in them. As
then they had neglected their office, it was necessary to choose other prophets:
and as we have said elsewhere, it was as it were accidental that God raised up
prophets from the common people. There was, indeed, a necessity of having
prophets always in the ancient Church; but God would have taken them from the
Levites, except that he designed to expose them to reproach before the whole
people, when he made prophets even of herdsmen, as in the case of
Amos.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the priests suffered the prophetic office to
be transferred to the common people, a new way was devised, that it might, not
be any loss to them, as under the Papacy; for we know that bishops are for no
other reason made rulers in the Church, but that there might be pastors and
teachers. For of what use could these asses be, whom we know to be for the most
part destitute of any learning? What could these men do, who are profane, and
given up to their own pleasures and enjoyments? In short, what could gamesters
and panders do? for such are almost all the Papal bishops. It was therefore
necessary to give up their office to brawling monks, &#8220;You shall teach, for
we resign to you the pulpits.&#8221; But, at the same time, they retained the
power of judgment in their own hands: when any controversy arose, neither the
noisy brawlers nor the dumb beasts could of themselves decide anything; for
ignorance prevented the latter, and power was wanting to the former. How, then,
did the bishops formerly condemn heretics? and how do they condemn them still?
Why, thus: When one was a Carmelite, they called in the Franciscans; and when
one was an Augustinian, the Dominicans were summoned. For, as I have said, these
mute animals had no knowledge nor wisdom. And yet a certain dignity was
maintained by the bishops or their vicars, when they pronounced sentence in
condemning heretics. And such was probably the case among the ancient people;
for those who pretended to be prophets were summoned, and that by the authority
of the high-priest, under the pretext of law, but not without some corruption
added to it; for God had not given fetters and manacles to the priests, that
they might thus restrain those who might create disturbance and corrupt the pure
truth. But what remains I shall defer to the next Lecture.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The crime ascribed to Jeremiah was, &#8212; that he
rendered the captives indifferent, so that they cast off every hope of
deliverance, and disregarded their own country. But the design of Jeremiah was
far different; it was, that the people might not by too much haste anticipate
the promises of God, and that he might also extend their hope to the end,
prefixed. As there are two causal particles here found,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kAl[
yk</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ki ol-ken, </i>some give this rendering,
&#8220;For for this cause,&#8221; that is, because he claimed the name of a
Prophet. The simpler meaning however is, that he gives a reason why Shemaiah
blamed the neglect of the priest, even because he (Jeremiah) had habituated the
captives to bear their exiles. But he reproached the holy man, as though he had
made them indifferent through long delay. Jeremiah had indeed said that the time
would be long; but this particular phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is
long</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means a different thing, as though
Jeremiah wished to bury in oblivion the hope of a return, because it would have
been foolish to languish so long.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Zephaniah had

is more suitable here, for the verse ought to be put in a parenthesis. The
Prophet obviates a doubt which might have been entertained. He then shews how
the prophecy was made known to him; he was one of the hearers when the letter
was read. And it is probable that the priest called Jeremiah on purpose, that he
might be proved guilty by his own accuser. However this may have been, he wished
to expose the holy man to the hatred of the people, or rather to their fury. The
constancy of Jeremiah was worthy of greater praise, while he boldly reproved the
arrogance of them all, who had nothing else in view but to suppress God&#8217;s
truth by force and tyranny.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah distinctly declares that this impostor would
not escape unpunished, because he had dared falsely to pretend the name of God,
and avowedly opposed Jeremiah. Here, then, the Prophet makes no long discourse,
but on the contrary simply declares by the power of the Spirit what would take
place. He speaks in God&#8217;s name, for he had been sent as a herald to
proclaim this judgment. This, then, is the reason why he is so brief; for there
was to be no dispute, though the impostor on the other hand was carrying himself
very high, and hesitated not to overthrow the revealed truth of God, which had
been confirmed by many witnesses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of what is stated is, that Shemaiah would not
see the favor of God, and that none of his seed would remain alive. It was a
curse under the Law, as it is well known, that one should have no seed left.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:18.) Jeremiah then denounces on Shemaiah this punishment, that no one of his
seed would remain alive, but that he would die childless; and then he excludes
him from the enjoyment of the benefit which the Lord had determined to bestow on
his people. He wished to return after two years to his own country; Jeremiah
commanded the people patiently to endure their exile to the end of seventy
years, which was the time of their deliverance. As, then, Shemaiah despised the
lawful time, he was deprived of the favor of seeing that event.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Added then is the reason; first, because he had
abused the name of God; he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I had not sent
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>said the Lord; the second reason
was, that he deceived<i> </i>the people with a vain hope; falsehood of itself is
worthy of a heavy punishment; but when it was pernicious to God&#8217;s people,
it became still more heinous, and therefore worthy of a twofold
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we see that Jeremiah esteemed as nothing that he
was condemned by Shemaiah; for he retained his own dignity; though the impostor
attempted to subvert his authority, yet the Prophet speaks as though he was
wholly unstained and not hurt nor affected by any calumny. The same magnanimity
of mind is what all faithful teachers ought to possess, so as to look down, as
from on high, on all deceivers, and their chatterings, and curses, and to go on
in their course, however insolently the despisers of God may rise up against
them, and tear and overwhelm them with reproaches. Let then all those who seek
to serve God and his Church follow this example of the Prophet, so that they may
not be discouraged in their minds when they find that they have to contend with
dishonest men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah is bidden to write to all the captives,
for Shemaiah was not worthy of being reproved; but God had a regard for the
public safety of the exiles, and reminded them of what would take place. It is
indeed probable that this prophecy was without any fruit, until it was known by
the event itself that Jeremiah had not without reason thus prophesied. Until,
then, Shemaiah died, and died without any to succeed him, the people disregarded
what had been predicted; but at length they were constrained to acknowledge that
Jeremiah had not spoken his own thought, but had been furnished with a message
from God; for God really fulfilled what he had predicted by the mouth of his
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The two reasons follow, why God resolved to punish
Shemaiah: the first is, that he had seized on the prophetic office without a
call; and hence we conclude, according to what has already appeared, that this
office<i> </i>which had been instituted by God, was perverted, when any one
intruded into it without a commission. Let us then know that no one ought to be
deemed a legitimate teacher, except he can really shew that he has been called
from above. I have in several places stated that two things belonged to a call;
the inward call was the chief thing when the state of the Church was in
disorder, that is, when the priests neglected the duty of teaching, and wholly
departed from what their office required. When, therefore, the Church became
disordered, God applied an extraordinary remedy by raising up prophets. But when
the Church is rightly and regularly formed, no one can boast that he is a pastor
or a minister, except he is also called by the suffrages of men. But as I have
spoken on this subject more at large on the twenty-third chapter, I only
slightly refer to it now.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the present passage in which God condemns
Shemaiah for having thrust in himself without being called, what is meant is,
that he brought forward his own dreams, having been furnished with no
commission; for the prophetic office was then special. Then Shemaiah is here
rejected as an impostor, because he had only brought forward prophecies
suggested by his own brains, which yet he falsely pretended to have been from
God; and it was a most atrocious crime, as it was a sacrilege to abuse, as
Shemaiah did, the name of God. But the atrocity of his sin the Prophet still
further sets forth, by saying that his prophecies were pernicious and fatal to
the people. We hence conclude how solicitous God was for the safety of his
people, in thus avenging the falsehoods which were calculated to lead them to
ruin; and Jeremiah shews that Shemaiah&#8217;s teaching was ruinous, because he
inebriated the people with false confidence;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he made
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to trust in
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he promised them a quick
return, when it was God&#8217;s will, that the Jews should patiently bear their
exile till the end of the seventy years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may deduce from this passage a useful
doctrine, &#8212; that nothing is more pestiferous in a Church than for men to
be led away by a false confidence or trust. For it is the foundation of all true
religion to depend on the mouth or word of God; and it is also the foundation of
our salvation. As, then, the salvation of men as well as true religion is
founded on faith and the obedience of faith; so also when we are drawn away to
some false trust, the whole of true religion falls to the ground, and at the
same time every hope of salvation vanishes. This ought to be carefully observed,
so that we may learn to embrace that doctrine which teaches us to trust in no
other than in the only true God, and reject all those inventions which may lead
us away from him, even in the least degree, so that we may not look around us
nor be carried here and there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason, as I have said, the Prophet declares
that Shemaiah would die childless, and be precluded from enjoying the favor
which God had resolved and even promised to bestow on his people. And all this,
as I have reminded you, was said for the sake of the people; for this prophecy
did no good to Shemaiah nor to his posterity; but his punishment ought to have
benefited the miserable exiles so as to lead them to repentance, however late it
may have been. This is the import of the passage.</font><br></div>

I may here state the result of a minute examination as to the Book of Psalm. It
is found there as a relative, and as an adverb, about a hundred and seven times;
about forty times as a nominative to verbs; nearly thirty times as an adverb or
conjunction, for, because, that, whom, how, whose, etc.; in a few instances, in
construction with nouns to which are affixed pronouns in the same case, as
exemplified in a previous note; in twenty-six instances governed by verbs in the
objective case, without any pronouns affixed to the verbs; and five times,
according to our version, accompanied by pronouns when thus circumstanced. But
in these five instances our version seems to me to be incorrect, the
construction being inconsistent with what appears to be the common usage of the
language. The passages are the following,

pronoun after the verb, but there are several instances of this, when governed
by an intransitive verb &#8212; such as the following, &#8220;A land wherein
thou shalt eat bread without scarceness,&#8221; literally, &#8220;A land which
without scarceness thou shalt in it eat bread.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
account which Blayney gives is the most probable: that he was the first of his
order. There were twenty-four courses of priests, as appointed by David, 1
Chronicles 24; and the head of each course was for the time the ruler or
governor of the Temple. These heads of the courses were no doubt the
&#8220;chief priests&#8221; mentioned in the New Testament, for in fact there
was only one chief priest. They were also called the &#8220;captains&#8221; of
the Temple. &#8220;The chief overseer in the house of Jehovah&#8221; is the most
suitable rendering. The whole verse might be rendered as follows, &#8212;
&#8220;When Pashur, the son of Immer, the priest, while he was the chief
overseer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these words, then
Pashur smote Jeremiah,&#8221; etc. So the Syriac, and so does Blayney connect
the first with the second verse. The family of &#8220;Immer&#8221; formed the
sixteenth course. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;132414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 24:14. &#8220;The priest&#8221; refers to Pashur, and not to
&#8220;Immer;&#8221; and it is so rendered by the Sept., Vulg., and the Arab.,
though not by the Syr. Immer was the name of the family. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>

&#8220;circuit,&#8221; is the Syr.; but the Targ. has &#8220;prison.&#8221; The
word occurs in two other places, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;132926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 29:26, and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;141610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

&#8220;the torturing prison,&#8221; taking the verb from which the word comes in
a bad sense, as signifying to distort, and hence to torture. Symmachus favors
this view, for he renders it &#8220;a place of torment &#8212;

The form of the expression is in favor of this idea, &#8220;and set him in the

Calvin and our version render &#8220;strength&#8221; is rendered the same by the
Sept.,

&#8212; by the Vulg., &#8220;substance,&#8221; &#8212; by the Syr.,
&#8220;citadels,&#8221; &#8212; and by the Targ., riches. The primary meaning of
the word is to be strong, or firm; and then what is strongly, or firmly secured
&#8212; store, or treasure, here, and the two things which follow are
explanatory of this store, &#8212; the labor, or the fruit of labor, &#8212;
their garments; and precious things, &#8212; their gold, silver, and precious
stones and furniture: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">5. And I will give the
whole store of this city, Even all the fruit of its labor, And every precious
thing in it, &#8212; Yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give,
Into the hand of their enemies: And they shall plunder them and take them, And
bring them into Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All the versions refer &#8220;them&#8221; in the two
last lines to the people, but the Targum to the things mentioned in the
preceding lines; but the former view is the right one. To render the last verb
to &#8220;carry,&#8221; as in our version, is not correct; for it means to cause
to come, and hence to bring; and this clearly supports the
versions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The exposition of Blayney is, that by
&#8220;strength&#8217;&#8221; is meant the military, by &#8220;labor&#8221; the
workmen, and by &#8220;the precious&#8221; the respectable part of society. Then
he ought to have gone on and said, that by &#8220;the treasures&#8221; were
meant the kings of Judah! But all this is fancy, and wholly inconsistent with
the tenor of the passage. They were to &#8220;plunder&#8221; them; and if their
stores were not referred to, how could this be said of what their enemies would
do? And then, according to this view, the treasures of the kings were to become
a spoil, and not the stores of the city. To spoil the people of their property
was one of the most common threatenings of the Prophets. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This

all who dwell in thine house, Go shall ye into captivity: Yea, to Babylon shalt
thou go, And there shalt thou die, and there be buried &#8212; Thou and all thy
friends, To whom thou hast prophesied falsely.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is here an instance of the free and unmodified
manner in which statements are often made in Scripture. It is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
20:4, that &#8220;his friends&#8221; would fall by the sword; but here, that
they would be carried into Babylon, die, and be buried there. The hearers of
Jeremiah, no doubt, understood him, though a captious hearer could have made out
a contradiction against him. But the meaning is, that many of them would be
slain by the sword, and that many of them, or most of such as remained, would be
led into captivity. A great number were to be slain, and a great number would be
taken captives. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I find
none agreeing with Calvin in his view of this verse; nor many with our version
in rendering the first verb &#8220;deceived.&#8221; So is the Septuagint, but
the Vulgate, Syriac, and Targum have &#8220;enticed.&#8221; In other parts it is
rendered in our version &#8220;enticed,&#8221; &#8220;allured,&#8221; and
&#8220;persuaded.&#8221; Blayney has &#8220;allured,&#8221; but Gataker and
Lowth prefer &#8220;persuaded;&#8221; and this wholly comports with the view the
Prophet gives of his calling in the first chapter, to which he evidently refers,
and also with what follows in this verse. He was unwilling to undertake the
office, but he was induced to do so by what God said to him. There was nothing
like deception in the case; for God had previously told him of the difficulties
he would have to encounter. And then he adds, that he was
&#8220;constrained,&#8221; which I consider to be the meaning of the next verb.
He had been persuaded by reasons and promises, and constrained by authority. I
would render the verse thus, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">7. Thou didst persuade
me, O Jehovah, and I was persuaded; Thou didst constrain me, and didst prevail:
I am become a derision every day; The whole of it are jeering
me.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The &#8220;it&#8221; refers to the city where he was,
and of which he speaks at the end of the last chapter; for this chapter is but a
continuation of the narrative. What he relates there of the fate of the city
drew the attention and excited the rage of Pashur. After having spoken of what
Pashur did, Jeremiah gives utterance here to his complaints.</font><br></div>

following. There is evidently in the second line an allusion to the name given
to Pashur: the multitude, by the way of ridicule, repeated the name. Cocceius
and Blayney render the line according to this meaning. &#8220;All the
men,&#8221; etc., literally, &#8220;Every man of my peace,&#8221; that is, who
is at peace with him; they were those who seemed to be his friends, though
really his enemies, and plotting for his downfall, and that by trying to entice
him out of his course. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Except
in the first line, the Sept. and the Vulg. differ from the text as well as from
one another; both are exceedingly confused. Few expounders have kept the proper

enemies, but also what had already in part happened to them,
&#8212;</font><br></div>

follows as an imprecation, &#8212; &#8220;May I see,&#8221; etc., while the
Targum does as Calvin, &#8220;I shall see,&#8221; etc.; and this better comports
with the passage. The Prophet first mentions God as a righteous judge, and then
he concludes that he should see God&#8217;s vengeance on his enemies, because he
had devolved his cause on him, or revealed it to him. He had referred his cause
to a righteous judge, and hence he felt assured that vengeance would overtake
his enemies. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
&#8220;poor&#8221; here does not mean him who is in low circumstances, but him
who is helpless or defenseless; and this is the meaning of the word often in
other parts, especially in the Psalm. The word &#8220;soul,&#8221; too, here and
in other places, means life, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Sing ye to Jehovah,

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
greatest difficulty in this passage is the connection. That Jeremiah should have
cursed his birth-day is what can be accounted for, as in the case of Job.
Nature, even in the best of men, sometimes utters its own voice. But how he came
to do this immediately after having thanked God for his deliverance, seems
singular. The explanation of Calvin, that he relates what had passed in his
mind, while he was confined by Pashur, is plausible, and has been adopted by
Grotius, Gataker, Cocceius, and Henry. Grotius considered, &#8220;I had
said,&#8221; to be understood at the beginning of the fourteenth verse. Adam
Clarke thought that the words have been transposed, and that the five last
verses ought to come in between the eighth and the ninth verse: and he says what
is true, that there are many transpositions in this book. Houbigant,  approved
by Horsley, thought the right place for these verses is between the sixth and
the seventh verse. But these transpositions are not satisfactory. Venema&#8217;s
notion is, that Jeremiah does not speak in his own name, but in the name of
Pashur. Having described in the previous verse his own ease, the protection he
found from God, he describes in these verses the wretchedness and misery of his
persecutor, and introduces him as cursing his birth-day, etc. But this is very
far-fetched and fanciful. Scott acknowledges the transition to be very
extraordinary, but yet thinks that the Prophet describes what had passed through
his own mind, and says that the experience of good men proves that such sudden
changes occur. &#8220;An experimental acquaintance with our hearts,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;and the variations of our passions, under sharp trials, as
encouraging or discouraging thoughts occur to our minds, will best enable us to
understand it.&#8221; This is probably the right view of the subject. The
Prophet, indeed, acknowledged God&#8217;s kindness in saving his life, and
invited others to join him in praising him: yet when he considered his
circumstances, he gave way to his own natural feelings. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Our
version seems right in rendering the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino"> in

otherwise there is an inconsistency in representing a man destroyed, and hearing
an outcry, etc. The two verses may be thus rendered, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">16. And let that man be

perpetuity,&#8221; &#8212; the Vulg. has, &#8220;an eternal conception,&#8221;

as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

simply wrath or anger; the second, heated wrath; and the third, foaming wrath,
and &#8220;great&#8221; is added to it. None of the Versions, except the Arab.,
presents this climax; the Sept. and Syr. have only two, &#8220;anger and great
wrath;&#8221; the Vulg., &#8220;fury, indignation, and great wrath;&#8221; and
the Arab., &#8220;wrath, indignation, and the greatest fury.&#8221; The Targ.

mentioned first, then the previous one relenting, and in the third place, what

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Of all
explanations of this passage, this is the most satisfactory. Mount Sion was
surrounded by a valley, and that valley by contiguous mountains. The city,
therefore, was a valley with a rock or a mountain in the midst, called here the
rock of the level ground. The sentence may, indeed, be thus rendered, &#8220;The
inhabitant of the valley of the rock of the level ground.&#8221; &#8220;The
valley of the rock&#8221; means, in this case, the valley around the rock or the
mountain; then the valley is farther designated as the level
ground.</font><br></div>

dwellest in valleys, who hast a large plain;&#8221; and the Targ., &#8220;who
dwellest in strength, in fortified cities.&#8221; The nearest to the original is
the Sept. version; which has been followed by Venema, who thought that there was
a valley called Sor in Jerusalem, which, from its situation, was the most secure
part of the city: hence the word &#8220;descend,&#8221; in the following
sentence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Blayney&#8217;s version is, &#8220;O thou inhabitant
of the levelled hollow of a rock.&#8221; He considered that Mount Sion is meant,
the residence of the house of David, and so called, because the top was
levelled. Then he rendered the following sentence, &#8220;Who shall make a
breach on us?&#8221; But the difficulty is to understand &#8220;the levelled
hollow,&#8221; and how to make the original to bear such a rendering. Doubtless,
the version of Calvin or that of Venema, which is not very different, is the
best. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

&#8220;Administer judgment and justice;&#8221; the former to the guilty, and the

their rights, nor violently to take their things away from them, or to plunder
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may render the passage as Gataker does, &#8220;And

an act of &#8220;justice&#8221; to rescue the plundered from the hands of the
plunderer. Then they were forbidden to administer wrong, &#8220;judgment,&#8221;
so as to depress and plunder the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, and to
shed innocent blood. See

power claimed to be exercised was never claimed nor possessed by Peter. The Pope

there can be hardly a doubt respecting the correctness of Calvin&#8217;s view.
All the Versions give this rendering, &#8220;Gilead, thou art to me the head of
Lebanon;&#8221; the meaning of which does not appear. The Targum is a paraphrase

<div><font face="Palatino">The repetition of the verb &#8220;weep&#8221; is
emphatical. Our version, &#8220;weep sore,&#8221; is the Arab. The Sept. and the
Targ. take it as an instance of what often occurs in Hebrew, a participle joined
to a verb to enhance its force; but it is not so here, the two verbs are in the
imperative mood. But it may be that there is here, as many think, a direct
allusion to Josiah, who was dead, and was much lamented, and to Shallum, who was
taken captive and carried into Egypt, where he died. In that case we ought to
render the second line thus, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Weep, weep for him who

<div><font face="Palatino">Some, with Calvin, think Shallum to be Jeconiah, or
Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim, and not Shallum the son of Josiah. The
objection to this is, that the Prophet here proceeds from Shallum to Jehoiakim,
and then to his son Jeconiah. And from what he says of Jehoiakim, it appears
that he delivered this prophecy in his reign, except we think, as some do, that
the Prophet relates here in the reign of Zedekiah what he had previously
prophesied. But the probability is, as Blayney and others think, that this
prophecy was delivered in the reign of Jehoiakim. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
general sense is given, but not a literal rendering. The last verb is variously
rendered; &#8220;because thou betakest thyself to cedar,&#8221; is the Vulg.;
&#8220;wilt thou delight thyself in cedars?&#8221; the Syr.; the Targ. is a
loose paraphrase, and the Sept. and Arab. wholly depart from our present text,
&#8220;because thou art stimulated by Ahaz thy father.&#8221; Then what follows
is widely different, but wholly inconsistent with the original. The verb is the
Hithpael of

countenanced both by the Vulg. and Syr. Blayney takes the third sense &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">To eat and to drink, as Calvin, observes, means a

his happiness arose from governing justly his people. The Syr. connects the two

Gataker and Venema, &#8220;from Abarim,&#8221; a mountain in the confines of
Moab. See

the king of Babylon had subdued them. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The word

tranquil, or quiet times or seasons. It is rendered &#8220;fall,&#8221; very
unaccountably, by the Sept.; &#8220;abundance,&#8221; by the Vulg.;
&#8220;affluence,&#8221; by the Syr.; &#8220;when thou didst sit
tranquil,&#8221; by the Targ. But the word clearly means a tranquil, quiet, or
peaceable state. Blayney rightly renders the expression, &#8220;in the times of
thy tranquillity.&#8221; &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
is omitted in the Sept., and the clause is given as in apposition with the
former, which seems to be the meaning; &#8220;the way&#8221; was not to hear
God&#8217;s voice. Blayney, very unsuitably, connects the last line with the
following verse. I render the verse thus, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">21. I spoke to thee in
thy quiet times; Thou didst say, &#8220;I will not hear:&#8221; This has been
thy way from thy childhood; For thou didst not hear my voice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It has been usual with many to render
&#8220;hear,&#8221; &#8220;obey;&#8221; but not rightly. The complaint against
the people was, that they would not &#8220;hear&#8221; the voice of God, much
less obey it. The answer here was that they would not &#8220;hear.&#8221; The
complaint, or the charge against them is the same, and the verb ought to be so
rendered. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The wind
sometimes means what is empty; and in this sense the Sept., the Vulg., and the
Arab. take it here, &#8220;All thy pastors the wind shall feed;&#8221; but the
Syr. and the Targ. take the &#8220;wind&#8221; as meaning a blasting or a stormy
wind: &#8220;All thy pastors the wind shall feed on,&#8221; or eat up, is the
Syr.; and the Targ. gives this paraphrase, &#8220;All thy pastors shall be
scattered unto every wind.&#8221; The verb, no doubt, means to feed, and to feed
on, or eat up, or consume, but not to scatter or disperse. Therefore the meaning
here is, either that the pastors would have nothing but what was empty to
support them, or that they would be consumed as by a blast. The first is most
consonant to the tenor of the passage; for the aid of their lovers is previously
referred to; but they would find this aid to be &#8220;wind,&#8221; and then it
is added, that these lovers as well as themselves would be driven into
captivity. There is a striking paronomasia in the words. The word for pastors is
derived from the verb to feed. We may give this version, &#8220;All thy feeders
shall the wind feed.&#8221; The feeders had fed the people with winds, with
empty expectations, and they, in their turn, would have nothing but wind, what
was empty, to live upon or to support them. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Our
version is better as to the two verbs here used, &#8220;ashamed and
confounded.&#8221; The latter is stronger than the former. The Vulg. and the
Targ. invert the order, &#8220;confounded and ashamed.&#8221; The Sept. and
Arab. have &#8220;ashamed and dishonored,&#8221; or despised. The first verb
means simply to be ashamed, and the other to turn aside as it were from a sense
of shame, as one not able to look on others. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
former part of this passage is differently rendered by all the early versions:
the Sept., &#8220;thou wilt groan;&#8221; the Vulg., &#8220;how thou hast
groaned;&#8221; the Syr., &#8220;how much wilt thou groan.&#8221; The reading
adopted was

not found in many copies, nor in the Keri, nor in connection with the two
participles at the beginning of the verse. The Targ. has &#8220;what wilt thou
do.&#8221; Most of modern expounders take the text as we have it, and there are
no different readings. Then the whole verse would read as follows,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">23. Inhabitress of
Lebanon! nestler in the cedars! How graceful (or favored) shalt thou be, When
come on thee shall throes, A pain like that of childbearing!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The gender is feminine, and either Jerusalem or the
house or family of David is meant. The word for &#8220;throes&#8221; means
girding pains or pangs. The verse is the language of irony. The people were so
hardened, that nothing else would have touched them. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
early Versions throughout this passage give his name as Jeconiah; but the Targ.,
Coniah, according to the Hebrew. The Rabbins give various reasons for the
change, and others too, which are frivolous. The reason given by Calvin and
adopted by Gataker, Lowth, and others, is confirmed by the contemptuous language
used in the 28th verse. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is
here a striking contrast: God would pluck off Jeconiah, were he like a signet on
his right hand, and would deliver him into the hand of his enemies. From being
as it were on the divine hand, he would be given up into the hand of those who
sought his life. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The word
is strong; it means to toss, to hurl, violently to cast forth, to throw with
force, as one throws a missile weapon. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;092811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
phrase, &#8220;to raise or lift up the mind,&#8221; or the soul, is to set the
heart on a thing. The Vulg. has adopted the Hebrew idiom, &#8220;to which they
lift up their soul.&#8221; The Sept. leaves out &#8220;return,&#8221; and have
only, &#8220;which they wish in their souls.&#8221; Our version retains the true
idea, though it be not literal, &#8220;whereunto they desire to return;&#8221;
literally, &#8220;where they are lifting up their soul to return there:&#8221;
the two adverbs of place are given, the relative adverb and the pronoun adverb,
if we may so call them. It is the same sort of idiom as when a relative and a
pronoun are used, one before and the other after the verb, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
22:25, &#8220;whom thou fearest (or dreadest) their face,&#8221; rightly
rendered in our version, &#8220;whose face thou fearest:&#8221; but the Welsh is
literally the Hebrew; the idiom is exactly the same. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The verb
means to loose, to set free; and it is here in a passive sense, to be loosed or
set free. It seems to refer to the setting free the idol or statue from its
fastenings; therefore, &#8220;broken down&#8221; would be its best rendering.
&#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
singular that all the early versions soften down the strong terms used in this
verse; not one of them give a faithful translation. The Sept., the Syr., and the
Arab. give hardly the half of the verse, and what they give is divested of the
tone and spirit of the original. The Vulg. leaves out the word
&#8220;idol&#8221; or statue, and puts &#8220;an earthen vessel&#8221; in its
place. The whole verse I render as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">28. A contemptible,
broken down idol! Is this the man Coniah? Is he a vessel in which there is no
delight? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, And sent into a land which they
have not known?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is the relative which understood after
&#8220;vessel&#8221; in the third line. The Welsh, which in this kind of idiom
is exactly the same with the Hebrew, admits of the same sort of ellipsis,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ai llester yw heb hoffder

<div><font face="Palatino">Which is verbally the Hebrew, &#8220;Is he a vessel
without delight in it?&#8221; The &#8220;casting out&#8221; was from the land of

Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It does
not appear whether Calvin meant the earth generally or the land of Judea. But
the latter most probably is what is intended. The version, then, ought to be,
&#8220;Land, land, land!&#8221; The Sept. and the Arab. have &#8220;land&#8221;
only twice, but the other versions have it three times as in Hebrew. The
paraphrase of the Targ. is singular, &#8220;From their own land they have made
them to migrate to another land; land of Israel! hear the words of the
Lord.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Land&#8221; means often the inhabitants; and

is connected with this, the &#8220;righteous branch,&#8221; the Messiah, the
King of Zion. The proper division of the chapter is at the ninth verse.
According to this view there is a perfect consistency, &#8212; Jeconiah was the
last reigning prince in the right line (Zedekiah, his uncle, was not in the
right line) on the throne of David, as a temporal sovereign; then he, of whom
David was a type, came, not to sit and to rule on the visible throne of David,

meaning seems to be that they had caused the flock to be scattered and driven

last verb means. The two first verbs are indeed in Hiphil, and may be rendered
causatively thus, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ye have caused my sheep
to be scattered, And have caused them to be driven away; And ye have not cared
for them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last verb is not in Hiphil, and states the reason
why the sheep had been dispersed. It means to oversee, to take care of, to
attend to. The dispersion was owing to the neglect of the pastors in taking care
of the sheep. The scattering or dispersion was their exile; which God states in
the third verse was his act as a punishment for their wickedness, but the cause
of dispersion was the conduct of the pastors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see here an instance of the order in which ideas
are often stated by the Prophets. Scattering, though mentioned first, is the
last act, the most ostensible; the driving out of the land was the previous act,
and the first in order, though the last stated, was the neglect of the pastors
in taking an oversight of them. It is to begin with the effect and to go back to
the cause. &#8220;You have caused them to be scattered to all lands, you have
made them to be driven out of their own land, and you have neglected to take
care of them.&#8221; These are the three points of accusation, but stated in an
inverted order. There are constant instances of this kind of arrangement.

Vulg.,&#8221; on account of a curse,&#8221; that is of God; the Targ., &#8220;on
account of false swearing.&#8221; Blayney says, that there is nothing here about
swearing, and renders the words &#8220;because of these:&#8221; but the 14th
verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:14) decides the question, where we have &#8220;adultery&#8221; and
&#8220;walking in lies,&#8221; ascribed to the same persons, the prophets. That,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">

10:4, we have the word &#8220;falsely&#8221; added to it. Their false swearing
was their unfaithfulness to God&#8217;s covenant, their apostasy in worshipping
idols. And the charge of being &#8220;adulterers&#8221; seems to refer to their
spiritual adultery &#8212; their idolatry, and not as Calvin and others think,
to that which is natural. Everything in the context favors this view; their
wickedness was found in God&#8217;s house, verse 11
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:11); and a comparison is made between them and the Samaritan prophets, verse
14
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:14). The construction of this verse leads us to the same conclusion: when two

&#8212;</font><br></div>

insipid, untempered, and hence figuratively, what is unreasonable, absurd,
fatuitous, foolish. It is rendered &#8220;folly&#8221; in Job. The Vulg., which
is followed by Calvin, gives its best meaning here &#8212;
&#8220;fatuity.&#8221; To prophesy by Baal was the effect of infatuation: it was

the Targ. go altogether astray. The word means properly horridness, hideousness,
or a horrid thing, and may be rendered enormity. The difference found in the
Targ. and the Versions, as to the word and the manner of rendering the words
which follow, seems to shew that the passage was not understood. I offer the
following version, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">14. But among the
prophets of Jerusalem Have I seen a horrid thing &#8212; The committing of
adultery and walking in falsehood; And they have strengthened the hand of the
wicked, That they might not turn, each from his wickedness: They are all of them
become to me like Sodom, And its inhabitants like those of
Gomorrah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb I render &#8220;the committing of
adultery,&#8221; is an infinitive without a preposition; it cannot be otherwise
rendered in our language, but in Welsh it can be rendered literally, as an
infinitive without a preposition, though commonly in that language, as in
Hebrew, the infinitive mood has a preposition before it. The &#8220;horrid
thing&#8221; was adultery, that is, idolatry, combined with &#8220;walking in
falsehood,&#8221; that is, with a false profession of prophesying in God&#8217;s
name, which is afterwards more distinctly specified. Here was the difference
between the prophets: those of Samaria were idolaters, and consistently they
prophesied in the name of Baal; but the prophets of Jerusalem were not only
idolaters, but added to this sin the enormity of defending all they did by
alleging that they were the Lord&#8217;s prophets. This was the horrid thing. It
is a great sin to advocate error, but to do this in the name of the Lord, or by
perverting his word, is a horrid thing. The last line presents an instance of
that ellipsis mentioned in a Note on the 12th verse. The word
&#8220;inhabitants&#8221; is to be understood before Gomorrah. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
the Syr., but it is not the meaning; it is properly rendered

improperly flattery, by the Targ. The verb from which it comes is commonly
rendered to defile; see

sense. The pollution here was by idolatry &#8212; the adultery beforementioned.
This pollution had spread from Jerusalem through the whole land. &#8212;

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The

nearer to the original, and render the first clause &#8220;and they deceive
you.&#8221; The words literally are, &#8220;Infatuating you are they.&#8221; The
whole verse is as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">16. Thus saith Jehovah of

speak &#8220;from the mouth of the Lord&#8221; is very striking. All the
Versions retain the preposition &#8220;from,&#8221; and the Targ. gives

idiom, where a participle often precedes a verb in the future tense, but never
follows it; nor is this countenanced by any of the Versions or the Targ. The

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What
seems to militate against this view is the fact, that these false prophets
themselves pretended to a divine revelation; they announced their message as
coming from God. Hence these questions seem to deny their pretensions. He seems
to say, &#8220;Who of you have been in the council of Jehovah?&#8221; The
tautology may be avoided without having recourse to the emendations which
Blayney proposes, &#8212;</font><br></div>

stood in the secret council of Jehovah? And saw and understood his business? Who

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">
means not only a word, but also a thing, affair, business, matter, any thing
represented or imagined. The verb to &#8220;see,&#8221; which implies a vision,
proves that it means the latter here. Then in the last line it means a message,
because it was what was listened to and heard. But the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[m&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the first clause, comports with seeing, and understanding is what it
sometimes signifies; and in the last clause it comports with listening, which is
that of hearing. The Prophet refers to a vision and to a message, or to an
affair as set before one admitted into the council chamber of his sovereign,
(for this is the representation,) and to a message given to him who is
commissioned to transact the business. It is not an unusual thing in Scripture
to use a word in two different senses in the same passage; but the surrounding
context is always sufficient to make the subject clear. &#8212;

it can be referred, except to the &#8220;tempest,&#8221; which is feminine, in
the former verse; they would understand at a future time the meaning of that
tempest, that it was from the Lord as a punishment for their sins. This they did

prophesied. They ran as though God had communicated something to them; but God
neither spoke to them nor sent them. They had neither a mission nor a message
from God. In the following verse, consistently still with the style of
Scripture, the order is reversed. The message is first referred to, and then the
mission. They had no message, because they never &#8220;stood&#8221; or were

their corrections, but we can do without them. What seems to have prompted
conjectural emendations has been the

prefixed to

thing. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:8. The meaning then may be, &#8220;Is it the delight of these
prophets?&#8221; etc. But the first sense is the most suitable. &#8220;How
long!&#8221; is an exclamation of wonder at their perseverance in their wicked
course. They had been often warned, and yet they continued. Then follows a
question, whether it was their settled purpose to persevere in prophesying
falsely? &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE105 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Calvin
begins this verse as our version, &#8220;Who think,&#8221; etc. So the Sept.;
the Vulg. is, &#8220;who seek (or wish), volunt.&#8221; Blayney has, &#8220;who
study.&#8221; The verb means sometimes to contrive or to purpose a thing after
counting the reasons for and against. It may be rendered here, &#8220;who
design.&#8221; The Syriac is, &#8220;whose counsel is.&#8221; It was their
design and intended object to make the people to forget God&#8217;s name through
their dreams. But how to forget his name? for they professed to announce their
dreams in his name. God&#8217;s name here evidently means his revealed name,
himself as revealed in his word. &#8212; Ed</font><br></div>

&#8220;What is the chaff to the wheat?&#8221; But the Syr. has another idea,
&#8220;Why mingle ye the chaff with the wheat?&#8221; The literal rendering of
the Hebrew is, &#8220;Why to the chaff the wheat?&#8221; The mixture is what
seems to be intended. So thought Gataker and Blayney, who rendered it,
&#8220;What has the chaff to do with the wheat?&#8221; that is, why do you mix
them together? And so does Adam Clarke view the phrase. Venema, Henry, Scott,
and Lowth take the first meaning, which is also that of our version; but the
other is more agreeable to the original. &#8212; Ed</font><br></div>

Venema regarded it either as a noun, burning, from

to burn, or a misprint for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jk</font><font face="Palatino">,
strength, vigor, power. The last is adopted by Blayney, and approved by Horsley,
and is countenanced by the Targ., &#8220;Are not all my words strong as

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Is not the power of my

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE109 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Various
have been the expositions of this sentence: they adopted the manner of the true

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
28:1-4; and this is the view of Scott; others hold that the imitation in saying,
&#8220;Thus saith the Lord,&#8221; is what is referred to. It has also been
suggested that they are intended &#8212; who, knowing the truth, withheld it
from the people; and that to withhold what they knew, is represented here as
stealing. But none of these views sufficiently account for the words here used,
&#8220;who steal my words every one from his neighbor.&#8221; They were
God&#8217;s words committed to the people, and these prophets stole them, that
is, by rendering them void by their falsehoods and vain dreams, as Satan is said
to steal the seed sown in the heart of the way-side hearer. This is the view
taken by Grotius, Venema, and Gataker. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

are those who, with Houbigant, suppose a transposition in the word, the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">j</font><font face="Palatino">
being put last instead of being first; and then it would mean to render smooth.
But this does not suit the passage. The probable idea is what is given
paraphrastically by the Sept., &#8220;who send forth the prophecies of the
tongue;&#8221; they derived their prophecies from their own hearts and their own
tongues, and said that they came from God. They took or used their tongues only,
and at the same time professed to speak God&#8217;s words. Or we may consider
the taking or using the tongue as meaning only profession, as though it was
said, &#8220;who profess and say, &#8216;He
saith.&#8217;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Syr. is, &#8220;who pervert their own

the Vulg.; &#8220;lasciviousness,&#8221; by the Syr.; and
&#8220;rashness,&#8221; by the Targ. It comes from a verb which means to swell,
to overflow. As a feminine noun it is only found here, and as a participial noun
in two places,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;070904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
9:4, and Zephaniah 30:4, in which places it evidently means licentious persons;
and I once thought that as used here it means licentiousness; see Note on
Zephaniah 30:4, in vol. 4 on the Minor Prophets: but I now think that the
meaning most suitable here is excess or overflowing in words &#8212; vaunting
boasting. The false prophets boasted that they were prophesying in God&#8217;s
name; they were telling lies, and boasting that they were sent by God. In this
way they succeeded in leading astray the people, Venema renders it &#8220;vain
boasting.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Behold, I am against
those who prophesy Lying dreams, saith Jehovah; And who declare them, that they
may lead astray My people by their lies and by their vauntings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a virtual denial of their vauntings, for
God had &#8220;not sent&#8217; nor &#8220;commanded&#8221; them; and the
conclusion of the verse refers to their lies, for what they said would
&#8220;not profit&#8221; the people. Thus we see a perfect correspondence
between what is said in this and in the following verse, and the order is
according to the usual style of the Prophets, it being reversed in the latter
instance; their vauntings were false, because God did not send them; and their
lies were vain, for they would not profit the people. &#8212;

seems to be, that the burden, or prophecy, ought to be deemed by every man as
the word of God, or ought to be called his word; it was no longer to be called
burden, but God&#8217;s word. According to Calvin and many others, the meaning
is, &#8220;the word, or the phrase,&#8221; the burden of the Lord, &#8220;which
ye use in derision, shall really be a burden to you.&#8221; The

well connect; and as punishment in case of disregarding the injunction here

the prohibition; and I give this version,</font><br></div>

them. Hence God prohibited the use of the expression, &#8220;the burden of

which means in Syriac, to dwell, to rest, and consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;</font><font face="Palatino">

Others derive it from an Arabic root which means to be swift or to advance
swiftly &#8212; the character of the sun or fire, which was deified. The third
party say, that it signifies a feast, like the Saturnalian, which the Chaldeans
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sake&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">;
for it was during a feast that Babylon was taken, so that there was thus an
intimation given of this by calling him the king of this feast. See

51:39.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the most probable account is that given by
Gataker, that Babylon was thus called from an idol in great repute in the city,
named Sheshach or Shach, and that it was on the festival of this idol that the
city was taken. This accounts for this name being given to it, when its
destruction is especially referred to. Mishael, which terminated with
God&#8217;s name, was changed into Meschach, or rather Mishach, which contained

mentioned in the 31st verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242531&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

&#8220;&#8220;his habitation,&#8221; is the Syr. The Vulg. is Jerome&#8217;s
version. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE147 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">This
verse seems to refer only to the Jews, and the following to the nations, as to

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Roaring he will roar against his own
habitation; A shout like that of treaders of grapes Will he respond to all the
inhabitants of the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This rendering prevents the necessity of giving an
unusual meaning to

Jehovah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The past is evidently used for the future. &#8220;The
sound&#8221; then was to go forth, and for the reasons here assigned, &#8212;
God would have a dispute with all, would try the matter as it were by a judicial
process, and would give up the condemned, the wicked, to the sword. The object
of this representation is very correctly stated by Calvin. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE149 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">This
word is omitted by the Sept., and Calvin&#8217;s rendering is that of the Vulg.,

two words are nouns, and ought to be so rendered, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">34. Howl, ye pastors, and cry, And roll
yourselves in the dust, ye illustrious of the flock, Because fulfilled are your

<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rpab</font><font face="Palatino">,

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
6:26, and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262730&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel

by the Sept., &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And mourn, ye rams of the
flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the verb has no other sense but that of rolling,
though the other word may be rendered &#8220;rams,&#8221; as it is in the
masculine gender.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Venema gives the following version,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Howl, ye pastors, and cry aloud, And
sprinkle yourselves with dust, ye illustrious of the flock; For fulfilled are
your days to be sacrificed; And there shall be your breakings, And ye shall fall
like a precious vessel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He considers the first and the fourth line as
connected, and the second and the third; the pastors were to be broken, and the
illustrious of the flock to be slain in sacrifice. There is certainly a
congruity in the parts thus viewed. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE150 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">So the
Targ. renders the sentence, &#8220;For the Lord hath destroyed their
people.&#8221; &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE151 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">The
word rendered &#8220;tents&#8221; means sometimes dwellings, or habitations, and
sometimes pastures; and it is thus variously translated in our version,
according to what the context requires. As &#8220;pastures&#8221; are mentioned
in the previous verse, tents, or habitations, would be the best word here, and
more suitable to the verb that is used, which means to reduce to silence, or to
level, that is, with the ground, and hence to demolish. The rendering of the
Vulg. is &#8220;fields &#8212; arva,&#8221; but of the Syr. and Targ.
&#8220;habitations.&#8221; Venema and Blayney have &#8220;folds,&#8221; which
are probably the habitations intended. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE152
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Literally it is, &#8220;through the burning
of the wrath of Jehovah.&#8221; The word &#8220;fury,&#8221; by which it is
often rendered, is by no means suitable. The Versions vary: &#8220;the wrath of
indignation&#8221; is the Sept.; &#8220;the wrath of fury&#8221; the Vulg.,
&#8220;boiling wrath&#8221; the Sept.; and &#8220;the fury of wrath&#8221; the
Targ. The same words occur at the end of the next verse. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE153 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Another
view is taken by many, that God is compared to a lion forsaking his covert for
the sake of prey; so Crotius, Gataker, Lowth, Henry, and Adam Clarke. Scott
seems to agree with Calvin&#8217;s view; which seems to be favored by what
follows, &#8220;for become has their land a waste,&#8221; etc.; though this may
comport also with the other view, for this may have been stated as a proof that
God had gone forth as a lion seeking his prey; that is, to destroy them. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE154 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">There

46:16, and
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
and we have it again in the next clause. The true reading then most probably is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brj</font><font face="Palatino">.
The verse would then be as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">38. Left hath he like a lion his covert;
For their land hath become a desolation Through the oppressing sword, And
through the burning of his wrath.</font><br></div>

thus the meaning would be more evident. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242530&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:30-31, where &#8220;the roaring&#8221; as of a lion, and the
&#8220;sword,&#8221; are both mentioned; and this confirms the view here given.
In the two last lines, &#8220;the oppressing&#8221; or &#8220;devastating
sword&#8221; is first referred to, &#8212; the visible effect, and then
&#8220;the burning of his wrath&#8221; &#8212; the cause; an order often to be
seen in the Prophets. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Indeed
his message does not seem to have been to the priests nor to the false prophets,
but to the people who came to worship, as though it was useless to address them.
There are none in so hopeless a state as unfaithful and corrupt priests and
false prophets; the people led astray by them may be restored, but their own
case is almost past hope. This appears to be intimated here; for they are passed
by, while the people are addressed. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE156 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">As it

purpose to bring on them for the evil of their doings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here is &#8220;evil for evil,&#8221; the evil of
punishment for the evil of sin. The word is often used in these two senses. It
is changed in the Sept.,

evil,&#8221; says Gataker, &#8220;begetteth evil, a just retaliation of evil for
evil. The evil of iniquity and the evil of penalty are as the needle and the

Jeremiah reached the princes &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

true reading no doubt is, &#8220;the house of Jehovah.&#8221; It was called
&#8220;the new gate,&#8221; says Gataker, because it had been renewed by Jotham.
See

They were now, it seems, before the court of justice, the princes sat as
magistrates or judges; and this was the accusation brought by the priests and
prophets; they had no power themselves of passing the sentence, they only
declared him as worthy of death. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">or, But now, etc. It reads better than
&#8220;therefore,&#8221; as in our version, borrowed from the Vulg. The Sept. is
&#8220;and,&#8221; and the Targ. also. &#8220;Amend&#8221; of our version, is
the Syr.; &#8220;make good&#8221; is the rendering of the other early versions.
He mentions what is posterior first; to hear God&#8217;s voice is in order
previous to the making good our ways; but this is according to the practice
often adopted by the prophets. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

preposition is different, and might be rendered &#8220;against:&#8221; by
killing him, they must have brought the guilt of innocent blood on themselves as
perpetrators, and against the city and its inhabitants as having allowed and
countenanced such a deed. &#8212; Ed</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE164
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Meet,&#8221; in our version, is not

you.&#8221; The Vulg. is nearly the original, &#8220;what is good and right in

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE169 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Both

Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE170 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">There
are two other views taken of this subject; some say that the second example,
that of  Uriah, was introduced by the writer of the narrative, whether Jeremiah
himself or Baruch, and that this was mentioned to shew, that according to this
precedent, Jeremiah would have been killed, had it not been for the
interposition of Ahikam. This is the view taken by Gataker and
Blayney.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what appears most consistent with the whole
passage is the view given by Venema; he considers that the 17th verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
26:17) has been removed from its place between the 19th and the 20<sup>th</sup>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
26:19-20), and that the &#8220;princes&#8221; mentioned the case of Micah in
favor of Jeremiah, and that &#8220;the elders of the land&#8221; adduced the
case of Uriah against him, and that notwithstanding this it is at last added,
that Ahikam, one of the princes, succeeded in his deliverance. That chapters
have been transposed in this book is indubitable; the same thing may also have
happened as to verses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the passage would read thus,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">16. Then said the princes and all the
people to the priests and to the prophets, &#8220;Against this man there is no
judgment of death, for in</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">18. the name of Jehovah hath he spoken
to (or against) us. Micah the Morasthite was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah,
the king of Judah, and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, &#8216;Thus
saith Jehovah of hosts, Sion, being a field, shall be plowed, and Jerusalem
shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the heights
of</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">19. a forest.&#8217; Slaying, did
Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all Judah, slay him? did he not fear Jehovah
and intreat the favor of Jehovah? then Jehovah repented as to the evil which he
had pronounced against them; but we are doing a great evil against our own
souls.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">17. Then rose up men from the elders of
the land and spoke to the</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">20. whole assembly of the people,
saying, &#8220;But there was also a man, who prophesied in the name of Jehovah,
Uriah, the son of Shemaiah,&#8221; etc. etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This arrangement makes the whole narrative plain,
regular, and consistent. The conclusion comes in naturally, that notwithstanding
the adverse speech of the &#8220;elders&#8221; Jeremiah was saved by the
influence of Ahikam, one of the princes. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE171 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">To
avoid what may seem a tautology in this verse, Blayney renders the word for
Egypt, adversaries, &#8212; &#8220;But Jehoiakim the king sent adversaries,
Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt.&#8221; Were
the words rendered literally, the repetition would not appear different from
many that we meet with; &#8220;Then sent the king Jehoiakim men into Egypt with
Elnathan the son of Achbor, even men with him into Egypt.&#8221; The repetition
seems to have been intended to shew that there was a strong force, and not one
man, sent to take the Prophet, and that this force was to go even as far as
Egypt. The version of the Sept. is, &#8220;And the king sent men into
Egypt;&#8221; the Vulg. and the Targ. are the same with our version; but the
Syr. is, &#8220;And the king Jehoiakim sent a certain Egyptian, Elnathan the son
of Achbor, and some with him, into Egypt.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is singular that in one MS. the word

searchers, spies, is found instead of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
rendered often Egypt, though it comes from a root which means to bind close, to
environ, to beset; and so as a hyphil participle it would be besetters, or
catchers &#8212; in modern language, bumbailiffs, which is a corruption for
bound bailiffs. This meaning would exactly suit the passage, &#8220;Then the
king Jehoiakim sent men, catchers, with Elnathan the son of Achbor, even these
men with him into Egypt.&#8221; &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE172 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">This
was his son Gedaliah, and not himself. &#8212; Ed</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE173 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">The
manner in which Calvin accounts for this prophecy being so long kept hid is
ingenious; but modern authors are not satisfied. Lightfoot says, that Jeremiah
was ordered to make these yokes in Jehoiakim&#8217;s time to signify the
subjection of Judah to the king of Babylon, but that he was ordered to send them
to foreign kings in the reign of Zedekiah. The first verse is omitted in the
Sept.; the Greek version as given by Theodoret, has &#8220;Jehoiakim,&#8221; and
so the Vulg. and the Targ., but the Syr. and Arab. have &#8220;Zedekiah;&#8221;
and there are three Hebrew MSS. in which the same is found. What seems most
decisive is the beginning of the next chapter, where Hananiah comes forward in
&#8220;the fourth year&#8221; of Zedekiah and breaks the yoke of Jeremiah.
Gataker, Henry, Lowth, Scott, and Blayney, are all inclined to think that the
mistake originally was that of the scribe. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE174 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">The
fourth verse in our version is not correct, &#8220;And command them to say to
their masters,&#8221; it ought to be, &#8220;And command them as to their
masters (or lords,) saying,&#8221; &#8212; ; for the Hebrew will not admit of
such a transposition. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE175
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Whenever the pronouns are set down in Hebrew,
they are emphatic: the beginning of this verse ought to be rendered, &#8220;I
myself,&#8221; or &#8220;made have I, even I, the earth, the man also and the
beast that are on the face of the earth,&#8221; (not as in our version,
&#8220;upon the ground,&#8221;) etc. The last clause, &#8220;and have given it
unto whom it seemed meet unto me,&#8221; according to Calvin and our version,
ought rather to be, &#8220;and I will give it to whom it shall seem right in my
eyes.&#8221; So Venema and Blayney; and it is according to the Sept., though the

beginning of his reign; and a third, which he prefers, that the fourth year
refers not to Zedekiah, but to the Sabbatical year, it was the fourth in that
cycle; and it appears that according to chronologers the destruction of
Jerusalem happened on a Sabbatical year, the fourth in the eighteenth jubilee.
In this case the first year of Zedekiah being the fourth after a Sabbath-year,
his eleventh would correspond with the next period of their kind, allowance
being made as to the commencement of the year in which he began to reign.
Blayney adopts the second solution. Perhaps it would be best to take

of war, famine, and pestilence, as to various kingdoms, and Judah no doubt as
forming a part of them. Now, in this verse he seems to say, that if a prophet
should be found speaking a different language, contrary to that of all former
prophets, the event alone, the fulfillment of his prophecy alone could prove him
a true prophet. He intimates that as Hananiah said things contrary to all former

Calvin, and explains it thus, &#8212; &#8220;Because by thy lying tales thou

properly signifies declining or turning aside from the straight path, the path
of truth and right, and that here it means the presumption of uttering as a

would suit the three places would be the following: &#8212; &#8220;For of

completely distinct though cotemporaneous: &#8220;To give you the end (of your
exile) and the expectation (of a return,)&#8221; that is, the fulfillment of it.
It is a metonymy, expectation is put for its object, or the thing expected.

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE212 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">The two
first verbs are wanting in the Sept. and the Targ., and the second in the Syr.
The Vulg. is according to our version, which is literally the Hebrew: and there
are no various readings. It is difficult to understand the meaning here of the
second verb, go, or proceed. Some give this meaning, &#8220;And ye shall call
upon me and shall go to your country; and ye shall pray to me, and I will
hearken to you.&#8221; But the sense most suitable appears to be the following,
&#8212; &#8220; And ye shall call on me, and ye shall go on and intercede with
me, and I will hearken to you.&#8221; The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;lh</font><font face="Palatino">
is used in the sense of advancing or of going on in a course that is begun. See

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:19. To &#8220;intercede for themselves and others, was more than to call upon
God. From calling they would go on to intercede, earnestly to plead for
themselves and others, and then the promise is that God would hear them. &#8212;

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">

except the Sept., where it is;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[ti</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8220;for,&#8221; or because. The most usual meaning of the particle is
&#8220;because;&#8221; and it may be so rendered here; for sincerity may be
justly assigned as a reason why prayers are heard, without the implication of
any merit. Indeed, in the very nature of things, prayer without sincerity cannot
possibly be accepted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In our version the meaning of the two verbs is
reversed; the first ought rather to be rendered as meaning &#8220;to search
for,&#8221; and the latter to &#8220;seek.&#8221; With the first is connected
&#8220;finding,&#8221; and this implies searching, and the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;qb</font><font face="Palatino">
means sometimes to search for what is lost. The verse should be, &#8212;
&#8220;And ye shall search for me and ye shall find me, because ye shall seek me
with all your heart.&#8221; To seek God means to seek his favor. They would
search for him whom they had, as it were, lost, and they would find him because
they would seek his favor with all sincerity; it would not be for a mercenary
purpose, but for the sake of enjoying God&#8217;s favor. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftE213</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
order found in this deserves notice; restoration is mentioned first, and then
the means necessary for the purpose, the gathering of the people from all
places; &#8220;I will restore your captivity,&#8221; or captives, &#8220;and I
will gather,&#8221; etc. The concluding sentence is, &#8220;where I have removed
you from there;&#8221; where, and from there, instead of whence. &#8212;

interpreter of prime note rendereth it.&#8221; That

is sometimes an iliative is generally admitted; and here the connection cannot
otherwise be seen. There is a large gap after the 15th verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:15) in the Sept., the verses 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:16-20), are omitted, but not in the other versions nor in the Targ.; and
Blayney has thereby been led to put the 15th verse out of its place and set it
between the 20th and the 21st, but without sufficient reason. The connection, as
shewn by Calvin, is suitable as the verse now is, and by removing it, the drift
of what follows is not so clearly seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another thing advanced by Blayney, though
countenanced by Houbigant and Horsley, two rival innovators, is not to be
admitted, &#8212; that the letter terminates at the end of the 20th verse

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242923&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

Hebrew is, &#8220;that there might be overseers in the house of Jehovah for
every one,&#8221; etc. He was a priest under the high-priest for this purpose.
Zephaniah was second in authority, as it appears from chapter 52:24. He was
probably the ruler or governor of the Temple, as Pashur was,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
20:1. Hence the paraphrase of the Targum as to this clause, &#8220;That thou
mightest be made the chief of the priests in the house of the sanctuary of the
Lord for every one,&#8221; etc. Blayney thinks it probable that Zephaniah
succeeded a priest called Jehoiada, in that office, who had been either deposed
for bad conduct or carried away into exile. Gataker and Grotins think that the
reference is to Jehoiada the priest, the zealous reformer in the reign of
Jehoash, 2 Kings 11 and 12; and that Shemaiah&#8217;s object was to rouse
Zephaniah to shew similar zeal for the house of God. If so, here is an instance,
not uncommon, in which a good example of zeal was perverted for the purpose of
encouraging zeal in exercising tyranny and suppressing the
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is somewhat singular that all the ancient
versions, as well as the Targum, give &#8220;overseers,&#8221; or officers, in

over every one;&#8221; the Sept., &#8220;That thou mightest be an umpire;&#8221;
the Syr., &#8220;That thou mightest be a censor.&#8221; But there are no MSS. in

&#8220;foolish,&#8221; by the Targ. As applied to prophets it means one in an

mostly in a bad sense.</font><br></div>

came from himself, the very thing which God ascribed to the false prophets; thus
wicked men impute to the good the very sin of which they themselves are guilty.
