PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL are among the most
remarkable Predictions of THE ELDER COVENANT. They are not confined within
either a limited time or a contracted space. They relate to the destinies of
mighty Empires, and stretch forward into eras still hidden in the bosom of the
future. The period of their delivery was a remarkable one in the history of out
race. The Assyrian hero had long ago swept away the Ten Tribes from the, land of
their fathers, and he in his turn had bowed his head in death, leaving
magnificent memorials of his greatness in colossal palaces and gigantic
sculptures. The Son of the renowned SARDANAPALUS, the worshipper of ASSARAC and
BELTIS, had already inscribed his name and exploits on those swarthy obelisks
and enormous bulls which have lately risen from the grave of centuries. The
glory of NINEVEAH, passed away, to be restored again in these our days by the
marvelous excavations at KOYUNJIK, KHORABAD, and NIMROUD. Another capital had
arisen on the banks of the Euphrates, destined to surpass the ancient splendor
of its ruined predecessor on the banks of the Tigris. The worshipper of the
eagle-headed NISROCH &#8212; a mighty leader of the Chaldean hordes &#8212; had
arisen, and gathering his armies from their mountain homes, had made the palaces
and halls of NINEVE a desert, had marched southwards against the reigning
PHARAOH of Egypt &#8212; had encountered him at CARCHEMISH &#8212; hurried on to
THE HOLY CITY, and carried away with him to his favorite capital the rebellious
people of the Lord. Among them was a captive of no ordinary note. He was at that
time a child, yet he lived to see this descendant of the hardy Chasdim grow
great in power and fame &#8212; to hear the tale of the fall of TYRE, and
&#8220;the<i> </i>daughter of the ZIDONIANS,&#8221; and of the triumph over
PHARAOH HOPHRA, whom modern researches have discovered in the twenty-sixth
dynasty of Egypt&#8217;s kings. At length the haughty conqueror returns, and
dreams mysteriously. This forgotten prisoner becomes the only interpreter of
wondrous visions of Empires about to arise and spread over distant centuries.
The dreamer is at length gathered to his fathers, yet the interpreter lives on
through the reign of the grandson, and explains a mysterious writing on the
palace wall, amidst revelry which ends in the city&#8217;s overthrow. Cryus and
his Persians, Darius and his Medes rise rapidly to power, and the Prophet rises
with them &#8212; till envy throws the aged Seer into a lion&#8217;s den. But he
perishes not till he has seen visions of the &#8220;future history of mankind.
The triumphs of Pitasia and MACEDON are revealed &#8212; the division of
ALEXANDER&#8217;S Empire &#8212; the wars of his successors &#8212; the
wide-spread dominion of ROME &#8212; the overthrow of the Sacred Sanctuary by
Titus &#8212; and THE COMING OF MESSIAH to regenerate and to rule the world when
the seventy weeks were accomplished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Roll of the Book, containing all these surprising
announcements, has naturally excited the attention of the Scholars and Divines
of all ages. Among the voluminous Comments of the laborious Calvin, none will be
received by the British public with more heartfelt interest than his Lectures
upon Daniel. The various illustrations of Daniel and the APOCALYPSE with which
the press has always teemed, display the hold which these Divine Oracles have
taken of the public mind. Various theories of interpretation have been warmly
and even bitterly discussed. The Praeterist, and the Futurist, the German
Neologian, and the American Divine, have each written boldly and copiously; and
the public of Christendom have read with avidity, because they have been taught
that these predictions come home to our own times, and to our modern
controversies. Abstruse arguments and historical discussions have been rendered
popular, through the expectation of seeing either Pope or Turk, or, perhaps, the
Saracen in THE WILLFUL KING, and THE LITTLE HORN. If Napoleon the First, or
Napoleon the Second, if an Emperor of Russia, or a Pharaoh of Egypt, can be
discovered in the King of the South, pushing at the King of the North &#8212;
then the deep significance of the Prophecy <i>to us </i>is at once acknowledged,
and the intensity of its brightness descends directly upon <i>our own
</i>generation. If the &#8220;twelve hundred and ninety Days&#8221; of the
twelfth Chapter be really years, then the blessing of waiting till &#8220;The
Time of The End&#8221; seems to be upon us, since THE French Revolution, and the
waning of the Turkish sway, and the Conquests of Britain in the East, are then
foretold in these &#8220;words&#8221; which have hitherto been &#8220;closed up
and sealed.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whether any of these theories be true or false, they
have exercised a mighty power over the imaginations of modern Writers on
Prophecy, and have so attracted the minds of Theologians to the subject, as to
give force to the inquiry, What was Calvin&#8217;s view of these stirring
scenes? Without anticipating his COMMENTS, it may be replied, that he disposes
of the important question in a few lines. &#8220;<i>In numeris non sum
Pythagoricus,</i>&#8221; is the expression of both his wisdom and his modesty.
In attempting, however, a solution of these great problems in Prophecy, the
opinions of THE REFORMERS are most important, and among them all none stands
higher as a deep and original thinker than the Author of these Explanatory
LECTURES. It is enough for this our Preface to remark, that the bare possibility
of the contents of this Book corning home to the daily politics of Europe and
the East, adds a charm and a zest to the following pages, which no infirmity in
the Commentator can destroy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In these INTRODUCTORY REMARKS, we shall allude to the
present state of opinion respecting the Genuineness and Authenticity of the Book
itself, touching upon some of the conjectures advanced since Calvin&#8217;s time
to the present, and adverting to the skepticism of German Neology and the bold
speculations of the amiable ARNOLD. In confutation of all Infidel Objections, we
shall next give a general sketch of the History of ASSYRIA and BABYLON, as it
has been lately disentombed by the labors of MM. BOTTA and LAYARD, and rescued
from the intricacies of the Cuneiform Inscriptions by HINCKS and RAWLINSON. By
these means, the Nimrod Obelisk in the British Museum &#8212; the palatial
chambers of KHORSABAD and KOYUNJIK &#8212; the Winged Bull of PERSEPOLIS &#8212;
the statue of Cyrus, Moorghab &#8212; and the magnificent sculpture of DARIUS at
Behistun &#8212; all become vocal proofs of the truthfulness of DANIEL&#8217;S
predictions. A visit to the East India House in London will make us acquainted
with the Standard Inscription of NEBUCHADNEZZAR, containing a list of &#8220;all
tire temples build by the king in the different towns and cities of BABYLONIA,
naming the particular gods and goddesses to whom the shrines were dedicated: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
a journey from Baghdad to the Bier&#8217;s Nimrod, would shew us <i>every
</i>ruin to be of the age of NEBUCHADNEZZAR:&#8221; the testimony of experience
is here decisive. &#8220;I<i> </i>have examined the bricks <i>in
situ,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>says Major Rawlinson, &#8220;<i>belonging, </i>perhaps,
to an hundreds of towns and cities within this area of about 100 miles in
length, and thirty or forty in breadth, and I never found any other legend than
that of Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopalassar, king of Babylon. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
These interesting researches into THE TIMES OF DANIEL will be followed by some
criticism or THE BOOK OF DANIEL Here we might enlarge to an overwhelming extent,
but we are necessarily compelled to confine our remarks to CALVIN&#8217;S method
of interpreting these marvelous Prophecies. It will next be desirable to point
out how succeeding Commentators have differed from our Reformer, while we must
leave the reader to form his own opinion of his merits when he has compared his
views with those of his successors. We shall present him, however, with
sufficient <i>data </i>for making this comparison, and by references to some
modern Writers of eminence; and by short epitomes of their leading arguments, we
hope to render this edition of these celebrated LECTURES as instructive and as
interesting as the limit of our space will allow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">AUTHENTICITY OF
THE BOOK OF DANIEL</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE THIRD CENTURY Of Christianity had scarcely
commenced, when the Authenticity of this Book was fiercely assailed by the
vigorous skepticism of PORPHYRY; and it would be totally unnecessary to allude
to so distant an opponent, had not his arguments been reproduced by the later
scholars of Germany, and adopted by one of our noble spirits, whom in many
things we delight to honor. Although the Jews admitted this Book into their
<i>Haiographa, </i>and our Lord referred to its contents when predicting
Jerusalem&#8217;s overthrow, yet these self-sufficient critics of our day have
repeated the heathen objection which JEROME so elaborately refuted. If we
inquire into the reason for the revival of such obsolete skepticism, we shall
find it in the pride of that carnal mind which will not bow down submissively to
the miraculous dealings of the Almighty. The Prophecies concerning the times of
the Seleucidae and the Lagidae are found to be exceedingly precise and minute
hence it is argued, &#8220;they are no prophecies at all &#8212; they are
History dressed in the garb of Prophecy, written by some pseudo-Daniel living
during their supposed fulfillment.&#8221; The Sacred words of Holy Writ become
thus branded with imposture the testimony of the Jews and of our Lord to the
integrity of the Sacred Canon is set aside, and the simple trust of the
Christian Church both before and since the Reformation is asserted to be a
baseless delusion. The judgment and labors of Sir Isaac NEWTON, the
chronological acumen of FABER and HALES, are nothing but &#8220;the<i>
</i>foolishness of the wise,&#8221; because BERTHOLDT and BLEEK, DE WETT, and
KIRMIS, have repeated the cry &#8220;<i>vaticinia post eventurn!</i>&#8221;<i>
</i>And why this eagerness to degrade this Book to a fabulous compilation of the
Macabian times? Simply because its reception as the Word of God would overthrow
the favorite theories of the Rationalists respecting The Old Testament. We
cannot undertake to reply to such objections in detail; we can only furnish the
reader with a few references to those Writers by whom they have been both
propagated and refuted. We shall first indicate and label the poison. The
proscenium of ROSEMULLER a furnishes us with a succinct abstract of the
assertions of EICHHORNAS in his <i>Einleit. in das A. T.,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of BERTHOLT in his<i> Histor. krit. Einleit,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of BLEEK in his <i>Theolog Zeitschr.,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
and </i>of GRISSINGER in his <i>Neue, ansicht der auffatze im Buche Daniel.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The antidote to these conjectures is contained in HAVERNICK&#8217;S article
on DANIEL, in KITTO&#8217;S Cyclopmdia of Biblical Literature, and also in his
valuable &#8220;New Critical Commentary on the Book of Daniel.&#8221;

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The various theories of these Neologists imply that the Book was written during
the Machabean period, by one or more authors who invented the earlier portions
by mingling fable with history in inextricable confusion, and by throwing around
the history of their own age the garb of prophetic romance! The reception of any
such hypothesis would so completely nullify the whole of Calvin&#8217;s
Exposition, that we feel absolved from the necessity of entering into details.
No disciple of this school will even condescend to peruse these LECTURES. It is
enough for us to know, that these unworthy successors of the early German
Reformers have been met with ability and research by LUDERWALK, STAUDLIN, JAHN,
LACK, and STEUDEL. The unbelief of a SEMLER, and MICHAELIS, and a CORRODI, will
seem to the follower of CALVIN the offspring of an unsanctified reason which has
never been trained in reverential homage to the inspired. Word. The keenness of
this perverse criticism has attempted to explain away two important facts;
first, that EZEKIEL mentions DANIEL as alive in his day, and as a model of piety
and wisdom, (Ezekiel 14:20, and Ezekiel 28:3, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
and secondly, that the Canon of the Hebrew Scriptures was finally closed before
the times of the Maccabean warriors. HAVERNICK also treats with the greatest
erudition the linguistic character of the Book as a decisive proof of its
authenticity. He reminds us that the Hebrew language had ceased to be spoken by
the Jews long before the reigns of the Seleucid, that the Aramaean was then the
vernacular tongue, and yet still there is a difference between the Aramaean of
DANIEL and the late Chaldee Paraphrases of the Old Testament. Oriental scholars
have pronounced this testimony to be decisive. Interesting as his illustrations
are, the numerous subjects which demand our immediate notice will only admit of
our referring the reader to the Professor&#8217;s &#8220;New<i> </i>Critical
Commentary on the Book of Daniel.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Happily there exists a strong conservative protection
against the injury arising from such speculations. They are perfectly harmless
to us when locked up in the obscurity of a foreign language and of a forbidding
theology. But it grieves the Christian mind to find a writer worthy of being
classed among the boldest of Reformers giving the sanction of his authority to
such baseless extravagances. There are many points of similarity between the
characters of ARNOLD and CALVIN. Both were remarkable for an unswerving
constancy in upholding all they felt to be right, and in resisting all they knew
to be wrong. Both were untiring in their industry, and marvelously successful in
impressing the young with the stamp of their own mental rigor. Agreeing in their
manful protest against the impostures of priestcraft, they differed widely
respecting the Book of Daniel. Our modern interpreter, in a letter to a friend, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
writes as follows concerning &#8220;<i>the </i>latter chapters of Daniel, which,
if genuine, would be a clear exception to my canon of interpretation, as there
can be no reasonable spiritual meaning made out of The Kings of the North and
South. But I have long thought that the greater part of the Book of Daniel is
most certainly very late work, of the time of the Maccabees; and the pretended
Prophecy about the Kings of Grecia and Persia, and of the North and South, is
mere history, like the poetical prophecies in Vigil and elsewhere. In fact, you
can trace distinctly the date when it was written, because the events up to the
date are given with historical minuteness, totally unlike the character of real
prophecy, and beyond that date all is imaginary.&#8221; It is not difficult to
detect the leading fallacy of this passage in the phrase &#8220;my<i> </i>canon
of interpretation.&#8221; This original thinker, with a pertinacity equal to
that of CALVIN, had adopted his own method of explaining Prophecy, and
determined at all hazards to uphold it. As the writings of this accomplished
scholar have been very widely diffused, it will be useful to notice the
arguments which he has employed. His &#8220;Sermons on Prophecy&#8221; contain
the dangerous theory, which has been fully and satisfactorily answered by Blake
in his chapter on &#8220;The<i> </i>Historical Reality of Prophecy.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Dr. ARNOLD&#8217;S statements are as follow Sacred
Prophecy is not an anticipation of History. For History deals with particular
nation, times, places, and persons. But Prophecy cannot do thief, or it would
alter the very conditions of humanity. It deals only with general principles,
good and evil, truth and falsehood, God and his enemy. It is the voice of God
announcing the issue of the great struggle between good and evil. Prophecy then,
on this view, cannot be fulfilled literally in the persons and nations mentioned
in its language, it can only be, fulfilled in the person of Christ. Thus, every
part is said to have a double sense, &#8220;one<i> </i>Historical, comprehended
by the Prophet and his own generation, in all its poetic features, but never
fulfilled answerably to the magnificence of is language, because that was
inspired by a higher object the other Spiritual, the proper form of which
neither the Prophet nor his contemporaries knew, but fill-filled adequately in
Christ, and his promises to his people as judgment on his enemies. &#8220;It is
History which deals with the Twelve Tribes of Israel; but the Israel of Prophecy
are God&#8217;s Israel really and truly, who walk with him faithfully, and abide
with him to the end.&#8221;<i> </i>Twice the Prophecies have failed of their
fulfillment, first in the circumcised and then in the baptized Church.
&#8220;The Christian Israel does not answer more worthily to the expectations of
Prophecy than Israel after the flesh. Again have the people whom he brought out
of Egypt corrupted themselves&#8221; and hence Predictions relating to the
happiness of the Church, both before and since the times of the Messiah, have
signally and necessarily failed. We cannot undertake the refutation of this
general theory, we must refer the reader to the satisfactory arguments of Birks.
We can only quote his clear exposition of the manner in which the Visions of
Daniel confute these crude speculations &#8212; &#8220;Instead of a mere glimpse
of the sure triumph of goodness at the last, we have most numerous details of
the steps of Providence which lead to that blessed consummation. The seven years
madness of NEBUCHADNEZZAR, and his restoration to the throne; the fate of
BELSHAZZAR, and the conquests of the MEDES and PERSIANS; the rise of the Second
Empire, the earlier dignity of the Medes, and the later pre-eminence of the
Persians over them; the victories of Cyrus westsyard in Lydia, northward in
Armenia, and southward in Babylon; the unrivaled greatness of his Empire, and
the exactions on the subject provinces; the three successors<i> </i>of CYRUS,
CAMBYSES, SMERDIS, and DARIUS; the accession of XERXES, and the vast armament he
led against Greece, are all predicted within the time of the two earlier
Empires. In the time of the Third Kingdom a fuller variety of details is given.
The mighty exploits of ALEXANDER, his total conquest of Persia, the rapidity of
his course, his uncontrolled dominion, his sudden death in the height of his
power, the fourfold division of his kingdom, and. the extinction of his
posterity; the prosperous reign of the first PTOLEMY, and of the great SELEUCUS,
with the superior power of the latter before his death; the reign of
PHILADELPHUS, and the marriage of BERENICE his daughter with ANTIOCHUS THEUS;
the murder of ANTIOCHUS and BERENICE and their infant son by LAODICE; the
vengeance taken by EUERGETES, brother of BERNICE, on his accession to the
throne; his conquest of Seleucia, the fortress of Syria, and the idol gods which
he carried into Egypt; the earlier death of Callinicus; the preparations of his
sons, SELEUCUS, CERAUNUS, and ANTIOCHUS the Great, for war with Egypt, are all
distinctly set before us. Then follows the history of ANTIOCHUS. His sole reign
after his brother&#8217;s death, his eastern conquests and recovery of Seleucia;
the strength of the two rival armies. and the Egyptian victory at Raphia; the
pride of PTOLOMY PHILOPATER and his partial conquests, with the weakness of his
profligate reign; the return of ANTICHOUS with added strength after an interval
of years, and with the riches of the East; his victories in Judea and the
capture of Sidon; the overthrow of the Egyptian forces at Panium, the honor
shewn by ANTIOCHUS to the Temple, and his care for its completion and beauty;
his treaty with Egypt, the marriage of his daughter CLOPATRA with PTOLEMY
PHILOMETOR, and defection from her father&#8217;s cause; his invasion of the
Isles of Greece; his rude repulse by the Roman Consul, and the reproach of
tribute which came upon him through his defeat; his return to Antioch and speedy
death, are all described in regular order. Then follow the reigns of SELEUCUS
and ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES, given with an equal fitness of prophetic detail, and
close the narrative of the Third Empire. Even in the time of the Fourth and last
Kingdom, though more remote from the days of the Prophet, the events predicted
are not few. We find there, distinctly revealed, the iron strength of the
Romans, their gradual subjugation of other powers, their fierce and warlike
nature, their cruel and devouring conquests, the stealthy policy of their
empire, and its gradual advance in the direction of the East, southward and
eastward towards the land of Israel, till it had cast down the noblest Kings,
and firmly ingrafted its new dominion on the stock of the Greek Empire., We have
next described its oppression of the Jews, the overthrow of their City and
Sanctuary by TITUS, the Abomination of Desolation in the Holy Place, and their
arrogant pride in standing up against Messiah, the Prince of princes.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f15</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the latter portion of these predictions were
really written previously to the, events, they must be inspired; and if a writer
of the Maccabaean period could thus accurately predict the Conquests of Rome in
the East, the whole question is decided there is no reason whatever why the
events of the Second and Third Empire should not have been foretold as clearly
as those of the Fourth. Thus the very existence of the Book before the Jewish
Canon was closed is fact which proves all that is required. These Visions then
become &#8220;the<i> </i>voice of Him who sees the end from the beginning, and
pronounces in his secret, council, even on the destiny of the falling sparrow.
They are designed to stoop to the earthly estate of the Church, while they exalt
her hopes to the glory that shall be revealed . They range through everlasting
ages; but they let fall in passing a bright gleam of light that discovers to us
the ass&#8217;s colt, tied at the meeting of their ways, on which the Lord of
glory was to ride into Jerusalem . Every step in the long vista of preparation
lies before them, from the seven months reign of SMERDIS and the marriage of
BERENICE with ANTIOCHUS,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;271102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
11:2-6,) to the<i> </i>seven months burial of (corpses) in days to come in the
land of Israel, and the marriage supper of the Lamb . They touch, as with an 
wand, the perplexed. and tangled skein of human history, and it becomes a woof
of curious and costly workmanship, that; bespeaks the skill of its Divine
Artificer an outer hanging, embroidered by heavenly wisdom, for that glorious
tabernacle in which the God of heaven will reveal himself for ever.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Throughout this PREFACE and the subsequent
DISSERTIONS the reader will find frequent reference to The DIVINES or GERMANY.
Some of these have proposed explanations of our Prophet which appear to the
English readers manifestly erroneous, that he may fancy we have spent too much
space in confuting them. But he who would keep pace with the Theological
Investigations of the day, may derive improvement from perusing the hypothesis
of BERTHOLDT and DE WETTE, and rejoice that they have elieked the able replies
of HAVERNICK and HENGSTENBERG. In truth, the reader Of DANIEL<i> </i>must put
aside for a while the laudable prejudices which he has been taught to cherish
from his earliest days, and descend into the arena where the contest is
fiereest, &#8212; whether our Prophet was contemporary with NEBUCHADNEZZAR or
ANTIOCHUS. To many the question itself is startling, and that we may be prepared
to meet it, thoroughly furnished with available armory, let us glance over the
wide field of Continental Rationalism as far as it concerns the Authenticity of
Daniel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The system under review is a melancholy off-shoot
from the teaching of LUTHER and his intrepid followers. They led men away from
form, and ceremony, and imposture, to rely upon one BOOK as their Rule of Faith
and Duty. They did more &#8212; they sifted the chaff from the wheat, and by
discarding the APOCRYPHA, placed before the eager attention of mankind the pure
word of heaven. LUTHER and CALVIN held very distinct ideas about Revelation and
Justification, and enforced very boldly their views of the only Books which were
written by the penmanship of the Almighty. Theirs was a work of purification and
of reconstruction on the assertion of the existence of a Divine Revelation, of
its being contained in the Old and New Testaments, and of these documents being
the only Inspired Records of what we are to believe, and how we are to live. In
process of time, each Boole became the subject of separate study &#8212; its
history, its criticism, and its preservation were respectively examined with
intense eagerness &#8212; and a vast amount of information was collected, which
was totally unknown to the Early Reformers. It soon became apparent that the
Reformed Churches were living under a totally different state of things from
theft described in the Old Testament. The events, for instance, of this Book of
DANIEL all seemed so mingled and so intertwined; the ordinary occurrences of
every-day life are so interlaced with marvelous dreams and visions, and the
conduct and passions of monarchs seem so singularly controlled by an unseen
Mind, that the question occurs, Is all this literally true? Did it all actually
come to pass exactly as it is recorded? Or, Is it allegorical, or a historical
romance, or only partially inspired by Jehovah, and tinged in its style and
diction with the natural exaggeration of Oriental imaginary? Such inquiries shew
us how the mind seeks to fathom the mysteries of what is offered to its
veneration, and have led to the conclusion, that the Sacred Books of the Hebrews
are not all pure revelation, but that they contain it amidst much extraneous
matter.

The writers to whom we refer have ever since the sixteenth century been
attempting to define how much of the Hebrew Scriptures is the pure and spiritual
Revelation of the Divine Mind to us, and how much is the unavoidable impurity of
the channel through which it has been conveyed. With the names of some later
critics, the modern Theologian is familiar. GESENIUS, WEGSCHEIDER, AND ROHR, yet
retain a powerful influence over the minds of later students, while SCHULTZ at
Breslau, GIESELER at Gottingen, ALLMANN at Heidelberg, BRETSCHNEIDER at Gotha,
DE WETTE &#8212; lately deceased &#8212; at Basle, hare at Jena, and WEINER at
Leipsic, are writers who worship irreverently at the shrine of human reason, and
either qualify or deny the Inspiration of Revelation.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">FALSE SYSTEMS
OF SCRIPTURE EXPOSITION</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">An important change was necessarily made on the minds
of the successors of the Reformers, by the more general spread of Classical
Literature, and a far better acquaintance with Hebrew philology. Here, we must
allow, that some of the disciples of Luther and CALVIN were better furnished for
the work of Interpretation than their more Christian-minded masters. ERNESTI,
the learned philologer of Leipsic, in 1761 laid down &#8220;The Laws of a wise
Interpretation,&#8221; and has ever since been considered as the founder of a
scholar like system of Scriptural Exposition. His principles are now universally
admitted, viz., that we must make use of history and philology of the views of
the period at which each Book was written, and of all those appliances which
improved scholarship has provided in the case of the Classical Authors of Greece
and Rome. Every attentive reader of German Theology must perceive, that too many
of their celebrated Critics have rested in this outward appeal to mere reason
and. research. SEMLER and TITTMANN, MICHAELIS and HENKE, have pursued this
system of accommodation so far, that they have destroyed the very spirit and
essence of a Divine Revelation. In the Prophets, and especially in DANIEL, whom
SEMLER includes among the doubtful Books, timre is a spiritual meaning only to
be comprehended by the moral and religious faculties; and except this spirit be
elicited, the merely outward form of prophetic dictation can effect no religious
result. LET ROHR and PAULUS sneer as they please, at the mysticism and pietism
of the Evangelic Reformers, we must still contend, that without a spirituality
similar to theirs, all comments are essentially lifeless and profitless to the
soul of man. The may display erudition, but they will not aid the spirit which
hungers and thirsts after righteousness on its way towards
heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Every student who desires to become familiar with
these discussions, may consult with advantage the Dissertations of HENGSTENBERG,
who has written fully and ably on The Genuineness of our Prophet. He has
sketched, historically, the attacks which have been made, and has answered every
possible objection. The impurity of the Hebrew, the words supposed to be Greek,
the silence of Siraeh, the disrespect shewn by the Jews, and the position in the
Canon of Scripture, are all ably discussed. The miracles have been called
&#8220;profuse in number and aimless in purpose;&#8221; historical errors have
been asserted, and statements called contradictory, or suspicious, or
improbable; many ideas and usages have been said to belong to later times. These
and similar arguments are used to shew the Book to be the production of the
times of ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES, but they have been fully treated by this orthodox
Professor at Berlin. He discusses most ably, and with the most laborious
erudition, those marvelous Prophecies of this Sacred Book, which have
necessarily provoked a host of assailants. He reminds us that in the earliest
ages, PORPHYRY devoted his twelfth book to the assault upon this Prophet, and
that we are indebted to JEROME for a knowledge of his objections as well as for
their refutation. He asserted that the Book was composed during the reign of
ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES in Greek, &#8220;and that DANIEL did not so much predict
future events as narrate past ones.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Though the imperial commands condemned his works to the flames, yet EUSEBIUS of
Caesarea, METHODIUS of Tyre, and APOLLINARIS of Laodicea, have ably refuted
them. In later times, the first scholar-like attack upon the genuineness of
various portions was made by J. D. MICHAELIS. COLLINS and SEMLER, SPINOZA and
HOBBES, had each condemned the Book after his own manner but it was left for
EICHORN
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to lead the host of those later theologians who have displayed their vanity and
their skepticism, by the boastfulness of their learning and the emptiness of
their conclusions. HEZEL and CORRODI treat it as the work of an impostor; while
BERTHOLDT, GRIESINGER, and GESENIUS, have each their own theory concerning its
authorship and contents. Other Critics have followed the footsteps of these into
paths most dangerous and delusive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having replied to the most subtle objections against
the Genuineness of these Prophecies, HENGSTENBERG proceeds to uphold the direct
arguments in its favor. He first discusses the testimony of the author himself,
and then enters upon its reception into the Canon of the Sacred Writings. He
comments at full length on the important passage in JOSEPHUS contra Apion. 1:8 ,
and shews the groundlessness of every assertion which impugns its Canonical
value. He next proves that the declaration of our Lord assumes the prophetical
authority of the work, and traces its existence in pre-Maccabaean times. The
alleged exhibition of these Writings to ALEXANDER THE GREAT and the exposition
of their contents to the Grecian Conqueror of the East, form a singular episode
in the midst of profound criticism. The incorrectness of the Alexandrine Version
and its rejection by the Early Church, who substituted that of Theodotion for
it, is turned into an argument against the Maccabaean origin of the original;
for certainly, a composition of which the author and the translators were nearly
contemporary, might be better translated, than one separated by an interval of
many ages. Then the peculiar features and complexion of the original language
point out the <i>exact </i>period to which the writing is to be assigned. The
historical accuracy, the apparent <i>discrepancies, </i>and yet the real
agreement with Profane Narratives, all strengthen the assertion, that the writer
lived during the times of the Babylonian and Persian Monarchies. Another
argument, as strong as any of the former, is deduced from the nature of the
symbolism used throughout the Book. The reasonings of HENGSTENBERG have now
received. additional confirmation from the excavations of LAYARD. The prevalence
of animal imagery, rudely grotesque and awkwardly gigantic, is characteristic of
Chaldean times, and bespeaks an era previous to the Medo-Persian Sculptures at
Persepolis. Summing up his reasonings, the Professor quotes the observation of
FENELON: &#8220;lisez DANIEL, denoncant a Balthasar la vengeance de Dieu toute
prete a fondre sur lui, et cherchez dans les plus sublimes originaux de
l&#8217;antiquite quelque chose qu&#8217;on puisse comparer a ces endroits

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">ENGLISH
PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOL</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The speculations which we have hitherto discussed are
not confined within the limits of unreadable GERMAN NEOLOGY they<i> </i>have
been transfused into English Philosophy, and presented in a popular form to the
readers of our current literature. In a learned and speculative Work, entitled
&#8220;The Progress of the Intellect, as exemplified in the Religious
Development of the Greeks and Hebrews,&#8221; the writer 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
has adopted the untenable hypothesis of the German Neologists. In his second
section of a chapter on the &#8220;Notion of a supernatural Messiah,&#8221; he
writes as follows; &#8220;During the severe persecution under ANTIOCHUS
EPIPHANES, when the cause of Hebrew faith in its struggle with colossal
heathenism seemed desperate, and when, notwithstanding some bright examples of
heroism, the majority of the higher class was inclined to submit and to
apostatize, an unknown writer adopted the ancient name of DANIEL, in order to
revive the almost extinct hopes of his countrymen, and to exemplify the proper
bearing of a faithful Hebrew in the presence of a Gentile Tyrant. The object of
pseudo-Daniel is to foreshow, under a form adapted to make the deepest
impression on his countrymen, by a prophecy, half-allusive, half-apocalyptic,
the approaching destruction of heathenism through the advent of Messiah.
Immediately after the overthrow of the Four Beasts, emblematic of four
successive heathen Empires, the last being the Macedonian with its offset, the
Syrian; the kingdom would devolve to the &#8216; Saints of the Most High,&#8217;
that is, to the Messianic Establishment of Jewish expectation, presided over by
a being appearing in the clouds, and distinguished, like the angels, by his
human form from the uncouth symbols of the Gentile Monarchies.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He treats &#8220;Messiah&#8221; as a &#8220;title which hitherto confined to
human anointed authorities, such as kings, priests, or prophets, became
henceforth, specifically appropriated to the ideal personage who was to be the
Hope, the Expectation, and the Salvation of Israel.&#8221; He discusses the
Seventy Weeks as the fiction of the imaginary DANIEL, and terms the accompanying
predictions &#8220;adventurous,&#8221; and as turning out &#8220;as<i>
</i>fallacious as all that had <i>preceded </i>them.&#8221; His fourth section
on DANIEL&#8217;S<i> </i>MESSIAH is, if possible, more wildly conjectural than
the two preceding ones. Daniel&#8217;s idea, says he, of a supernatural leader
called &#8220;Son of Man,&#8221; became afterwards &#8220;a basis of mystical
Christology.&#8221; Those glowing passages of this Prophet, which fill the
Christian mind with awe and delight, are to this theorist &#8220;the earthly or
Messianic resurrection<i> </i>of pious Hebrews, which was all that was
originally contemplated in the prediction.&#8221; In thus attempting to
overthrow the Inspired authority of DANIEL, he mingles the Books of Esdras and
the Jewish Targum, and is eager to catch at ally Jewish fiction as if it were
true interpretation of ancient prophecy. He alludes to puerile Rabbinical fables
as really explanatory of the Divine Records, and mingles ZOROASTER and
MAIMONIDES, GFRORER and EISENMENGER, as of equal value in determining abstruse
points of sound criticism! The sections with which we are concerned evince the
greatest research and the crudest opinions all hurried together without the
slightest critical skill or philosophical sagacity. With materials gathered
together in the richest abundance, he has presented us with results which are
alike baseless, futile, and injurious. TOBIT and PAPIAS, the Book of BARUCH and
the Book of ENOCH, are all treated as on a level with the writings of Moses or
TACITUS, JUSTIN MARTYR or a German Mystic! The public, too, are in danger of
being imposed on by a show of learning and by long Latinized words and phrases,
which merely disguise, under classical forms, ideas with which the well-read
Divine is already familiar; at the same time, they give such an air of
scholarship to these speculations, that the unlearned may be readily deceived by
their showy rationalism. The whole work utterly fails in its attempt to explain
the rites and symbols of Jewish worship, and to give the slightest explanation
of the &#8220;theories&#8221; and &#8220;philosophies&#8221; of the Old
Testament. The tendency is to reduce it all to mysticism and symbolism, and to
any other &#8220;theosophy&#8221; which leads the mind away from the Christian
assurance of one God, one Faith, and one Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE RECENT
EASTERN DISCOVERIES</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The strongest of all possible arguments against these
fallacious theories has lately been derived from Eastern discovery. Fresh
importation&#8217;s of sculptured rock are daily arriving in Europe, from the
sepulchers of those cities amidst which our Prophet dwelt. The more this new
vein is worked, the richer it becomes. Are we to be told by BLEEK that the
writer of this Book transferred the events of which he was a spectator to the
more ancient times of Assyria and Babylon? and that NEBUCHADNEZZAR and
BELSHAZZAR were but fabulous characters, of which the original types were
ANTIOCHUS and ALEXANDER? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Are EICHHORN and BERTHOLDT to make DANIEL another Homer, or Virgil, or
AEschylus? Then let us appeal to the testimony of MM. BOTTA and LAYARD let us
visit the British museum, and under the guidance of RAWLINSON and HINCKS, let us
peruse, in the arrow-headed characters, the history of the Monarchs of Assyria
and Babylon, and observe how exactly those memorials of antiquity illustrate the
Visions of our Prophet. The assistance which these excavations afford, for the
elucidation of our subject, is too important to be passed over, and we must
venture upon such arguments as may properly enter into a General Preface, while
they vindicate the historical accuracy of the interpretation which CALVIN has so
elaborately set before us in the following LECTURES.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">ANCIENT
ASSYRIAN REMAINS</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The order of the VISIONS suggests the propriety of
treating, first, THE ANCIENT ASSYRIAN REMAINS; then those of BABYLON and
PERSEPOLIS with such notices of the EGYPT OF THE PTOLEMIES as the connection of
the history may require.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The earliest memorials of Assyria have not been
preserved in the records of literature, but by durable engravings on marble and
granite. Within the last fifty years the PYRAMIDS of EGYPT have been compelled
to open their lips of stone to speak for God&#8217;s Word, and the ROSETTA table
suggested to YOUNG and CHAMPOLLION an alphabet by which they read on sarcophagus
and entablature the history of the earliest dynasties of the Nile. What LEPSIUS
and BUNSEN have done for Thebes and Memphis, Dendera and Edfou, LAYARD and
RAWLINSON are now accomplishing for the long lost NINEVEH, the majestic BABYLON,
and the elegant PERSEPOLIS. It has lately been revealed to astonished Europe,
that a buried city lies, in all its pristine grandeur, beneath that huge mound
which frowns over Mosul on the banks of the Tigris. KHORSABAD and KOYUNJIK,
NIMROUD, and BEHISTUN, are now giving up their black obelisks, their colossal
bulls, and their eagle-headed warriors, to become &#8220;signs and
wonders&#8221; to our curious generation. In this general sketch we must avoid
details, however interesting we can only allude to the first Assyrian monuments
discovered by M. BOTTA, in 1843, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f23</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as containing a line of Cuneiform Inscriptions amid winged kings and their
warlike chariots. They are deposited in the Louvre, and form the most ancient of
its esteemed collections. The elegant volumes of LAYARD, and the more tangible
proof of his untiring labors, now deposited in the British Museum, have thrown
new light upon the prophetic portion of the Elder Covenant. Two-coned
Conquerors, winged Chiefs, carrying either the gazelle or the goat, sacred
trees, and their kneeling worshippers &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">enable us to guess at the exploits of a long line of
kings before the age of Saul or Priam. The name of SARDANAPALUS is now rescued
from traditional disgrace, and ennobled in the midst; of a hardy race of
ancestors and successors. Our progress in interpreting these arrow-headed
mysteries, enables us to assign the date 1267 B.C. for the founding of NINEVEH
as a settled point in Asiatic chronology. The earliest historical document in
the world is that on the north-west palace of NIMROUD built by ASSAR-ADAN-PAL.
He informs us of the existence, and celebrates the exploits of TEMEN-BAR the
first, the founder of HALEH, at a time when the Hebrews were just entering the
promised land, and the Argives were colonizing the virgin valleys of Hellas! The
familiar names of SHALMANESER, SENNACHERIB, and ESARHADDON, are found incised
upon the enduring masonry; and it is now possible to ascertain who founded the
MESPILA of Xenophon, who constructed the towers in the south-west palace of
NIMROUD and who stamped his annals on the clay cylinders in the British Museum. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The NIMROUD obelisk becomes a precious relic, since it enables us to ascertain,
for the first time, the events of those nine centuries, during which NINEVEH
existed from its rise to its overthrow. We are mainly concerned with the manner
in which it confirms the truthfulness of the Prophets of the Hebrews, and with
the unanswerable arguments which it supplies against the subtleties of German
Neology. The credibility of one Prophet is intimately bound up with that of
another. Whatever confirms either ISAIAH or EZEKIEL, throws its reflected light
upon Daniel and HOSEA. The god NISROCH, in whose temple Sennacherib was slain,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;121937&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:37, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233738&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:38,) is, repeatedly mentioned on the obelisk as the chief deity of the
Assyrians. The &#8220;SARGON<i> </i>king of Assyria&#8221; (Isaiah 20:1) is most
probably the monarch who founded the city excavated by M. BOTTA; and the
occurrence of the name &#8220;YEHUDA,&#8221; in the 33rd number of the British
Museum series, leads Interpreters to consider the passage as alluding to the
conquest of SAMARIA. The very paintings so graphically described by EZEKIEL,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;262314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
23:14, 15,) have reappeared upon the walls of these palaces. They are, perhaps,
the very identical objects which this Prophet beheld, for he dwelt at no great
distance from them on the banks of the Khabur, and wrote the passage about
thirteen years after the destruction of the Assyrian Empire. The prophecy bears
the date B.C. 593, and &#8220;the latest Assyrian sculpture on the site of
Nineveh must be as early as B.C. 634.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>We would gladly linger over these proofs of the truthfulness of the ancient
Prophets; but further details must be inserted in those DISSERTATIONS which
accompany the text, and we close this rapid sketch of these Assyrian remains in
the touching words of their enterprising Discoverer. &#8220;I used,&#8221; says
Mr. LAYARD, &#8220;to contemplate for hours these mysterious emblems, and to
muse over their intent and history. What more noble forms could have ushered the
people into the temple of their gods? What more sublime images could have been
borrowed from nature, by men who sought, unaided by the light of Revealed
Religion, to embody their conception of the wisdom, power, and ubiquity of a
Supreme Being? They could find no better type of intellect and knowledge, than
the head of a man; of strength, than rite body of the lion; of ubiquity, than
the wings of the bird. The winged-human-headed lions were not idle creations;,
the offspring of mere fancy; their meaning was written upon them. They had awed
and instructed races which had flourished 3000 years ago. Through the portals
which they guarded, kings, priests, and warriors had borne sacrifices to their
altars, long before the wisdom of the East had penetrated to Greece, and had
furnished its mythology with symbols long recognized by the Assyrian votaries.
They may have been buried, and their existence may have been unknown, before the
foundation of the Eternal City. For twenty-five centuries they had been hidden
from the eye of man, and they now stood forth once more in their ancient
majesty. But how changed was the scene around them! The luxury and civilization
of a mighty nation had given place to the wretchedness and ignorance of a few
half-barbarous tribes; the wealth of temples, and the riches of great cities had
been succeeded by ruins and shapeless heaps of earth. Above the spacious hall in
which they stood, the plough had passed and the corn now waved. Egypt had
monuments no less ancient and no less wonderful, but they have stood forth for
ages, to testify her early power and renown, while those before me had but now
appeared to bear witness in the words of the Prophet, that once The Assyrian was
a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud of a high
stature; and his top was among the thick boughs . His height was exalted above
all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches
became long, because of the multitude of the waters which he shot forth. All the
fowls of heaven made nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the
beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all
great nations; for now is &#8216;Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a
wilderness, and flocks lie down in the midst of her; all the beasts of the
nations, both the cormorant and the bittern lodge in the upper lintels of it;
their voice sings in the windows, and desolation is in the
thresholds.&#8217;&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">After centuries of extensive empire, NINEVEH yielded
to a younger rival. The army of Sennacherib had been annihilated by the angel of
the Lord; ESARHADDON, his son, had planted his heathen colonizes in the fertile

been slain, and his son, CYAXARES in alliance with NABOPALASSAR, had taken
NINEVEH, and destroyed for ever its place in the history of Asia. Palaces of
black basalt, bas-reliefs, and hawk-headed heroes, covered with legends of
unbounded triumphs, no longer rose at the bidding of the servants of Bar, and
the worshippers of Assarac, Beltis, and Rimmon. No more</font><br></div>

son of NABOPALASSAR now commences the era of Babylonian greatness. This
enterprising chieftain is no creation of poetic fancy. HERODOTUS and BEROSUS
have recorded his exploits, and we have now the testimony of recent discovery to
confirm the assertions of Daniel, and to throw fresh light upon his

<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The earliest Babylonian record that we
have,&#8221; says Major RAWLINSON, &#8220;is,<i> </i>I think, the inscription
engraved on a triumphal tablet at Holwan, near the foot of Mount Zagros; it is
chiefly religious, but it seems also to record the victories of a certain king
named Temnin against the mountaineers. Unfortunately it is in a very mutilated
state, and parts of it alone are legible. I discovered this tablet on the
occasion of my last visit to Behistun, and with the help of a telescope, for
there are no possible means of ascending the rock, succeeded in taking a copy of
such portions of the writing as are legible . I am not able at present to
attempt a classification of the kings of Babylon, such as they are known from
the various relics that we possess of them nor, indeed, can I say with
certainty, whether the kings recorded, with the exception of NEBUCHADNEZZAR and
his father, may be anterior or posterior to the era of NABONASSAR. The
Babylonians certainly borrowed their alphabet from the Assyrians, and it
requires no great trouble or ingenuity at the present day to form a comparative
table of the characters.&#8221;

valuable monument gives a detail of all the temples which he built throughout
the various cities of his extensive provinces, it names the particular deities
to whom the shrines were dedicated, and mentions other particulars, which our
present ignorance of the language enables us. but partially to comprehend. The
vast; mound of El Kasr contains the remains of a magnificent palace, supposed to
be that of NEBUCHADNEZZAR; but as these recent excavations are more to our
present purpose, it is unnecessary to refer at length to this majestic ruin.

followed the usual method of interpreting it of ALEXANDER and his successors he
naturally assumes them to be real predictions, and believes them to have been
accomplished according to the utterance of their Hebrew captive. And have we no
traces of the foot-prints of Alexander now remaining to us? Not long ago, a
traveler, amid the barren plains of Persia, lighted unexpectedly on a
magnificent ruin &#8212; alone, on a deserted plain &#8212; its polished
marbles, and its chiseled columns all strewed around in wild confusion. This
Chehel-Minar, or hall of forty pillars, was built by the Genii, said the Arabs,
amid the desert solitudes of Merdusht. The Genii builders have lately been
stripped of their disguise of fable, and the long lost Persepolis, destroyed by
the mad frolic of Alexander. stands revealed to the world in the
Takht-i-Jemshid. The grandeur of these pillared halls, these sculptured
staircases, and fretwork fringes of horn-bearing lions, interests the reader of
Daniel, through the inscriptions which they bear on their surface. The ingenuity
of a Westergaard and a Lassen has been displayed in deciphering them, and has
enabled us to discover the original architects. CYRUS and CAMBYSES, DARIUS
HYSTASPES and XERXES, each erected his own portion. One portion can be assigned
to the Achaenenian dynasty, and another to the monarchs of the Sassanian family.
These inscriptions also point out where the rulers of Persia formed their
sepulchral repose. The tomb of Cyrus at Moorghab, his statue discovered and
described by Sir R. K. PORTER, and &#8220;<i>the </i>thousand lines&#8221; on
the sculptured rock of Behistun, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
throw a clear and brilliant light on the statements of DANIEL, as well as on the
narrative of Herodotus. These passing allusions must suffice at. present &#8212;
further discussions must be left for distinct dissertations &#8212; while the
ninth and tenth chapters of Vaux&#8217;s Nineveh and Persepolis will supply
additional information to all who are inclined to search for it. Enough is
introduced, if the reader is impressed with the conviction that Daniel&#8217;s
Vision; and Calvin&#8217;s Lectures are no vague or cunning delusions, no
skillful travestying of history, under the garb of either intentional forgery or
weak credulity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As PERSEPOLIS suggests the triumph of the He-goat,
and the rising of the four horns towards the four winds of heaven,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
8:8,) so it leads us forwards towards the subsequent warfare between Asia and
Egypt. The mighty king stood ups, and his kingdom was broken and the king of the
south became strong and mighty,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;271103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
11:3, 4.) All index here points to the valley of the Nile, where there now
exists a countless host of monuments, raised by the giants of the very earliest
days of out race. On the day when CAMBYSES, flushed with victory, stabbed with
his own hand the living Apis, and commanded the bones of the Pharaohs to be
beaten with rods, he struck to the heart the genius of the Nile. At that moment,
the quarries were teeming with busy sculptors, numerous as swarming bees &#8212;
massive monoliths were becoming Sphinxes and Memnons, while architrave&#8217;s
and propyla, worthy of the TEMPLE of KARNAK, were emerging from the living rock.
They all retired to rest that evening, intending to renew their labor on the
morrow, but. can the morrow bursts the avenging Persian, and that long train of
workers are still for ever. But their unfinished handicraft remains for the
astonishment of our later centuries. A perfect statue only awaits one final blow
to detach it from its parent rock &#8212; there runs the track of the wheels
which had come to transport it to either EDFOU or Luxor; there may be seen the
very marks of the tools which lay by its side all night, and were never used on
the next fatal morning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Henceforth Egyptian art is transferred to the tombs
and palaces of the kings of Persia. It is cheering to feel, that as our
knowledge of the significance of these treasures advances, they confirm the
assertions of Holy Writ. Among the mural sculptures at KARNAK, one of the
captives, with a Jewish physiognomy, bears the title which we can now read
&#8212; YOUDAH MALEK, meaning a king of Judah. THE ROSETTA STONE in our National
Museum, which is the basis of modern Egyptology was sculptured as late as B.C.
195 and contains decree of PTOLEMY EPIPHANES, to whom Daniel is supposed to
refer. The primaeval antiquity of THE ZODIAC on the majestic portico DENDERA,
has now been disproved. &#8220;The Greek Inscription on the pronaos refers to
TIBERIUS and HADRIAN.&#8221; The hieroglyphic legends on the oldest portion of
its walls belong to the last CLEOPATRA while the Zodiac was constructed between
A.D. 12 and 132. While we willingly allow the connection between Assyria and
Egypt as early as the thirteenth century before Christ, and admit the occurrence
of its name on the Nimroud obelisk in the British Museum, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F30</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and on the sculptures of Behistun and Nakhshi-Rustam, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F31</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet; we contend. against that assumption of a false antiquity, which is assumed
for the purpose of throwing discredit upon die prophetic portions of our Sacred
Oracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is the result of our rapid sketch of
these remains of the dynasties of former eras? A complete overthrow of the
baseless fabrications of German Neology. Till the arrow-headed character was
deciphered, the history of NINEVEH was almost a bank to the world. As Assyria
and Babylon now breathe and live in resuscitated glory, so all that DANIEL wrote
is confirmed and amplified by the marbles and tombs which have traveled to this
Island of the West. Hence this Captive of Judah really lived while the Head of
Gold was towering majestically upon the allegorical image. Neither poet nor
impostor of the reign of ANTIOCHUS could have fancied or forged characters and
events which accord so exactly with the excavations of a LAYARD, or the
decipherings of a RAWLINSON. Skeptical infidelity must now hide its head for
ever, and speculations of the school of Arnold must shrink into their original
insignificance.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">POSITIVE
EVIDENCE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The positive evidence of additional facts may also be
adduced. This Book was translated by The Seventy many years before the death of
ANTIOCHUS, and the translation was well known to JEROME, although it has not
come down to our age. Bishop CHANDLER has pointed out fifteen places in which
JEROME refers to it; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and Bishop HALIFAX has collected many conclusive arguments on these and kindred
topics. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The words of JOSEPHUS are explicit enough as to the received opinion in his day,
&#8220;you will find the Book of DANIEL, in our Sacred Writings.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F34</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
MAIMONIDES, indeed, has attempted to detract from its high reputation, but has
been sufficiently refuted by ABARBANEL and the son of JARCHI. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F35</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The arrangement of the Jews, which places this Book among the Hagiography, and
not among the Prophets, seems also to be intended to depreciate its Canonical
value; but while the earlier Talmudists place<i> </i>it with the Psalms and the
Proverbs, the later ones range it with Zechariah and Haggai. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When Aquila and Theodotion translated their Versions, he was admitted to the
Prophetic rank and although we can &#8212; not absolutely determine the point
from the MS. of the Septuagint in the Chigian Library at Rome, yet the
probability is highly in its favor. ORIGEN places DANIEL among the Prophets and
before EZEKIEL, following the example of Josephus in his first book against
Apion.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JEWISH
TESTIMONIES &#8212; SINAITIC INSCRIPTIONS</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Instead of following the beaten track of reference to
JEWISH COMMENTS and RABBINICAL TRADITIONS, which CALVIN always quoted and
refitted, we shall here introduce a collateral branch of singular and valuable
evidence. As the surface of the Theological world is much agitated by doubts of
historic facts, originating alike with Rationalists and Romanists, it is
desirable to fortify our evidence from existing inscriptions of correlative
value with those of Nineveh. That far-famed seceder to Rome, Dr. Newman, speaks
of some &#8220;Scripture Narratives which are quite as difficult to the reason
as any miracles recorded in the History of the Saints;&#8221; and he then
instances that &#8220;of the Israelites flight from Egypt, and entrance into the
Promised Land.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Anxious as the votary of either Superstition or of Reason may be to suggest
doubts as to the recorded facts, THE ROCKS OF SINAI are now vocal with the
voices of the moving Tribes Valley after valley has been found in which these
SINAITIC INSCRIPTIONS<i> </i>abound. &#8220;Their numbers may be computed by
thousands, their extent by miles, and their positions above the valleys being as
often measurable by fathoms as by feet.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
These hitherto unreadable remnants of a former age have now been read, and they
become fresh confirmations of the truthfulness of the Mosaic Narrative. It is
enough for our present purpose to refer to the conclusive labors of the Rev.
CHARLES FORSTER, who has compared the characters used with those of The ROSETTA
STONE, with the Arrow-headed Character, and with the Alphabets of Etruria,
Palmyra, and Persepolis; and has been enabled to read what neither BEER could
decipher nor POCOCKE explain. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By him they are shewn to record the bitterness of the Waters at Marah &#8212;
the Flight of Pharaoh on horseback &#8212; the Miracle of the feathered fowls,
the Murmuring at Meribah &#8212; and the Uplifting of the hands of Moses at the
battle of Rephidim. Thus the &#8220;Written Valley,&#8221; and the
&#8220;Written Mountain,&#8221;&#8217; have rendered their testimony in favor of
Revelation. &#8220;No difficulties of situation, no ruggedness of material, no
remoteness of locality, has been any security against the gravers of the one
phalanx of mysterious scribes. The granite rocks of the almost inaccessible
Mount Serbal, from its base to its summit, repeat the characters and
inscriptions of the Sandstone&#8217;s of the Mokateh.&#8221; Countless
multitudes are supposed to be yet undiscovered. And what people but the
Israelites could have engraven them? Professor BEER allows them to be all of the
same age &#8212; the soil affords no sustenance for hordes of men, and never did
provide for the existence of a settled population. This wilderness may be
periodically traveled through, but never has been permanently settled by
mankind. The very execution of such works requires the use of ladders and
platforms, ropes, baskets, and tools, and all the usual instruments of a long
established population. But no people could have executed all this unproductive
labor without a ready supply of water and food. If, then, a single generation
carved and grayed these countless Inscriptions, how can we account for the fact,
except by the Mosaic narrative? Whence came the bodily aliments, by which so
many workmen were enabled to carry out their hazardous employments for so long
and continuous a period? Grant that Israel coming out of Egypt performed them,
and the difficulty is solved &#8212; adopt; any other possibility, and the
problem becomes perfectly insoluble! We forbear to enter further little this
important discussion; it is enough to have awakened this train of thought, in
accordance with our previous reasonings.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE CONTENTS OF
THE BOOK OF DANIEL.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The CONTENTS of this Book admits of an easy and
natural division. The first part has been called &#8220;The Historical,&#8221;
and the second &#8220;The Prophetical&#8221; portions. Each contains, six
chapters, and the Comments on each, with the Editor&#8217;s, Dissertations, will
respectively occupy a Volume. The HISTORICAL PORTION contains Predictions; but
they were, not uttered by DANIEL himself, and seem to spring naturally out of
the events of the times. It is not without its difficulties. The learned have
differed respecting the existence of a second NEBUCHADNEZZAR, the person and
character of CYRUS, and the reign of Darius the Mede. Strenuous efforts have
been made to show that one NEBUCHADNEZZAR plundered the Temple, and another was
afflicted by madness that the Koresh of the last verse of the sixth chapter is
not CYRUS THE GREAT, but an obscure Satrap of an earlier age. A noble Duke,
those scriptural researches confer higher honor on His name than the coronet he
wears, has proposed an elaborate theory for the better explanation of&#8221; The
Times of DANIEL,&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the hypothesis has met with an equally learned reply by the author of
&#8220;The<i> </i>Two later Visions of DANIEL.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>A detail of the arguments on both sides will be found in the
Dissertation&#8217;s previously referred to. The discrepancies between HERODOTUS
and XENOPHON, which Archbishop SECKER tried in vain to reconcile, must be again
discussed; the critical value of PTOLEMY&#8217;S Astronomical Canon ascertained,
and many subordinate and collateral events examined. Calvin makes no pretensions
to minute Historical Criticism- he adopts the received opinions of his day, and
if he sometimes errs, he does so in ignorance of other sources of knowledge
which have since been opened to the world. But his diligence and his judgment
have preserved him from errors of ally ultimate importance; and it must be
always remembered that the Antiquarian Researches of later times have thrown a
flood of light upon these distant Eras. Baseless conjecture has, indeed, done
much to pervert and mystify the plainest truths; but the materials themselves
are of a most varied and intricate character; and the satisfactory adjustment of
these historical difficulties requires the highest powers of discrimination, as
well as the most comprehensive grasp of all the conflicting evidence by which a
doubtful event is embarrassed.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE SEVENTY
WEEKS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In attempting to appreciate Calvin&#8217;s Comments
on the Historical Portion of this Book, and of the celebrated period Of
&#8220;THE SEVENTY WEEKS,&#8221; it will be necessary to advert to some abstruse
points of Chronology. We would willingly avoid any tedious discussion of dates
and figures, but the interest of many important questions now frequently turns
upon such arithmetical proofs. A strong assertion of the Chevalier BUNSEN<i>
</i>must justify us in the course which we are about to pursue. &#8220;All the
results,&#8221; says he, &#8220;of Jewish or Christian Research<i> </i>are;
based upon the Writings of the Old Testament and their Interpretation, and upon
the connection between the Chronological data they supply and divine Revelation.
There are points, therefore, relative to which it is of vital importance, both
to the sound thinker and the sound critic, to arrive at a clear understanding
before embarking upon his inquiry ... The question is, Whether the external
History related in the Sacred Books be externally complete, and capable of
chronological arrangement?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The reply should be given &#8220;with<i> </i>a deep feeling of the respect due
to the general chronological statements of Scripture, which have been considered
during so many centuries as forming the groundwork of religious faith, and are
even at the present moment intimately connected<i> </i>with the Christian
Faith.&#8221; Let but these principles of the learned Egyptologist guide us in
our decisions, and we may hope for the blessing of Heaven in disentangling many
of the Historical intricacies which will soon come under our
notice.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">TIIE
PRAETERIST,
ANTI-PAPAL,</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">AND FUTURIST
VIEWS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In attempting to determine the intrinsic value of
these LECTURES, it becomes necessary to compare Calvin&#8217;s Prophetic
Interpretations with those of the Divines who preceded and have followed him.
The scheme proposed for interpreting, these Visions may be classed generally
under this threefold division, viz., the PRAETERIST, the ANTI-PAPAL, and the
FUTURIST VIEWS. The first view is that usually adopted, with some slight
modifications, by the Primitive Church and the Earlier Reformers. The second,
sometimes called rite &#8220;Protestant&#8221;<i> </i>System, supposes the Papal
power to be prominently foretold by both DANIEL and Sir John; while the Third
System defers the accomplishment of many of these Prophecies to times yet
future. If these three Systems be borne distinctly in mind, it will become easy
to understand how the most popular modern explanations differ for in those of
the earlier period of the Reformation. The Primitive Church has, with few
exceptions, agreed in considering The Head of Gold to mean, either the
Babylonian Empire or the person of Nebuchadnezzar; the Silver denoting the
Medo-Persian; the Brass the Greek; and the Iron the Roman; while the mixture of
the Clay denotes the intermingling of Conquered Nations with the power of
Heathen Rome. In interpreting the Four Beasts, the Lion denotes the Babylonian
Empire; the Eagle Wings relate to Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s ambition; the Bear to
the Medo-Persians; the Leopard to the Macedonians; and the Fourth Beast to the
Romans. The Ten Horns were differently explained; some referring them to Ten
individual Kings, and others to Ten Divisions, of the Empire; some supposing
them to commence with the Roman sway in the East, others not till the Fourth or
Fifth Centuries after Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Calvin differs slightly from the earlier, and most
materially from the later Commentators. Supposing the Fourth Boast to typify the
Roman Empire, &#8220;The<i> </i>Tell Kings,&#8221; he says, &#8220;were not
persons succeeding each other in dominion, but rather the complex Form of the
Government instead of a unity under one head.&#8221; The number
&#8220;ten&#8221; is, he thinks, indefinite, for &#8220;many,&#8221;<i> </i>and
the Sway of a Senate instead of a Monarchy is the true, fulfillment of the
Prophecy. The rise of one King and his oppressing three, refers to the two
Caesars, JULIUS and OCTAVIUS, with LEPIDUS and ANTONY. How unconscious was
CALVIN that succeeding Protestant Writers would determine The &#8220;Little
Horn&#8221; to be the POPE, and the Three Kings, the Exarchate of Ravenna, the
Kingdom of Lombardy, and the State of Rome. Here the multitude of modern
commentators differ most materially from the author of these LECTURES. The
&#8220;Time, Times, and Half a Time&#8221; of this chapter, CALVIN refers to the
persecution of the Christian Church under NERO, and similar tyrannical Emperors
of Rome, and gives not the slightest countenance to any allusion in these words
to a specified number of years. &#8220;Time and Times&#8221; are with him a long
undefined period; and &#8220;Half a Time&#8221; is added in the spirit of the
promise to shorten the time, for the Elects sake. Those modern Writers, who
think the Year-Day theory essential to the full exposition of the Visions of
DANIEL, will be disappointed by the opinion of our Reformer. He takes no notice
of either the 1260 years of the Papacy, or the 1290 years for the reign of
Antichrist. Again, there are Writers who deny the Fourth Beast to refer to ROME
at all. ROSENMULLER and TODD are instances; and each of these has his own way of
interpreting the concluding portion of this chapter. The former asserts it to be
fulfilled in the Greek Empire in Asia after ALEXANDER&#8217;S death, and the
latter supposes it to be yet future. According to Dr. Todd and the Futurists, it
has yet to be developed. Its fulfillment shall be the precursor of THE FINAL
ANTICHRIST, whom the Lord shall destroy with the brightness of his PERSONAL
ADVENT. This Antichrist shall tyrannize in the world for the &#8220;Time, Times,
and Half a Time,&#8221; that is, for the definite space of three years and a
half, till the Ancient of Days shall proclaim THE FINAL CLOSE OF THE GENTILE
DISPENSATION.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The three views,<i> </i>then, of the Interpretation
of these Prophecies are thus clearly distinguished. The <i>Praeterits, </i>view
treats them as fulfilled in past historical events, taking place under the
several Empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Heathen Rome. The modern
<i>Anti-Papal </i>view treats &#8220;The Little Horn&#8221; as the Pope, and the
drays as years; and this stretches the predictions over the Twelve Centuries of
European struggle between the Ecclesiastical and the Civil Powers. The
<i>Futurist </i>is dissatisfied with the Year-Day theory he cannot agree with
the past fulfillment of these glowing images of future blessedness. Hence,
instead of either ANTIOCHUS, MAHOMET, NERO, or the POPE, he sees a future
Antichrist in the Eleventh Horn of the seventh chapter, in The Little Horn of
the eighth chapter, and ht The Willful King of the eleventh chapter. He rejects
entirely the Year-Day explanation, and every assertion which is based upon it,;
he takes the days literally as days, and supposes them yet unfulfilled. The
&#8220;Toes&#8221;<i> </i>of the image, and the &#8220;Horns&#8221;<i> </i>of
the beasts, are not to him Kingdoms or Successions of Rulers of any kind, but
single individual persons. The phrase, The Pope, as equivalent to a
&#8220;Horn<i>,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>is to him a fallacy as it does not mean one
person, like an ALEXANDER or a SELEUCUS; or a single despotic Antichrist &#8212;
but a long succession of Rulers, one after another. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
FABER, for example, interprets &#8220;the<i> </i>Scriptures of Truth,&#8221;
chapter 11, by extending it throughout all history, till the end of the Gentile
Dispensation. Dr. Todd refers it solely to its close, and contends very strongly
against the usual explanation of the Fourth verse. Elliott, again, (Horae Apoc.,
volume 3,) expounds this chapter to the 35th verse with great propriety and
clearness, but passes at once from the Ptolemidae and Seleucidae to the Pope, as
signified by &#8220;The Willful King.&#8221; The Days<i> </i>then become Years,
and. the various phases of the Papacy throughout many centuries are supposed to
be predicted here, and fulfilled by the decrees of JUSTINIAN, persecutions of
the Waldenses, French Revolutions, and catastrophes and convulsions yet to come.
Our American brethren have adopted similar theories. Professor Bush in his
&#8220;Hierophant,&#8221; has inserted an able exposition of the &#8220;Little
Horn,&#8221; as unquestionably the Ecclesiastical Power of the
&#8220;Papacy,&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and introduced the GOTHS and CHARLEMAGNE as fulfilling their own portions of
this interesting Vision. Professor STUART, however, of Andover, and some of his
followers, have returned to the simplicity of the Earlier Expositors

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">CALVIN
PROPHETIC SCHEME.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Calvin, then, was, on the whole, a Praeterits. He saw
hi the history of the world before the times of the Messiah the fulfillment of
the Visions of this Book. They extended from NEBUCHADNEZZAR to Nero. &#8220;The
Saints of the Most High&#8221; were to him either the Hebrew or the Christian
Church under heathen persecutors. the had a glimpse indeed of the times of the
Messiah, and expressed his views in general language; but he rejected the idea
of any series of fulfillment&#8217;s through a succession of either Popes or
Sultans. He saw in these four-footed beings, neither MAHOMET, nor JUSTINIAN, nor
the Ottoman Empire, nor the Albigensian Martyrs. Heathen Rome, and its Senate,
and its early Caesars, were to him what Papal Rome, and its Priesthood, and its
Gregories, have been to later Expositors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our SECOND VOLUME, which contains THE PROPHETICAL
PORTION of the Book, will be illustrated by many <i>Dissertations,</i> which<i>
</i>will condense the sentiments of later Expositors. Ample scope will then be
given to important details. Extracts will be made from the most approved
Moderns, and copious references to the best sources of information. IT will be
sufficient here to insert the reply of Professor Bush of New York to Professor
STUART of Andover, as illustrating the importance of the difference between
those who adopt the Year-Day theory and those who do not &#8220;Denying
<i>in</i> <i>toto, </i>as I do, and disproving, as I think I have done, the
truth of your theory in regard to the literal import of Day, I can of course see
no evidence, and therefore feel no interest in your reasonings respecting the
events which you consider as the fulfillment of these splendid Visions. If a
<i>Day </i>stands for a <i>Year, </i>and a <i>Beast </i>represents an <i>Empire,
</i>then we are imperatively remanded to a far different order of occurrences in
which to read the realization of the mystic scenery from that which you have
indicated. As the Spirit of Prophecy has under his illimitable ken the most
distant future as well as the nearest present, I know nothing, in reason or
exegesis, that should prevent the affairs of the Christian economy being
represented by DANIEL as well as by JOHN. As the Fourth Beast of Daniel lives
and acts through the space of 1260 years, and as the Seven-headed and Ten-horned
beast of John prevails through the same period, and puts forth substantially the
same demonstrations, I am driven to the conclusion that they adumbrate precisely
the same thing &#8212; that they are merely different aspects of the same really
&#8212; and this, I have no question, is the <i>Roman, Empire. </i>This you
deny; but I submit that the denial can be sustained only by shewing an adequate
reason why the Spirit of God should be debarred from giving such extension to
the Visions of the Old Testament Prophets. Until this demand is satisfied, no
progress can be made towards convincing the general mind of Christendom of the
soundness of your Expositions. The students of Revelation will still reiterate
the query, Why the oracles of DANIEL; should be so exclusively occupied with the
historical fates of ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES? If I do not err in the auguries of the
times, a struggle is yet to ensue on the prophetic field between two conflicting
parties, on whose banners shall be respectively inscribed, <i>Antiochus and
Antichrist.</i>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">OECOLAMPADIUS,
ZUINGLE, AND BULLINGER.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is precisely the point that these Lectures will
assist in determining, and the following sketches of the opinions of the
immediate predecessors and successors of our Reformer, will be useful hi guiding
the judgment of the reader.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One of the most learned of the Commentators among the
Early Reformers was OECOLAMPADIUS, the well-known companion of ZUINGLE.
BULLINGER published his notes on the Prophets about fifty years before BEZA
edited Calvin&#8217;s <i>Lec</i>tures. His character for piety and profound
erudition stood high among his contemporaries, and his elaborate expositions of
the Prophets form a tangible proof of his industry, ingenuity, and Christian
proficiency. Some account of the method in which he treats these interesting
questions will here be appropriate. He divides the Book into the two natural
divisions &#8212; the Historical and the Prophetical. His remarks on the former
portion contain nothing which demands our notice at present; but his second
division contains some valuable comments. He takes the Four Beasts of chapter 7
for the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman Empires, dwells on the cruelties
of Sylla and MARIUS, TIBERIUS and NERO; and accuses ABEN-EZRA and the Jews of
denying this Fourth Beast to mean Heathen Rome, lest they should be compelled to
embrace JESUS as their Messiah. He is not satisfied with JEROME&#8217;S opinion,
that the Ten Horns mean Ten Kings, who .should divide among them the territories
of the Roman power. He takes the numbers &#8220;ten&#8221; and
&#8220;<i>seven</i>&#8221;<i> </i>for complete and perfect numbers, quoting from
the parable, &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like <i>ten </i>virgins.&#8221; He
quotes and approves of HIPPOLYTUS, who asserts &#8220;the<i> </i>Little
Horn&#8221; to mean the Antichrist., to whom St. PAUL alludes in the Second
Epistle to the Thessalonians. APOLLINARIUS and other Ecclesiastical Writers
judge rightly in adopting this interpretation, while POLYCHRONIUS is <i>deceived
</i>by PORPHYAY in referring it to ANTIOCHUS. But who is this Antichrist? Is he
supposed to rule after the destruction of Heathen or of Papal Rome?
OECOLAMPADIUS furnishes us with many opinions &#8212; some supposing MAHOMET,
others TRAJAN, and others the PAPAL SEE. He quotes the corresponding passage in
the APOCALYPSE, and implies that the successors of MAHOMET and the occupiers of
the Chair of ST. PETER are equally intended. By thus introducing the modern
history of Europe and of Asia, he leans rather to the second of those divisions
into which Commentators on DANIEL have been divided. On this testing question of
&#8220;the Time, Times, and Half a Time&#8221; he assumes it to mean three years
and a half, he has no limit of any extension of the time through 1260 years;
adding, &#8220;there is no reason why we should be religiously bound to that
number, or follow puerile and uncertain triflings.&#8221; He will not allow
Antichrist to be only a single person, and thus throws an air of indefiniteness
over the whole subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Consistently with these principles, he interprets
&#8220;The<i> </i>Willful King&#8221; of chapter 11 by both MAHOMET and the
PAPACY; and explains how this twofold power should be destroyed in the Holy
Land. The repetition in the numbers in chapter 12 is treated very concisely.
Literal days are said to be intended, and the possibility of ascertaining
certainty is doubted. &#8220;<i>If </i>any one has detected any certainty in
these obscure dates, I do not envy him the exposition already offered satisfies
me; for it is not in our power to know the precise divisions of the time
(<i>articulos temporum</i>)<i>.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Throughout the whole Comment
of OECOLAMPADIUS, there is a tone of pity, and a proficiency in correct
interpretation which we seek for in vain in some disciples of the Early
Reformers. He was evidently a spiritually-minded man, and was always preaching
Christ in his Comments on the Old Testament. In the is respect he equals, and if
possible surpasses the more elaborate CALVIN. The extreme spirituality of this
eminent Reformer entitles him, in these days, to more notice than he receives.
His constant effort&#8217;s to honor Christ as his Redeemer, and the practical
and persevering manner in which he preaches the gospel of his Redeemer, in his
<i>Old </i>Testament Exposition, should render his writings familiar to every
sincere and simple-minded Christian. And we are not surprised when we hear
competent judges of the difference between CALVIN and himself prefer the tone of
his remarks to that of his more vigorous ally.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">GROTIUS</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Commentary of Grotius is also worthy of
comparison with that of CALVIN. He is very precise and minute in shewing how the
history of the East has borne out the truthfulness of the predictions; and is,
perhaps, more accurate in details than his predecessor he differs, indeed, in a
few points of importance, which will be separately noticed, but, on the whole,
his remarks are correct and judicious. The Ten Kings of the seventh chapter
(Daniel 7) he considers to be Syrian Monarchs, and enumerates them as Seleuci,
Antioch, and Ptolemaei. POLANUS and JUNIUS, two Commentators who are constantly
quoted by poole, in his Synopsis, treat. the passage in a similar way. The king
to arise after them is still confined to the Jewish era, and &#8220;the Time,
Times,&#8221; etc., are supposed to be literally three years and a, half. The
36th verse of chapter 11
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;271136&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
11:36), GROTIUS interprets of ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES, and is supported by JUNIUS,
POLANUS, MALDONATUS, WILLET, and BROUGHTON. The &#8220;Days&#8221; of the
twelfth chapter are taken literally by all the Commentators quoted by Poole from
CALVIN to MEDE, and all sup &#8212; pose the period intended to be during the
reign of the successors of ALEXANDER. MEDE was the well-known reviver of the
Year-Day theory. Before his time it was a vague assertion, he first gave it
shape, and form, and plausible consistency, and since his (lay it has been
adopted by many intelligent Critics, among whom are Sir ISAAC NEWTON, BISHOP
NEWTON, FABER, FRERE, KEITH, AND BIRKS.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">MALDONATUS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Commentary of MALDONATUS, the Jesuit, demands
more extended notice, as he lived about the times of our author, and calls him
<i>Patriarcha Hereticorum, </i>and looks upon the subject from exactly the
opposite point of view. His exposition of JEREMIAH, BARUCH, EZEKIEL, and DANIEL,
was published at Moguntiae, (Mentz,) 1611. In his <i>procemium </i>he sketches
the life of DANIEL, and defends his Book against PORPHYRY, the Manichaeans, and
the Anabaptists. He quotes the mention made of DANIEL by EZEKIEL, and lays it
down as a rule, that our ignorance of the author of a book does not impeach its
Canonical Authority; and in the spirit of his Religious Society, lays special
stress upon the judgment and decision of &#8220;<i>the </i>Church.&#8221; He
next argues in favor of the Apocryphal Books attributed to this Prophet, and
then prefers the authority of his Church to the testimony of JEROME. He defends
the canonicity of the stories of Susannah and the Idol Bel, and comments on them
in two additional chapters, and places &#8220;The Song of the Three
Children&#8221; between Daniel 23:3-4, translating from Theodotion&#8217;s
version. There is nothing worthy of special notice in his remarks on the first
six chapters; but the next six treat of the reign&#8217;s of Christ. and of
Antichrist. In accordance with this view, he decides upon the Fourth Beast of
tale seventh chapter as the Roman Empire, after rejecting the opinion of
ABEN-EZRA in favor of the Turks, and that of PORPHYRY, who thought it to be the
successors of ALEXANDER. Respecting the &#8220;Little Horn,&#8221; his wrath is
stirred up, for&#8221; the heretical Lutherans and Calvinists, and other
monstrous sects,&#8221; had dared to pronounce it to be the Roman Pontiff.
&#8220;But this interpretation even their master, Calvin, has shewn to be
absurd.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He combats the notion that by one term all the Roman Pontiffs are intended; and
then triumphantly asks, Where are the &#8220;Three&#8221; whom this single one
was to pluck up? He further inquires, Whether all were past in his own day, or
all future? He determines that it is all yet to be fulfilled, and thus becomes
an adherent to the cause of the Futurists. As neither the Ten Horns nor the
Eleventh have yet come into existence, it is natural to conclude the Eleventh to
be that Antichrist whom JEROME represents not as a Demon, but a man in whom
&#8220;a whole Satan shall corporally dwell.&#8221; He shall reign, he thinks,
three years and a half &#8212; a distinct and fixed period &#8212; objecting to
what he calls &#8220;figurt; Calvini,&#8221; viz., that an uncertain period is
intended by so clear an expression. The, various opinions of his predecessors on
Daniel 11:36, move rather his derision than his wrath. Their notions about
CONSTANTINE, and MAHOMET, and the ROMAN PONTIFFS, do not need his serious
refutation. Almost all Catholics, he adds, both ancient and modern, refer it to
the Antichrist. He also accuses the greater part of &#8220;the<i> </i>New
Heretics&#8221; of stating the Michael of the 12th chapter to be, Messiah
himself; and treats the &#8220;days&#8221; of the close of this chapter as
partly fulfilled under the Jewish and partly under the Christian dispensations.
His inconsistency in this interpretation is more apparent than in the preceding
ones; while his work on the whole is worthy of perusal, as he quotes with
judgment the opinions of learned Jews and of the earlier Commentators of the
Christian Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Within the first century after the Reformation, the
views of Divines respecting these Prophecies were far more in accordance with
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers than those prevalent in the present day. The
student who would know how MELANCTHON, OSIANDER, and BULLINGER treated the
subject in reply to BELLARMINE, FERERIUS, and other Romish Divines, may
profitably consult WILLET&#8217;S Hexapla in Danielem, published at Cambridge in
1610, and dedicated to King James I. The arguments of the ancients in reply to
&#8220;wicked PORPHIRIE&#8221; are collected and reviewed, the opinions of
various Jewish writers are stated and confuted, and no valuable remark of any
preceding Commentator is overlooked. For instance, the Fourth Beast of the
seventh chapter is explained according to the Jews, as the Turkish, and to
JEROME, of the Roman empire but he decides it to be the kingdom of Syria, under
the sway of Seleucus and his posterity. The &#8220;Little Horne&#8221; is said
to be ANTIOCHUS; and CALVIN&#8217;S view, connecting it with AUGUSTUS and the
following Emperors, is thus treated &#8212; &#8220;But though these things may,
by way of analogy, be thus applied, yet, historically, as hath been shewed at
large, this prophecy was fulfilled before the coming of the Messiah into the
world.&#8221; BULLINGER refers it to. the Pope, and others to the Turks; and
&#8220;These<i> </i>applications, by way of analogie, we mislike not.&#8221; The
&#8220;rimes&#8221; are supposed, by the majority of these writers quoted, to be
single years, and the whole period three years and a half. His laborious
industry respecting the &#8220;Seventy<i> </i>Weeks&#8221; is most instructive;
and he deserves the greatest possible credit for the patience with which he has
examined all authorities, and the acuteness with which he has discussed the most
opposite opinions. He is careful in remarking the various readings of the text,
and the different renderings of all preceding versions. The eleventh chapter he
treats as all fulfilled hi the history of Syria and Palestine before the birth
of Christ. he discusses with much ability the question, whether Antichrist is a
single person, or a succession of Rulers, as Caliphs or Popes, and presents us
with the decisions of the leading Fathers, Romanists, and Reformers on the
&#8220;notes and marks wherein Antiochus and Antichrist agree.&#8221; All who
would see BELLARMINE fully confuted, and the enormities of this chapter brought
home to the several occupants of the See of Rome, will peruse WILLET with
eagerness and profit. He will also find Calvin&#8217;s Interpretations clearly
stated and fairly compared with those of the most celebrated Reformers and their
most acute antagonists. The days of the twelfth chapter are taken literally, and
no hint is given of any elaborate theory of a dozen centuries, extending through
the modern history of Europe. To all who love to trace the progress of opinion,
respecting the intercourse between men and angels, &#8220;the Ancient of
Daies,&#8221; the Opening of the Books, Michael the Prince, and the application
of these Prophecies to the Turks, the Papacy, and the times of a yet future
Antichrist, will find hi the &#8220;Hexapla&#8221; a storehouse of valuable
material, where he may exercise, with all freedom, the liberty of choice. It
proposes and answers 593 questions, and discusses 134 controversies, the greater
part of the latter division being directed against. the doctrines aid practices
of the Church of Rome.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JOSEPH
MEDE.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A formidable opposition to the principles propounded
in these LECTURES is found in the writings of JOSEPH MEDE. That learned and
ingenious author is usually held as the ablest and earliest expositor of the
Year-Day theory. It is neither necessary nor possible for us here either to
confirm or confute all his hypotheses; we can only refer to his
&#8220;<i>Revelatio Antichrist, sive de Numeris Daniel</i>&#8217;<i>s, 1290
1335.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>(Works, page 717.) The first part is occupied by
refuting BROUGHTON and JUNIUS, who assert those mystic days to have been
literally fulfilled during the Wars of ANTIOCHUS. The prediction, he thinks,
fulfilled in the twelfth century of our era, when the persecutions of the Papal
See, against the Heretics of those days, are said to verify the words of the
Prophet. Dr. Tom) has thought this treatise worthy of a detailed refutation, and
to all who are interested in determining whether Antichrist is a Succession of
Rulers or a single person, his learned remarks are worthy of attentive perusal.
In pursuance of his own ideas respecting a personal future Antichrist, he is led
to dispute the division of ALEXANDER&#8217;S empire into four parts, and to
quote at full length various authorities, especially VENEMA, who endeavored to
shew the number of divisions to be ten, and that the portion of chapter 8
usually interpreted of the Roman was really fulfilled by the Grecian Empire in
the East. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f49</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">CALVIN then, we find, agrees entirely with VENEMA,
and by anticipation confutes the arguments of Dr. TODD. He thinks it surprising,
that men versed in Scripture can thus substitute darkness for light. He is
supported by MELANCTHON and MICHAELIS, HENGSTENBERG and ROSENMULLER as well as
by THEODORET and most of the Greek Expositors. He treats those more leniently
who modestly and considerately suppose the times of Antiochus to be figurative
of those of Antichrist. At this. &#8220;figure Calvin&#8221; MALDONATUS sneers;
and yet if we determine that Calvin&#8217;s solution is right, it is the very
principle by which the perusal of Holy Scripture becomes profitable to us.
&#8220;I<i> </i>desire,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to treat the Sacred Oracles
reverently; but I require something certain.&#8221; &#8220;If any one wishes to
adapt this passage to present use, he may refer it to
Antichrist<i>,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>on<i> </i>the principle, &#8220;that<i>
</i>whatever happened to the Ancient Church, occurred for our
instruction.&#8221; Hence he, allows of a double sense, and raises a question
which has been ably contended for and against by many subsequent Divines. It is
too important to be passed over, and will demand our notice in our Second
Volume.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The followers of MEDE have met with a formidable
antagonist, and the adherents of CALVIN a staunch supporter in the late Regius
Professor of Hebrew in the University of Cambridge. Dr. LEE, in his pamphlet on
the Visions of DANIEL and ST. JOHN 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
has stated his reasons for adhering to the Older Interpreters, thus adopting the
principle of the Praeterists, and entirely discarding the slightest reference to
the Pope and the Papacy. His conclusions may be exhibited in a few word.
Respecting Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s Image, &#8220;the feet must of necessity
symbolize <i>Heathen </i>Rome in its last times.&#8221; &#8220;Papal Rome
cannot, therefore, possibly be any prolongation of Daniel&#8217;s Fourth
Empire.&#8221; &#8220;These Kings,&#8221; represented by the <i>Toes,
</i>&#8220;may,<i> </i>therefore, be supposed in a mystical sense to be, as the
digits ten,<i> </i>a round number, and signifying a whole series.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;The Little Horn&#8221; is said to be Heathen Rome &#8212; its persecuting
Emperors from NERO to CONSTANTINE fulfilling the Prophetic conditions. The
phrase &#8220;a Time, Times, and a Half,&#8221; is said to refer to the
&#8220;latter half (mystically speaking) of the Seventieth <i>Week </i>of our
Prophet.&#8221;<i> </i>&#8220;DANIEL&#8217;S Week of seven days &#8212;
equivalent here to Ezekiel&#8217;s period of seven years &#8212; is, we find,
divided into two parts mystically considered halves, or of three days and a
half.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
... &#8220;That the Roman Power took away the Daily Sacrifice, arid cast down
the place of its Sanctuary, it is impossible to doubt. TITUS, during the reign
of his father VESPASIAN desolated Jerusalem by destroying both the City and the
<i>Sanctuary.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Thus in his general principles of Exposition,
this celebrated Hebraist pronounces his verdict in favor of Calvin and his
interpretation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">No notice is taken in these LECTURES of the
Deutero-Canonical additions, to this Prophet. In the versions of the SEPTUAGINT,
and that of THEODOTION, there are some additions, to this Book which are not
found in the Hebrew Canon. JEROME translated these from the version of
THEODOTION, and ably replies to the objection of PORPHYRY by denying the
canonicity of the following treatises, viz., The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of
The Three Children, the History of Susanna, and The Story of Bel and the Dragon.
Eusebius also denies the identity between the Prophet and the Son of Abdias, the
priest who ate of the table of the King of Babylon. DE WETTE, in his
<i>Lehrbuch, </i>has discussed the, criticism of these treatises with great
ability. As early as. the second century, rite Septuagint Version of Daniel was
superseded by that of Theodotion; and the former was lost till it was discovered
and published at Rome in 1772. The views of DE WETTE, and of&#8221; ALBER OF
PESTH, who contends. against JAHN for the historic truth of these
variations,&#8221; will be found in the Addenda to DANIEL in Kitto&#8217;s
Cyclopaedia. The Commentators of the Romish Church feel bound in honor to defend
these additional portions. Their best arguments will be found in a praiseworthy
attempt of J. G. KERKHERDERE Historian to his Catholic Majesty Charles III,. to
explain some difficulties in this Prophet. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He considers, the number of Daniel&#8217;s Treatises to be a dozen. He places
the history of his own Youth first, that of Susanna second, the Story of Bel and
the Dragon third, and Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s Dream fourth; and. then with great
precision and clearness, enters upon those historical questions which need both
acuteness and research in their treatment. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
BELLARMINE also dwells on the testimony of the Greek Fathers, but meets, with an
able opponent in WILLET, the laborious author of the <i>Hexapla in Danielem.</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F57</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must not be forgotten that portions of this Book,
like that of Ezra, are written in Chaldee. From the fourth verse of chapter 2 to
the end of chapter 7., the language is Chaldee. ROSEMULLER assigns as a reason
for this, the desire of the author to represent Nebuchadnezzar and the Magi as
speaking in the language of their country. However valid this reason may be for
the earlier chapters, it is not equally so for the sixth and seventh, since the
Medes and Persians probably used the Persian tongue. ABARBENEL, in the preface
to his <i>Commentaries, </i>supposes that Chaldee was no longer in use after the
taking of the city; and that DANIEL, through ignorance of Persian, returned to
the use of Hebrew. C.B. MICHAELIS, however, demurs to this, and suggests that
the use of either tongue was arbitrary, just as modern scholars use either Latin
or their own vernacular tongue according to their <i>convenience </i>and taste.
The occurrence of this older form of the Aramaic idiom has been seized upon by
the opponents of the, authenticity of this Book, while its use has been ably
explained and vindicated by HENGSTENBERG.

<div><font face="Palatino">In concluding our Introductory Remarks it will be
useful to offer a few suggestions on the Religious, Social, and Political value
of Calvin&#8217;s METHOD of EXPOSITION throughout these Lectures. Such
suggestions are the more appropriate in these days when views directly adverse
to our Reformer&#8217;s are extensively popular through the ingenious theories
of FABER, ELLIOTT, and CUMMING. Those who have imbibed their views will
pronounce these Volumes profitless and barren. &#8220;<i>What </i>can it benefit
us,&#8221; they will ask, &#8220;<i>in </i>the present day, to know how many
Kings reigned from Cyrus to XERXES; the changes in the Empire of ALEXANDER; the
troops which fought at Raphia; the marriage of BERNICE, and the, results of the
invasion of Greece by Antiochus, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F59</font></sup><font face="Palatino">...
&#8220;Why not suffer these antiquated facts of history to sleep quietly in the
dust, and bend our strength to the controversies and practical movements of the
present hour?&#8221; May we not reply, that he is best able to understand and
unfold the religious phases of the age in which he lives, who is most familiar
with the events and opinions of all preceding times. A man can permanently
impress his own age with the precepts of spiritual wisdom, who knows nothing but
what his own eyes have seen, and his own hands have handled. The ever varied
messages of the Holy Spirit have always combined historical reality with the
deepest spiritual significance. The details of Profane History and its
comparison with the Sacred Text will never, by itself, enable us to reap the
full harvest of solid improvement from the perusal of these Sacred Oracles. We
must dive deeper than the surface. We must look at them in the light of one
majestic and solemn truth. They are all &#8220;the<i> </i>foreseen counsels and
works of the living God; the vast scheme of Providence which he has ordained for
his own glory, and steps in the fulfillment of his everlasting
counsel.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are fully aware, that many will pronounce these
Volumes deficient in spiritual life, and in Protestant zeal. But the Christian
who dares not dogmatize beyond the direct teachings of the Spirit of God, will
apply them indirectly to the events of the present era, on the intelligible
principles of SACRED ANALOGY. They thus become a portion of that Divine Lesson
which fulfilled Prophecy is ever reading to the Church of God. They display His
ceaseless dominion over the wills of Sovereigns and over the destinies of
Nations. When abstract truths are felt to be powerless in breaking the spell of
worldliness, and in piercing within the charmed circle of social strife and
political party, these embodied proofs of an ever-watchful Deity may awe men
into submission to his sovereign will. The hollow maxims of earthly policy will
never be superseded till men reverence the GOD OF Daniel, and, like the heavenly
Elders, cast all their crowns of intellect and renown before His throne. From
the days of Nebuchadnezzar and of Cyrus, we see in every change the foot;-prints
of a guiding Deity. &#8220;The reigns of CAMBYSES, SMERDIS, and DARIUS; the
armament of XERXES, with its countless myriad&#8217;s; the marches, and
counter-marches, and conflicts, the subtle plots and shifting alliances of
contending kings, long before they occurred, were noted down in the Scriptures
of Truth &#8212; the Secret Volume of the Divine counsels. All of them, before
they rose into birth, were revealed by the Son of God to his holy Prophets; and
they remain till the end of time an imperishable monument of His Providence and
foreknowledge. All was foreseen by His wisdom and ordained by his Sovereign
power. The passing generations of mankind, while they see, this blue arch of
Providence<i> </i>above them, and around them, sure and steadfast, age after
age, like Him who has ordained it, must feel a deep and quiet reverence take
possession of their soul.&#8221; The minuteness of detail in the visions
concerning ALEXANDER and PTOLEMY SOTER, and the repulse of ANTIOCHUS, convey the
same instructive lesson. &#8220;Every royal marriage, like that of BERENICE<i>
</i>or CLEOPATRA, with all its secret issues of Peace or war, of discord or
union; the levying of every army, the capture of every fortress, the length of
every reign, the issue of every battle, the lies of deceitful ambition, the
treachery of councilors, the complex web of policy, woven out of ten thousand
human wiles, and each of them agahl the product of ten thousand various
influences of good and evil, all are portrayed with unerring accuracy in the
&#8216;Scriptures of Truth.&#8217;&#8221; ... &#8220;The pride of Antiochus the
Great, his successful ambition and military triumphs, his schemes of politic
affinity, nay, even his prudent regard for the house of God, cannot avert. the
sentence written against him, for his fraud and violence in the Word of Truth.
In the height of seeming power, his own reproach is turned against him, and he
tumbles and falls, and is not found.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, then, we conclude with CALVIN, that the
persecution of the Little Horn and the idolatries of the Willful King are past,
on what principle are we to derive instruction from their perusal? By the
induction&#8217;s of a Divine analogy, by the assertion that &#8220;all <i>which
has passed is in some sense typical of all that is to come.</i>&#8221;<i>
</i>&#8220;The Saints of the Most High&#8221; are always the special objects of
Jehovah&#8217;s regard; they ever meet with an oppressor as fierce as ANTIOCHUS,
and as hateful as &#8220;<i>the </i>Man of Sin<i>;</i>&#8221;<i> </i>but still,
whatever their sufferings under a Guise or an ALVA, they shall ultimately
&#8220;take the Kingdom,&#8221; and possess it for ever. Strongholds of Mahuzzim
there always. will be, under either the successors of MEDICI or the descendants
of MAHOMET. The evidence of Gibbon, which has been used so freely by many modern
theorists, is equally valuable on the hypothesis, that similar relations between
the Church and the world occur over and over again in the course of successive
ages. A parallel may often be drawn by an ingenious mind between the
persecutions of Heathen and of Papal Rome, and the temptation is, always great
to refer the fulfillment of Prophecy exclusively to that system of things with
which we are immediately and personally concerned. Military ambition, subtle
policy,. the arts of Statesmen, the voice of excited multitudes. the passions of
<i>every </i>hour, the delusions of every age &#8212; all must pass in silent
review Under the <i>eye </i>of heaven. They are repeated with every successive
generation under an infinite variety of outward form, but with a perfect
identity in spirit and in feeling. It may be safely asserted, that every social
and political change from the times of Nebuchadnezzar to those of Constantine,
have had their historic parallel from the days of CHARLEMAGNE to those of
NAPOLEON. Hence, Predictions which originally related to the Empires of the
East, may be naturally transferred to the transactions of Western Christendom.
At the same time, there never may have been the slightest intention in the mind
of the writer to apply them in this double sense. We cannot venture to discuss
all the arguments either for or against the double sense of Prophecy. Calvin, at
least, opposed it strongly, and whenever he swerved from the literal version, he
substituted the principle of accommodation, according to the educated taste of
an experienced Expounder of Holy Writ. It will, perhaps, be our truest wisdom to
listen to the judicious advice of Bishop HORSLEY<i> &#8212; </i>&#8220;Every
single text of prophecy is to be considered as a portion of an entire system,
and to be understood in that sense which may best connect it with the whole. The
sense of Prophecy, in general, is to be sought in the events which have actually
taken place ...To qualify the Christian to make a judicious application of these
rules, no skill is requisite in verbal criticism &#8212; no proficiency in the
subtleties of the logician&#8217;s art &#8212; no acquisition of recondite
learning. That degree of understanding with which serious minds are ordinarily
blessed &#8212; those general views of the schemes of Providence, and that
general acquaintance with the Prophetic language which no Christian can be
wanting in these qualifications will enable the pious, though unlearned
Christian, to succeed in the application of the Apostle&#8217;s rules.&#8221;

While this sentiment is cheering to the humble minded believer, another
principle laid down by the same author must never be omitted. The meaning of a
prediction &#8220;never can be discovered without a general knowledge of the
principal events to which k alludes.&#8221; Let CALVIN, then, be judged by this
simple test &#8212; and before we venture to condemn him, let us be equally
patient, and equally careful to gather all the information within our

EVENTS IN FRANCE.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The period when our Reformer addressed these LECTURES
TO ALL THE PIOUS Worshippers OF GOD IN FRANCE, is now worthy of our attention.
Calvin writes from GENEVA at the close of the month of August A.D. <i>1561,
</i>immediately preceding that Colloquy at POISSY to which reference was made in
the preface to EZEKIEL. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
His Letter depicts so faithfully the state of persecution in which the
Christians of France were placed, and compares it so efficiently with the
condition of DANIEL and the pious worshippers of God under NEBUCHADNEZZAR, that
the more we know of the times in which Calvin wrote, the more complete the
parallel appears. An animated sketch of this eventful era has lately been
published by the Queen&#8217;s Professor of Modern History in the University of
Cambridge; and as the views of the Editor accord with those of the Professor
&#8220;<i>On </i>the Reformation and the Wars of Religion&#8221; in France, we
shall abridge and condense his narrative, as the best suited to our
purpose.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE GENERAL
SYNOD</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">OF PROTESTANTS AT
PARIS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When CALVIN addressed his followers in France, as
desirous of the firm establishment of Christ&#8217;s kingdom in the native land,
he was at His College in Geneva; but his labors and his Writings were
all-powerful in influence with the Reformed in France. Their numbers were large
throughout the cities and villages of the Empire. LEFEVRE and FAREL were as
father and son in ceaseless efforts to make known to these Gentiles &#8220;the,
unsearchable riches of Christ.&#8221; Their evangelical preaching was signally
blessed. BRICONNET, the Bishop of Meaux, aided them in translating the
Evangelists and in heralding the word of God, and so rapidly and widely had
their gospel been received, that &#8220;a Heretic of Meaux&#8221; became the
popular title for an opponent of the Papacy. Notwithstanding the hideous
spectacle and the odious MASSACRE of the 29th of January 1535<i>, </i>when
Francis I. celebrated the Fete of Paris by the Martyrdom of the Saints of God,
the Reformers were so numerous throughout the realm, that a serious conflict was
approaching between themselves and their foes. On the 25th of May 1559, a
General SYNOD OF ALL PROTESTANT CONGREGATIONS was solemnly convened and held at
Paris &#8212; the ecclesiastical system of their Patriarch at Geneva was
adopted, and his &#8220;<i>Institution Chretienne</i>&#8221;<i> </i>became the
source and basis of their Confession of Faith. Paris was but the energizing
center of an organized Church throughout the Sixteen Provinces of the Realm,
while Synods, and Consistories, and Conferences formed a kind of Spiritual
Republic, spreading like network over the land. But the hand and the eye of the
Persecutor was upon them. Rome had its despotic tyrants both in Court and Camp.
In the very midst of the Parliament at Paris, a confessor of the true fifth
appeared &#8212; but his courage was extinguished by his condemnation. DUBOURG,
a magistrate of eminent learning and illustrious family, in the presence of the
King, in his place in Parliament, invoked a National Council for the Reform of
Religion, and denounced the persecution of Heritics as a crime against Him whose
holy name they were accustomed to adore with their dying breath. He expected His
audacity by his death, and before the grave had been opened for him it had
closed upon the Royal Tyrant, HENERY II., who bequeathed his crown to a second
FRANCE in his sixteenth year. And who knows not the crafty, treacherous, and
intriguing wickedness of the Queen-mother, CATHERINE or MEDICI? Who knows not
the ambitious worldliness of the two sons of CLAUDE or LORRAINE &#8212; Francis,
the DUKE of GUISE &#8212; the savage butcher of the HUGUENOTS of Champagne, and
Charles, the CARDINAL LORRAINE, the subtle agent of Rome&#8217;s most hateful
policy? These artful brothers worked their way to supreme influence in the
national councils. Having married their niece, MARY QUEEN or Scots, to the
youthful Sovereign, they employed their vast influence for the wholesale
martyrdom of the defenseless flock of Christ. In every Parliament of the kingdom
they established Chambers for trying and burning all persons charged with
herisy, which obtained the unenviable notoriety of&#8221; <i>chambres
ardentes.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>&#8220;But deep,&#8221; says the eloquent Lecturer,
&#8220;called<i> </i>unto deep.&#8221; The alarmed and exasperated HUGUENOTS,
confident in their strength and deriving courage from despair, rose in many
parts of France to repel, or at least to punish their antagonists. In the midst
of the anarchy of the times, a voice was raised in calm and earnest
remonstrance, urging toleration and peace. In August 1560, the<i>, </i>renowned
Chancellor L&#8217;HOPITAL appeared before the King and an assembly of notables
at Fontainebleau. He presents a Petition from the whole Reformed Church of the
realm, and requests the royal permission for the free performance of public
worship. &#8220;Your Petition,&#8221; says the King, &#8220;is without a
signature!&#8221; &#8220;True<i>, </i>sire,&#8221; replies COLIGNY &#8220;but if
you will allow us to meet for the purpose, I will obtain 50,000 signatures in
one day in Normandy alone!&#8221; His zeal might occasion a slight; exaggeration
&#8212; but the phrase presents us with data for conjecturing the number of
&#8220;the pious&#8221;<i> </i>whom our Reformer addressed about a year
afterwards. As soon as opportunity was given for listening to the glad tidings
of salvation, large accessions were made to the hosts of the believers. FAREL,
though advanced in years, preached the truth to large and ethusiastic
assemblages. In the neighborhood of Paris, the followers of BEZA were numerous,
and his admirers reckoned them at 40,000. L&#8217;HOPITAL presented to the
Queen-mother a list of 2150 Ireformed Congregations, each under the ministry of
a separate pastor, and he reckoned the number of the HUGUENOTS as one-third of
that of the Romanists!</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">EDICT OF
POISSY.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the very moment when Calvin was penning in his
study the Letter which is prefixed to these LECTURES OF DANIEL, the Edict of
July 1561 was issued. It bears the impress of the restored influence of the
House of LORRAINE<i>, </i>which ever proved an implacable foe to the Gospel of
Christ as preached by THE Calvinists. That Edict forbid their public assemblies,
and yet tolerated their private and social worship. It protected them from
injury on account of their opinions, and provided for a National Council which
should, if possible, settle differences which were in their nature
irreconcilable. This important enactment was issued in the Assembly at Poissy,
held a few weeks after the date of the Letter which follows this Preface, and
which has been alluded to in the Preface to EZEKIEL. Cams was absent, because
the French Court refused to give those securities for his safety which the,
Republic of Geneva required. But he was ably represented by BEZA, and a dozen
ministers, and twenty-two lay deputies of the Churches. The dramatic taste of
the French mind was gratified by the scene, for the tournaments of belted
knights had now given way to those of theological disputant,. In the Refectory
of the great Convent the boy King was seated on a temporary throne. The members
of his family, the officers and ladies of his Court, were stationed on one side,
six Cardinals, with an array of mitred Bishops, were assembled on the other. The
rustic garb of BEZA and his associates, as they were introduced to their
Sovereign by the Chancellor, contrasted strongly with the gorgeous apparel and
the showy splendor of the Court and its attendants. The political CARDINAL or
LORRAINE and the subtle General of the Jesuits, IAGO LASQUEZ, conducted the
dispute against BEZA. The Doctors of the Sorbonne watched the sport with
official keenness, while CATHERINE listened to the debate with secret contempt,
having long ago determined to root out every Heretic as soon as she could throw
the mantle of policy over her cruelty.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">PARALLEL
BETWEEN THE PROTESTANTS IN FRANCE ANDTHE JEWS IN BABYLON.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The matured Christian is now enabled to see at a
glance, that such Conferences<i> </i>are, of necessity,<i> </i>worthless as to
any progress of vital religion in the soul. The narrative, however, may enable
the reader to enter a little into the state of the Christian, in France when
Calvin&#8217;s indicted his Prefatory Letter, and may justify the comparison
which he makes between their lot, under the tyranny of such merciless<i>
</i>rulers, and that of DANIEL under the sway of the imperious
Nebuchadnezzar<i>, </i>and at the tender mercy of his colleagues under DARIUS.
The parallel is as complete as it could possibly be between the temporal
position of the pious in FRANCE, and that of the devout Jews<i> </i>in BABYLON
&#8212; and the graphic description of the Royal Professor of Modern History
fully justifies the pastoral anxiety of the austere Theologian of
Geneva.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Before concluding these Prefatory Observations, THE
EDITOR would briefly refer to the fundamental rules of THE CALVIN TRANSLATION
SOCIETY, which very wisely exclude all expressions of private opinion. He hopes
that no remarks in this PREFACE will be deemed inconsistent with so judicious a
regulation. The clear illustration and the comprehensive defense of our
Venerable Reformer seem to demand the candid statement of some views which are
adverse to the popular current; but this necessity need not induce him to step
beyond the limits of his province. It has been his desire conscientiously to
vindicate his Author&#8217;s Interpretations wherever he is able to do so, and
as fearlessly to point out wherever Calvin is allowed to be in error; but in
both cases, the EDITOR has scrupulously avoided taking any one-sided view of a
great argument. He has attempted to exercise the utmost impartiality in quoting
from a great variety of Standard Works which contain the most opposite
conclusions; and yet, in accordance with the first principles of these
Translations, he has at the same time carefully abstained from pressing any
sentiments of his own on rite attention of the intelligent
reader.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HAIL to thee, Christian Reader! &#8212; I present to
thee the Lectures of the most illustrious JOHN CALVIN, in which he has
interpreted THE Prophecies OF DANIEL, with his usual diligence and clearness,
and with that singular fidelity which shines throughout all his Expositions of
Sacred Scripture. The manner in which they have been edited by those two
brethren, John Budaeus and CHARLES JOINVILLE, it would be superfluous to dwell
upon, since that has been clearly made manifest in the way in which the TWELVE
MINOR Prophets were brought out two years ago by John Crispin. For, in treating
these Lectures, they have followed entirely the same course as they did in the
former ones. Lest, perhaps, you should be surprised at the addition of the
Hebrew context to the Latin version, I will explain the matter in a few words.
Some studious and learned men very much wished to have the Hebrew text in the
former Lectures which I mentioned, for the following reason chiefly, among
others. It is exceedingly agreeable to Hebrew scholars to have that very
fountain placed before their eyes from which this most faithful Interpreter drew
the genuine sense of the Prophet. It is by no means unpleasing to those less
skilled in the language, to see Daniel speaking not only in a foreign, but in
his native tongue, and to understand how anything is originally expressed. Hence
we have thought it right not to pass over the original words of the holy man. In
addition to this, the same learned Interpreter, CALVIN, is accustomed first to
read each verse in Hebrew, and then to turn it into Latin. It was desirable to
introduce this short preface, that you may understand his whole method of
teaching. Besides, every one will judge better by his own perusal, what copious
and abundant fruit all may derive from these Lectures. Farewell, and if you
profit at all, ascribe the praise to God alone, who deserves it, and always pray
much for CALVIN, his most faithful servant.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">HEALTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ALTHOUGH I have been absent these six-and-twenty
years, with little regret, from that native land which I own in common with
yourselves, and whose agreeable climate attracts many foreigners from the most
distant quarters of the world; yet it would be in no degree pleasing or
desirable to me to dwell in a region from which the Truth of God, pure Religion,
and the doctrine of eternal salvation are banished, and the very kingdom of
Christ laid prostrate! Hence, I have no desire to return to it; yet it would be
neither in accordance with human nor Divine obligation to forget the people from
which I am sprung, and to put away all regard for their welfare. I think I have
given some strong proofs, how seriously and ardently I desire to benefit my
fellow-countrymen, to whom perhaps my absence has been useful, in enabling them
to reap the greater profit from my studies. And the contemplation of this
advantage has not only deprived my banishment of its sting, but has rendered it
even pleasant and joyful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, therefore, throughout the whole of this period
I have publicly endeavored to benefit THE Inhabitants OF FRANCE, and have never
ceased privately to rouse the torpid, to stimulate the sluggish, to animate the
trembling, and to encourage the doubtful and the wavering to perseverance, I
must now strive to the utmost that my duty towards them may not fail at a period
so urgent and so pressing. A most excellent opportunity has been providentially
afforded to me; for in publishing the Lectures which contain my INTERPRETATION
OF THE Prophecies OF DANIEL, I have the very best occasion of showing you,
beloved brethren, in this mirror, how God proves the faith of his people in
these days by various trials; and how with wonderful wisdom he has taken care to
strengthen their minds by ancient examples, that they should never be weakened
by the concussion of the severest storms and tempests; or at least, if they
should totter at all, that they should never finally fall away. For although the
servants of God are required to run in a course impeded by many obstacles, yet
whoever diligently reads this Book will find in it whatever is needed by a
voluntary and active runner to guide him from the starting-post to the goal;
while good and strenuous wrestlers will experimentally acknowledge that they
have been sufficiently prepared for the contest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First of all, a very mournful and yet profitable
history will be recorded for us, in the exile of Daniel and his companions while
the kingdom and priesthood were still standing, as if God, through ignominy and
shame, would devote the choicest flower of his elect people to extreme calamity.
For what, at first sight, is more unbecoming, than that youths endued with
almost angelic virtues should be the slaves and captives of a proud conqueror,
when the most wicked and abandoned despisers of God remained at home hi perfect
safety? Was this the reward of a pious and innocent life, that while the impious
were sweetly flattering themselves through their escape from punishment, the
saints should pay the penalty which they had deserved? Here, then, we observe,
as in a living picture, that when God spares and even indulges the wicked for a
time, he proves his servants like gold and silver; so that we ought not to
consider it a grievance to be thrown into the furnace of trial, while profane
men enjoy the calmness of repose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, we have here an example of most manly
prudence and of singular consistency, united with a magnanimity truly heroic.
When pious youths of a tender age are tempted by the enticements of a Court,
they not only overcome the temptations presented to them by their temperance,
but perceive themselves cunningly enticed to depart by degrees from the sincere
worship of God; and then, when they have extricated themselves from the snares
of the devil, they boldly and freely despise all poison-stained honor, at the
imminent risk of instant death. A more cruel and formidable contest will follow
when the companions of Daniel, as a memorable example, of incredible constancy,
are never turned aside by atrocious threats to pollute themselves by adoring the
Image, and are at length prepared to vindicate the pure worship of God, not only
with their blood, but in defiance of a horrible torture set before their eyes.
Thus the goodness of God shines forth at the close of this tragedy, and tends in
no slight degree to arm us with invincible confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A similar contest and victory of DANIEL himself will
be added; when he preferred to be cast among savage lions, to desisting from the
open profession of his faith three times a-day; lest by perfidious dissembling
he should prostitute the Sacred Name of God to. the jests of the impious. Thus
he was wonderfully drawn out of the pit which was all but his grave, and
triumphed over Satan and his faction. Here philosophers do not come before us
skillfully disputing about the virtues peacefully in the shade; but the
indefatigable constancy of holy men in the pursuit of piety, invites us; with a
loud voice to imitate them. Therefore, unless we are altogether untouchable, we
ought to learn from these masters, if Satan lays the snares of flattery for us,
to be prudent and cautious that we are not entangled in them; and if he attacks
us violently, to oppose all his assaults by a fearless contempt of death and of
all evils. Should any one object, that the examples of either kind of
deliverance which we have mentioned are rare, I confess indeed that God does not
always stretch forth his hand from heaven in the same way to preserve his
people; but it ought to satisfy us that he has promised that he will be a
faithful guardian of our life, as often as we are harassed by any trouble. We
cannot be exposed to the power of the impious without his restraining their
furious and turbulent plots against us, according to his pleasure. And we must
not look at the results alone; but observe how courageously holy men devoted
themselves to death for the vindication of God&#8217;s glory; and although they
were snatched away from it, yet their willing alacrity in offering themselves as
victims is in no degree less deserving of praise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is also worth while to consider how variously the
Prophet was tossed about and agitated during the Seventy years which he spent in
exile. No King treated him so humanely as Nebuchadnezzar, and yet he found him
act like a wild beast. The cruelty of others was greater, until after the sudden
death of Belshazzar and the taking of the City, he was delivered up to its new
masters, The Medes and Persians. Their hostile irruption struck terror into the
minds of all, and there is no doubt that the Prophet partook of the general
feeling. Although he was kindly received by DARIUS, so that his slavery was
rendered tolerable, yet the envy of the nobles and their ,tricked conspiracy
against him subjected him to the greatest dangers. But he was more anxious for
the common safety of the Church than for his own personal security. He evidently
suffered the greatest grief, and was distracted with the utmost anxiety, when
the position of affairs discovered no limit to so severe and miserable an
oppression of the people. He acquiesced indeed, in the Prophecy of JEREMIAH;
still it was a proof of his incomparable forbearance that his hope, so long
suspended, did not languish; nay, that when tossed hither and thither amidst
tempestuous waves, it was not entirely drowned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the PROPHECIES themselves. The former
part were uttered against the BABYLOIANS; partly, because God wished to adorn
his servants with sure testimonies, which might compel that most proud and
victorious Nation to revere him; and partly, because His Name ought to be held
in reverence with the profane. Thus he would exercise the prophetic gift among
his own people more freely, through being endued with authority. After his name
had become celebrated among THE CHALDEANS, God entrusted him with Prophecies of
greater moment, which were peculiar to his elect people. Moreover, God so
accommodated them to the use of his Ancient people, and they so soothed their
sorrows by suitable remedies, and sustained their vacillating minds till The
ADVENT OF CHRIST &#8212; that they have no less value in our time; for whatever
was predicted concerning the changing and vanishing splendor of these
Monarchies, and the perpetual existence of Christ&#8217;s Kingdom, is <i>in
these days no </i>less useful to be known than formerly. For God shows how all
earthy power which is not founded on Christ must fall; and he threatens speedy
destruction to all Kingdoms which obscure Christ&#8217;s glory by extending
themselves too much. And those Kings whose sway is most extended shall feel by
sorrowful experience how horrible a judgment will fall upon them, unless they
willingly submit themselves to the sway of Christ! And what is less tolerable
than to deprive Him of his right by whose protection their dignity remains safe?
And we see how few of their number admit The Sons Of God; nay, how they turn
every;stone and try every possible scheme to prevent his entrance into their
territories! Many of their Councilors studiously use their utmost endeavors and
influence to close every avenue against him. For while they put forward the name
of Christianity, and boast themselves to be the best. defenders of the Catholic
Faith, their frivolous vanity is easily refuted, if men hold the true and
genuine definition of the Kingdom of Christ. For his throne or scepter is
nothing else but the doctrine of the Gospel. Nor does his Majesty shine
elsewhere, nor his Empire otherwise exist, than when all, from the highest to
the lowest, hear His voice with the calm docility of sheep, and follow wherever
he calls them. These Kings not only completely reject this doctrine, which
contains the substance of True Religion, and the lawful Worship of God, in which
the eternal salvation of men and their true happiness consists; but they drive
it far away from them by threats and terrors, by the sword and flame, nor do
they omit any violence in their efforts to exterminate it. How great, how
prodigious this blindness, when they cannot bear that those whom the
only-begotten Sort of God invites mercifully to himself should era.-brace him!
But many in their own pride, forsooth, think themselves reduced. to the common
level, if they lower their ensigns of royalty to the Supreme King others are
unwilling to bridle their lusts, and since hypocrisy seizes on all their senses,
they seek darkness, and dread to be dragged into light. No plague is worse than
this fear, like Herod&#8217;s as if tie who offers a celestial empire to the
least and most despised of the people, would snatch away the kingdoms of the
earth from its monarchs. In addition to this, when each regards the c, pinion of
others, this mutual league retains them all bound in a distinctive bond under
the yoke of impiety. For if they would seriously apply their minds to inquire
what is true and right; nay, if they would only open their eyes, they could not
fail to discover it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since it has often been found, by experience, that
when Christ goes forth with his Gospel serious commotion&#8217;s arise, thus
Kings have a plausible pretext for rejecting the heavenly doctrine by consulting
for the public safety. I confess, indeed, that all change which occasions
disturbance ought to be esteemed odious; but the injustice to God is great,
unless this also is attributed to his <i>power, </i>that whatever tumults arise
he allays them, and thus the kingdom of his Son is established! Although the
heavens should mingle with the earth, the worship of God is so precious, that
not even the least diminution of it can be compensated at any price. But those
who pretend that the Gospel is the source of disturbances, accuse it falsely and
unjustly.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;370207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
2:7.) It is indeed true, that God thunders therein with the vehemence of His
voice, which shakes heaven and earth; but while the Prophet gains attention to
its preaching by this testimony, such concussion is to be wished for and
expected. And, surely if God&#8217;s glory did not shine forth his its own
degree, until all flesh was humbled, it would be necessary that man&#8217;s
pride shone to be humbled by the bold and strong hand of God; since that pride
raise, itself against him, and never yields of its own accord. But if the earth
trembled at the promulgation of the Law,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:18,)it is not surprising that the force and efficacy of the Gospel should
appear more resplendent. Wherefore, it becomes us to embrace that consoling
doctrine which raises the dead from the grave, and opens heaven, and implants
unaccustomed rigor in those whom the earth is unworthy to sustain, as if all the
elements were subservient to our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, lo! storms and tempests now flow from another
fountain! Because the Rulers and Governors of the world do not willingly submit
to the yoke of Christ, now even the rude multitude reject what is salutary
before they even taste it. Some delight themselves in filth, like pigs, and
others excited by fury rejoice in slaughter. The devil instigates by especial
fury those whom he. has enslaved to himself to tumults of all sorts. Hence the
clash of trumpets; hence conflicts and battles. Meanwhile, THE ROMAN PROTEST
&#8212; a Heliogabalus &#8212; with his red and sanguinary cohorts and horned
beasts, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
rages with a hasty rush against Christ and fetches from every side his allies
from the filth of his foul Clergy,

all of whom sup the food on which they subsist from the same pot, though it be
not equally dainty. Many hungry fellows also run up to offer their assistance.
Most of the Judges are accustomed to gratify their appetites at these sumptuous
banquets, and to fight for the kitchen and the kettle! and besides this, the
haunts of the Monks, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and the dens of the Sorbonne,

send forth their gluttons who add fuel to the flame. I omit the clandestine arts
and wicked conspiracies of which my best witnesses are these notorious enemies
to piety! I mention no one by name, it is enough to point with the finger to
those who are too well known to you. In this confused assault of wild beasts, it
is not surprising if those who depend only on the complicated events of things
hesitate through perplexity, while they unjustly and unfairly throw the blame of
their distrust upon the Sacred Gospel of Christ. Let us suppose that all the
infernal regions with their furies should offer us battle, will God sit at ease
in heaven, and desert and betray his own cause? and when he has entered into the
conflict, will either the crafty cunning, or the impetuous rush of men deprive
Him of his victory?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE POPE they say will draw with him a large faction
&#8212; it is the just reward of unbelief to tremble at the sound of a falling
leaf!(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;032636&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:36.) <i>Why, O ye </i>counselors, have ye so little fore-sight? Christ will
take care that no novelty shall disturb you. In a short time ye will feel how
far more satisfactory it is to have God propitious, to despise terrors as of no
moment, and to rest in His protection, than to harass Him by open warfare,
through that of the wrath of the evil and the hypocritical. In truth, after all
these discussions, the superstition which has hitherto reigned is with the
defenders of the Pope, nothing else but well-placed evil, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and they think it cannot be removed, because the attempt would occasion
irreparable damage. But those who regard the glory of God, and are endued with
sincere piety, ought to have far higher objects in view, and so to submit
themselves to the will of God as to approve of all the events of his providence.
If he had not promised us anything, there might be just cause for fear and
constant vacillation; but since he has so often declared, that his help shall
never be wanting in upholding the kingdom of his Christ, the reliance on this
promise is the one sole basis of right action.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it is your duty, dearest brethren, as far as
lies in your power, and your calling demands it, to use your hearty endeavors,
that true religion may recover its perfect state. It is not necessary for me to
relate how strenuously I have hitherto endeavored to cut off all occasion for
tumult; yea, I call you all with the angels to witness before the Supreme Judge
of all men, that it is no fault of mine if the kingdom of Christ does not
progress quietly without any injury. And I think it is owing to my carefulness
that private persons have not transgressed beyond their bounds. Now, although
God by his wonderful skill has carried forward the restoration of his Church
further than I had dared to hope for, yet it is well to remember what Christ
taught his disciples, namely, that they should possess their souls in patience.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is one object of the Vision which Daniel has
explained. The Stone by which those kingdoms were destroyed, which had made war
on God, was not formed by the hand of man and although it was rude and
unpolished, yet it increased to a great mountain. I thought that ye required
reminding of this, that ye may remain calm amidst the threatening thunders,
while the empty clouds vanish away through being dispersed by heavenly agency.
It does not escape me, while I pass by the numberless fires of thirty years,
that ye have endured very great indignities during the last six months. How
often in many places an irruption was made against you by a ferocious populace,
and how often ye were attacked at one time by stones, and at. another by swords!
How your enemies plotted against you, and repressed your peaceful assemblies by
sudden and unlocked for violence! How some were slain in their dwellings, and
others by the wayside while the bodies of your dead were dragged about as a
laughing-stock, your women ravished, and many of your party wounded, and even
the pregnant female with her offspring pierced through, and their homes
ransacked and made desolate. But, although more atrocious things should be yet
at hand, that ye may be approved as Christ&#8217;s disciples, and be wisely
instructed in his school, you must use every effort, that no madness of the
impious who act thus intemperately, should deprive you of that moderation by
which alone they have thus far been conquered and broken down. And if the length
of your affliction should cause you weariness, bear in mind that celebrated
prophecy in which the Church&#8217;s condition is depicted to the life. God
therein shews his Prophet what contests and anxieties, troubles and
difficulties, awaited the Jews from the close of their exile, and from their
joyful return to their country until the advent of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The similarity of the times adapts these predictions
to ourselves, and fits them for our own use. DANIEL congratulated the wretched
Church which had so long been submerged in a deluge of evils, when he collected
from the computation of the years, that the day of deliverance predicted by
Jeremiah was at hand.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:12, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:10.) But he receives for an answer, that the lot of the people from the time
of their permission to return would be more bitter, so that they would scarcely
breathe again under a continual series of oppressive evils. With the bitterest
grief, and with many sorrows, the people had dragged on in hope for seventy
years, but now God increases the period sevenfold, and inwardly inflicts A
deadly wound on their heart. He not only pronounces that the people, after their
return home, should collect their strength and build their city and temple, and
then suffer new anxieties, but he predicts fresh troubles amidst the very
commencement of their joy, whilst they had scarcely tasted the sweetness of
grace. Then with regard to the calamities which shortly followed, the multiform
catalogue here presented affrights us even who have only heard of them: then how
bitter and how distressing were they to that rude nation! To see the temple
profaned by the audacity of a sacrilegious tyrant, its sacred rites shamefully
mingled with foul pollution&#8217;s, all the books of the law cast into the
fire, and the whole of the ceremonies abolished, &#8212; how horrible the
spectacle! Since all who professed to persist boldly and constantly in the
worship of God were seized and subjected to the same burning, how could the
tender and weak behold this without the greatest consternation! Yet this was the
tyrant&#8217;s plan, that the cruelty might excite the less earnest to deny
their faith. Under the Maccabees, some relaxation seems to have taken place, but
yet such as is soon deformed by the most cruel slaughters, and was never without
its share of lamentation and wo. For since the enemy far excelled them in forces
and in every equipment for war, nothing was left for those who had taken up arms
for the defense of the Church but to hide themselves in the dens of wild beasts,
or to wander through the woods in the greatest distress, and in utter
destitution. Another source of temptation was added, since impious and abandoned
men, in the boasting of a fallacious zeal as DANIEL says, joined the party of
Judas and his brethren, by which artifice of Satan infamy became attached to the
band which Judas had collected, as if it had been a band of robbers.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;271134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
11:34.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But nothing was a source of greater sorrow to the
righteous, than to find the priests themselves betraying the temple and worship
of God, by wicked compacts according to the prompting of their interested
ambition. For not only was that sacred dignity both bought and sold, but it was
purchased by mutual murders and parricides. Hence it happened, that men of all
ranks grew more and more profane, and corruption&#8217;s multiplied everywhere
with impunity, although circumcision and the sacrifices still remained in use,
so that the expectation of the kingdom of God, when Christ appeared, was a
strange and unheard of marvel. Very few, indeed, are entitled to even this
praise. If then, in that unworthy deformity of the Church, if in the midst of
its many dispersions and its dreadful terrors, of the devastation of the lands,
the destruction of the dwellings and the consequent dangers to life itself, this
prophecy of DANIEL sustained the spirit of the pious, when the religious
ceremonies were involved in obscure shadows, and doctrine was almost extinct,
when the priests were most degenerate, and all sacred ordinances abolished,
&#8212; how ashamed should we be of our cowardice, if the clearness of the
Gospel, in which God shews to us his paternal face, does not raise us above all
obstacles, and prop us up with unwearied constancy?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt that the servants of God
accommodated to their own times the predictions of this Prophet concerning the
exile at Babylon, and thus lightened the pressure of present calamities. Thus,
also, we ought to have our eyes fixed on the miseries of the Fathers, that we
may not object to be joined with the body of that Church to which it was
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O, thou little
flock, borne down by the tempest and deprived of comfort, behold, I take thee
up.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
54:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, again, after she has complained that her back
had been torn by the ungodly, like a field cut up by the course of the furrows,
yet she boasts immediately afterwards, that their cords were cut away by a just
God, so that they did not prevail against her.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19C901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
129:1-4.) The Prophet, then, not only animates us to hope and patience, by the
example of those times, but adds an exhortation dictated by the Spirit, which
extends to the whole reign or Christ, and is applicable to us. Wherefore it is
no hardship to us to be comprehended in the number of those whom he announces
shall be proved and purified by fire, since the inestimable happiness and glory
which springs from this process more than compensates for all its crosses and
distresses. And although these things are insipid to the majority, lest their
sloth and stupidity should render us too sluggish, we should fix deeply in our
hearts the denunciation of the Prophets, namely, that the ungodly will act
impiously, since they understand nothing; while the sons of God will be endued
with wisdom to hold on the course of their divine calling. It is worth while,
then, to perceive the origin of that gross blindness which is commonly observed,
so that the heavenly doctrine may make us wise. Hence, it too often happens that
the multitude revile Christ and his Gospel; they indulge themselves without
either care, or fear, or any perception of their dangers, and they are not
aroused by God&#8217;s wrath to an ardent and serious desire for that redemption
which alone snatches us from the abyss of eternal destruction. In the meantime
they are caught or rather fascinated by luxuries, pleasures, and other
enticements, and pay no regard to the prospect of a happy eternity. Although
there are many sects who contemptuously despise the teaching of the Gospel, some
are remarkable for pride, others for imbecility, some for want of sobriety of
mind, and others for a sleepy torpidly, yet we shall find that contempt flows
from profane security, since no one descends into himself to shake off his own
miseries by finding a remedy for them. Yet, when God&#8217;s curse rests upon
us, and his just vengeance urges us, it is the height of madness to cast aside
all anxiety, and to please ourselves as if we need fear nothing. Yet it is a
very common fault for those who are guilty of a thousand sins, and deserve a
thousand eternal deaths, to discharge with levity a few frivolous ceremonies
towards God, and then give themselves up to sloth and lethargy. Moreover, Paul
denounces the savor of the Gospel
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:16) to be deadly towards all whose minds are fascinated by Satan;
so that to taste of its life-giving savor, it is necessary for us to stand at
God&#8217;s tribunal, and there also to cite out own consciences when wounded
with serious terror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, we esteem, according to its proper worth and
value, that reconciliation which Christ procured for us by his precious blood.
Thus, the angel, that he might acquire reverence and respect for Christ&#8217;s
authority, brings a message concerning eternal justice which he sealed by the
sacrifice of his death, and expresses the mode and plant by which iniquity was
abolished and expiated. <i>Thus, </i>while the world revels in its lusts, let
the knowledge of the condemnation which we have deserved inspire us with fear,
and humble us before God and while the profane involve themselves in the whirl
of earthly gratification&#8217;s, let us eagerly embrace this incomparable
treasure, in which solid blessedness is laid up. Let our enemies jeer as they
please, every man ought to take care to have God propitious to him, and it is
clear that the very foundation of the faith is overthrown by those who think he
is to be doubtfully invoked. Let them deride our faith with as much petulance as
they please, but let us be sure of this, that no one obtains this privilege
except by God&#8217;s good gift, for men can only call God &#8220;Father&#8221;
by relying on the advocacy of Christ, through a free and peaceful confidence.
But the pursuit of piety will never flourish in us as it ought, until we learn
to raise our minds upwards, since they are too inclined to grovel upon earth,
and we should exercise them in continual meditation upon the heavenly life. And
in this respect, the surprising vanity of the human race manifests itself, since
though all speak eloquently, like philosophers, on the shortness of life, yet no
one aspires to that perpetual existence. So that when Paul contends the faith
and charity of the Colossians, he very truly says, that they were animated by a
hope laid up in the heavens.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:5.) And when discussing elsewhere the results of the grace which is open to us
in Christ, he says &#8212; we must be so built. up therein, that all impiety and
worldly desires must be mortified, and we must live soberly, justly, and piously
in this world, and wait for the blessed hope, and glorious advent of the great
God and our Savior Jesus Christ.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
2:12, 13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let, then, this expectation free us from all
hindrances, and draw us towards itself, and though the world is steeped in more
than epicurean pollution, lest the contagion should reach us, we ought to strive
the more earnestly until we arrive at the goal. Although it is truly a matter of
grief, that so great a multitude should willfully perish, and rush devotedly on
their own destruction, yet their foolish fury need not disturb us; for another
admonition of DANIEL should succor us, namely, that certain salvation is laid up
for all who have been found written in the book. But although our election is
hidden in God&#8217;s secret counsel, which is the prime cause of our salvation,
yet, since the adoption of all who are inserted into the body of Christ, by
faith in the gospel, is by no means doubtful, be ye content with this testimony,
and persevere in the course which ye have happily begun. But if ye must contend
still longer, (and I announce, that contests more severe than ye contemplate yet
remain for you,) by whatsoever attack the madness of the impious bursts forth,
as if it stirred up the regions below, remember that your course has been
defined by a heavenly Master of the contest, whose laws ye must obey the more
cheerfully, since he will supply you with strength unto the
end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, it is not lawful for me to desert the
station to which God has appointed me, I have DEDICATED<i> </i>to you this my
labor, as a pledge of my desire to help you, until at the completion of my
pilgrimage our heavenly Father, of his immeasurable pity, shall gather me
together with you, to his eternal inheritance.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>TO HIS LECTURES ON
DANIEL.</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
FIRST.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Book of The PROPHET DANIEL follows these Remarks,
and its utility will be better understood as we proceed; since it cannot be
conveniently explained all at once. I will, however, just present the Leader
with a foretaste to prepare his mind, and render him attentive. But before I do
so, I must make a brief SUMMARY OF THE BOOK. We may divide the Book into two
part, and this partition will materially help us. For DANIEL relates how he
acquired influence over the unbelieving. It was necessary for him to be elevated
to the prophetic office in some singular and unusual manner. The condition of
the Jews, as is well known, was so confused, that it was difficult for any one
to determine whether any Prophet existed. At first Jeremiah was alive, and after
him Ezekiel. After their return, the Jews had their own Prophets but Jeremiah
and Ezekiel had almost fulfilled their office, when DANIEL succeeded them.
Others too, as we have already seen, as HAGGAI, MALACHI, and ZECHARIAH, were
created Prophets for the purpose of exhorting the people, and hence their duties
were partially restricted. But DANIEL would scarcely have been considered a
Prophet, had not God, as we have said, appointed him in a remarkable way. We
shall perceive at the close of the sixth chapter, that he was divinely endued
with remarkable signs, so that the Jews might surely ascertain that he had the
gift of prophecy, unless they were basely ungrateful to God. His name was known
and respected by the inhabitants of Babylon. If the Jews had despised what even
the profane Gentiles admired, was not this purposely to suffocate and trample on
the grace of God? DANIEL, then, had sure and striking marks by which he could by
recognized as God&#8217;s Prophet, and his calling be rendered
unquestionable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A Second Part is afterwards added, in which God
predicts by his agency the events which were to occur to his elect people. The
Visions, then, from the seventh chapter to the end of the Book, relate
peculiarly to the Church of God. There God predicts what should happen
hereafter. And that admonition is the more necessary, since the trial was
severe, when the Jews had to bear an exile of seventy years; but after their
return to their country, instead of seventy years, God protracted their full
deliverance till seventy weeks of years. So the delay was increased sevenfold.
Their spirits might be broken a thousand times, or even utterly fail; for the
Prophets speak so magnificently about their redemption, that the Jews expected
their state to be especially happy and prosperous, as soon as they were snatched
from the Babylonian Captivity. But since they were oppressed with so many
afflictions, and that, too, not for a short period, but for more than four
hundred years, their redemption might seem illusory since they were but seventy
years in exile. there is no doubt, then, that Satan seduced the minds of many to
revolt, as if God were mocking them by bringing them out of Chaldea back again
to their own country. For these reasons God shews his servant in a Vision what
numerous and severe afflictions awaited his elect people. Besides, DANIEL, Se
prophesies that he describes almost historically events previously hidden. And
this was necessary, since in such turbulent convulsions the people would never
have tasted that these had been divinely revealed to Daniel, unless the heavenly
testimony had been proved by the event. This holy man ought so to speak and to
prophesy concerning futurity, as if he were relating what had already happened.
But we shall see all these things in their own order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I return, then, to what I commenced with, that we may
see in few words how useful this Book is to the Church of Christ. First of all,
the matter itself shews how Daniel did not speak from his own discretion, but
whatever he uttered was dictated by the Holy Spirit for whence could he conceive
the things which we shall afterwards behold, if he were only endued with human
prudence? for instance, that other Monarchies should arise to blot out that
Babylonian Empire which then had the greatest authority in all the world? Then,
again, how could he divine concerning Alexander the Great and his Successors?
for long before Alexander was born, DANIEL predicted what he should accomplish.
Then he shows that his kingdom should not last, since it is directly divided
into four horns. Other events also clearly demonstrate that he spoke by the
dictation of the Holy Spirit. But our confidence in this is strengthened by
other narratives, where he represents the various miseries to which the Church
should be subject between two most cruel enemies, the kings of Syria and Egypt.
He first recites their treaties, and then their hostile incursions on both
sides, and afterwards so many changes, as if he pointed at the things themselves
with his finger; and he so follows through their whole progress, that God
appears to speak by his mouth. This, then, is a great step, and we shall not
repent of taking it, when we acknowledge Daniel to have been only the organ of
the Holy Spirit, and never to have brought anything forward by his own private
inclination. The authority, too, which he obtained, and which inspired the Jews
with perfect confidence in his teaching, extends to us also. Shameful, indeed,
and base would be our ingratitude, if we did not embrace him as God&#8217;s
Prophet, whom the Chaldeans were compelled to honor &#8212; a people whom we
know to have been superstitious and full of pride. These two nations, the
Egyptians and Chaldeans, placed themselves before all others; for the Chaldeans
thought wisdom&#8217;s only dwelling-place was with themselves hence they would
never have been inclined to receive Daniel&#8217;s, unless the reality had
compelled them, and the confession of his being a true prophet of God had been
extorted from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since DANIEL&#8217;S authority is thus established,
we must now say a few words about the subjects which he treats. Respecting THE
INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAMS, the first of; those of Nebuchadnezzar embraces a
matter of great importance, as we shall see, namely, how all the splendor and
power of the world vanish away, Christ&#8217;s kingdom alone remaining stable,
and that nothing else is self-enduring. In the Second Dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
Daniel&#8217;s admirable constancy is displayed. Very invidious, indeed, was the
office of throwing down the mightiest Monarch of the whole world as he did
&#8220;Thou excepts thyself from the number of men, and art worshipped like a
god; thou shalt hereafter become a beast!&#8221; No man of these days would dare
thus to address Monarchs; nay, who dares to admonish them even mildly, if they
have sinned at all? When, therefore, DANIEL intrepid]y predicted to King
Nebuchadnezzar the disgrace which awaited him, he thus gave a rare and memorable
proof of his constancy. And in this way, again, his calling was sealed, since
this fortitude sprang from God&#8217;s Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Second Part is peculiarly worthy of notice,
since we there perceive how God cares for his Church. God&#8217;s providence is,
indeed, extended to the whole world. For if a sparrow does not fall to the
ground without his permission, he, doubtness, is mindful of the human race!
(Matthew 10, and Luke 12.) Nothing, therefore, happens to us by chance, but God
in this Book affords us light, while we know His Church to be so governed by
him, as to be the object. of His peculiar care. If matters ever were so
disturbed in the world, that one could suppose God to be asleep in heaven, and
to be forgetful of the human race, surely such were the changes of those times,
nay, so multiform, so extensive, and so various were they, that even the most
daring must be confounded, since there was no end to the wars. Egypt prevailed
at one time, while at another there were commotion&#8217;s in Syria. Seeing,
then, all things turned up-side (town, what judgment could be passed, except
that God neglected the world, and the Jews were miserably deceived in their
hope? They thought that as God had been their deliverer, so would he have been
the perpetual guardian of their safety. Although all nations were then subject
in common to various slaughters, yet if the Syrians were victorious over the
Egyptians, they abused their power against the Jews, and Jerusalem lay exposed
as their prey, and the reward of their victory if, again, the opposite side were
the conquerors, they revenged the injury, or sought compensation against rite
Jews. Thus on every side those miserable people were fleeced, and their
condition was much worse after their return to their country, than if they had
always been exiles or strangers in other regions. When, therefore, they were
admonished concerning the future, this was the best prop on which they could
repose. But the use of the same doctrine is at this day applicable to us. We
perceive, as in a glass or picture, how God was anxious about his Church, even
when he seemed to cast away all regard for it, hence when the Jews were exposed
to the injuries of their enemies, it was but, the accomplishment of his
designs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the Second Part we recognize their wonderful
preservation, and that too, by a. greater and more surprising exercise of
God&#8217;s power, than if they had lived in peace, and no one had molested
them. We learn this from the seventh to the ninth chapters. Now, when Daniel
numbers the years till THE ADVENT OF CHRIST, how clear and distinct is the
testimony which we may oppose against. Satan, and all the taunts of the impious!
and how certain it is that the Book of Daniel, was familiarly used by men before
this event. But when he enumerates THE SEVENTY WEEKS, and says, that Christ
should then come, all profane men may come, and boast, and swell with increased
swaggering, yet they shall fall down convicted, since Christ is that true
Redeemer whom God had promised from the beginning of the world. For He was
unwilling to make him known without the most certain demonstration, such as ail
the mathematicians can never equal. First of all, it is worthy of observation,
that DANIEL afterwards discoursed on the various calamities of the Church, and
prophesied the time at which God pleased to hew his only-begotten Son to the
world. His dissertation on the office of Christ is one of the principal supports
of our faith. For he not only describes his Advent, but announces the abolition
of the shadows of the Law, since the Messiah would bring with him its complete
fulfillment. And when he predicts the Death of Christ, he shows for what purpose
he should undergo death, namely, to abolish Sin by his sacrifice, and to bring
in Eternal Righteousness. Lastly, this also must be noticed, &#8212; as he had
instructed the people to bear their cross, so also he warns them that the
Church&#8217;s state would not be tranquil even when the Messiah came. The sons
of God should be militant until the end, and not hope for any fruit of their
victory until the dead should rise again, and Christ himself should collect us
into his own Celestial Kingdom. Now, we comprehend in few words, or rather only
taste how useful and fruitful this Book is to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to the words themselves, I wished, as I
said, just to catch a foretaste of a few things, and the reading of the Book
will show us better what advantage we may derive from each of its
chapters.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">These are not two different things, but the Prophet
explains and confirms the same sentiments by a change of phrase, and says that
the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had brought into the land of Shinar were laid
up in the house of the treasury. The Hebrews, as we know, generally use the word
&#8220;house&#8221;<i> </i>for any place, as they call the temple God&#8217;s
&#8220;house<i>.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Of the land of Shinar, it must be remarked,
that it was a plain adjacent to Babylon; and the famous temple of Belus, to
which the Prophet very probably refers, was erected there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel marks the time in which he was led into
captivity together with his companions, namely, in the third year of
Jehoiakim.<i> </i>A difficult question arises here, since<i> </i>Nebuchadnezzar
began to reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim. How then could he have besieged
Jerusalem in the third year, and then led away the people captives according to
his pleasure? Some interpreters solve this difficulty by what appears to me a
frivolous conjecture, that the four years ought to refer to the beginning of his
reign, and so the time may be brought within the third year. But in the second
chapter we shall see Daniel brought, before the king in the second year of his
reign. They explain this difficulty also by another solution. They say &#8212;
the years are not reckoned<i> </i>from the beginning of the reign, and, &#8212;
this was the second year from the Conquest of the Jews and the taking of
Jerusalem; but this is too harsh and forced. The most probable conjecture<i>
</i>seems to me, that the Prophet is speaking of the first King Nebuchadnezzar,
or at least uses the reign of the second, while his father was yet alive. We
know there were two kings of the same name, father and son; and as the son did
many noble and illustrious actions, he acquired the surname of Great. Whatever,
therefore, we shall afterwards meet with concerning Nebuchadnezzar, cannot be
understood except of the second, who is the son. But Josephus says the son was
sent by his father against the Egyptians and the Jews<i> </i>and this was the
cause of the war, since the Egyptians often urged the Jews to a change of
affairs, and enticed them to throw off the yoke<i>. </i>Nebuchadnezzar the
younger was car-wing on the war in Egypt at the death of his father, and
speedily returned home, lest ally one should supersede him. When, however, he
found all things as he wished, Josephus thinks he put off that expedition, and
went to Jerusalem. There is nothing strange, nay, it is very customary to call
him King who shares the command with his father. Thus, therefore, I interpret
it. In the third year or the reign of Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar came, under the
command and direction of his father, or if any one prefers it, the father
himself came. For there is nothing out of place, whether we refer it to the
father or to the son.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king of Babylon, came
to Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, by the hand of
his son besieged Jerusalem. But if a different explanation is preferred, since
he was there himself and carried on the war in person, that view not be taken
still, the events happened in the third year of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign.
Interpreters make many mistakes hi this matter. Josephus, indeed, says this was
done hi the eighth year, but he had never read the Book of Daniel. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f70</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He was an unlearned man, and by no means familiar with the Scriptures; nay, I
think he had never read three verses of Daniel. It was a dreadful judgment of
God for a priest to be so ignorant a man as Josephus. But in another passage on
which I have commented, he seems to have followed Metasthenes and others whom he
cites, when speaking of the destruction of that monarchy. And this seems to suit
well enough, since in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim the city was once
taken, and some of the nobles of the royal race were led away in triumph, among
whom were Daniel and his companions. When Jehoiakim afterwards rebelled, his
treatment was far more severe, as Jeremiah had predicted. But while Jehoiakim
possessed the kingdom by permission of King Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel was already a
captive, so that Jeremiah&#8217;s prediction was fulfilled &#8212; the condition
of the figs prematurely ripe was improved; for those who were led into exile
last thought themselves better off than the rest. But the Prophet deprives them
of their vain boast, and shows the former captives to have been better treated
than the remnant of the people who as yet remained safe at. home.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
24:2, 8.) I assume, then, that Daniel was among the first fruits of the
captivity; and this is an instance of God&#8217;s judgments being so
incomprehensible by us. For had there been any integrity in the whole people,
surely Daniel was a remarkable example of it for Ezekiel includes him among the
three just men by whom most probably God would be appeased. (Ezekiel 14:14.)
Such, then, was the excellence of Daniel&#8217;s virtues, that he was like a
celestial angel among mortals; and yet he was led into exile, and lived as the
slave of the king of Babylon. Others, again, who had provoked God&#8217;s wrath
in so many ways, remained quiet in their nests the Lord did not deprive them of
their country and of that inheritance which was a sign and pledge of their
adoption. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f71</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Should any wish here to determine why Daniel was
among the first. to be led into captivity, will he not betray his folly? Hence,
let us learn to admire God&#8217;s judgments, which surpass all our perceptions;
and let us also remember the words of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If these things
are done in the green tree,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">what
will be done in the dry?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422331&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
23:31.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As I have already said, there was an angelic holiness
in Daniel, although so ignominiously exiled and brought up among the kings
eunuchs. Then this happened to so holy a man, who from his childhood was
entirely devoted to piety, how great is God&#8217;s indulgence in sparing us?
What have we deserved? Which of us will dare to compare himself with Daniel?
Nay, we are unworthy, according to the ancient proverb, to loosen the tie of his
shoes. Without. the slightest doubt Daniel, through the circumstances of the
time, wished to manifest the singular and extraordinary gift of God, since this
trial did not oppress his mind and could not turn him aside from the right
course of piety. When, therefore, Daniel. saw himself put forward as an example
of integrity, he did not desist from the pure worship of God. As to his
assertion that Jehoiakim was delivered into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar
<i>by </i>God&#8217;s command, this form of speech takes away any stumbling
block which might occur to the minds of the pious. Had Nebuchadnezzar been
altogether superior, God himself might seem to have ceased to exist, and so his
glory would have been depressed. But Daniel clearly asserts that King
Nebuchadnezzar did not possess Jerusalem, and was not the conqueror of the
nation <i>by </i>his own valor, or counsel, or fortune, or good luck, but
because God wished to humble his people. Therefore, Daniel here sets before us
the providence and judgments of God, that we may not think Jerusalem to have
been taken in violation of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham and his posterity. He
also speaks by name of the vessels of the temple. Now, this might seem
altogether out of place, and would shock the minds of the faithful. For what
does it mean? That God&#8217;s temple was spoiled by a wicked and impious man.
Had not God borne witness that his rest was there? This shall be my rest for
ever, here will I dwell because I have chosen it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14.) If any place in the world were impregnable, here truly honor ought to
remain entire and untainted in the temple of God. When, therefore, it was.
robbed and its sacred vessels profaned, and when an impious king had also
transferred to the temple of his own god what had been dedicated to the living
God, would not, as I have said, such a trial as this cast down the minds of the
holy? No one was surely so stout-hearted whom that unexpected trial would not
oppress. Where is God, if he does not defend his own temple? Although he does
not dwell in this world, and is not enclosed in walls of either wood or stone,
yet he chose this dwelling-place for himself,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
80:1, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
99:1, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:16,)and often by means of his Prophets asserted his seat to between the
Cherubim. What then is the meaning of this? As I have already said, Daniel
recalls us to the judgment of God, and by a single word assures us that we ought
not to be surprised at God inflicting such severe punishments upon impious and
wicked apostates. For under the name of God, there is a silent antithesis; as
the Lord did not deliver Jehoiakim into the hand of the Babylonians without just
reason: <i>God, </i>therefore, exposed him as a prey that he might punish him
for the revolt of his impious people. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel pursues his narrative, and shows the
manner in which he was led away together with his companions. The king had
demanded young men to be brought, not from the ordinary multitude, but from the
principal nobility, who stood before him, that is, ministered to him. Hence, we
ascertain why Daniel and his companions were chosen, because they were noble
young men and of the royal seed, or at least of parents who surpassed others in
rank. The king did this purposely to show himself a conqueror; he may also have
taken this plan designedly, to retain hostages in his power; for he hoped, as we
shall see, that those who were nourished in his palace would be degenerate and
hostile to the Jews, and he thought their assistance would prove useful to
himself. He also hoped, since they were born of a noble stock, that the Jews
would be the more peaceable, and thus avoid all danger to those wretched exiles
who were relations of the kings and the nobles. With regard to the words, he
calls this <i>Aspenaz </i>the prince of eunuchs, under which name he means the
boys who were nourished in the king&#8217;s palace to become a seminary of
nobles; for it is scarcely possible that this Aspenaz was set over other
leaders. But we gather from this place, that the boys whom the king held in
honor and regard were under his custody. The Hebrews calls eunuchs
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ysyrs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>serisim, </i>a name which belongs to certain prefects; for Potiphar is called
by this name though he had a wife. So this name is everywhere used in Scripture
for the satraps of a king;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
37:36;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;014002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
40:2, 7;) but since satraps also were chosen from noble boys, they were probably
called eunuchs, though they were not made so, yet Josephus ignorantly declares
these Jewish children to have been made eunuchs. But when eunuchs existed among
the luxuries of Oriental kings, as I have already said, those youths were
commonly called by this name whom the king brought up as a kind of school of
nobles, whom he might afterwards place over various province.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The

resolved; he did not command any of the common people to be brought to him, but
some of the royal race, the more plainly to show himself their conqueror by
doing all things according to his will. He means those &#8220;elders&#8221; who
yet were in chief authority under the king of Judah. And Daniel also was of that

suit the present passage where Jews are treated of. We now see the general

regarded not only their rank, when he ordered the most excellent of the royal
and noble children to be brought to him; but he exercised his choice that those
who were to be his servants should be clever; they were of high birth, as the
phrase is; so they ought to prevail in eloquence and give hopeful promise of
general excellence in both body and mind. Without doubt he wished them to be
held in great estimation, that he might win over other Jews also. Thus, if they
afterwards obtained authority, should circumstances allow of it, they might
become rulers in Judea, bearing sway over their own people, and yet remain
attached to the Babylonian empire. This was the king&#8217;s design; it affords
no reason why we should praise his liberality, since it is sufficiently apparent
that he consulted nothing but his own advantage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile, we observe, that learning and the liberal
arts were not then so despised as they are in this age, and in those immediately
preceding it. So strongly has barbarism prevailed in the world, that it is
almost disgraceful for nobles to be reckoned among the men of education and of
letters! The chief boast. of the nobility was to be destitute of scholarship
&#8212; nay, they gloried in the assertion, that they were &#8220;no
scholars,&#8221; in the language of the day; and if any of their rank were
versed in literature, they acquired their attainments for no other purpose than
to be made bishops and abbots&#8217; still, as I have said, they generally
despised all literature. We perceive the age in which Daniel lived was not so
barbarous, for the king wished to have these boys whom he caused to be so
instructed, among his own princes, as we have said, to promote his own
advantage; still we must remark upon the habit of that age. As to his requiring
so much knowledge and skill, it may seem out of place, and more than their
tender age admitted, that they should be so accomplished in prudence, knowledge,
and experience. But we know that kings require nothing in moderation when they
order anything to be prepared, they often ascend beyond the clouds. So
Nebuchadnezzar speaks here; and Daniel, who relates his commands, does so in a
royal manner. Since the king commanded all the most accomplished to be brought
before him, if they really manifested any remarkable qualities, we need not be
surprised at their knowledge, skill, and prudence. The king simply wished those
boys and youths to be brought to him who were ingenious and dangerous, and
adapted to learn with rapidly; and then those who were naturally eloquent and of
a healthy constitution of body. For it. follows directly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they might
learn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or be taught
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the literature and language of
the Chaldees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We perceive that King
Nebuchadnezzar did not demand teachers, but boys of high birth, and good
talents, and of promising abilities; he wished them to be liberally instructed
in the doctrine of the Chaldees he was unwilling to have youths of merely
polished and cultivated minds without natural abilities. His desire to have them
acquainted with the language of Chaldea arose from his wish to separate them by
degrees from their own nation, to introduce them to forget their Jewish birth,
and to acquire the Chaldean manners, since language is a singular bond of
communication. Respecting their learning, we may ask, whether Daniel and his
companions were permitted to learn arts full of imposition, which we know to be
the nature of the Chaldean learning. For they professed to know every
one&#8217;s fate, as in these days there are many impostors in the world, who
are called fortune-tellers. They abused an honorable name when they called
themselves mathematicians, as if there were no scientific learning separate from
those arts and diabolic illusions. And as to the use of the word, the Caesars,
in their laws, unite Chaldeans and mathematicians, treating them as synonymous.
But the explanation is easy, &#8212; the Chaldeans not only pursued that
astrology which is called &#8220;Judicial,&#8221; but were also skilled in the
true and genuine knowledge of the stars. The ancients say, that the course of
the stars was observed by the Chaldeans, as there was no region of the world so
full of them, and none possessed so extensive an horizon on all sides. As the
Chaldeans enjoyed this advantage of having the heavens so fully exposed to the
contemplation of man, this may have led to their study, and have conduced to the
more earnest pursuit of astrology. But as the minds of men are inclined to vain
and foolish curiosity, they were not content with legitimate science, but fell
into foolish and perverse imaginations. For what fortune-tellers predict of any
one&#8217;s destiny is merely foolish fanaticism. Daniel, therefore, might have
learned these arts; that is, astrology and other liberal sciences, just as Moses
is said to have been instructed in all the sciences of Egypt. We know how the
Egyptians were infected with similar corruption&#8217;s; but it is said both of
Moses and of our Prophet, that they were imbued with a knowledge of the stars
and of the other liberal sciences. Although it is uncertain whether the king
commanded them to proceed far in these studies, yet we must hold that Daniel
abstained, as we shall see directly, from the royal food and drink, and was not
drawn aside nor involved in these Satanic impostures. Whatever the king&#8217;s
commandment was, I suppose Daniel to have been content with the pure and genuine
knowledge of natural things. As far as the king is concerned, as we have already
said, he consulted simply his own interests; wishing Daniel and his companions
to pass over into a foreign tribe, and to be drawn away from their own people,
as if they had been natives of Chaldea. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse, DANIEL shews that the king had ordered
some youths to be brought to him from Judea, and to be so nourished as to be
intoxicated with delicacies, and thus rendered forgetful of their own nation.
For we know that wherever there is any cunning in the world, it reigns
especially in kings palaces! So Nebuchadnezzar, when he perceived he was dealing
with an obstinate people, (and we know the Jews to have been of a hard and
unsubdued spirit,) wished to acquire servants spontaneously obedient, aid thus
endeavored to soften them with luxuries. This was the reason why he provided for
them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an allotment of his own meat
and drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as at present it is the
greatest honor at princes&#8217; tables to be served with a <i>bon-bouche,
</i>as they say. Nebuchadnezzar wished this Daniel and his companions, though
but captives and exiles, to be brought up not only splendidly but royally, if of
the royal race. Through his right of conquest he, had drawn them away violently
from their country, as we said yesterday. Hence he does not act thus from any
feeling of liberality, and his feeding those miserable exiles from his own table
should not be esteemed a virtuous action; but, as we have said, he cleverly
reconciles the minds of the boys to be reckoned Chaldeans rather than Jews, and
thus to deny their own race. This, then, was the king&#8217;s intention; but we
shall see how God governed Daniel and his companions by His Spirit, and how they
became aware of these snares of the devil, and abstained from the royal diet,
lest they should become polluted by it. This point will hereafter be treated in
its place &#8212; we are now only commenting on the craftiness of the king. He,
commanded a daily portion of diet to be distributed to them, not that the spirit
of parsimony dictated this daily portion, but the king wished their food should
be exactly the same as his own and that of the chiefs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they should be educated for
three years</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>meaning, until they were
thoroughly skilled in both the language and knowledge of the Chaldeans. Three
years were sufficient for both these objects, since he had selected youths of
sufficient talent to learn with ease both languages and sciences. As they were
endued with such capacity, it is not surprising that the space of three years
had been prescribed by the king. At length, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the end of
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>meaning of the three years. We
have shown how this ought not to be referred to the boys, as if the king
afterwards selected some of them, for we shall see in its own place that a
distinct time was fixed beforehand; hence no long refutation is needed. It is
certain, then, that the Prophet speaks of the close of the three years. It had
been said just before, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they
with stand in the palace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but this ought
also to be understood of the time of which mention has been made. They did not
stand before the king immediately, but were reserved for this purpose. Since the
king commanded them to be brought up for the purpose of using their services
afterwards Daniel twice repeats &#8212; they were splendidly educated &#8212;
seeing the king wished them to become his servants at table and in other
duties.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now comes to what properly belongs to his
purpose. He did not propose to write a full narrative, but he touched shortly on
what was necessary, to inform us how God prepared him for the subsequent
discharge of the prophetic office. After he had stated their selection from the
royal and noble seed, as excelling in talent, dexterity, and eloquence, as well
as in rigor of body, he now adds, that he would his companions were among them.
He leaves out the rest, because he had nothing to record of them worthy of
mention; and, as I have said, the narrative hitherto is only subsidiary. The
Prophet&#8217;s object, then, must be noticed, since he was exiled, and educated
royally and sumptuously hi the palace of King Nebuchadnezzar, that he might
afterwards be one of the prefects, and his companions be elevated to the same
rank. He does not say that he was of the royal house, but only of the tribe of
Judah; but he was probably born of a noble rather than of a plebeian family,
since kings more commonly selected their prefects from their own relations than
from others. Moreover, since the kingdom of Israel was cut off, perhaps through
a feeling of modesty, Daniel did not record his family, nor openly assert his
origin from a noble and celebrated stock. He was content with a single word,
&#8212; he and his companion were of the tribe of Judah, and brought up among
the children of the nobility. He says <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their names were
changed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>so that by all means the king
might blot out of their hearts the remembrance of their own race, and they might
forget their own origin. As far as interpretations are concerned, I think I have
said enough to satisfy you, as I am not willingly curious in names where there
is any obscurity, and especially in these Chaldee words. As to the Hebrew names,
we know Daniel&#8217;s name to mean the judge, or judgment of God. Therefore,
whether by the secret instinct of God, his parents had imposed this name, or
whether by common custom, Daniel was called by this name, as God&#8217;s judge.
So also of the rest; for Hananiah has a fixed meaning, namely, one who has
obtained mercy from God; so Misael means required or demanded by God; and so
Azariah, the help of God, or one whom God helps. But all these flyings have
already been better explained to you, so I have only just touched on these
points, as the change has no adequate reason for it. It is enough for us that
the names were changed to abolish the remembrance of the kingdom of Judah from
their hearts. Some Hebrews also assert these to have been the names of wise men.
Whether it was so or not, if, was the kings plan to draw away those boys that
they should have nothing in common with the elect people, but degenerate to the
manners of the Chaldeans. Daniel could not help the prince or master of the
eunuchs changing his name, for it was not in. his power to hinder it; the same
must be said of his companions. But they had enough to retain the remembrance of
their race, which Satan, by this artifice, wished utterly to blot out. And yet
this was a great trial, because they suffered. from their badge of slavery.
Since their names were changed, either the king or his prefect Aspenaz wished to
force them under the yoke, as if he would put before their eyes the, judgment of
their own slavery as often as they heard their&#8221; names. We see, then, the
intention of the change of name, namely, to cause these miserable exiles to feel
themselves; in captivity, and cut off from the race of Israel; and by this mark
or symbol they were reduced to slavery, to the, king of Babylon and his palace.
This was, indeed, a hard trial, but it mattered not to the servants of God to be
contemptuously treated before men, so long as they were not infected with any
corruption; hence we conclude them to have been divinely governed, as they stood
pure and spotless. For Daniel afterwards says &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel shows his endurance of what he could
neither cast off nor escape; but meanwhile he took care that he did not depart
from the fear of God, nor become a stranger to his race, but he always retains
the remembrance of his origin, and remains a pure, and unspotted, and sincere
worshipper of God. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore, &#8212; he determined
in his heart not to pollute himself with the kings food and drink, and that he
asked the prefect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>under whose charge he
was, that he should not be driven to this necessity. It may be asked here, what
there was of such importance in the diet to cause Daniel to avoid it? This seems
to be a kind of superstition, or at least Daniel may have been too morose in
rejecting the king&#8217;s diet. We know that to the pure all things are pure,
and this rule applies to all ages. We read nothing of this kind concerning
Joseph, and very likely Daniel used all food promiscuously, since he was treated
by the king with great honor. This, then, was not perpetual with Daniel; for he
might seem an inconsiderate zealot, or this might be ascribed, as we have said,
to too much moresoness. If Daniel only for a time rejected the royal food, it
was a mark of levity and inconsistency afterwards to allow himself that liberty
from which he had for the time abstained. But if he did this with judgment and
reason, why did he not persist in his purpose? I answer, &#8212; Daniel
abstained at first from the luxuries of the court to escape being tampered with.
It was lawful for him and his companions to feed on any kind of diet, but he
perceived the king&#8217;s intention. We know how far enticements prevail to
deceive us; especially when we are treated daintily; and experience shows us how
difficult it is to be moderate when all is affluence around us, for luxury
follows immediately on plenty. Such conduct is, indeed, too common, and the
virtue of abstinence is rarely exercised when there is an abundance of
provisions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is not the whole reason which weighed with
Daniel. Sobriety and abstinence are not simply praised here, since many twist
this passage to the praise of fasting, and say Daniel&#8217;s chief virtue
consisted in preferring pulse to the delicacies of a palace. For Daniel not only
wished to guard himself against the delicacies of the table, since he perceived
a positive danger of being eaten up by such enticements; hence he simply
determined in his hem not to taste the diet of the court, desiring by his very
food perpetually to recall the remembrance of his country. He wished so to live
in Chaldea, as to consider himself an exile and a captive, sprung from the
sacred family of Abraham. We see, then, the intention of Daniel. He desired to
refrain from too great an abundance and delicacy of diet, simply to escape those
snares of Satan, by which he saw himself surrounded. He was, doubtless,
conscious of his own infirmity, and this also is to be reckoned to his praise,
since; through distrust of himself he desired to escape from all allurements and
temptations. As far as concerned the king intention, this was really a snare of
the devil, as I have said. Daniel rejected it, and there is no doubt that God
enlightened his mind by his Spirit as soon as he prayed to him. Hence he was
unwilling to cast himself into the snares of the devil, while he voluntarily
abstained from the royal diet. This is; the full meaning; of the
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may also be asked, Why does Daniel claim this
praise, as His own, which was shared equally with his companions? for he was not
the only one who rejected the royal diet. It is necessary to take notice, how
from his childhood he was, governed by the Spirit of God, that the confidence
and influence of his teaching might. be the greater; hence he speaks peculiarly
of himself, not for the sake of boasting, but to obtain confidence in his
teaching, and to show himself to have been for a long period formed and polished
by God for the prophetic. office. We must also remember that he was the adviser
of his companions; for this course might never have come into their minds, and
they might have been corrupted, unless they had been admonished by Daniel. God,
therefore, wished Daniel to be a leader and master to his companions, to induce
them to adopt the same abstinence. Hence also we gather, that as each of us is
endued more fruitfully with the grace of the Spirit, so should we feel bound to
instruct others. It will not be sufficient for any one to restrain himself and
thus to discharge his own duty, under the teaching of God&#8217;s Spirit, unless
he also extend his hand to others, and endeavor to unite in an alliance of
piety, and of the fear and worship of God. Such an example is here proposed to
us in Daniel, who not only rejected the delicacies of the palace, by which he
might be intoxicated and even poisoned; but he also advised and persuaded his
companions to adopt the same course. This is the reason why he calls tasting the
king&#8217;s food pollution or abomination, though, as I have said, there was
nothing abominable in it of itself. Daniel was at liberty to eat and drink at
the loyal table, but the abomination arose from the consequences. Before the
time of these four persons living in Chaldea., they doubtless partook of
ordinary food after the usual manner, and were permitted to eat whatever was
offered to them. They did not ask for pulse when at an inn, or on their journey;
but they began to desire it when the king wished to infect them with his
delicacies, and to induce them if possible to prefer that condition to returning
to their own friends. When they perceived the object of his snares, then it
became both a pollution and abomination to feed on those dainties, and to eat,
at the king&#8217;s table. Thus we may ascertain the reason why Daniel thought
himself polluted if he fared sumptuously and partook of the royal diet; he was
conscious, as we have already observed, of his own infirmities, and wished to
take timely precautions, lest he should be enticed by such snares, and fall away
from piety and the worship of God, and degenerate into the manners of the
Chaldeans, as if he were one of their nation, and of their native princes. I
must leave the rest till tomorrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">DANIEL, yesterday, related what he had asked from the
master to whose care he had been committed, he now inserts his sentence, to show
this demand to be quite unobjectionable, since the prefect of the eunuchs
treated him kindly. The crime would have been fatal had Daniel been brought into
the king&#8217;s presence. Although very probably he did not use the word
&#8220;pollution,&#8221; and openly and directly call the royal diet a
&#8220;defilement,&#8221;<i> </i>yet it, may be easily conjectured from these
words which he now records, that he asked the prefect to be permitted to eat
pulse, because he did not think himself permitted to partake of the royal diet.
We yesterday gave the reason; but the king of Babylon would immediately have
been angry, had he known this. What! he would say, I honor those captives, when
I might abuse them as slaves; nay, I nourish them delicately like my own
children. and yet they reject my food, as if I were polluted. This, therefore,
is the reason why Daniel here relates his being in favor with that prefect. For,
as we shall see in the next verse, the prefect simply denied his request. Where
was then any favor shown? But though he was not willing to acquiesce in the
prayers of Daniel, he showed a singular kindness in not taking him before the
king, since courtiers are ready for any accusation for the sake of obtaining
favor. Then, very probably, the prefect would know that this had been granted to
Daniel by his servant. If then there was any connivance on the part of the
prefect, this is the favor and pity of which Daniel now speaks. His intention,
then, is by no means doubtful, since he did not hesitate to adopt a different
course of life, in order to remain pure and spotless, and uncontaminated with
the delicacies of the palace of Babylon. He expresses how he escaped the danger,
because the perfect treated him kindly, when he might have instantly caused his
death. But we must notice the form of speech here used;<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God placed him in favor and
pity before that prefect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He might have
used the usual phrase, merely saying he was favorably treated; but, as he found
a barbarian so humane and merciful, he ascribes this benefit to God. This
phrase, as we have expounded it, is customary with the Hebrews; as when it is
said,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A646&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:46,) God gave the Jews favor in the sight of the heathen who had led them
captive; meaning, he took care that their conquerors should not rage so cruelly
against them as they had done at first. For we know how the Jews were often
treated harshly, roughly, and contemptuously. Since this inhumanity was here
mitigated, the Prophet attributes it to God, who prepared mercies for his
people. The result is this, &#8212; Daniel obtained favor with the prefect,
since God bent the heart of a man, otherwise unsoftened, to clemency and
humanity. His object in this narrative is to urge us to greater earnestness in
duty, if we have to undergo any difficulties when God calls us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It often happens that we cannot discharge everything
which God requires and exacts without imminent danger to our lives. Sloth and
softness naturally creep over us, and induce us to reject the cross. Daniel,
therefore, gives us courage to obey God and his commands, and here states his
favor with the prefect, since God granted his servant favor while faithfully
performing his duty. Hence let us learn to cast our care upon God when worldly
terror oppresses us, or when men forbid us with threats to obey God&#8217;s
commands. Here let us acknowledge the power of God&#8217;s hand to turn the
hearts of those who rage against us, and to flee us from all danger. This, then,
is the reason why Daniel says the prefect was kind to him. Meanwhile, we gather
the general doctrine from this passage, that men&#8217;s hearts are divinely
governed, while it shows us how God softens their iron hardness, and turns the
wolf into the lamb. For when he brought his people out of Egypt, he gave them
favor with the Egyptians, so that they carried with them their most precious
vessels. It is clear enough that the Egyptians were hostile towards the
Israelites. Why then did they so freely offer them the most valuable of their
household goods? Only beck, use the Lord inspired their hearts with new
affections. So, again, the Lord can exasperate our friends, and cause them
afterwards to rise up in hostility against us. Let us perceive, then, that on
both sides the will is in God&#8217;s power, either to bend the hearts of men to
humanity, or to harden those which were naturally tender. It is true, indeed,
that every one has a peculiar disposition from his birth some are ferocious,
warlike, and sanguinary; others are mild, humane, and tractable. This variety
springs from God&#8217;s secret ordination; but God not only forms every
one&#8217;s disposition at his birth, but every day and every moment, if it
seems good to him, changes every one&#8217;s affections. He also blinds
men&#8217;s minds, and rouses them again from their stupor. For we sometimes see
the rudest men endued with much acuteness, and show a singular contrivance in
action, and others who excel in foresight, are at fault when they have need of
judgment and discretion. We must consider the minds and hearts of men to be so
governed by God&#8217;s secret instinct, that he changes their affections just
as he pleases. Hence there is no reason why we should so greatly fear our
enemies, although they vomit forth their rage with open mouth, and are
overflowing with cruelty; for they can be turned aside by the Lord. And thus let
us learn from the example of Daniel to go on fearlessly in our course, and not
to turn aside, even if the whole world should oppose us; since God can easily
and readily remove all impediments and we shall find those who were formerly
most cruel, become humane when the Lord wishes to spare us. We now understand
the sense of the words of this verse, as well as the Prophet&#8217;s intention.

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel suffers a repulse from the prefect; and truly,
as I have lately remarked, his humanity is not praised through his listening to
Daniel&#8217;s wish and prayer; but through his burying in silence whatever
might have brought him into difficulties. And his friendship appears in this;
for although he denies his request, yet he does so mildly and civilly, as if he
had said he would willingly grant it unless he had feared the king&#8217;s
anger. This, therefore, is the meaning, &#8212; the prefect, though he did not
dare to comply with Daniel&#8217;s request, yet treated both him and his
companions kindly by not endangering their lives. He says, &#8212; he

as if he feared. man more than the living God, for he could not have any
knowledge of God. Although he may have been persuaded that Daniel made his
request in the earnest, pursuit of piety, yet he did not think himself
authorized to comply; for he thought the Jews had their peculiar method of
worship, but meanwhile he clung entirely to the religion of Babylon. Just as
many profane persons now think us quite right in casting away superstitions, but
yet they slumber in this error, &#8212; it is lawful for themselves to live in
the ancient manner, since they were so brought up and instructed by their
forefathers. Hence they use rites which they allow to be disapproved by us. So
also this prefect might feel rightly concerning Daniel and his associates; at
the same time he was not so touched by them as to desire to learn the difference
between the two religions. Therefore he simply excuses himself, as not being at
liberty to grant Daniel&#8217;s request, since this would endanger his own head
with the king. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Since Daniel understood from the answer of the
prefect that he could not obtain his wish, he now addresses his servant. For the
prefect had many servants under him, according to the custom of important
stewardships. Most probably the steward&#8217;s duty was similar to that of the
Chief Steward of the Household, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as it exists at this time in France. Daniel and his companions were under the
care of one of these servants; Daniel descends to this remedy and obtains his
wish. though, as we shall see, not without some artifice. And here
Daniel&#8217;s singular constancy is observable, who after trying the matter
once in vain, did not cease to pursue the same object It is a clear and serious
proof of our faith, when we are not fatigued when anything adverse occurs, and
never consider the way closed against us. Then if we do not retrace our steps,
but try all ways, we truly show the root of piety fixed in our hearts. It might
have seemed excusable in Daniel, after he had met with his first repulse; for
who would not have said he had discharged his duty, and that an obstacle had
prevailed over him! But; since he did not prevail with the chief prefect, he
goes to his servant. Thus voluntarily to incur risk was the result of no common
prudence. For this servant could not make the same objection, as we have just
heard the prefect did. Without doubt he had heard of Daniel&#8217;s request, and
of his repulse and denial; hence Daniel is beforehand with him, and shows how
the servant may comply without the slightest danger; as if he had said, &#8212;
We, indeed, did not obtain our wish from the prefect because he was afraid of
his life, but I have now thought of a new scheme by which you may both gratify
us and yet not become chargeable with any crime, as the whole matter will be
unknown. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Try thy servants,
therefore, for ten days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and prove them;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let nothing but pulse be given us
to eat and water to drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If after that
time our faces are fresh and plump, no suspicion will attach to time, and no one
will be persuaded that we are not treated delicately according to the
king&#8217;s commandment. Since, then, this proof will be sufficiently safe for
thee, and cautious enough for us both, there is no reason why you should reject
our prayers. Besides, without the slightest doubt, when Daniel brought this
forward, he was directed by God&#8217;s Spirit to this act of prudence, and was
also impelled to make this request. By the singular gift of the Holy Spirit
Daniel invented this method of bending the mind of the servant under whose care
he was placed. We must hold, then, that this was not spoken rashly or of his own
will, but by the instinct of the Holy Spirit. It would not have been duty but
rashness, if Daniel had been the author of this plan, and had not been assured
by the Lord of its prosperous issue. Without doubt. he had some secret
revelation on the subject; and if the servant allowed him and His associates to
feed on pulse, it was a happy answer to his prayers. Hence, I say, he would not
have spoken thus, except under the guidance and command of the Spirit. And this
is worthy of notice, since we often permit ourselves to do many things which
turn out badly, because we are carried away by the mere feelings of the flesh,
and do not consider what is pleasing to God. It is not surprising, then, when
men indulge in various expectations, if they feel themselves deceived at last,
since every one occasionally imposes upon himself by foolish hopes, and thus
frustrates his designs. Indeed, it is not our province to promise ourselves any
success. Hence let us notice how Daniel had not undertaken or approached the
present business with any foolish zeal; and did not speak without due
consideration, but was assured of the event by the Spirit of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let pulse be put before us to
eat, and water to drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see, then,
that the foul youths did not abstain from the royal food for fear of pollution;
for there was no law to prevent any one drinking wine, except the Nazarites,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;040602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
6:2,) and they might eat of any kind of flesh, of which there was abundance at
the royal table. Whence then sprang this scrupulousness? because, as we said
yesterday, Daniel was unwilling to accustom himself to the delicacies of the
palace, which would cause him to become degenerate. He wished, therefore, to
nourish his body not only frugally, but abstemiously, and not to indulge in
these tastes; for although he was raised to the highest honors, he was always
the same as if still among the most wretched captives. There is no occasion for
seeking other reasons for this abstinence of Daniel&#8217;s. For he might have
fed on ordinary bread and other less delicate food; but he was content with
pulse, and was continually lamenting and nourishing in his mind the remembrance
of his country, of which he would have been directly forgetful if he had been
plunged into those luxuries of the palace. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now this surprising event took place, &#8212; Daniel
contracted neither leanness nor debility from that mean food, but his face was
as shirting as if he had continued to feed most delicately; hence we gather as I
have already said, that he was divinely impelled to persist firmly in his own
design, and not to pollute himself with the royal diet. God, therefore,
testified by the result that. he had advised Daniel and his companions in this
their prayer and proposal. It is clear enough that there is no necessary virtue
in bread to nourish us; for we are nourished by God&#8217;s secret blessing, as
Moses says, Man lives not by bread alone,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
8:3,) implying that the bread itself does not impart strength to men, for the
bread has no life in it; how then can it afford us life? As bread possesses no
virtue by itself, we are nourished by the word of God; and because God has
determined that our life shall be sustained by nourishment, he has breathed its
virtue into the bread &#8212; but, meanwhile, we ought to consider our life
sustained neither by bread nor any other food, but by the secret blessing of
God. For Moses does not speak here of either doctrine or spiritual life, but
says our bodily life is cherished by God&#8217;s favor, who has endued bread and
other food with their peculiar properties. This, at least, is certain, &#8212;
whatever food we feed on, we are nourished and sustained by God&#8217;s
gratuitous power. But the example which Daniel here mentions was singular. Hence
God, as I have said, shews, by the event, how Daniel could not remain pure and
spotless with his companions, otherwise than by being content with pulse and
water. We must observe, for our improvement, in the first place, &#8212; we
should be very careful not to become slaves of the palate, and thus be drawn off
from our duty and from obedience and the fear of God, when we ought to live
sparingly and be free from all luxuries. We see a this day how many feel it a
very great cross if they cannot indulge at the tables of the rich, which are
filled with abundance and variety of food. Others are so hardened in the
enjoyment of luxuries, that they cannot be content with moderation; hence they
are always wallowing in their own filth, being quite unable to renounce the
delights of the palate. But Daniel sufficiently shews us, when God not only
reduces us to want, but when, if necessary, all indulgences must be
spontaneously rejected. Daniel indeed, as we saw yesterday, does not attach any
virtue to abstinence from one kind of food or another; and all we have hitherto
learnt has no other object than to teach him to guard against imminent danger,
to avoid passing over to the morals of a strange nation, and so to conduct
himself at Babylon as not to forget himself as a son of Abraham. But still it
was necessary to renounce the luxuries of the court. Although delicate viands
were provided, he rejected them of his own accord; since, as we have seen, it
would be deadly pollution, not in itself but in its consequences. Thus Moses,
when he fled from Egypt, passed into a new life far different from his former
one; for he had lived luxuriously and honorably in the king&#8217;s palace, as
if he had been the king&#8217;s grandson. But he lived sparingly in the Desert
afterwards, and obtained his support by very toilsome labor. He preferred, says
the Apostle, the cross of Christ to the riches of Egypt.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:26.) How so? Because he could not be esteemed an Egyptian and retain the
favor which had been promised to the sons of Abraham. It was a kind of
self-denial always to remain in the king&#8217;s palace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may take this test as a true proof of our
frugality and temperance, if we are able to satisfy the appetite when God
compels us to endure poverty and want; nay, if we can spurn the delicacies which
are at hand but tend to our destruction. For it would be very frivolous to
subsist entirely on pulse and water; as greater intemperance sometimes displays
itself in pulse than in the best and most dainty dishes. If any one in weak
health desires pulse and other such food which is injurious, he will surely be
condemned for intemperance. But if he feeds on nourishing diet, as they say, and
thus sustains himself, frugality will have its praise. If any one through desire
of water, and being too voracious, rejects wine, this as we well know would not
be praiseworthy. Hence we ought not to subsist on this kind of food to discover
the greatness of Daniel&#8217;s virtue. But we ought always to direct our minds
to the object of his design, namely, what he wished and what was in his power
&#8212; so to live under the sway of the king of Babylon, theft his whole
condition should be distinct from that of the nation at large, and never to
forget himself as an Israelite &#8212; and unless there had been this great
difference, Daniel would have been unable to sharpen himself and to shake off
his torpor, or to rouse himself from it. Daniel necessarily kept before his mind
some manifest and remarkable difference which separated him from the Chaldeans;
he desired pulse and water, through the injurious effects of good
living.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, this passage teaches us, although we should
meet with nothing lout the roots and leaves of trees, and even if the earth
herself should deny us the least blade of grass, yet God by his blessing can
make us healthy and active no less than those who abound in every comfort.
God&#8217;s liberality, however, is never to be despised when he nourishes us
with bread and wine and other diet; for Paul enumerates, among things worthy of
praise, his knowing how to bear both abundance and penury.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:12) When, therefore, God bountifully offers us both meat and drink, we may
soberly and frugally drink wine and cat savory food; but when he takes away from
us bread and water, so that we suffer from famine, we shall find his blessing
sufficient for us instead of all nutriment. For we see that Daniel and his
companions were ruddy and plump, and even remarkably robust by feeding on
nothing but pulse. How could this occur, unless the Lord, who nourished his
people in the Desert on manna alone, when other diet was deficient, even at this
day turns our food into manna, which would otherwise be injurious to us.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
16:4.) For if any one asks the medical profession, whether pulse and other
leguminous plants are wholesome? they will tell us they are very injurious,
since they know them to be so. But at the same time, when we have no choice of
viands and cannot obtain what would conduce most to our health, if we are
content with herbs and roots, the Lord, as I have said, can nourish us no less
than if he put before us a table well supplied with every dainty. Temperance
does not exist in the food itself, but in the palate &#8212; since we are
equally intemperate if pleasure entices us to gratify the appetite on inferior
food &#8212; so, again, we may remain perfectly<i> </i>temperate though feeding
on the best diet. We must form the same opinion of the properties of various
viands, which do not support us by their own inherent qualities, but by
God&#8217;s blessing, as he sees fit. We sometimes see the children of the rich
very emaciated, although they may receive the greatest attention. We see also
the children of the country people most beautiful in form, ruddy in countenance,
and healthy in condition; and yet they feed on any kind of food, and sometimes
upon what is injurious. But although they are deprived of tasty sauces, yet God
gives them his blessing, and their unripe fruit, pork, lard, and even herbs,
which seem most unwholesome, become more nourishing than if the people abounded
in every delicacy. This, therefore, must be remarked in the words of Daniel. It

<div><font face="Palatino">After Melsar saw it possible to gratify Daniel and

easily dealt with, and had no need of long disputation. For an intervening
obstacle often deters us from the pursuit of gain, and we forbear to seek what
we very much crave when it requires oppressive labor; but when our profit is at
hand, and we are freed from all danger, then every one naturally pursues it. We
see, then, what Daniel means in this verse, namely, when Melsar saw the
usefulness of this plan, and the possibility of his gaining by the diet assigned
by the king to the four youths, then he gave them pulse. But we must notice also
Daniel&#8217;s intention. He wishes to shew that we ought not to ascribe it to
the kindness of man, that he and his companions could preserve themselves pure
and unspotted. Why so? Because he never could have obtained anything from this
man Melsar, until he perceived it could be granted safely. Since, therefore,
Melsar consulted his own advantage and his private interest, and wished to
escape all risks and hazards, we easily gather that the benefit is not to be
ascribed entirely to him. Daniel and his companions obtained their wish, but
God&#8217;s providence rendered this man tractable, and governed the whole
event. Meanwhile, God openly shews how all the praise was due to himself,
purposely to exercise the gratitude of Daniel and his
associates.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet here shows what we have already touched
upon, how his authority was acquired for exercising the prophetic office with
greater advantage. He ought to be distinguished by fixed marks, that the Jews
first, and foreigners afterwards, might acknowledge him to be endued with the
prophetic spirit. But a portion of this favor was shared with his three
companions; yet he excelled them all, because God fitted him specially for his
office. Here the end is to be noticed, because it would be incorrect to say that
their reward was bestowed by God, because they lived both frugally and heavenly,
and spontaneously abstained from the delicacies of the palace; for God had quite
a different intention. For he wished, as I have already said, to extol Daniel,
to enable him to shew with advantage that Israel&#8217;s God is the only God;
and as he wished his companions to excel hereafter in political government, he
presented them also with some portion of his Spirit. But it is worth while to
set Daniel before our eyes; because, as I have said, before God appointed him
his Prophet, he wished to adorn him with his own <i>insignia, </i>to procure
confidence in his teaching. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to those four
boys</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or youths,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge and science were given
in all literature and wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Daniel was
endued with a very singular gift &#8212; he was to be an interpreter of dreams,
and an explainer of visions. Since Daniel here speaks of literature, without
doubt he simply means the liberal arts, and does not comprehend the magical arts
which flourished then and afterwards in Chaldea. We know that nothing was
sincere among unbelievers; and, on the other hand, I have previously admonished
you, that Daniel was not imbued with the superstitions in those days highly
esteemed in that nation. Through discontent with genuine science, they corrupted
the study of the stars; but Daniel and his associates were so brought up among
the Chaldeans, that they were not tinctured with those mixtures and corruptions
which ought always to be separated from true science. It would be absurd, then,
to attribute to God the approval of magical arts, which it is well known were
severely prohibited and condemned by the law itself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:10.) Although God abominates those magical superstitions as the works of the
devil, this does not prevent Daniel and his companions from being divinely
adorned with this gift, and being very well versed in all the literature of the
Chaldees. Hence this ought to be restricted to true and natural science. As it
respects Daniel, he says, he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>understood even, visions and
dreams </i></font><font face="Palatino">and we<i> </i>know how by these two
methods the Prophets were instructed in the will of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
12:6.) For while God there blames Aaron and Miriam, he affirms this to be his
usual method; as often as he wishes to manifest his designs to the Prophets, he
addresses them by visions and dreams. But Moses is treated out of the common
order of men, because he is addressed face to face, and mouth to mouth. God,
therefore, whenever he wished to make use of his Prophets, by either visions or
dreams, made known to them what he wished to be proclaimed to the people. When,
therefore, it is here said, &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daniel understood dreams and
visions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it has the sense of being
endued with the prophetic spirit. While his companions were superior masters and
teachers in all kinds of literature, he alone was a Prophet of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the object of this distinction,
when an acquaintance with visions and dreams was ascribed peculiarly to Daniel.
And here our previous assertion is fully confirmed, namely, that Daniel was
adorned with the fullest proofs of his mission, to enable him afterwards to
undertake the prophetic office with greater confidence, and acquire greater
attention to his teaching. God could, indeed, prepare the in a single moment,
and by striking terror and reverence into the minds of all, induce them to
embrace his teaching; but he wished to raise his servant by degrees, and to
bring him forth at the fitting time, and not too suddenly so that all might know
by marks impressed for many years how to distinguish him from the common order
of men. It afterwards follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now, Daniel relates how he and his companions were
brought forward at a fixed time, since three years was appointed by the king for
their instruction in all the science of the Chaldees and on that account the
prefect of the eunuchs produces them. He shews how he and his companions were
approved by the king, and were preferred to all the rest. By these words he
confirms my remark, that the Lord through a long interval had adorned them with
much favor, by rendering them conspicuous throughout the royal palace, while the
king himself acknowledged something uncommon in them. He, as well as the
courtiers, ought all to entertain such an opinion concerning these four youths,
as should express his sincere reverence for them. Then God wished to illustrate
his own glory, since without doubt the king was compelled to wonder how they
could surpass all the Chaldeans. This monarch had spared no expense on his own
people, and had not neglected to instruct them; but when he saw foreigners and
captives so superior, a spirit of rivalry would naturally spring up within him.
But, as I have already said, God wished to extol himself in the person of his
servants, so that the king might be compelled to acknowledge something divine in
these young men. Whence, then, was this superiority? for the Chaldeans boasted
of their wisdom from their birth, and esteemed other nations as barbarians. The
Jews, they would argue, are eminent beyond all others; verily the God whom they
worship distributes at his will talent and perception, since no one is naturally
gifted unless he receives this grace from heaven. God, therefore, must
necessarily be glorified, because Daniel and his comrades very far surpassed the
Chaldeans. Thus God usually causes his enemies to gaze with wonder on his power,
even when they most completely shun the light. For what did King Nebuchadnezzar
propose, but to extinguish the very remembrance of God? For he wished to have
about him Jews of noble family, who should oppose the very religion in which
they were born. But God frustrated this plan of the tyrant&#8217;s,<i> </i>and
took care to make his own name more illustrious. It now

continued to the first year of the reign of Cyrus in the discharge of the
prophetic office, although expositors do not openly say so; but I state openly
what they say obscurely. For since he afterwards set out into Media, they say
this change is denoted here. But we may understand the words better in the sense
of Daniel&#8217;s flourishing among the Chaldeans and Assyrians, and being
acknowledged as a celebrated Prophet; because he is known to have interpreted
King Belshszzar&#8217;s vision, on the very night on which he was slain. The
word here is simple and complete <i>&#8212; he was &#8212; </i>but<i> </i>it
depends on the succeeding ones, since he always obtained the confidence and
authority of a Prophet with the kings of Babylon. This, then, is the true sense.

been destined. God had already engraven, as we have said, distinct marks by
which Daniel might be acknowledged as a Prophet, but he wished really to prove
the effect of the grace which he had conferred upon Daniel. First of all, a
simple history is narrated, then Daniel proceeds to the interpretation of a
dream. This is the heading of the chapter.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel here says, &#8212; King Nebuchadnezzar dreamt
in the second year of his reign. This seems contrary to the opinion expressed in
the first chapter. For if Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem in the first year of
his reign, how could Daniel be already reckoned among the wise men and
astrologers, while he was as yet but a disciple? Thus it is easily gathered from
the context that he and his companions were already brought forward to minister
before the king. At the first glance these things are not in accordance, because
in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign Daniel and his companions were
delivered into training; and in the second he was in danger of death through
being in the number of the Magi. Some, as we have mentioned elsewhere, count the
second year from the capture and destruction of the city, for they say
Nebuchadnezzar was called king from the time at which he obtained the monarchy
in peace. Before he had cut off the City and Temple with the Nation, his
Monarchy could not be treated as united; hence they refer this to the capture of
the city, as I have said. But I rather incline to another conjecture as more
probable &#8212; that of his reigning with his father, and I have shewn that
when he besieged Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachim, he was sent by his father;
he next returned to Chaldea from the Egyptian expedition, through his wish to
repress revolts, if any one should dare to rebel. In this, therefore, there is
nothing out of place. Nebuchadnezzar reigned before the death of his father,
because he had already been united with him in the supreme power; then he
reigned alone, and the present narrative happened in the second year of his
reign. In this explanation there is nothing forced, and as the history agrees
with it, I adopt it as the best.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says &#8212; he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dreamt

narrated; but since many things were involved in this dream, the use of the
plural number is not surprising. It is now added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his, spirit was
contrite</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to shew us how uncommon the
dream really was. For Nebuchadnezzar did not then begin to dream, and was not
formerly so frightened every night as to send for all the Magi. Hence, in this
dream there was something extraordinary, which Daniel wished to express in these
words. The clause at the end of the verse which they usually translate <i>his
sleep was interrupted, </i>does not seem to have this sense; another explanation
which our brother D. Antonius gave you 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
suits it better; namely, &#8212; his sleep was upon him, meaning he began to
sleep again. The genuine and simple sense of the words seems to me<i> &#8212;
his spirit was confused, </i>that is, very great terror had seized on his mind.
He knew, indeed, the dream to be sent from heaven; next, being astonished, he
slept again, and became like a dead man, and when he considered the
interpretation of the dream, he became stupified and returned to sleep and
forgot the vision, as we shall afterwards see. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse more <i>clearly </i>proves what I have
already said that the dream caused the king to feel God to be its author. Though
this was not his first dream, yet the terror which God impressed on his mind,
compelled him to summon all the Magi, since he could not rest even by returning
to sleep. He felt as. it were a sing in his mind, since God did not suffer him
to rest, but wished him to be troubled until he received an interpretation of
the dream. Even profane writers very correctly consider dreams connected with
divine agency. They express various opinions, because they could not know
anything with perfect certainty; yet the persuasion was fixed in their minds
relative to some divine agency<i> </i>in dreams. It would be foolish and puerile
to extend this to all dreams; as we see some persons never passing by a single
one without a conjecture, and thus making themselves ridiculous. We know dreams
to arise from different causes; as, for instance, from our daily thoughts. If I
have meditated on anything during the daytime, something occurs to me at night
in a dream; because the mind is not completely buried in slumber, but retains
some seed of intelligence, although it be suffocated. Experience also
sufficiently teaches us how our daily thoughts recur during sleep, and hence the
various affections of the mind and body produce, many dreams. If any one retires
to bed in sorrow from either the death of a friend, or any loss, or through
suffering any injury or adversity, his dreams will partake of the previous
preparation of his mind. The body itself causes dreams, as we see in the case of
those who suffer from fever; when thirst prevails they imagine fountains,
burnings, and similar fancies. We perceive also how intemperance disturbs men in
their sleep; for drunken men start and dream in their sleep, as if in a state of
frenzy. As there are many natural causes for dreams, it would be quite out of
character to be seeking for divine agency or fixed reason in them all; and on
the other hand, it is sufficiently evident that some dreams are under divine
regulation. I omit events which have been related in ancient histories; but
surely the dream of Calphurnia, the wife of Julius Caesar, could not be
fictitious; because, before he was slain it was commonly reported, &#8220;Caesar
has been killed,&#8221; just as she dreamt it. The same may be said of the
physician of Augustus, who had ordered him to leave his tent the day of the
battle of Pharsalia, and yet there was no reason why the physician should order
him to be carried out of the tent on a litter, unless he had dreamt it to be
necessary. What was the nature of that necessity? why, such as could not be
conjectured by human skill, for the camp of Augustus was taken at that very
moment. I doubt not there are many fabulous accounts, but here I may choose what
I shall believe, and I do not yet touch on dreams which are mentioned in
God&#8217;s word, for I am merely speaking of what profane men were compelled to
think on this subject. Although Aristotle freely rejected all sense of
divination, through being prejudiced in the matter, and desiring to reduce the
nature of Deity within the scope of human ingenuity, and to comprehend all
things by his acuteness; yet he expresses this confession, that all dreams do
not happen rashly but that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">manti&gt;kh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is &#8220;divination,&#8221;<i> </i>is the source of some of them. He
disputes, indeed, whether they belong to the intellectual or sensitive portion
of the mind, and concludes they belong to the latter, as far as it is
imaginative. Afterwards, when inquiring whether they are causes or anything of
that kind, he is disposed to view them only as symptoms or accidents
fortuitously contingent. Meanwhile, he will not admit dreams to be sent from
heaven; and adds as his reason, that many stupid men dream, and manifest the
same reason in them as the wisest. He notices next the brute creation, some of
which, as elephants, dream. As the brutes dream, and wise men more seldom than
the rudest idiots, Aristotle does not think it probable that dreams are divinely
inspired. He denies, therefore, that they are sent from God, or divine, but
asserts that they spring from the <i>Daimones;</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that is, he fancies them to be something between the natures of the Deity
and the Daimones. We know the sense in which philosophers use that word, which,
in Scripture, has usually a bad sense. He says that dreams were occasioned by
those aerial inspirations, but are not from God.; because, he says, man&#8217;s
nature is not divine, but inferior; and yet more than earthly, since it, is
angelic. Cicero discourses on this subject at great, length, in his first book
on Divination; although he refutes in the second all he had said, while he was a
disciple of the Academy. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f107</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For among other arguments in proof of the existence of deities, he adds dreams;
&#8212; if there is any divination in dreams, it follows that there is a. Deity
in heaven, for the mind of man cannot conceive of any dream without divine
inspiration. Cicero&#8217;s reasoning is valid; if there is divination in
dreams, then is there also a Deity. The distinction made by Macrobius is worthy
of notice; although he ignorantly confounds species and genera, through being a
person of imperfect judgment, who strung together in rhapsodies whatever he
read, without either discrimination or arrangement. This, then, should remain
fixed, &#8212; the opinion concerning the existence of some kind of divine
agency in dreams was not rashly implanted in the hearts of all men. Hence that
expression of Homer&#8217;s, a dream is from Jupiter. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He does not mean this generally and promiscuously of all dreams; but he takes
notice of it, when bringing the characters of his heroes before us, since they
were divinely admonished in their sleep.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to NEBUCHADNEZZAR&#8217;S DREAM. In this,
two points are worthy of remark. First, all remembrance of its subject was
entirely obliterated; and secondly, no interpretation was; found for it.
Sometimes the remembrance of a dream was not; lost while its interpretation was
unknown. But here Nebuchadnezzar was not only perplexed at the interpretation of
the dream, but even the vision itself had vanished, and thus his perplexity and
anxiety was doubled. As to the next point, there is no novelty in Daniel making
known the interpretation; for it sometimes, but rarely, happens that a person
dreams without a figure or enigma, and with great plainness, without any need of
conjurers &#8212; a name given to interpreters of dreams. This indeed happens
but seldom, since the usual plan of dreams is for God to speak by them
allegorically and obscurely. And this occurs in the case of the profane as well
as of the servants of God. When Joseph dreamt that he was adored by the sun and
moon,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
37:9,) he was ignorant of its meaning; when he dreamt of his sheaf being adored
by his brothers sheaves, he understood not its meaning, but related it simply to
his brothers. Hence God often speaks in enigmas by dreams, until the
interpretation is added. And such was Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s
dream.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>We </i>perceive, then, that God reveals his will
even to unbelievers, but not clearly; <i>because </i>seeing they do not see,

tongue.

remained perplexed and lay completely astonished. His dream would have been of
no use to him, unless, as we shall see, Daniel had been presented to him as its
interpreter. For God not only wished to hold the king in suspense, but he thus
blotted out the remembrance of the dream from his mind, to increase the power of
his sting. As mankind are accustomed to neglect the dreams which they do not
remember, God inwardly fastened such a sting in the mind of this unbeliever, as
I have already said, that he could not rest, but was always wakeful in the midst
of his dreaming, because God was drawing him to himself by secret chains. This
is the true reason why God denied him the immediate explanation of his dream,
and blotted out the remembrance of it from his mind, until he. should receive
both from Daniel. We will leave the rest till tomorrow.</font><br></div>

FIFTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We yesterday saw the Magi sent for by the
king&#8217;s edict, not only in order to explain his dream to him, but also to
narrate the dream itself which had slipt from his memory. But since four kinds
of Magi are used here, or at least three, and their description is added in the
fourth place, I shall briefly touch upon what seems to me their meaning.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymfrh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
Hartummim, </i>is usually explained by &#8220;soothsayers,&#8221; and afterwards
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yp&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Assaphim, </i>they think, means &#8220;<i>physicians.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>I am
unwilling to contend against the first interpretation; but I see no reason for
the second. They interpret it as &#8220;<i>physicians,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>because
they judge of men&#8217;s health by feeling the pulse, but having no better
reason than this, I adopt the opinion that it refers to astrologers. In the
third place,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yp&ccedil;km</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Mecasphim, </i>is used, meaning &#8220;<i>sorcerers,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>though
some change the signification, and say it; means
&#8220;<i>star-gazers,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>who indicate future events and
<i>predict </i>unknown ones from the position of the stars. I have nothing to
bring forward more probable than this, <i>except </i>the uncertainty of what the
Hebrews meant by the word for <i>since </i>the matter itself is so buried in
oblivion, who can distinguish between words which belong to the profession of an
unknown art?
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yd&ccedil;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Casdim, </i>is doubtless put for a race, for it is the name of a nation, yet
on account of its excellence, the Magi appropriated it to themselves, as. if the
nobility and <i>excellence </i>of the whole nation was in their power; and this
name is known to be in common use in Greece and Italy. All who professed their
ability to predict future or hidden events from the stars or other conjectures,
were called <i>Chaldees. </i>With respect to the three other words, I do not
doubt their honorable meaning, and for this red, son they called themselves
Mathematicians, as if there were no <i>science </i>in the world except with
them. Besides, although their principles were good, they were certainly stuffed
with many superstitions, for they were soothsayers and diviners, and we know
them to have given especial attention to augury. Although they were highly
esteemed by their fellow-countymen, yet they are condemned by God&#8217;s law,
for all their pretense to science was complete imposture. They are generally
called Magi, and also Chaldeans, as shortly afterwards, when Daniel will repeat
what they have spoken before the king, he will not enumerate those three
species, but will simply call them Chaldees. It is surprising that Daniel and
his companions were not called among them, for he ought to have been called
among the first, since the king, as we have, said, found these four to be ten
times better than all the Magi and Diviners throughout his kingdom! Since their
dexterity was not unknown to the king, why does he pass them completely by,
while the other Magi are at hand and are called in to a case so arduous? Very
probably the king omitted them because he trusted more in the natives; or
suspected the captives, and was unwilling to entrust them with his secrets, as
he had not yet sufficiently tried their fidelity and constancy. This might have
been the reason, but it is better for us to consider the intention of the
Almighty, for I have no doubt that this forgetfulness on the part of the king
occurred by God&#8217;s providence, as he was unwilling from the first to mingle
his servant Daniel and the rest with the Magi and Soothsayers. This accounts for
Daniel not being sent for with the rest; whence, as we shall see, his divination
would afterwards <i>become more </i>illustrious. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel relates first the great confidence of the
Chaldeans, since they dared to promise the interpretation of a dream as yet
unknown to them. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king says he
was troubled through desire to understand the
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which he signifies that a kind
of riddle was divinely set, before him. He confesses his ignorance, while the
importance of the object may be gathered from his words. Since, then, the king
testifies his desire to inquire concerning a matter obscure and profound, and
exceeding his comprehension, and since he clearly expresses himself to be
contrite in spirit, some kind of fear and anxiety ought to have touched these
Chaldeans; yet they securely promise to offer the very best interpretation of
the dream as soon as they understood it. When they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O king live for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is not. a simple and unmeaning
prayer, but they rather order the king to be cheerful and in good spirits, as
they are able to remove all care and anxiety from his mind, because the
explanation of the dream was at hand. We know how liberal in words those
impostors always were; according to the language of an ancient poet, they
enriched the ears and emptied the purses of others. And truly those who
curiously court the breeze with their ears deserve to feed upon it, and to be
taken in by such deceits. And all ages have proved that nothing exceeds the
confidence of astrologers, who are not content with true science, but divine
every one&#8217;s life and death, and conjecture all events, and profess to know
everything.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must hold generally that the art of conjecturing
from dreams is rash and foolish; there is, indeed, a certain fixed
interpretation of dreams, as we said yesterday, yet as we shall afterwards see,
this ought not to be ascribed to a sure science, but to God&#8217;s singular
gift. As, therefore, a prophet will not gather what he has to say from fixed
reasonings, but will explain God&#8217;s oracles, so also he who will interpret
dreams correctly, will not follow certain disthief rules; but if God has
explained the meaning of the dream, he will then undertake the office of
interpreting it according to his endowment with this gift. Properly speaking,
these two flyings are opposite to each other and do not mutually agree, general
and perpetual science, and special revelation. Since God claims this power of
opening by means of a dream, what he has engraven on the minds of men, hence art
and science cannot. obtain it, but a revelation from the spirit must be waited
for. When the Chaldeans thus boldly promise to become good interpreters of the
dream, they not only betray their rashness, but become mere impostors, who
pretend to be proficients in a science of which they know nothing, as if they
could predict by their conjectures the meaning of the king&#8217;s dream. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the king requires from the Chaldeans more than
they professed to afford him; for although their boasting, as we have said, was
foolish in promising to interpret any dream, yet they never claimed the power of
narrating to any one his dreams. The king, therefore, seems to me to act
unjustly in not regarding what they had hitherto professed, and the limits of
their art and science, if indeed they had any science! When he says &#8212; the
matter or speech had departed from him, the words admit of a twofold sense, for

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has flowed
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but since the same form of
expression will be shortly repeated when it seems to be, used of the dream,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:8,) this explanation is suitable enough, as the king says his dream had
vanished so I leave the point undecided. It is worth while noticing again what
we said yesterday, that terror was so fastened upon the king as to deprive him
of rest, and yet he was not so instructed that the least taste of the revelation
remained; just as if an ox, stunned by a severe blow, should toss himself about,
and roll over and over. Such is the madness of this wretched king, because God
harasses him with dreadful torments; all the while the remembrance of the dream
is altogether obliterated from his mind. Hence he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confesses &#8212; his dream had
escaped him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and although the Magi had
prescribed the limits of their science, yet through their boasting themselves to
be interpreters of the gods, he did not hesitate to exact of them what they had
never professed. This is the just reward of arrogance, when men puffed up with a
perverse confidence assume before others more than they ought, and forgetful of
all modesty wish to be esteemed angelic spirits. Without the slightest doubt God
wished to make a laughingstock of this foolish boasting which was conspicuous
among the Chaldees, when the king sharply demanded of them to relate his dream,
as well as to offer an exposition of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds threats, clearly tyrannical;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unless they expound the dream
their life is in danger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No common
punishment is threatened, but he says they should become
&#8220;<i>pieces</i>&#8221;<i> &#8212; if we </i>take the meaning of the word to
signify pieces. If we think it means &#8220;blood<i>,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>the
sense will be the same. This wrath of the king is clearly furious, nay,
Nebuchadnezzar in this. respect surpassed all the cruelty of wild beasts. What
fault could be imputed to the Chaldeans if they did not know the king&#8217;s
dream? &#8212; surely, they had never professed this, as we shall afterwards
see; and no, king had ever demanded what was beyond the faculty of man. We
perceive how the long manifested a brutal rage when he denounced death and every
cruel torture on the Magi and sorcerers. Tyrants, indeed, often give the reins
to their lust, and think all things lawful to themselves; whence, also, these
words of the tragedian, Whatever he wishes is lawful. And Sophocles says, with
evident truth, that any one entering a tyrant&#8217;s threshold must cast away
his liberty; but if we were to collect all examples, we should <i>scarcely
</i>find one like this. It follows, then, that the king&#8217;s mind was
impelled by diabolic fury, urging him to punish the Chaldees who, with respect
to him, were innocent enough. We know them to have been impostors, and the world
to have been deluded by their impositions, which rendered them deserving of
death, since by the precepts of the law it was a capital crime for any one to
pretend to the power of prophecy by magic arts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;032006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
20:6.) But, as far as concerned the king, they could not be charged with any
crime. Why, then, did he threaten them with death? because the Lord wished to
shew the miracle which we shall afterwards see. For if the king had suffered the
Chaldeans to depart, he could have buried directly that anxiety which tortured
and excruciated his mind. The subject, too, had been less noticed by the people;
hence God tortured the king&#8217;s mind, till he rushed headlong in his fury,
as we have said. Thus, this atrocious and cruel denunciation ought to have
aroused all men; for there is no doubt that the greatest and the least trembled
together when they heard of such vehemence in the monarch&#8217;s wrath. This,
therefore, is the complete sense, and we must mark the object of God&#8217;s
providence in thus allowing the king&#8217;s anger to burn without restraint.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the king, on the other hand, desires to entice
them by the hope of gain, to apply themselves to narrate his dream. He had
already attempted to strike them with horror, that even if they are unwilling he
may wrest the narration of the dream from them, as. well as its interpretation.
Meanwhile, if they could be induced by flattery, he tries this argument upon
them; for he promises </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a gift, and
reward, and honor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, he promises
a large remuneration if they narrated his dream, and were faithful interpreters.
Hence we gather, what all history declares, that the Magi made a gain of their
predictions and guesses. The wise men of the Indies, being frugal and austere in
their manner of living, were not wholly devoted to gain; for they are known to
have lived without any need of either money, or furniture, or anything else.
They were content with roots, and had no need of clothing, slept upon the
ground, and were thus free from avarice. But the Chaldeans, we know, ran hither
and thither to obtain money from the simple and credulous. Hence the king here
speaks according to custom when he promises a large reward. We must remark here,
how the Chaldeans scattered their prophecies for the sake of gain; and when
knowledge is rendered saleable, it is sure to be adulterated with many faults.
As when Paul speaks of corruptors of the Gospel, he says, &#8212; they
trafficked in it, (2 Corinthians 2:7,) because when a profit is made, as we have
previously said, even honorable teachers must necessarily degenerate and pervert
all sincerity by their lying. For where avarice reigns, there is flattery,
servile obsequiousness, and cunning of all kinds, while truth is utterly
extinguished. Whence it is not surprising if the Chaldeans were so inclined to
deceit, as it became natural to them through the pursuit of gain and the lust
for wealth. Some honest teachers may receive support from the public treasury;
but, as we have said, when any one is drawn aside by lucre, he must necessarily
pervert and deprave all purity of doctrine. And from this passage we gather,
further, the anxiety of the king, as he had no wish to spare expense, if by this
means he could click the interpretation of his dream from the Chaldeans; all the
while he is furiously angry with them, because he does not obtain what the
offered reward ought to procure. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the excuse of the Magi is narrated. They state
the truth that their art only enabled them to discover the interpretation of a
dream; but the king wished to know the dream itself. Whence he appears again to
have been seized with prodigious fury and became quite implacable. Kings
sometimes grow warm, but are appeased by a single admonition, and hence this
sentiment is very true, &#8212; anger is assuaged by mild language. But since
the fair reply of the Magi did not mitigate the king&#8217;s wrath, he was quite
hurried away by diabolical vehemence. And all this, as I have said, was governed
by God&#8217;s secret counsel, that Daniel&#8217;s explanation might be more
noticed. They next ask the king &#8212; to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>relate his
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then they promise as before
to interpret it directly. And even this was too great a boast, as we have said,
and they ought to have corrected their own conceit and foolish boasting when in
such a difficulty. But since they persist in that foolish and fallacious
self-conceit, it shews us how they were blinded by the devil, just as those who
have become entangled by superstitious deceptions confidently defend their own
madness. Such an example we have in the Magi, who always claimed the power of
interpreting dreams.</font><br></div>

you are aware that the matter has gone from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or the word has been pronounced, if
we adopt the former sense. The king here accuses them of more disgraceful
cunning, since the Magi have nothing to offer, and so desire to escape as soon
as they know that the king has lost all remembrance of his dream. It is just as
if he had said &#8212; You promised me to be sure interpreters of my dream, but
this is false; for if I could narrate the dream, it would be easy to prove your
arrogance, since ye cannot explain that enigma; but as lye know I have forgotten
my dream, for that reason ye ask me to relate it; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this is only to gain
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he; thus ye manage to conceal
your ignorance and retain your credit for knowledge. But if my dream still
remained in my memory I should soon detect your ignorance, for we cannot perform
your boasting. We see, therefore, how the king here loads the Magi with a new
crime, because they were impostors who deluded the people with false boastings;
and hence he shews them worthy of death, unless they relate his dream. The
argument indeed is utterly vicious; but it is not surprising when tyrants appear
in the true colors of their cruelty. Meanwhile we must remember what I have
said. &#8212; the Magi deserved this reproof, for they were puffed up with
vanity and made false promises, through conjecturing the future from dreams,
auguries, and the like. But in the king&#8217;s case, nothing was more unjust.
than to invent such a crime against the Magi, since if they deceived others it
arose from being self-deceived. They were blinded and fascinated by the foolish
persuasion of their own wisdom, and had no intention of deceiving the king; for
they thought something might immediately occur which would free his mind from
all anxiety. But the king always pursued the blindest impulse of his rage.
Meanwhile we must notice the origin of this feeling, &#8212; he was divinely
tormented, and could not rest a single moment till he obtained an explanation of
his dream. He next adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye do
not explain my dream, this sentence alone remains for
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he; that is, it is already
decreed concerning you all, I shall not inquire particularly which of you is in
fault and which wishes to deceive me; but I will utterly cut off all the tribe
of the Magi, and no one shall escape punishment, unless ye explain to me both
the dream and its interpretation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have prepared a fallacious and
corrupt speech to relate here before me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as your excuse. Again, the king charges them with fraud and malice, of which
they were not guilty; as if he had said, they purposely sought specious
pretenses for practicing deceit. But he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, a lying
speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or fallacious
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
corrupt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, yours is a stale
excuse, as we commonly say, and I loathe it. If there were any colorable pretext
I might admit what. ye say, but I see in your words nothing but fallacies, and
those too which savor of corruption. Now, therefore, we observe the king not
only angry because the Magi cannot relate his dream, but charging it against
them, as a greater crime, that they brought a stale excuse and wished purposely
to deceive him. He next adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>,
tell me the dream and then I shall know it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>or then I shall know that ye can faithfully interpret, its meaning. Here the
king takes up another argument to convict the Magi of cunning. Ye boast, indeed,
that you have no difficulty in interpreting the dream. How can ye be confident
of this, for the dream itself is still unknown to you? If I had told it you, ye
might then say whether ye could explain it or not; but when I now ask you about
the dream of which both you and I are ignorant, ye say, when have related the
dream, the rest is in your power; I therefore shall prove you to be good and
true interpreters of dreams if ye can tell me mine, since the one thing depends
on the other, and ye are too rash in presuming upon what is not yet discovered.
Since, therefore, ye burst forth so hastily, and wish to persuade me that ye are
sure of the interpretation, you are evidently quite deceived in this respect;
and your rashness and fraud are herein detected, because ye are clearly
deceiving me. This is the substance &#8212; the rest to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">They add, that the object of the king&#8217;s inquiry
surpassed the power of human ingenuity. There is no doubt that they were slow to
confess this, because, as we said before, they had acquired the fame of such
great wisdom, that the common people thought nothing unknown to them or
<i>concealed </i>from them. And most willingly would they have escaped the dire
necessity of confessing their ignorance in this respect, but in their extremity
they were compelled to resort to this subterfuge. There may be a question why
they thought the matter about which the king inquired was precious; for as they
were ignorant of the king&#8217;s dream, how could they ascertain its value? But
it is not surprising that men, under the influence of extreme anxiety and fear,
should utter anything without judgment. <i>They </i>say, therefore, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this matter is
precious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>thus they mingle flattery with
their excuses to mitigate the king&#8217;s anger, hoping to escape the unjust
death which was at hand. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
matter of which the king inquires is
precious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and yet it would probably be
said, since <i>the, </i>matter was uncommon, that the dream was divinely sent to
the king, and was afterwards suddenly buried in oblivion. There certainly was
some mystery here, and hence the Chaldeans very reasonably considered the whole
subject to surpass in magnitude the common measure of human ability; therefore
they add, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there cannot be
any other interpreters than gods or angels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Some refer this to angels, but we know the Magi to have worshipped a
multitude of gods. Hence it is more simple to explain this of the crowd of
deities which they imagined. They had, indeed, lesser gods; for among all
nations a persuasion has existed concerning a supreme God who reigns alone.
Afterwards they imagined inferior deities, and each fabricated a god for himself
according to his taste. hence they are called &#8220;gods,&#8221; according to
common opinion and usage, although they ought rather to be denoted genie or
demons of the air. For we know that all unbelievers were imbued with this
opinion concerning the existence of intermediate deities. The Apostles contended
strongly against this ancient error, and we know the books of Plato 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f125</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be full of the doctrine that demons or genii act as mediators between man and
the Heavenly Deity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may, then, suitably understand these words that
the Chaldeans thought angels the only interpreters; not because they imagined
angels as the Scriptures speak of them clearly and sincerely, but the Platonic
doctrine flourished among them, and also the superstition about the genii who
dwell in heaven, and hold familiar intercourse with the supreme God. Since men
are clothed in flesh, they cannot so raise themselves towards heaven as to
perceive all secrets. Whence it follows, that the king acted unjustly in
requiring them to discharge a duty either angelic or divine. This excuse was
indeed probable, but the king&#8217;s ears were deaf because he was carried away
by his passions, and God also spurred him on by furies, which allowed him no
rest. Hence this savage conduct which Daniel records.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The former denunciation was horrible, but now
Nebuchadnezzar proceeds beyond it; for he not merely threatens the Chaldeans
with death, but commands it to be inflicted. Such an example is scarcely to be
found in history; but the cause of his wrath must be noticed, since God wished
his servant Daniel to be brought forward and to be observed by all men. This was
the preparation by which it became generally evident that the wise men of
Babylon were proved vain, through promising more than they could perform; even
if they had been endowed with the greatest wisdom, they would still have been
destitute of that gift of revelation which was conferred upon Daniel. Hence it
happened that the king denounced death against them all by his edict; for he
might then perhaps acknowledge what he had never perceived before, namely, that
their boasting was nothing but vanity, and their arts full of superstitions. For
when superstition fails of success, madness immediately succeeds, and when those
who are thought and spoken of as remarkably devout, perceive their fictitious
worship to be of no avail, then they burst forth into the madness which I have
mentioned, and curse their idols, and detest what they had hitherto followed. So
it occurred here, when Nebuchadnezzar suspected imposture in so serious a
matter, and no previous suspicion of it had entered his mind; but now, when he
sees through the deception, in so perplexing a case, and hi such great anxiety,
when left destitute of the advice of those from whom he hoped all things, then
he is a hundredfold more infuriated than if he had been previously in a state of
perfect calmness. It afterwards follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It appears from these words that some of the wise men
had been slain, for Daniel at first is not required for slaughter; but when the
Magi and Chaldeans were promiscuously dragged out for punishment, Daniel and his
companions were in the same danger. And this is clearly expressed thus &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>widen the edict had gone
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, was published, according
to the Latin phrase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the wise
mere were slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then Daniel was also
sought for; because the king would never suffer his decree to be despised after
it had once been published; for if he had publicly commanded this to be done,
and no execution had been added, would not this have been ridiculous? Hence,
very probably, the slaughter of the Magi and Chaldeans was extensive. Although
the king had no lawful reason for this conduct, yet they deserved their
punishment; for, as we said yesterday, they deserved to be exterminated from the
world, and the pest must be removed if it could possibly be accomplished. If
Nebuchadnezzar had been like David, or Hezekiah, or Josiah, he might most justly
have destroyed them all, and have purged the land from such defilements; but as
he was only carried away by the fervor of his wrath, he was himself in fault.
Meanwhile, God justly punishes the Chaldeans, and this admonition ought to
profit the whole people. They were hardened in their error, and were doubtless
rendered more excuseless by being blinded against such a judgment of God.
Because Daniel was condemned to death, though he had not been called by the
king, the injustice of the edicts of those kings who do not inquire into the
causes of which they are judges, becomes more manifest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nebuchadnezzar had often heard of Daniel, and had
been compelled to admire the dexterity of his genius, and the singular gift of
his wisdom. <i>How </i>comes it, then, that he passed him by when he had need of
his singular skill? Although the king anxiously inquires concerning the dream,
yet we observe he does not act seriously; since it would doubtless have come
into his mind, &#8220;Behold, thou hadst formerly beheld in the captives of
Judah the incredible gift of celestial wisdom &#8212; -then, in the first place,
send for them!&#8221; Here the king&#8217;s sloth is detected because he did not
send for Daniel among the rest. We have stated this to be governed by the secret
providence of God, who was unwilling that his servant should mix with those
ministers of Satan, whose whole knowledge consisted in juggling and errors. We
now see how the king had neglected the gift of God, and had stifled the light
offered to him; but Daniel is next dragged to death. Therefore, I said, that
tyrants are, for this reason, very unjust, and exercise a cruel violence because
they will not undertake the labor and trouble of inquiry. Meanwhile we see that
God wonderfully snatches his own people from the jaws of death, as it happened
in Daniel&#8217;s case; for we may be surprised at Arioch sparing his life when
he slew the others who were natives. How can we account for Daniel meeting with
more humanity than the Chaldeans, though he was a foreigner and a captive?
Because his life was in the hand and keeping of God, who restrained both the
mind and the hand of the prefect from being immediately savage with him. But it
is said &#8212; Daniel </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inquired
concerning the counsel and the edict</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Some translate <i>prudently </i>and <i>cunningly </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">af[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gneta, </i>signifies &#8220;<i>prudence,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>just as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[f</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
tegem, </i>metaphorically is received for &#8220;<i>intelli</i>gence&#8221; when
it signifies taste. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f128</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But we shall afterwards find this latter word used for an edict, and because
this sense appears to suit better, I therefore adopt it, as Daniel had inquired
of the prefect the meaning of the edict and the king&#8217;s design. Arioch also
is called the Prince of Satellites. Some translate it of executioners, and
others of cooks, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jbf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tebech, </i>signifies &#8220;<i>to </i>slay,&#8221; but the noun deduced from
this means a cook. Thus Potiphar is called, to whom Joseph was sold.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
39:1.) It seems to me a. kind of absurdity to call him the prince of gaolers;
and if we say the prefect of cooks, it is equally unsuitable to his office of
being sent to slay the Chaldeans. I therefore prefer interpreting it more
mildly, supposing him to be the prefect of the guards; for, as I have said,
Potiphar is called </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yjbf
br</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, reb tebechi, </i>and here the pronunciation
only is changed. It follows:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daniel also had said, Whither does
the edict haste from before the king?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It
seems by these words, that Daniel obliquely blames the king&#8217;s anger and
ingratitude, because he did not inquire with sufficient diligence before he
rushed forward to that cruel punishment. Then he seems to mark his ingratitude,
since he is now undeservedly doomed to death without being sent for, though the
king might have known what was in him. As he refers to haste, I do not doubt his
expostulating with the king, since he was neither called for nor listened to,
and yet was to be slain with the rest, as if he were guilty of the same fault as
the Chaldeans. The conclusion is, &#8212; there was no reason for such haste,
since the king would probably find what he desired, if he inquired more
diligently. It is afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arioch explained the matter to
Daniel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Whence it appears that Daniel
was formerly ignorant of the whole matter; and hence we may conjecture the
amount of the terror which seized upon the pious man. For he had known nothing
about it, and was led to punishment suddenly and unexpectedly, as if he had been
guilty. Hence, it was necessary for him to be divinely strengthened, that he
might with composure seek the proper time from both the prefect and the king,
for relating the dream and adding its interpretation. Daniel&#8217;s power of
acting so composedly, arose from God&#8217;s singular gift, since terror would
otherwise have seized on his mind; for we are aware that in sudden events, we
become deprived of all plan, and lose our presence of mind. Since nothing of
this kind was perceived in Daniel, it becomes clear that his mind was governed
by God&#8217;s Spirit. It is afterwards added-</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse contains nothing new, unless we must
notice what is not expressed, namely, that the prefect was not entirely without
fear in giving Daniel an introduction to the king. For he knew the Icing to be
very angry, and himself under serious displeasure, for not immediately executing
the edict. But, as we have already said, God had taken Daniel into his
confidence, and so bends and tames the mind of the prefect, that he no longer
hesitates to introduce Daniel to the king. Another point is also gathered from
the context, namely, Daniel&#8217;s obtaining his request; for it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he returned
home</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>doubtless, because he obtained a
single day from the king with the view of satisfying his demands on the next
day. And yet it is surprising that this favor was granted, since the king wished
the dream narrated to him immediately. Although Daniel does not here relate the
reasons which he used with the king, yet most probably he confessed what we
shall afterwards observe in its own place, namely, that he was not endued with
sufficient intelligence to expound the dream, but hoping in God&#8217;s
kindness, he would return next day with a new revelation. Otherwise the king
would never have permitted this, if Daniel had petitioned doubtfully; or if he
had not borne witness to his hopes of some, secret revelation from God, he would
have been rejected immediately, and would have provoked still further the anger
of the king. The Hebrews very commonly mention afterwards, in the context,
whatever they omit in its proper place. So when he modestly confesses his
inability to satisfy the king, till he has received from the Lord a faithful

<div><font face="Palatino">We observe with what object and with what confidence
Daniel demanded an extension of time. His object was to implore God&#8217;s
grace. Confidence was also added, since he perceived a double punishment
awaiting him, if he disappointed the king; if he had returned the next day
without reply, the king would not have been content with an easy death, but
would have raged with cruelty against Daniel, in consequence of his deception.
Without the slightest doubt, Daniel expected what he obtained &#8212; namely,
that the king&#8217;s dream would be revealed to him. He therefore urges his
companions to implore unitedly mercy from God. Daniel had already obtained the
singular gift of being an interpreter of dreams, and as. we, have seen, he alone
was a Prophet. of God. God was accustomed to manifest his intentions to his
Prophets by dreams or visions,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
12:6,) and Daniel had obtained both. Since Misael, Hananiah, and Azariah were
united with him in prayer, we gather that they were not induced by ambition, to
desire anything for themselves; for if they had been rivals of Daniel, they
could not have prayed in concord with him. They did not pray about their own
private concerns, but only for the interpretation of the dream being made known
to Daniel. We observe, too, how sincerely they agree in their prayers, how all
pride and ambition is laid aside, and without any desire for their own
advantage. Besides, it is worthy of notice why they are said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to have desired mercy from
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Although they, do not hem come into
God&#8217;s presence as criminals, yet they hoped their request would be
graciously granted, and hence the word &#8220;mercy&#8221; is used. Whenever we
fly to God to bring assistance to our necessities, our eyes and all our senses
ought always to be turned towards his nlerey, for his more good will reconciles
him to us. When it is said, at. the close of the <i>verse, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they should not perish with
the rest of the wise men of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>some explain this, as if they had been anxious about the life of the Magi,
and wished to snatch them also from death. But although they wished all persons
to be safe, clearly enough they here separate themselves from the Magi and
Chaldeans; their conduct was far different. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here it may be gathered, that Daniel did not
vacillate nor pray with his companions through any doubt upon his mind. For that
sentence of James ought to <i>come </i>into our memory, namely, Those who
hesitate, and tremble, and pray to God with difference, are unworthy of being
heard. Let not such a one, says James, think he shall obtain anything from the
Lord, if he is driven about variously like the waves of the sea.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:6.) As God, therefore, shewed himself propitious to the prayers of Daniel, we
conclude him to have prayed with true faith, and to be clearly persuaded that
his life was in God&#8217;s hands; hence, also, he felt that God did not vainly
harass the mind of King Nebuchadnezzar, but was preparing some signal and
remarkable judgment for him. Because Daniel was imbued with this firm
persuasion, he exercises a sure confidence, and prays to God as if he had
already obtained his request. On the other hand, we perceive that God never
closes his ears when rightly and cordially invoked, as also it is said in the
Psalms,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19E518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
145:18,) He is near to all who pray to him in truth; for there cannot be truth
<i>when </i>faith is wanting; but as Daniel brought faith and sincerity to his
prayers, he was listened to, and the secret concerning the dream was made known
to him in a vision by night. I cannot now proceed any further.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">DANIEL here pursues his narrative, and thanks God
after King Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream had been made known to him, while he
relates the sense of the words which he had used.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May God&#8217;s name be
blessed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from age to
age</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We ought daily to wish for this;
for when we pray that God&#8217;s name may be hallowed, continuance is denoted
under this form of prayer. But Daniel here breaks forth into the praises of God
with greater vehemence, because he acknowledges his singular benefit in being
snatched away from death, together with his companions, beyond his expectation.
Whenever God confers any remarkable blessing on his servants, they are the more
stirred up to praise him, as David says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:3,) Thou hast put a new song into my mouth. And Isaiah also uses this form of
speech twice, (Isaiah 42:10,)as if God had given him material for a new and
unusual song, in dealing so wonderfully with his Church. So also, there is no
doubt that Daniel here wished to praise God in a remarkable manner, since he had
received a rare proof of his favor in being delivered from instant death.
Afterwards he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whose (or
since his) is the wisdom and the strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for the relative is here taken for the causal particle, and the sentence
ought to be so expressed; the additional particles may avail to strengthen the
expression, and be taken exclusively, as if he had said, &#8212; to God alone
ought the praise of wisdom and virtue to be ascribed. Without him, indeed, both
are sought in vain; but these graces do not seem to suit the present purpose;
for Daniel ought rather to celebrate God&#8217;s praises, through this vision
being opened, and this was enough to content him. But he may here speak of
God&#8217;s glory as well from his power as his wisdom; as, when, re Scripture
wishes to distinguish the true God from all fictions, it takes these two
principles &#8212; first, God governs all things by his own hand, and retains
them under his sway; and secondly, nothing is hid from him &#8212; and these
points cannot be separated when his majesty is to be proved. We see mankind
fabricating deities for themselves, and thus multiplying gods, and distributing
to <i>each </i>his own office; because they cannot rest in simple unity, when
God is treated of. Some fancy God retains but half his attributes; as. for
instance, the praters about bare foreknowledge. They admit nothing to be hidden
to God, and his knowledge of all things; and this they prove by the prophecies
which occur in the Scriptures. What they say is true; but they very much lessen
the glory of God; nay, they tear it to pieces by likening him to Apollo, whose
office it formerly was, hi the opinion of the heathen, to predict future events.
When they sought predictions of future events, they endued Apollo with the
virtue of making known to them future occurrences. Many at the present time
think God able to foresee all things, but suppose him either to dissemble or
purposely withdraw from the government of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, Their notion of God&#8217;s foreknowledge is
but a cold and idle speculation. Hence I said, they rob God of half his glory,
and, as far as they can, tear him to pieces. But Scripture. when it wishes to
assert what is peculiar to God, joins these two things inseparably; first, God
foresees all things, since nothing is hidden from his eyes; and next, he
appoints future events, and governs the world by his will, allowing nothing to
happen by chance or without his direction. Daniel here assumes this principle,
or rather unites the two, by asserting Israel&#8217;s God alone to deserve the
name, since both wisdom and strength are in his power. We must remember how God
is defrauded of his just praise. when we do not connect these two attributes
together &#8212; his universal foresight and his government of the world
allowing nothing to happen without his permission. But as it would be too cold
to assert that to God alone belongs wisdom and strength, unless his wisdom was
conspicuous, and his strength openly acknowledged, hence it follows immediately
afterwards &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel explains, in these words, what might have been
obscure; for he teaches God to be the true fountain of wisdom and virtue, while
he does not confine them to himself alone, but diffuses them through heaven and
earth. And we must mark this diligently; for when Paul affirms God alone to be
wise, this praise does not seem magnificent enough,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:27;) but when we think of God&#8217;s wisdom, and set before our eyes all
around and about us, then we feel more strongly the import of Paul&#8217;s
words, that God only is wise. God, therefore, as I have already stated, does not
keep His wisdom confined to himself, but makes it flow throughout the whole
world. The full sense of the verse is, &#8212; whatever wisdom and power exists
in the world, is a testimony to the Almighty&#8217;s. This is man&#8217;s
ingratitude; whenever they find anything worthy of praise in themselves or
others, they claim it directly as their own, and thus God&#8217;s glory is
diminished by the depravity of those who obtain their blessings from him. We are
here taught not to detract anything from God&#8217;s wisdom and power, since
wherever these qualities are conspicuous in the world, they ought rather to
reflect his glory. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning &#8212; God
places before our eyes, as in a glass, the proofs of his wisdom and power, when
the affairs of the world roll on, and mankind become powerful through wisdom,
and some are raised on high, and others fall to the ground. Experience teaches
us these events do not proceed from human skill, or through the equable course
of nature, while the loftiest kings are cast down and others elevated to the
highest posts of honor. Daniel, therefore, admonishes us not to seek in heaven
alone for God&#8217;s wisdom and power, since it is apparent to us on earth, and
proofs of it are daily presented to our observation. We now see how these two
verses are mutually united He had stated wisdom to belong exclusively to God; he
now shews that it is not hidden within him, but is made manifest to us; and we
may perceive by familiar experience, how all wisdom flows from him as its
exclusive fountain. We ought to feel the same concurring power
also.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is
he,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who changes times and portions of
time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know it to be ascribed to
fortune when the world passes through such uncertain changes that everything is
daily changing. hence the profane consider all things to be acted on by blind
impulse, and others affirm the human race to be a kind of sport to God, since
men are tossed about like balls. But, as I have already said, it is not
surprising to find men of a perverse and corrupt disposition thus perverting the
object of all God&#8217;s works. For our own practical improvement we should
consider what the Prophet is here teaching, how revolutions, as they are called,
are testimonies of God&#8217;s power, and point out with the finger to the truth
that the affairs of men are ruled by the Most High. For we must of necessity
adopt one or the other of these views, either that nature rules over human
events, or else fortune turns about in every direction, things which ought to
have an even course. As far as nature is concerned, its course would be even,
unless God by his singular counsel, as we have seen, thus changes the course of
the times. Yet those philosophers who assign the supreme authority to nature are
much sounder than others who place fortune in the highest rank. For if we admit
for a moment this latter opinion that fortune directs human affairs by a kind of
blind impulse, whence comes this fortune? If you ask them for a definition, what
answer will they make? They will surely be compelled to confess this, the word
&#8220;<i>fortune</i>&#8221;<i> </i>explains nothing. But neither God nor nature
will have any place in this vain and changeable government of the world, where
all things throw themselves into distinct forms without the least order or
connection. And if this be granted, truly the doctrine of Epicurus will be
received, because if God resigns the supreme government of the world, so that
all things are rashly mingled together, he is no longer God. But in this variety
he rather displays his hand in claiming for himself the empire over the world.
In so many changes, then, which meet us on every side, and by which the whole
face of things is renewed, we must remember that the Providence of God shines
forth; and things do not flow on in an even course, because then the peculiar
property of God might with some shew of reason be ascribed to nature. God, I
say, so changes empires, and times, and seasons, that we should learn to look up
to him. If the sun always rose and set at the same period, or at least certain
symmetrical changes took place yearly, without any casual change; if the days of
winter were not short, and those of summer not long, we might then discover the
same order of nature, and in this way God would be rejected from his own
dominion. But when the days of winter not only differ in length from those of
summer, but even spring does not always retain the same temperature, but is
sometimes stormy and snowy, and at others warm and genial; and since summers are
so various, no year being just like the former one; since the air is changed
every hour, and the heavens put on new appearances &#8212; when we discern all
these things, God rouses us up, that we may not grow torpid in our own
grossness, and erect nature into a deity, and de-wive him of his lawful honor,
and transfer to our own fancy what he claims for himself alone. If then, in
these ordinary events, we. are compelled to acknowledge God&#8217;s Providence,
if any change of greater moment arises, as when God transfers empires from one
hand to another, and all but transforms the whole world, ought we not then to be
the more affected, unless we are utterly stupid? Daniel, therefore, very
reasonably corrects the perverse opinion which commonly seizes upon the senses
of all, that the world either rolls on by chance, or that nature is the supreme
deity, when he asserts &#8212; God changes times and seasons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is evident from the context, that he is here
properly speaking of empires, since
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he appoints and removes
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We feel great difficulty in
believing kings placed upon their thrones by a divine power, and afterwards
deposed again, since we naturally fancy that they acquire their power by their
own talents, or by hereditary right, or by fortuitous accident Meanwhile all
thought of God is excluded, when the industrly, or valor, or success, or any
other quality of man is extolled! Hence it is said in the Psalms, neither from
the east nor the west, but God alone is the judge.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
75:6, 7.) The Prophet there derides the discourses of those who call themselves
Wise, and who gather up reasons from all sides to shew how power is assigned to
man, by either his own counsel and valor, or by good fortune or other human and
inferior instruments. Look round, says he, wherever you please, from the rising
to the setting of the sun, and you will find no reason why one man becomes lord
of his fellow-creatures rather than another. God alone is the judge; that is,
the government must remain entirely with the one God. So also in this passage,
the Lord is said to appoint kings, and to raise them from the rest of mankind as
he pleases. As this argument is a most important one, it might be treated more
copiously; but since the same opportunity will occur in other passages, I
comment but shortly on the contents of this verse; for we shall often have to
treat of the state of kingdoms and of their ruin and changes. I am therefore
unwilling to add anything more at present, as it is sufficient to explain
Daniel&#8217;s intention thus briefly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, &#8212; he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gives wisdom to the wise, and
knowledge to those who are endued ,with it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In this second clause, the Prophet confirms what we have already said, that
God&#8217;s wisdom is not shrouded in darkness, but is manifested to us, as he
daily gives us sure and remarkable proofs of this. Meanwhile he here corrects
the ingratitude of men who assume to themselves the praise of their own
excellencies which spring from God, and thus become almost sacrilegious. Daniel,
therefore, asserts that men have no wisdom but what springs from God. Men are,
indeed, clever and intelligent., but the question arises, whether it springs
from themselves? He also shews us how mankind are to be blamed in claiming
anything as their own, since they have really nothing belonging to them, however
they may be wrapt, in admiration of themselves. Who then will boast of becoming
wise by his own innate strength? Has he originated the intellect with which he
is endowed? Because God is the sole author of wisdom and knowledge, the gifts by
which he has adorned men ought not to obscure his glory, but rather to
illustrate it. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same sentiment, and confirms it,
&#8212; that all mortals receive from God&#8217;s Spirit whatever intelligence
and light they enjoy; but he proceeds a step further in this verse than in the
last. He had said generally, that, men receive wisdom and understanding by
God&#8217;s good will; but here he speaks specially; for when a man&#8217;s
understanding is rare and unusual, there God&#8217;s gift shines forth more
clearly; as if he had. said &#8212; God not only distributes to every one
according to the measure of his own liberality, whatever acuteness and ingenuity
they possess, but he adorns some with such intelligence that they appear as his
interpreters. He speaks, therefore, here, specially of the gift of prophecy; as
if he had said, God&#8217;s goodness is conspicuous, not only in the ordinary
prudence of mankind, for no one is so made as to be unable to discover between
justice and injustice, and to form some plan for regulating his life; but in
Prophets there is something extraordinary, which renders God&#8217;s wisdom more
surprising. Whence, then, do Prophets obtain the power of prophesying concerning
hidden events, and penetrating above the heavens, and surpassing all bounds? Is
this common to all men? Surely this far exceeds the ordinary ability of man,

to God all things are clear; he has no occasion to hesitate, or inquire, and has
no need to be hindered through ignorance. Now, we fully understand the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this passage to attribute to God
that praise which the greater part of the world claims to itself with
sacrilegious audacity, though God shews it to belong to himself. Whatever
understanding or judgment we may possess, we should remember that it was first
received from God. Hence, also, if we have but a small portion of common sense,
we are still equally indebted to God, for we should be like stocks or stones
unless by his secret instinct he endued us with understanding. But if any one
excels others, and obtains the admiration of all men, he ought still modestly to
submit himself to God, and acknowledge himself the more bound to him, because he
has received more than others. For who knows himself fully but God? The more,
therefore, he excels in understanding, the more he will lay aside all claims of
his own, and extol the beneficence of God. Thirdly, let, us learn that the
understanding of spiritual things is a rare and singular gift of the Holy
Spirit, in which God&#8217;s power shines forth conspicuously. Let us guard
against that diabolical pride by which we see almost; the whole world to be
swollen and intoxicated. And in this respect we should chiefly glorify God, as
he has not, only adorned us with ordinary foresight, enabling us to discern
between good and evil, but raised us above the ordinary level of human nature,
and so enlightened us that we can understand things far exceeding our
capacities. When Daniel pronounces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light to be with
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we must supply a tacit antithesis;
since he indicates, as I have already said, that men are surrounded by thick
darkness, and grope about in obscurity. The habitation of men is here obliquely
contrasted with the sanctuary of God; as if the Prophet had said, there is no
pure and perfect light but in God alone. Hence, when we remain in our natural
state, we must necessarily wander in darkness, or at least be obscured by many
clouds. These words naturally lead us not to rest satisfied in our own position,
but to seek from God that light in which he only dwells. Meanwhile, we should
remember how God dwells in light unapproachable,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16,) unless he deigns to stretch forth his hand to us. Hence, if we
desire to become partakers of this divine light, let us be, on our guard against
audacity, and mindful of our ignorance; let; us seek God&#8217;s illumination.
Thus his light will not be inaccessible to us, when, by his Spirit, he shall
conduct us beyond the skies. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel turns his discourse to God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I confess to
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O God of my fathers, and praise
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he more openly distinguishes
the God of the Israelites from all the fictions of the nations. Nor does he use
this epithet in vain, when he praises the God of his fathers; for he wishes to
reduce to nothing all the fabrications of the Gentiles concerning a multitude of
deities. Daniel rejects this as a vain and foolish thing, and shews how the God
of Israel alone is worthy of praise. But he does not found the glory of God on
the authority of their fathers, as the Papists, when they wish to ascribe the
supreme power to either George, or Catharine, or any others, count up the number
of ages during which the error has prevailed. Thus they wish whatever the
consent of mankind has approved to be received as oracular. But if religion
depended on the common consent of mankind, where would be its stability? We know
nothing vainer than the minds of men. If man is weighed, says the Prophet, with
vanity in a balance, vanity itself will preponderate.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;196209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
62:9.) Nothing, therefore, is more foolish than this principle of this king,
&#8212; what has prevailed by the consent of many ages must be religiously true.
But here Daniel partially commends the God of their fathers, as their fathers
were the sorts of God. For that sacred adoption prevailed among the Jews, by
which God chose Abraham and his whole family for himself. Daniel, therefore,
here does not extol the persons of men, as if they either could or ought to add
anything they pleased to God; but this is the reason why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of Israel is the God of
their fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>since he was of that race
which the Almighty had adopted. On the whole, he so opposes the God of Israel to
all the idols of the Gentiles, that the mark of separation is in the covenant
itself, and in the celestial doctrine by which he revealed himself to the sacred
fathers. For while the Gentiles have no certain vision, and follow only their
own dreams, Daniel here deservedly sets forth
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of their
fathers.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because thou hast given me wisdom
and strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As far as relates to
wisdom, the reason is. clear enough why Daniel thanks God, since he had
obtained, as he soon afterwards says, the revelation of the dream. He had also
formerly been endued with the prophetic spirit and with visions. as he related
in the first chapter, (Daniel 1:17.) We may here, inquire what he means by
<i>strength? </i>He was not remarkable for his honor among men, nor was he ever
a commander in military affairs, and he had no superior gift of magnificent
power to cause him to return thanks to God. But Daniel regards this as the
principal point, that the God. of Israel was then acknowledged as the true and
only God; because, whatever wisdom and virtue exists in the world, it flows from
him as its only source. For this reason he speaks of himself as well as of all
others, as if he had said &#8212; If I have any strength or understanding, I
ascribe it all to thee; it is thine entirely. And, truly, though Daniel was
neither a king nor a prefect, yet that unconquered greatness of mind which we
have seen was not to be esteemed as without value. Hence he very properly
acknowledges something of this kind to have been conferred upon him by heaven.
Lastly, his intention is to debase himself and to attribute to God his own; but
he speaks concisely, as we have said, since under the phrases
&#8220;<i>power</i>&#8221;<i> </i>and &#8220;<i>wisdom</i>&#8221;<i> </i>he had
previously embraced the proof of his divinity. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast revealed to me what we
demanded of thee; thou hast made known to us the king&#8217;s
inquiry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There seems here a slight
discrepancy, as he praises God for granting him a revelation of the dream, and
then unites others to himself. Yet the revelation was not common to them, but
peculiar to himself. The solution is easy; for he first expresses that this was
given to himself specially, that he might know the king&#8217;s dream and
understand its interpretation. When he has confessed this, he extends the
benefit to his companions, and deservedly so; because though they did not yet
understand what God had conferred upon Daniel, yet he had obtained this in their
favor,-they were all snatched from death, and all their prayers attended to. And
this availed very much for the confirmation of their faith as it assured them
they had not prayed in vain. For we said that. there was no ambition in their
prayers, as if any one desired any peculiar gift by which he might acquire honor
and estimation for himself in the world. Nothing of the kind. It was enough for
them to shew forth God&#8217;s name among unbelievers; because by his kindness,
they had been delivered from death. Hence Daniel very properly says, the
king&#8217;s dream was made known to him with its interpretation; and this he
will afterwards transfer to his companions.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, since we have so
many testimonies to thy glory daily before our eyes, though we seem so blind as
to shut out all the light by our ingratitude; grant, I pray, that we may at
length learn to open our eyes; yea, do thou open them by thy Spirit. May we
reflect on the number, magnitude, and importance of thy benefits towards us; and
while thou dost set before us the proof of thy eternal divinity, grant that we
may become proficient in this school of piety. May we learn to ascribe to thee
the praise of all. virtues, till nothing remains but to extol thee alone. And
the more thou deignest to declare thyself liberal towards us, may we the more
ardently desire to worship thee. May we devote ourselves to thee without
reserving the slightest self praise, but caring for this only, that thy glory
may remain and shine forth throughout all the world, through Christ our Lord.

<div><font face="Palatino">BEFORE Daniel sent his message to the king, as we saw
yesterday, he discharged the duty of piety as he ought, for he testified his
gratitude to God for revealing the secret. But he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he came to Arioch, who had
been sent by the king to, slay the Magi, and asked him not to kill them, for he
had a revelation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>of which we shall
afterwards treat. Here we must notice that some of the Magi were slain, as I
have said. For after Arioch had received the king&#8217;s mandate, he would
never have dared to delay it even a few days; but. a delay occurred after Daniel
had requested a short space of time, to be afforded him. Then Arioch relaxed
from the severity of the king&#8217;s order against the Magi; and now Daniel
asks him to spare the remainder. He seems, indeed, to have done this with little
judgment, because we ought to desire the utter abolition of magical arts, for we
saw before that they were diabolical sorceries. It may be answered thus, &#8212;
although Daniel, saw many faults and corruptions in the Magi and their art, or
science, or false pretensions to knowledge, yet, since the principles were true,
he was unwilling to allow what had proceeded from God to be blotted out. But; it
seems to me that Daniel&#8217;s object was somewhat different, for although the
Magi might have been utterly destroyed without the slightest difficulty, yet he
looks rather to the cause, and therefore wished the persons to be spared. It,
will often happen that wicked men are called in question as well as those who
have deserved a tenfold death; but if they are not punished for any just reason,
we ought; to spare their persons, not through their worthiness, but through our
own habitual sense of equity and rectitude. It is therefore probable that
Daniel, when he saw the king&#8217;s command concerning the slaughter of the
Magi to be so tyrannical, went out to meet him, lest; they should all be slain
with savage and cruel violence, without; the slightest reason. I therefore think
that Daniel spared the Magi, but not through any personal regard; he wished them
to be safe, but for another purpose, namely, to await their punishment from God.
Their iniquity was not yet ripe for destruction through the indignation of the
king. It is not surprising, then, that Daniel wished, as far as possible, to
hinder this cruelty. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It may here be a question, in what sense Arioch
speaks of bringing Daniel before the king, as if it were something new. For
Daniel had already requested from the king time for prayer, as we have seen. Why
then does Arioch now boast of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
having found a man of the captives of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as if he were speaking of all obscure and unknown person? But very probably
Daniel requested the time for prayer from Arioch, since we learn from history
how difficult it was to approach those kings; for they thought it a profanation
of their majesty to be polite and humane. The conjecture, therefore, is
probable, that Arioch was the channel through whom the king granted the time to
Daniel; or, we may suppose the words of Arioch are not simply related, but that
Daniel shews the great boasting of courtiers, who always praise their own good
offices, and adorn them with the splendor of words. Hence Arioch reminds the
king how he had met with Daniel, and had at length obtained what the king very
urgently desired. I do not therefore dwell longer on this, since either Arioch
then explained more clearly to the long that Daniel could interpret, his dream;
or he joined what had formerly been done; or else Daniel had obtained this
before; or he had begged of the king that some time should be given to Daniel.

possessors of wisdom. Since he had asked them in vain, the error with which he
was imbued, as I have said, prevented him from hoping for anything better
elsewhere. Through surprise, then, he here inquires, as if the tiling were
impossible, Have you that power? There is no doubt that God drew this
interrogation from the proud king to render his grace in Daniel more
illustrious. The less hope there was in the king himself, the more there was in
the revelation of both dignity and reverence, as we shall afterwards see; for
the, king was astonished, and fell prostrate through stupor upon the earth

<div><font face="Palatino">First, with respect to these names we need not
trouble ourselves much, since even the Jews themselves are compelled to guess at
them. They are very bold in their definitions and rash in their affirmations,
and jet they cannot. clearly distinguish how one kind of wise man differed from
the others; hence it is sufficient for us to hold that the discourse now
concerns those then esteemed &#8220;wise men,&#8221; under the various
designations of Magi, Soothsayers, and Astrologers. Now, as to Daniel&#8217;s
answer. He says it was not surprising that the king did not find what he hoped
for among the Magi, since God had breathed into him this dream beyond the
comprehension of human intellect. I know not whether those interpreters are
right who think magical arts here simply condemned; for I rather think a
comparison is instituted; between the king&#8217;s dream and the substance of
the science of the Magi. I always exclude superstitions by which they vitiated
true and genuine science. But as far as the principles are concerned, we cannot
precisely condemn astronomy and whatever belongs to the consideration of the
order of nature. This appears to me the whole intention, &#8212; the
king&#8217;s dream was not subjected to human knowledge, for mortals have no
such natural skill as to be able to comprehend the meaning of the dream, and God
manifests those secrets which need the peculiar revelation of the Spirit. When
Daniel says the Magi, Astrologers, and the rest cannot explain to the king his
dream, and are not suitable interpreters of it, the true reason is, because the
dream was not natural and had nothing in common with human conjectures, but was
the peculiar revelation of the Spirit. As when Paul disputes concerning the
Gospel, he collects into order every kind of intelligence among men, because
those who are endued with any remarkable acuteness or ability think they can
accomplish anything. But the doctrine of the Gospel is a heavenly mystery
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:4) which cannot be comprehended by the most learned and talented
among men. The real sense of Daniel&#8217;s words is this, &#8212; the Magi,
Astrologers, and Soothsayers had no power of expounding the king&#8217;s dream,
since it was neither natural nor human.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is clearly evident from the context, because he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is a God in heaven
who reveals secrets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For I take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>berem, </i>here for the adversative particle. He opposes therefore the
revelation of God to the conjectures and interpretations of the Magi, since all
human sciences are included, so to speak, within their own bounds and bolts.
Daniel, therefore, says that the matter requires the singular gift of the Holy
Spirit. The same God also who revealed the king&#8217;s dream to Daniel,
distributes to each of us ability and skill according to his own pleasure.
Whence does it arise that some are remarkable for quickness and others for
stupidity and sloth? &#8212; that some become proficients in human arts and
learning, and others remain utterly ignorant, unless God shews, by this variety,
how by his power and will the minds of men become enlightened or remain blunt
and stupid? As the Almighty is the supreme origin of all intelligence in the
world, What Daniel here says is not generally true; and this contrast, unless we
come to particulars, is either cold or superfluous. We understand, therefore,
why he said in the former verse that the Magi and Astrologers could not explain
the king&#8217;s dream, since the Almighty had raised King Nebuchadnezzar above
the common level for the purpose of explaining futurity to him through his
dream.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then <i>a
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God in heaven who reveals
secrets; he shews to king Nebuchadnezzar what will come to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms what I have said, that
the king was utterly unable to comprehend the meaning of his own dream. It often
happens that men&#8217;s minds move hither and thither, and thus make clever
guesses; but Daniel excludes all human <i>media, </i>and speaks of the dream as
proceeding directly from God. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what shall happen at the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or extremity
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We may inquire what he means by
the word &#8220;extremity.&#8221; Interpreters think this ought to be referred
to the advent of Christ; but they do not explain why this word signifies
Christ&#8217;s advent. There is no obscurity in the phrase; &#8220;<i>the
</i>end of the days&#8221; signifies the advent of Christ, because it was a kind
of renewal to the world. Most. truly, indeed, the world is still in the same
state of agitation as it was when Christ was manifest in the flesh; but, as we
shall afterwards see, Christ came for the very purpose of renovating the world,
and since his Gospel is a kind of perfection of all things, we are said to be
&#8220;in the last days.&#8221; Daniel compares the whole period preceding
Christ&#8217;s advent with this extremity of the days. God therefore wished to
shew the king of Babylon what should occur after one monarchy had destroyed
another, and also that there should be an end of those changes whenever
Christ&#8217;s kingdom should arrive. At present I touch but briefly on this
point, since more must; be said upon it by and bye.</font><br></div>

may seem absurd for Daniel here to profess to explain to the king the nature of
his dream and its interpretation, and yet to put in something else. But, as he
will add nothing out of place, we ought not to question the propriety of his
saying, this was the king&#8217;s vision and his dream; for his object was to
rouse the king the more urgently to attend to both the dream and its
interpretation. Here we must; take notice how the Prophet persists in this, with
the view of persuading the king that God was the author of the dream about.
which he inquired of Daniel; for the words would be entirely thrown away unless
men were thoroughly persuaded that the explanation given proceeded from God. For
many in the present day will hear willingly enough what may be said about the
Gospel, but they are not inwardly touched by it, and then all they hear vanishes
away and immediately escapes them. Hence reverence is the principle of true and
solid understanding. Thus Daniel does not abruptly bring forward either the
explanation or the narration of the dream, but prepares the proud king to
listen, by shewing him that he neither dreamt at, random nor in accordance with
his own thoughts, but was divinely instructed and admonished concerning hidden
events. It now follows,-</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He again confirms what I have just touched upon, for
he wished to impress this upon the king&#8217;s mind &#8212; that God was the
author of the dream, to induce the king to prepare for its interpretation with
becoming sobriety, modesty, and docility. For unless he had been seriously
affected, he would have despised Daniel&#8217;s interpretation; just as we see
men fail to profit through their own pride or carelessness even when God
addresses. them familiarly. Hence we must observe this order, and be fully
prepared to listen to God, and learn to put a bridle upon ourselves on hearing
his sacred name, never rejecting whatever he proposes to us, but treating it
with proper gravity. This is the true reason why Daniel repeats again that King
Nebuchadnezzar was divinely instructed in future events. He says, in the first
clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king&#8217;s thoughts
ascended</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; the </i>phrase is Hebrew
and. Chaldee. Thoughts are said to ascend when they are revolved in the brain or
head, as we formerly saw &#8212; this vision was in thy head; since the seat of
the reasoning faculty is in the head. Daniel therefore asserts the king to be
anxious about futurity, as the greatest monarchs think of what shall happen
after their death, and every one dreams about enjoying the empire of the whole
world. So King Nebuchadnezzar was very probably indulging these thoughts. But it
follows immediately, that his thoughts could non profit him unless God unveiled
the future, because it was his peculiar office, says the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to reveal
secrets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>Here we see clearly how vainly
men disturb themselves when they turn over and over again subjects which surpass
their abilities. King Nebuchadnezzar might have fatigued himself for a, long
time without profit if he had not been instructed by the oracle. Hence there is
weight in these words &#8212; He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who reveals secrets has explained
to the king what shall happen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is,
thou canst not understand the dream by thine own thoughts, but God has deemed
thee worthy of this peculiar favor when he wished to make thee conscious of
mysteries which had been otherwise altogether hidden from thee, for thou couldst
never have penetrated to such a depth.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel meets an objection which Nebuchadnezzar
might make, &#8212; If God alone can reveal secrets, how, I pray thee, canst
thou, a mere mortal, do it? Daniel anticipates this, and transfers the whole
glory to God, and ingenuously confesses that he has no interpretation of his own
to offer, but represents himself as led forward by God&#8217;s hand to be its
interpreter; and as having nothing by his own natural talents, but acting as God
pleased to appoint him his servant for this office, and-as using his assistance.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This
secret,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has been made known to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he sufficiently
declares, how his undertaking to interpret the dream was God&#8217;s peculiar
gift. But he more clearly expresses this gift to be supernatural, as it is
called, by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not in the
wisdom which belongs to me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For if
Daniel had surpassed the whole world in intelligence, yet he could never divine
what; the king of Babylon had dreamt! He excelled, indeed, in superior abilities
and learning, and was endowed, as we have said, with remarkable gifts; yet; he
could never have obtained this power which he acquired from God through prayer,
(I repeat it; again,)through his own study or industry, or any human
exertions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We observe how Daniel here carefully excludes, not
only what men foolishly claim as their own, but; also what God naturally
confers; since we know the profane to be endowed with singular talents, and
other eminent faculties; and these are called natural, since God desires his
gracious gifts to shine forth in the human race by such examples as these. But
while Daniel acknowledges himself endowed with no common powers, through the
good pleasure and discipline of God, though he confesses this, I say, yet he
places this revelation on a higher footing. We observe also how the gifts of the
Spirit mutually differ, because Daniel acted in a kind of twofold capacity with
regard to the endowments with which it pleased God to adorn him. First of all,
he made rapid progress in all sciences, and flourished much in intellectual
quickness, and we have already clearly shewn this to be, owing to the mere
liberality of God. This liberality puts all things in their proper order, while
it shews God&#8217;s singular favor in the explanation of the
dream.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This
secret,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was not made known to me on
account of any wisdom in me beyond the rest of
mankind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Daniel does not affirm himself
to be superior to all men in wisdom, as some falsely twist these words, but he
leaves this in doubt by saying, This ought not to be ascribed to wisdom, for if
I were the acutest of all men, all my shrewdness would avail me nothing and,
again, if I were the rudest idiot, still it is God who uses me as his servant,
in interpreting the dream to you. You must not, therefore, expect anything human
from me, but you must receive what I say to you, because I am the instrument of
God&#8217;s Spirit, just as if I had come down from heaven. This is the simple
sense of the words. Hence we may learn to ascribe the praise to God alone, to
whom it is due; for it is his peculiar office to illuminate our minds, so that
we may comprehend heavenly mysteries. For although we are naturally endued with
the greatest acuteness, which is also his gift, yet we may call it a limited
endowment, as it does not reach to the heavens. Let us learn, then, to leave his
own to God, as we are admonished by this expression of Daniel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But that I may make known to the
king the interpretation, and thou mayest know the thoughts of thy
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Daniel uses the plural number,
but indefinitely; as if he had said, God has left thee indeed hitherto in
suspense; but yet he did not inspire thee with this dream in vain. These
flyings, therefore, are mutually united, namely, &#8212; God has revealed to
thee this secret, and has appointed me his interpreter. Thus we perceive
Daniel&#8217;s meaning. For Nebuchadnezzar might object, Why does God torment me
thus? What is the meaning of my perplexity; &#8212; first I dream, and then my
dream escapes me, and its interpretation is unknown to me? Lest, therefore,
Nebuchadnezzar should thus argue with God, Daniel here anticipates him, and
shows how neither the dream nor the vision occurred in vain; but God now grants
what was there wanting, namely, the return of the dream to
Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s memory, and at the same time his acknowledgment of its
purport, and the reason of its being sent to him.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, since thou desirest
us to differ from the brutes, and hence didst impress our minds with the light

to magnify this singular favor, and may we exercise ourselves in the knowledge
of those things which induce us to reverence thy sovereignty. Besides this, may
we distinguish between that common sense which thou hast bestowed upon us, and
the illumination of thy Spirit, and the gift of faith, that thou alone mayest be
glorified by our being grafted by faith into the body of thine only-begotten
Son. We entreat also from thee further progress and increase of the same faith,
until at length thou bring us to the full manifestation of light. Then, being

<div><font face="Palatino">ALTHOUGH Daniel here records the dream, and does not
touch on its interpretation, yet we must not proceed farther without discoursing
on the matter itself. When the interpretation is afterwards added, we shall
confirm what we have previously said, and amplify as the context may guide us.
Here Daniel records how Nebuchadnezzar saw an image consisting of gold, silver,
brass, and iron, but its feet were mixed, partly of iron and portly of clay. We
have already treated of the name of the &#8220;Vision,&#8221; but I briefly
repeat again, &#8212; king Nebuchadnezzar did not see this image here mentioned,
with his natural eyes, but it was a specimen of the revelation which he knew
with certainty to have been divinely offered to him. Otherwise, he might have
thrown off all care, and acted as he pleased; but God held him down in complete
torment, until Daniel came as its interpreter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar then saw an
image.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All writers endowed with a sound
judgment and candidly desirous of explaining the Prophet&#8217;s meaning,
understand this, without controversy, of the Four Monarchies, following each
other in succession. The Jews, when pressed by this interpretation, confuse the
Turkish with the Roman empire, but their ignorance and unfairness is easily
proved. For when they wish to escape the confession of Christ having been
exhibited to the world, they seek stale calumnies which do not require
refutation; but still something must afterwards be said in its proper place. My
assertion is perfectly correct, that interpreters of moderate judgment and
candor, all explain the passage of the Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and
Roman monarchies, and Daniel himself afterwards shews this sufficiently by his
own words. A question, however, arises, why God represented these four
monarchies under this image? for it does not seem to correspond throughout, as
the Romans had nothing in common with the Assyrians. History has fully informed
us how the Medes and Persians succeeded the Chaldeans; how Babylon was besieged
by the enemy; and how Cyrus, after obtaining the victory, transferred the empire
to the Medes and Persians. It may, perhaps, seem absurd that one image only
should be proposed. But it is probable &#8212; nay, it may be shewn &#8212; that
God does not here regard any agreement between these four monarchies, for there
was none at all, but the state of the world at large. God therefore wished,
under this figure, to represent the future condition of the world till the
advent of Christ. This is the reason why God joined these four empires together,
although actually different; since the second sprang from the destruction of the
first, and the third from that of the second. This is one point, and we may now
inquire, secondly, why Daniel calls the kingdom of Babylon by the honorable term
<i>golden. </i>For we know the extent of its tyranny and the character of the
Assyrians, and their union with the Chaldeans. We are also aware of the
destruction of Nineveh, and how the Chaldeans made Babylon their capital city,
to preserve the seat of empire among themselves. If we consider the origin of
that monarchy, we shall surely find the Assyrians like savage beasts, full of
avarice, cruelty, and rapacity, and the Chaldeans superior to all these vices.
Why, then, is that empire called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>&#8212; and why
a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> golden
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the name, &#8220;head,&#8221; since that
monarchy arose first, there is nothing surprising in Daniel&#8217;s assigning
the highest place to it. And as to his passing by Nineveh, this is not
surprising, because that city had been already cut off, and he is now treating
of future events. The Chaldean empire, then, was first in the order of time, and
is called &#8220;golden&#8221;<i> </i>by comparison; because the world grows
worse as it becomes older; for the Persians and Medes who seized upon the whole
East under the auspices of Cyrus, were worse than the Assyrians and Chaldeans.
So profane poets invented fables about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Four
Ages</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Golden, Silver, Brazen, and
Iron. They do not mention the clay, but without doubt they received this
tradition from Daniel. If any one object, that Cyrus excelled in the noblest
qualities, and was of a heroic disposition, and celebrated by historians for his
prudence and perseverance, and other endowments, I reply, we must not look here
at the character of any one man, but at the continued state of the Persian
empire. This is sufficiently probable on comparing the empire of the Medes and
Persians with that of the Babylonians, which is called &#8220;silver;&#8221;
since their morals were deteriorated, as we have already said. Experience also
demonstrates how the world always degenerates, and inclines by degrees to vices
and corruptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then as to the Macedonian empire, it ought not to
seem absurd to find it compared to brass, since we know the cruelty of
Alexander&#8217;s disposition. It is frivolous to notice that politeness which
has gained him favor with historians; since, if we reflect upon his natural
character, he surely breathed cruelty from his very boyhood. Do we not discern
in him, when quite a boy, envy and emulation? When he saw his father victorious
in war, and subduing by industry or depraved arts the cities of Greece, he wept
with envy, because his father left him nothing to conquer. As he manifested such
pride when a boy, we conclude him to have been more cruel than humane. And with
what purpose and intention did he undertake the expedition by which he became
king of kings, unless through being discontented not only with his own power,
but with the possession of the whole worm? We know also how tie wept when he
heard from that imaginative philosophy, that there were more worlds than this.
&#8220;What<i>,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>said he, &#8220;I<i> </i>do not possess even
one world!&#8221; Since, then, one world did not suffice for a man who was small
of stature, he must indeed put off all humanity, as he really appeared to do. He
never spared the blood of any one; and wherever he burst forth, like a devouring
tempest, he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>everything. Besides, what is here said of that monarchy ought not to be
restricted to the person of Alexander, who was its chief and author, but is
extended to all his successors. We know that they committed horrible cruelties,
for before his empire was divided into four parts, constituting the kingdoms of
Asia, Syria, Egypt, and Macedonia, how much blood was sited! God took away from
Alexander all his offspring. He might have lived at home and begotten children,
and thus his memory would have been noble and celebrated among all posterity;
but God exterminated all his family from the world. His mother perished by the
sword at the age of eighty years; also his wife and sons, as well as a brother
of unsound mind. Finally, it was a horrible proof of God&#8217;s anger against
Alexander&#8217;s offspring, for the purpose of impressing all ages with a sense
of his displeasure at such cruelty. If then we extend the Macedonian empire to
the period when Perseus was conquered, and Cleopatra and Ptolemy slain in
Egypt., and Syria, Asia, and Egypt reduced under the sway of Rome &#8212; if we
comprehend the whole of this period, we shall not wonder at the prophet Daniel
calling the monarchy &#8220;brazen.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he speaks of THE ROMAN EMPIRE as
&#8220;iron,&#8221; we must always remember the reason I have noticed, which has
reference to the world in general, and to the depraved nature of mankind; whence
their vices and immoralities always increase till they arrive at a fearful
height. If we consider how the Romans conducted themselves, and how cruelly they
tyrannized over others, the reason why their dominion is called
&#8220;<i>iron</i>&#8221;<i> </i>by Daniel will immediately appear. Although
they appear to have possessed some skill in political affairs, we are acquainted
with their ambition, avarice, and cruelty. Scarcely any nation can be found
which suffered like the Romans under those three diseases, and since they were
so subject to these, as well as to others, it is not surprising that the Prophet
detracts from their fame and prefers the Macedonians, Persians, Medes, and even
Assyrians and Chaldeans to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the feet of the image were partly
of iron and partly of clay,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this ought
to be referred to the ruin which occurred, when God dispersed and cut in pieces,
so to speak, that monarchy. The Chaldean power fell first; then the Macedonians,
after subduing the East, became the sole monarchs to whom the Medes and Persians
were subservient. The same event happened to the Macedonians, who were at length
subdued by the, Romans; and all their kings who succeeded Alexander were cut
off. But there was another reason why God wished to overthrow the Roman
monarchy. For it fell by itself according to the prediction of this prophecy.
Since, then, without any external force it fell to pieces by itself, it easily
appears that it was broken up by Christ, according to this dream of King
Nebuchadnezzar. It is positively certain, that nothing was ever stable from the
beginning of the world, and the assertion of Paul was always true &#8212; the
fashion of this world passeth away.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460731&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:31.) By the word &#8220;fashion&#8221; he means whatever is
splendent in the world is also shadowy and evanescent, he adds, also, that all
which our eyest gaze upon must vanish away. But, as I have said, the reason was
different when God wished to destroy the empire of the Chaldees, the Persians,
and the Macedonians; because this was more clearly shewn in the case of the
Romans, how Christ by his advent took away whatever was splendid, and
magnificent, and admirable in the world. This, therefore, is the reason why God
assigns specially to the Romans
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feet of
clay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Thus much, then, with respect to
the four empires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the third place, it may be doubted why <i>Christ
</i>is said </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to have broken this
image from the mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For if Christ
is the eternal wisdom of God
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;200815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
8:15) by whom kings reign, this seems scarcely to accord with it; for how, by
his advent, should he break up the political order which we; know God approves
of, and has appointed and established by his power? I answer, &#8212; earthly
empires are swallowed and broken up b;y Christ accidentally, as they say.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;190209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:9.) For if kings exercise their office honestly, clearly enough Christ&#8217;s
kingdom is not contrary to their power. Whence, then, does it happen that Christ
strikes kings with an iron scepter<i>, </i>and breaks, and ruins, and reduces
them to nothing? Just <i>because </i>their pride is untamable, and they raise
their heads to heaven, and wish, if possible, to draw down God from his throne.
Hence they necessarily feel Christ&#8217;s hand opposed to them, because they
cannot and will not subject themselves to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But another question may be raised: &#8212; When
Christ was made manifest, those monarchies had fallen long previously; for the
Chaldean, the Persian, and that of the successors of Alexander, had passed away.
The solution is at hand, if we understand what I have previously mentioned
&#8212; that under one image the whole state of the world is here <i>depicted
</i>for us. Although all events did not occur at the same moment, yet we shall
find the Prophet&#8217;s language essentially true, that Christ should destroy
all monarchies. For when the seat of the empire of the East was changed, and
Nineveh destroyed, and the Chaldeans had fixed the seat of empire among
themselves, this happened by God&#8217;s just judgment, and Christ was already
reigning as the king of the world. That monarchy was really broken up by his
power, and the same may be said of the Persian empire. For when they degenerated
from a life of austerity and sobriety into one of foul and infamous luxury; when
they raged so cruelly against all mankind, and became so exceedingly rapacious,
their empire necessarily passed away from them, and Alexander executed the
judgment of God. The same occurred to Alexander and his successors. Hence the
Prophet means, that before Christ appeared, he already possessed supreme power,
both in heaven and earth, and thus broke up and annihilated the pride and
violence of all men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Daniel says &#8212; the image perished when the
Roman empire was broken up, and yet we observe in the East and the neighboring
regions the greatest monarchs still reigning with very formidable prowess. I
reply, we must remember what we said yesterday &#8212; the dream was presented
to King Nebuchadnezzar, that he might understand all future events to the
renovation of the world. Hence God was not willing to instruct the king of
Babylon further than to inform him of the four future monarchies which should
possess the whole globe, and should obscure by their splendor all the powers of
the world, and draw all eyes and all attention to itself; and afterwards Christ
should come and overthrow those monarchies. God, therefore, wished to inform
King Nebuchadnezzar of these events; and here we must notice the intention of
the Holy Spirit. No mention is made of other kingdoms, because they had not yet
emerged into importance sufficient to be compared to these four monarchies.
While the Assyrians and Chaldeans reigned, there was no rivalry with their
neighbors, for the whole of the East obeyed them. It was incredible that Cyrus,
springing from a barbarous region, could so easily draw to himself such
resources, and seize upon so many provinces in so short a time! For he was like
a whirlwind which destroyed the whole East. The same may be said of the third
monarchy; for if the successors of Alexander had been mutually united, there was
then no empire in the world which could have increased their power. The Romans
were fully occupied in struggling with their neighbors, and were not yet at rest
on their own soil; and afterwards, when Italy, Greece, Asia, and Egypt were
obedient to them, no other empire rivaled their fame; for all the power and
glory of the world was at that period absorbed by their arms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand why Daniel mentioned those four
kingdoms, and why he places their close at the advent of Christ. When I speak of
Daniel, this ought to be understood of the dream; for without doubt God wished
to encourage the Jews not to despair, when first the brightness of the Chaldean
monarchy, then that of the Persian, next the Macedonian, and lastly, the Romans
overwhelmed the world. For what could they have determined by themselves at the
time when Nebuchadnezzar dreamt about the four empires? The kingdom of Israel
was then utterly destroyed, the ten tribes were exiles, the kingdom of Judah was
reduced to desolation. Although the city Jerusalem was yet. standing, still
where was the kingdom? It was full of ignominy and disgrace; nay, the posterity
of David then reigned precariously in the tribe of Judah, and even there over
but a part of it; and afterwards, although their return was permitted, yet we
know how miserably they were afflicted. And when Alexander, like a tempest,
devastated the East, they suffered, as we know, the greatest distress; they were
frequently ravaged. by his successors; their <i>city </i>was reduced almost to
solitude, and the temple profaned; and when their condition was at the best,
they were still tributary, as we, shall afterwards see. It was certainly
necessary for their minds to be supported in so great and such confused
perturbation. This, therefore, was the reason why God sent the, dream about
those monarchies to the king of Babylon. It Daniel had dreamt, the faithful
would not have had so remarkable a subject-matter for the confirmation of their
faith; but when the king&#8217;s dream is spread abroad through almost the whole
East, and when its interpretation is equally celebrated, the Jews might recover
their spirits and revive their hopes at their own time, since they understood
from the first that these four monarchies should not exist by any mere changes
of fortune; for the same God who had foretold to King Nebuchadnezzar future
events, determined also what he should do, and what he wished to take
place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Jews knew that; the Chaldeans were reigning only
by the decree of heaven; and that another more destructive empire should
afterwards arise; thirdly, that they must undergo a servitude under the
Macedonians; lastly, that the Romans should be the conquerors and masters of the
world &#8212; and all this by the decree of heaven. When they reflected on these
things, and finally heard of the Redeemer, as, according to promise, a perpetual
King, and all the monarchies, then so refulgent, as without any stability-all
this would prove no common source of strength. Now, therefore, we understand
with what intention God wished what had hitherto been hidden, to be everywhere
promulgated; the Jews, too, would hand down to their sons and grandsons what
they had heard from Daniel, and afterwards this <i>prophecy </i>would be extant,
and become an admiration to them throughout all ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we come to the words, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one image was great and large,
its splendor was precious, and its form
terrible</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this phrase, God wished to
meet a doubt which might creep into the minds of the Jews, on perceiving each of
those empires prosperous in its turn. When the Jews, captive and forlorn, saw
the Chaldeans formidable throughout the whole world, and, consequently, highly
esteemed and all but adored by the rest of mankind, what could they think of it?
Why, they would have no hope of return, because God had raised their enemies to
such great power that their avarice and cruelty were like a deep whirlpool. The
Jews might thus conclude themselves to be drowned in a very deep abyss, whence
they could not hope to escape. But when the empire was transferred to the Medes
and Persians, although they were allowed the liberty of returning, still we know
how small a number used this indulgence, and the rest were ungrateful. Whether
or not this was so, few of the Jews, returned to their country; and these had to
make war upon their neighbors, and were subject to continual molestation. As far
as common sense would guide them, it was easier for them not to stir a step from
Chaldea, Assyria, and the other parts of the East, since their neighbors in
their own country were all so hostile to them. As long as they were tributary
and esteemed almost as serfs and slaves, and while their condition was so
humiliating, the same temptation remained. For, if they were God&#8217;s people,
why did he not care for them so far as to relieve them from that cruel tyranny?
Wily did he not restore them to calmness, and render them free from such various
inconveniences, and from so many injuries? When the Macedonian. empire
succeeded, they were more miserable than before; they were daily exposed as a
prey, and every species of cruelty was practiced towards them. Then, with regard
to the Romans, we know how proudly they domineered over them. Although Pompey,
at his first assault, did not spoil the temple, yet at length he became bolder,
and Crassus shortly afterwards destroyed everything till the most horrible and
prodigious slaughter followed. As the Jews must suffer these things, this
consolation must, necessarily be offered to them &#8212; the Redeemer shall at
length arrive, who shall break up all these empires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to Christ being called <i>the stone cut out
without human, hands, </i>and being pointed out by other phrases, I cannot
explain them now.</font><br></div>

his faithfulness and guardianship, and compel the whole world to promote our

TENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have already explained God&#8217;s intention in
offering to King Nebuchadnezzar the dream concerning the four monarchies, and
the kingdom of Christ which should put an end to them. We have shewn it to have
been not for the king&#8217;s sake so much as for the consolation and support of
the remnant of the faithful in those very severe troubles which awaited them,
and were close at hand. For when redemption had been promised to them, and the
Prophets had extolled that remarkable beneficence of God in magnificent terms,
their confidence might fail them amidst those revolutions which afterwards
followed. For God wished to sustain their spirits, so that amidst such
agitations and tumults they might remain constant, and patiently and quietly
wait; for the promised Redeemer. Meanwhile God wished to render all the
Chaldeans without excuse, because this dream of the king&#8217;s was everywhere
celebrated, and yet, none of them profited by it, as far as Christ&#8217;s
eternal reign is concerned. But this was the principal point in the dream, as we
shall afterwards see. But God wished, in the first place, to consult the
interests of his elect, lest they should despond among those so-called
revolutions, which might seem contrary to those numerous prophecies, by which
not merely simple liberty was promised, but perpetual and continued happiness
under God&#8217;s hand. We now understand the end which God intended by this
dream. We must now treat its explanation. We have already touched upon some
points, but Daniel himself shall lead the way along which we are to proceed.

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel here declares &#8220;the golden head of the
image&#8221; to be the Babylonian kingdom. We know that the Assyrians were
subdued before the monarchy was transferred to Babylon; but since they did not
prevail sufficiently to be considered as supreme rulers in that eastern
territory, the Babylonian empire is here mentioned first. It is also worth while
to remark, that God was unwilling to refer here to what had already occurred,
but he rather proposed that the people should in future depend on this prophecy
and rest upon. it. Here it would have been superfluous to say anything about the
Assyrians, since that empire had already passed away. But the Chaldeans were
still to reign for some time &#8212; say seventy or at least sixty years. Hence
God wished to hold the minds of his own servants in suspense till the end of
that monarchy, and then to arouse them by fresh hopes, until the second monarchy
should pass away, so that afterwards they might rest in patience under the third
and fourth monarchies, and might perceive at length the time of Christ&#8217;s
advent to be at hand. This is the reason why Daniel places the Chaldean monarchy
here in the first rank and order. And in this matter there is no difficulty,
because he states King Nebuchadnezzar to be the golden head of the image. We may
gather the reason of his being called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the golden
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from the context, namely, because
its integrity was then greater than under the empire of the Medes and Persians.
It is very true that the Chaldeans were the most cruel robbers, and we know how
Babylon was then detested by all the pious and sincere worshippers of God.
Still, since things usually become worse by process of time, the state of the
world was; as yet tolerable under that sovereignty. This is the reason why
Nebuchadnezzar is called &#8220;the head of gold;&#8221; but this ought not to
be referred to him personally, but rather extended to his whole kingdom, and all
his successors, among whom Belshazzar was the most hateful despiser of God; and
by comprehension he is said to form part of this head of gold. But Daniel shews
that he did not flatter the king, since he assigns this reason for
Nebuchadnezzar being the golden head &#8212; God had set him up above all the
earth. But this seems to be common to all kings, since none of them reign
without God&#8217;s permission &#8212; a sentiment which is partially true, but
the Prophet implies that Nebuchadnezzar was raised up in an especial manner,
because he excelled all other sovereigns. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse Daniel embraces the Second and Third
Monarchies. He says the second should be inferior to the Chaldean in neither
power nor wealth; for the Chaldean empire, although it spread so far and so
wide, was added to that of the Medes and Persians. Cyrus subdued the Medes
first; and although he made his father-in-law, Cyaxares, his ally in the
sovereignty, yet he had expelled his maternal grandfather, and thus obtained
peaceable possession of the kingdom throughout all Media. Then he afterwards
conquered the Chaldeans and Assyrians, as well as the Lydians and the rest of
the nations of Asia Minor. We see then that his kingdom is not called inferior
through having less splendor or opulence in human estimation, but because the
general condition of the world was worse under the second monarchy, as
men&#8217;s vices and corruptions increase more and more. Cyrus was, it is true,
a prudent prince, but yet sanguinary. Ambition and avarice carried him fiercely
onwards, and he wandered in every direction, like a wild beast, forgetful of all
humanity. And if we scan his disposition accurately, we shall discover it to be,
as Isaiah says, very greedy of human blood.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
13:18.) And here we may remark, that he does not treat only of the persons of
kings, but of their counselors and of the whole people. Hence Daniel deservedly
pronounces the second state of the kingdom inferior to the first; not because
Nebuchadnezzar excelled in dignity, or wealth, or power, but because the world
had not degenerated so much as it afterwards did. For the more these monarchies
extend themselves, the more licentiousness increases in the world, according to
the teaching of experience. Whence the folly and madness of those who desire to
have kings very powerful is apparent, just as if any one should desire a river
to be most rapid, as Isaiah says when combating this folly.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:7.) For the swifter, the deeper, and the wider a river flows on, the greater
the destruction of its overflow to the whole neighborhood. Hence the insanity of
those who desire the greatest monarchies, because some things will by positive
necessity occur out of lawful order. when one man occupies so broad a space; and
this did <i>occur </i>under the sway of the Medes and Persians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The description of the Third Monarchy now follows. It
is called <i>brazen, </i>not so much from its hardness as from its being worse
than the second. The Prophet teaches how the difference between the second and
third monarchies is similar to that between silver and brass. The rabbis
confound the two monarchies, through their desire to comprehend under the second
what they call the kingdom of the Greeks; but they display the grossest
ignorance and dishonesty. For they do not err, through simple ignorance, but
they purposely desire. to overthrow what Scripture here states clearly
concerning the advent of Christ. Hence they are not ashamed to mingle and
confuse history, and to pronounce <i>carelessly </i>on subjects unknown to them
&#8212; unknown, I say, not because they escape men moderately versed hi
history, but through their being brutal themselves, and discerning nothing. For
instead of Alexander the son of Philip, they put Alexander the son of Mammea,
who possessed the Roman empire, when half its provinces had been already
separated from it. He was a spiritless boy, and was slain in his tent with the
greatest ignominy by his own soldiers; besides that, he never really governed,
but lived as a minor under the sway of his mother. And yet the Jews are not
ashamed to distort and twist what relates to the king of Macedon to this
Alexander the son of Mammea. But their wickedness and ignorance is easily
refuted by the context, as we shall afterwards see. Here Daniel states shortly
that there shall be a third monarchy, he does not describe its character, nor
explain it fully; but we shall see in another place the meaning of his prophecy.
He now interprets the dream of the king of Babylon, as the vision of the four
empires had been offered to him. But the angel afterwards confirms the same to
him by a vision, and very clearly, too, as will be seen in its own place.
Without doubt this narrative of the brazen image relates to the Macedonian
kingdom. How, then, is all doubt removed? By the description of the fourth
empire, which is much fuller, and clearly indicates what we shall soon see, that
the Roman empire was like the feet, partly of clay and partly of iron. He says,
therefore, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Fourth Empire is described, which agrees
only with the Roman, for we know that the four successors of Alexander were at
length subdued. Philip was the first king of Macedon, and Antiochus the second;
but yet Philip lost nothing from his own kingdom; he only yielded it to the free
cities of Greece. It was, therefore, hitherto, entire, except as it paid tribute
to the Romans for some years on account of the expenses of the war. Antiochus,
also, when <i>compelled </i>to adopt the conditions imposed by the conqueror,
was driven beyond Mount Taurus; but Macedonia was reduced to a province when
Perseus was overcome and captured. The kings of Syria and Asia suffered in the
same way; and, lastly, Egypt was seized upon by Augustus. For their posterity
had reigned up to that period, and Cleopatra was the last of that race, as is
<i>sufficiently </i>known. When, therefore, the three monarchies were absorbed
by the Romans, the language of the Prophet suits them well enough; for, as the
sword diminishes, and destroys, and ruins all things, thus those three
monarchies were bruised and broken up by the Roman empire. There is nothing
surprising in his here enumerating that popular form of government, among
&#8220;<i>monarchies,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>since we know how few were rulers among
this people, and how customary it was to call every kind of government among
them an empire, and the people themselves the rulers of the whole world! But the
Prophet compares them to &#8220;iron,&#8221; not only on account of its
hardness, although this reason is clearly expressed, but also through another
kind of similitude, &#8212; they were worse than all others, and surpassed in
cruelty and barbarity both the Macedonians. and the Medo-Persians. Although they
boast much in their own prowess, yet if any one exercises a sound judgment upon
their actions, he will discover their tyranny to be far more cruel than all the
rest; although they boast in their senators being as great as ordinary kings,
yet we shall find them no better than robbers and tyrants, for scarcely one in a
hundred of them shewed a grain of equity, either then sent into any province or
when discharging any magistracy; and with regard to the body of the empire
itself, it was all horrible pollution. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet
says that monarchy was partly composed of iron, and partly of potter&#8217;s
clay, since we know how they suffered under intestine disorders. The Prophet
requires no other interpretation here, because, he says, this mixture of iron
and clay, which unites so badly, is a sign of disunion, through their never
mingling together.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
kingdom,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be
divided</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he adds yet another
mixture,<i> &#8212;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> they
shall mingle themselves with the seed of
men,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is., they shall be neighbors
to others, and that mutual interchange which ought to promote true friendship,
shall become utterly profitless. The opinion of those who introduce the alliance
of Pompey and Caesar is farfetched, for the Prophet is speaking of a continued
government. If stability is sought for in any kind of government, it surely
ought to shine forth in a republic, or at least in an oligarchy in preference to
a despotism; because, when all are slaves, the king cannot so confidently trust
his subjects, through their constant fear for themselves. But when all unite in
the government, and the very lowest receive some mutual advantage from their
commonwealth, then, as I have said, superior stability ought to be conspicuous.
But Daniel pronounces, that even if the superior power should reside in the
senate and the people &#8212; for there is dignity in the senate, and majesty in
the people yet that empire should fall. Besides, although they should be
mutually united in neighborhood and kindred, yet this would not prevent them
from contending with each other with savage enmity, even to the destruction of
their empire. Here then the Prophet furnishes us with a vivid picture of the
Roman empire, by saying </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that it
was like iron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mingled with
clay,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or mud, as they destroyed
themselves by intestine discord after arriving at the highest pitch of fortune.
Thus far concerning the four monarchies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now inquire why Daniel said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The stone which was to be cut out
of the mountain should destroy all these
empires</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>since it does not appear, at
first sight, to suit the kingdom of Christ. The Babylonian monarchy had been
previously abolished &#8212; the Medes and Persians had been utterly prostrated
by Alexander &#8212; and after Alexander&#8217;s conquests, had been divided
into four kingdoms; the Romans subdued all those lands; and then it is objected
that the Prophet&#8217;s language is absurd,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a stone shall come out of a
mountain which shall break up all empires</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The solution, as I have said above is at hand. Daniel does not here state
that; the events shall happen together, but simply wishes to teach how the
empires of the world shall fail, and one kingdom shall be eternal. He does not
regard, therefore, when or why the empire&#8217;s of the Chaldees and of the
Persians fell, but he compares the kingdom of Christ with all those monarchies
which have been mentioned. And we must always remember what I have touched upon,
that the Prophet speaks for the captive people, and accommodates his <i>style
</i>to the faithful, to whom he wished to stretch forth the hand, and to
strengthen them in those most serious concussions which were at hand. And hence,
when he speaks of all lands and nations, if any one objects &#8212; there were
then. other empires in the world, the answer is easy, the Prophet is not here
describing what should happen through all the ages of the world, but only what
the Jews should see. For the Romans were the lords of many regions before they
passed over into Greece; we know they had two provinces in Spain, and after the
close of the second Punic war were masters of that upper sea, and held
undisputed possession of all the islands, as well as of Cisalpine Gaul and other
regions. No notice is taken of this empire, till it was made known to the
Jews,<i> </i>as they might have given themselves up to, utter despair, when they
could not perceive an end to those storms which almost ruined the world; and,
meanwhile, they were the most miserable of all men, because the various and
continual calamities of the world never ceased. We must remember this view of
things, as otherwise the whole prophecy would be cold and profitless to us. I
now return to the kingdom of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE KINGDOM or CHRIST is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to break up all the empires of
the world,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not <i>directly, </i>but only
accidentally, as the phrase is. For Daniel here assumes a principle,
sufficiently understood by the Jews; namely, those monarchies were opposed to
Christ&#8217;s; kingdom. For the Chaldees had overthrown God&#8217;s temple, and
had endeavored as far as possible to extinguish the whole of his worship, and to
exterminate piety from the world. As far as concerns the Medes and Persians,
although by their kindness a permission to return was granted to the people, yet
very soon afterwards the kings of the Medes and Persians raged against that most
miserable people, until the greater part of them preferred remaining; in exile
to returning home. At length came the Macedonian fury; and although the Jews
were spared for a short period, we know how impetuously the kings of Syria and
Egypt overran Judea, how cruelly they treated the wretched people by rapine and
plunder, and the shedding of innocent. blood. Again, the extreme barbarity of
Antiochus in ordering all the Prophetic Books to be burned, and in all but
exterminating the religion itself (1 Maccabees 1:59) is well
ascertained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">No wonder, then, that Daniel here opposes the reign
of Christ to such monarchies! Next, as to the Romans, we know how thoroughly and
proudly they despised the name of &#8220;Christian!&#8221; nay, they endeavored
by all means to root out from the world the Gospel and the doctrine of
salvation, as an abominable thing. With all this we are familiar. Hence, to
inform the faithful of their future condition until Christ&#8217;s advent,
Daniel shews how all the empires of the world should be adverse to God, and all
its most powerful kings and sovereigns should be his very worst and most cruel
enemies, and should use every means in their power to extinguish true piety.
Thus he exhorts them to bear their cross, and never to yield to those wretched
and sorrowful spectacles, but to proceed steadily in the course of their
calling, until the promised Redeemer should appear. We stated this to be
&#8220;accidental,&#8221; since all the kingdoms of this world are clearly
founded on the power and beneficence of Christ; but a memorable proof of
God&#8217;s anger ought to exist against them all, because they raised
themselves against the Son of God, the Supreme King, with such extreme fury and
hostility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, Christ is compared
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to a stone cut out of a
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some restrict this,
unnecessarily, to the generation of Christ, because he was born ,of a virgin,
out of the usual course of nature. Hence he says, as we have seen,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that it was cut out of a mountain
without the hand of man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, he was
divinely sent, and his empire was separated from all earthly ones, since it was
divine and heavenly. Now, therefore, we understand the reason of this
simile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the word
&#8220;<i>stone,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Christ is not here called <i>a stone </i>in
the sense of the word in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:22, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:14, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;380915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
9:15,<i> </i>and elsewhere. For there the name of a stone is applied to Christ,
because his Church is founded on it. The perpetuity of his kingdom is denoted
there as well as here; but, as I have already said, these phrases ought to be
distinguished. It must now be added, &#8212; Christ is called a stone cut out
without human hands, because he was from the beginning almost without form and
comeliness, as far as human appearance goes. There is also a silent contrast
between its magnitude, which the Prophet will soon mention, and this
commencement. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The stone cut out
of the mountain shall descend, and it shall become a great mountain, and shall
fill the whole earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see how the
Prophet here predicts the beginning of Christ&#8217;s Kingdom, as contemptible
and abject before the world. It was not conspicuous for excellence, as it is
said in Isaiah, A branch is sprung from the root of Jesse.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1.) When the posterity of David were deprived of all dignity, the royal name
was utterly buried, and the diadem trodden under foot, as it is said in Ezekiel
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
17:19.) Hence, Christ first appeared cast down and lowly; but the branch
increased wonderfully and beyond all expectation and calculation, unto an
immense size, till it filled the whole earth. We now perceive how appositely
Daniel speaks of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. but we must treat the rest
to-morrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Jews agree with us in thinking this passage
cannot be otherwise understood than of the perpetual reign of Christ, and
willingly and eagerly ascribe to the glory of their own nation whatever is
written everywhere throughout the Scriptures; nay, they often cry down many
testimonies of Scripture for the purpose of boasting in their own privileges.
They do not therefore deny the dream to have been sent to King Nebuchadnezzar
concerning Christ&#8217;s kingdom; but they differ from us, in expecting a
Christ of their own. Hence they are, compelled in many ways to corrupt this
prophecy; because, if they grant that the fourth empire or monarchy was
accomplished in the Romans, they must necessarily acquiesce in the Gospel, which
testifies of the arrival of that Messiah who was promised in the Law. For Daniel
here openly affirms that Messiah&#8217;s kingdom should arrive at the close of
the fourth monarchy. Hence they fly to the miserable refuge that by the fourth
monarchy should be understood the Turkish empire, which they call that of the
Ishmaelites; and thus they confound the Roman with the Macedonian empire. But
what pretense have they for making only one empire out of two such different
ones? They say the Romans sprang from the Greeks; and if we grant this, whence
did the Greeks spring? Did they not arise from the Caspian Mountains and Higher
Asia? The Romans referred their origin to Troy, and at the time when the
prophecy ought to be fulfilled, this had become utterly obscure &#8212; but what
is this to the purpose when they had no reputation for a thousand years
afterwards? But the Turks a long time afterwards, namely 600 years, suddenly
burst forth like a deluge. In such a variety of circumstances, and at such a
distance of time, how can they form one single kingdom? Then they shew no
difference between themselves and the rest of the nations. For they recall us to
the beginning of the world, and in this way make one kingdom out of two, and
this mixture is altogether without reason, or any pretension to it. There is no
doubt then, that Daniel intended the Romans by the fourth empire, since we
yesterday saw, how in a manner contrary to nature, that empire ultimately
perished by intestine discord. No single monarch reigned there, but only a
democracy. All thought themselves to be equally kings, for they were all
related. This; union ought to have been the firmest bond of perpetuity. But
Daniel here witnesses beforehand, how, even if they were intimately related,
that kingdom would not be social, but would perish by its own
dissension&#8217;s. Finally, it is now sufficiently apparent that the
Prophet&#8217;s words cannot be otherwise explained than of the Roman empire,
nor can they be drawn aside, except by violence, to the Turkish
empire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I shall now relate what our brother Anthony has
suggested to me, from a certain Rabbi Barbinel, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who seems to excel others in acuteness. He endeavors to shew by six principal
arguments, that the fifth kingdom cannot relate to our Christ &#8212; Jesus, the
son of Mary. He <i>first </i>assumes this principle, since the four kingdoms
were earthly, the fifth cannot be compared with them, except its nature is the
same. The comparison would be, he says, both inappropriate and absurd. As if
Scripture does not always compare the celestial kingdom of God with those of
earth! for it is neither necessary nor important for all points of a comparison
to be precisely similar. Although God shewed to the king of Babylon the four
earthly monarchies, it does not follow that the nature of the fifth was the
same, since it might be very different. Nay, if we weigh all things rightly, it
is necessary to mark some difference between those four and this. last one. The
reasoning, therefore, of that rabbi is frivolous, when he infers that
Christ&#8217;s kingdom ought to be visible, since it could not otherwise
correspond with the other kingdoms. The <i>second </i>reason, by which he
opposes us, is this, &#8212; if religion makes the difference between kingdoms,
it follows that the Babylonian, and Persian, and Macedonian are all the same;
for we know that all those nations worshipped idols, and were devoted to
superstition! The answer to so weak an argument is easy enough, namely, these
four kingdoms did not differ simply in religion, but God deprived the
Babylonians of their power, and transfer-red the monarchy to the Medes and
Persians; and by the same providence of God the Macedonians succeeded them; and
then, when all these kingdoms were abolished, the Romans possessed the sway over
the whole East. We have already explained the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. He wished
simply to teach the Jews this, &#8212; they were not to despair through
beholding the various agitation&#8217;s of the world, and its surprising and
dreadful confusion; although those ages were subject to many changes, the
promised king should at length arrive. Hence the Prophet wished to exhort the
Jews to patience, and to hold them in suspense by the expectation of the
Messiah. He does not distinguish these four monarchies through diversity of
religion, but because God was turning the, world round like a wheel while one
nation was expelling another, so that the Jews might apply all their minds and
attention to that hope of redemption which had been promised through
Messiah&#8217;s advent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>third </i>argument which that rabbi brings
forward may be refitted without the slightest trouble. He gathers from the words
of the Prophet that the kingdom of our Christ, the son of Mary, cannot be the
kingdom of which Daniel! speaks, since it is here clearly expressed that there
should be no passing away or change of this
kingdom,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> it shall not pass on to
another</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or a strange <i>people. </i>But
the Turks, says he, occupy a large portion of the world, and religion among
Christians is divided, and many reject the doctrine of the Gospel. It follows,
then, that Jesus, the son of Mary, is not, that king of whom Daniel prophesied
&#8212; that is, about whom the dream which Daniel explained occurred to the
king of Babylon. But he trifles very foolishly, because he assumes, what. we
shall ever deny &#8212; that Christ&#8217;s kingdom is visible. For however the
sons of God are dispersed, without any reputation among men, it is quite clear
that Christ&#8217;s kingdom remains safe and sure, since hi its own nature it is
not outward but invisible. Christ did not utter these words in vain,
&#8220;My<i> </i>kingdom is not of this world.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431836&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
18:36.) By this expression he wished to remove his kingdom from the ordinary
forms of government. Although, therefore, the Turks have spread far and wide,
and the world is filled with impious despisers. of God, and the Jews yet occupy
a part of it, still Christ, kingdom exists and has not been transferred to any
others. Hence this reasoning is not only weak but puerile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>A fourth </i>argument follows: &#8212; It seems
very absurd that Christ, who was born under Octavius or Augustus Caesar, should
be the king of whom Daniel prophesied. For, says he, the beginning of the fourth
and fifth monarchy was the same, which is absurd; for the fourth monarchy ought
to endure for some time, and then the fifth should succeed it. But here he not
only betrays his ignorance, but his utter stupidity, since God so blinded the
whole people that they were like restive dogs. I have had much conversation with
many Jews- I have never seen either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or
ingenuousness &#8212; nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew. But this
fellow, who seems so sharp and ingenious, displays his own impudence to his
great disgrace. For he thought the Roman monarchy began with Julius Caesar! as
if the Macedonian empire was not abolished when the Romans took possession of
Macedon and reduced it to a province, when also Antiochus was reduced into order
by them &#8212; nay, when the third monarchy, namely, the Macedonian, began to
decline, then the fourth, which is the Roman, succeeded it. Reason itself
dictates to us to reckon hi this way, since unless we confess the fourth
monarchy to have succeeded directly on the passing away of the third, how could
the rest follow on? We must observe, also, that the Prophet does not look to the
Caesars when he treats of these monarchies; nay, as we saw concerning the
mingling of races, this cannot in any way suit the Caesars; for we shewed
yesterday how those who restrict this passage to Pompey and Caesar are only
trifling, and are utterly without judgment in this respect. For the Prophet
speaks generally and continuously of a popular state, since they <i>were,
</i>all mutually related, and yet the empire was not stable, through their
consuming themselves internally by intestine warfare. Since this is the case, we
conclude this rabbi to be very foolish and palpably absurd in asserting the
Christ not to be the son of Mary who was born under Augustus, although I do not
argue for the kingdom of Christ commencing at his nativity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His <i>fifth </i>argument is this: &#8212;
Constantine and other Caesars professed the faith of Christ. If we receive, says
he, Jesus the son of Mary as the fifth king, how will this suit? as the Roman
Empire was still in existence under this king. For where rite religion of Christ
flourishes, where he is worshipped and acknowledged as the only King, that
kingdom ought not to be separated from his. When therefore Christ, under
Constantine and his successors, obtained both glory and power among the Romans,
his monarchy cannot be separated from theirs. But the solution of this is easy,
as the Prophet here puts an end to the Roman Empire when it began to be torn in
pieces. As to the time when Christ&#8217;s reign began, I have just said it
ought not to be referred to the time of his birth, but to the preaching of the
Gospel. From the time when the Gospel began to be promulgated, we know the Roman
monarchy to have been dissipated and at length to vanish away. Hence the empire
did not endure through Constantine or other emperors, since their state was
different; and we know that neither Constantine nor the other Caesars were
Romans. From the time of Trojan the empire began to be transferred to strangers,
and foreigners reigned at Rome. We also know by what monsters God destroyed the
ancient glory 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f166</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the Roman people! &#8212; for nothing could be more abandoned or disgraceful
than the conduct of many of the emperors. If any one will but run through their
histories, he will discover immediately that no other people ever had such
monsters for rulers as the Romans under Heliogabalus and others like him,
&#8212; I omit Nero and Caligula, and speak only of foreigners. The Roman Empire
was therefore abolished after the Gospel began to be promulgated and Christ
became generally known throughout the world. Thus we observe the same ignorance
in this argument of the rabbi as in the others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>last </i>assertion is, &#8212; The Roman
empire as yet partially survives, hence what is here said of the fifth monarchy
cannot belong to the son of Mary; it is necessary for the fourth empire to be at
an end, if the fifth king began to reign when Christ rose from the dead and was
preached in the world. I reply, as I have said already, the Roman empire ceased,
and was abolished when God transferred their whole power with shame and reproach
to foreigners, who were not only barbarians, but horrible monsters! It would
have been better for the Romans to suffer the utter blotting out of their name,
rather than submit to such disgrace. <i>We </i>perceive how this sixth and last
reason vanishes away. I wished to collect them together, to shew you how
foolishly those Jewish reasoners make war with God, and furiously oppose the
clear light of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to Daniel&#8217;s words. He says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A kingdom shall come and destroy
all other kingdoms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I explained
yesterday the sense in which Christ broke up those ancient monarchies, which had
come to an end long before his advent. For Daniel does not wish to state
precisely what Christ would do at any one moment, but what should happen from
the time of the captivity till his appearance. If we attend to this intention,
all difficulty will be removed from the passage. The conclusion, therefore, is
this; the Jews should behold the most powerful empires, which should strike them
with terror, and utterly astonish them, yet they should prove neither stable nor
firm, through being opposed to the kingdom of the Son of God. But Isaiah
denounces curses upon all the kingdoms which do not obey the Church of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
60:12.) As all those monarchs erected their crests against the Son of God and
true piety, with diabolical audacity, they must be utterly swept away, and
God&#8217;s curse, as announced by the Prophet, must become conspicuous upon
them. Thus Christ rooted up all the empires of the world. The Turkish empire,
indeed, at this day, excels in wealth and power, and the multitude of nations
under its sway; but. it was not God&#8217;s purpose to explain future events
after the appearance of Christ. He only wished the Jews to be admonished, and
prevented from sinking under the weight of their burden, since they would be in
imminent danger through the rise of so many fresh tyrannies in the world, and
the absence of all repose. God wished, therefore, to brace their minds by
fortitude. One reason <i>was </i>this &#8212; to cause them to dwell upon the
promised redemption, and to experience how evanescent and uncertain are all the
empires of the world which are not founded in God, and not united to the kingdom
of Christ. <i>God, </i>therefore, will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set up the kingdoms of the
heavens, which shall never be dissipated.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>It is here worth while to notice the sense in which Daniel uses the term
&#8220;perpetuity<i>.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>It ought not to be restricted to the
person of Christ, but belongs to all the pious and the whole body of the Church.
Christ is indeed eternal in himself, but he also communicates his eternity to
us, because he preserves the Church in the world, and invites us by the hope of
a better life than this, and begets us again by his Spirit to an incorruptible
life. The perpetuity, then, of Christ&#8217;s reign, is twofold, without
considering his person. <i>First, </i>in the whole body of believers; for though
the Church is often dispersed and hidden from men&#8217;s eyes, yet it never
entirely perishes; but God preserves it by his incomprehensible virtue, so that
it shall survive till the end of the world. Then there is a <i>second
</i>perpetuity in each believer, since each is born of incorruptible seed, and
renewed by the Spirit of God. The sons of Adam are now not mortal only, but bear
within them heavenly life; since the Spirit within them is life, as St. Paul
says, in the Epistle to the Romans.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:10.) We hold, therefore, that whenever Scripture affirms Christ&#8217;s reign
to be eternal, this is extended to the whole body of the Church, and need not be
confined to his person. We. see, then, how the kingdom from which the doctrine
of the Gospel began to be promulgated, was eternal; for although the Church was
in a certain sense buried, yet God gave life to his elect, even in the
sepulcher. Whence, then, did it happen that the sons of the Church were buried,
and a new people and a new creation required, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:18? Hence it easily appears that God is served by a remnant, although they
are not evident to human observation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This kingdom shall not pass away
to another people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this phrase the
Prophet means that this sovereignty cannot be transferred, as in the other
instances. Darius was conquered by Alexander, and his posterity was
extinguished, till at length God destroyed that ill-fated Macedonian race, until
no one survived who boasted himself to be sprung from that-family. With respect
to the Romans, although they continued to exist, yet they were so disgraceful]y
subjected to the tyranny of strangers and barbarians, as to be completely
covered with shame and utterly disgraced. Then, as to the reign of Christ, he
cannot be deprived of the empire conferred upon him, nor can we who are his
members lose the kingdom of which he has made us partakers. Christ, therefore,
both in himself and his members, reigns without any danger of change, because he
always remains safe and secure in his own person. As to ourselves, since we are
preserved by his grace, and he has received us under his own <i>care </i>and
protection, we are beyond the reach of danger; and, as I <i>have </i>already
said, our safety is ensured, for we cannot be deprived of the inheritance
awaiting us in heaven. We, therefore, who are kept by his power through faith,
as Peter says, may be secure and calm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:5,) because whatever Satan devises, and however the world attempts
various plans for our destruction, we shall still remain safe in Christ. <i>We
</i>thus see how the Prophet&#8217;s words ought to be understood, when he says
that this fifth empire is not to be transferred and alienated to another people.
The last clause of the sentence, which is this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall bruise and break all
other kingdoms, and shall stand perpetually
itself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>does not require any long
exposition. We have explained the manner in which Christ&#8217;s kingdom should
destroy all the earthly kingdoms of which Daniel had previously spoken; since
whatever is adverse to the only-begotten Son of God, must necessarily perish and
utterly vanish away. A Prophet exhorts all the kings of the earth to kiss the
Son.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;190212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:12.) Since neither the Babylonians, nor Persians, nor Macedonians, nor Romans,
submitted themselves to Christ, nay, even used their utmost efforts to oppose
him, they were the enemies of piety, and ought to be extinguished by
Christ&#8217;s kingdom; <i>because, </i>although the Persian empire was not in
existence when Christ appeared in the world, yet its remembrance was cursed
before God. For Daniel does not here touch only on those things which were
visible to men, but raises our minds higher, assuring us most clearly that no
true support on which we can rest can be found except in Christ alone. Hence he
pronounces, that without Christ all the splendor, and power, opulence, and might
of the world, is vain, and unstable, and worthless. He confirms the same
sentiment in the following verse, where God shewed the king of Babylon what
should happen in the last times, when he pointed out a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stone cut out of the mountain
without hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We stated Christ to be
cut out of the mountain without hands, because he was divinely sent, so that men
cannot claim anything for themselves in this respect, since God, when treating
of the redemption of his own people, speaks thus, by Isaiah, &#8212; Since God
saw no help in the world, he relied upon. his own arm and his own power.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:5.) As, therefore, Christ was sent only by his heavenly Father, he is said to
be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut out without
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile, we must consider what I have added in the
second place, that the humble and abject origin of Christ is denoted, since it
was like a rough and unpolished stone. With regard to the word
&#8220;mountain&#8221;, I have no doubt Daniel here, wished to shew
Christ&#8217;s reign to be sublime, and above the whole world. Hence the figure
of the mountain means, in my opinion, &#8212; Christ should not spring out of
the earth, but should come in the glory of his heavenly Father, as it is said in
the Prophet. And thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, art the least among the divisions of
Judah; yet out of thee shall a leader in Israel arise for me, and his reign
shall be from the days of eternity.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;330502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
5:2.) Daniel, then, here condescends to those gross imaginations to which our
minds are subjected. Because, at the beginning, Christ&#8217;s dignity did not,
appear so great as we discern it in the kings of the world, and to this day it
seems to some obscured by the shame of the cross, many, alas! despise him, and
do not acknowledge any dignity in him. Daniel, therefore, now raises aloft our
eyes and senses, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this stone should be cut out of
the mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Meanwhile, if any one
prefers taking the mountain for the elect people, I will not object to it, but
this seems to me not in accordance with the genuine sense of the Prophet. At
length he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the dream is
true, and its interpretation trustworthy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here Daniel securely and intrepidly asserts, that he does not bring forward
doubtful conjectures, but explains faithfully to King <i>Nebuchadnezzar </i>what
he has received from the Lord. Here he claims for himself the Prophetic
authority, to induce the king of Babylon to acknowledge him a sure and faithful
interpreter of God. We see how the prophets always spoke with this confidence,
otherwise all their teaching would be useless. If our faith depended on
man&#8217;s wisdom, or on anything of the kind, it would indeed be variable.
Hence it is necessary to determine this foundation of truth, &#8212; Whatever
the Prophets set before us proceeds from God; and the reason why they so
constantly insist on this is, lest their doctrine should be supposed to be
fabricated by men. Thus also in this place, Daniel first says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the dream is
true</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if he said, the dream is not a
common one, as the poets fable concerning a gate of horn; the dream is not
confused, as men imagine when scarcely sane, or stuffed with meat and drink, or
through bodily constitution, either melancholy or choleric. He states,
therefore, the king of Babylon&#8217;s dream to <i>have </i>been a <i>true
</i>oracle; and adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its
interpretation is certain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Where, as in
the next clause, the Prophet again urges his own authority, lest Nebuchadnezzar
should doubt his divine instructions to explain the truth of his dream. It now
follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When the king of Babylon
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fell upon his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is partly to be considered as
worthy of praise and partly of blame. It was a sign of both piety and modesty,
when he prostrated himself before God and his Prophet. We know the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fierceness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and pride of kings; nay, we see them act like madmen, because they do not
reckon themselves among mortals, and become blinded with the splendor of their
greatness. Nebuchadnezzar was really a very powerful monarch, and it was
difficult for him so to regulate his mind as to attribute the glory to God. Thus
the dream which Daniel explained could not be pleasing to him. He saw his
monarchy cursed before God, and about to perish in ignominy others, too, which
should succeed it were ordained in heaven; and though he might <i>receive
</i>some comfort from the destruction of the other kingdoms, yet it was very
harsh to delicate ears, to hear that a kingdom, which appeared most flourishing,
and which all men thought would be perpetual, was of but short duration and sure
to perish. As, therefore, the king so prostrated himself before Daniel, it is,
as I have said, a sign. of piety hi thus reverencing God, and in embracing the
prophecy, which would otherwise be bitter and distasteful. It was also a sign of
modesty, because he humbled himself so before God&#8217;s Prophet Thus far the
king of Babylon is worthy of praise, and we will discuss tomorrow the deficiency
in his reverence.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
TWELFTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said yesterday that King Nebuchadnezzar was worthy
of praise, because he prostrated himself before Daniel after he had heard the
narration of his dream and the interpretation which was added. For he gave them
some testimony of piety, since in the person of Daniel he adored the true God,
as we shall mention hereafter. Hence he shewed himself teachable, since the
prophet might, exasperate his mind; because tyrants can scarcely ever bear
anything to detract from their power. But he cannot be entirely excused.
Although he confesses the God of Israel to be the only God, yet he transfers a
part of his worship to a mortal man. Those who excuse this do not sufficiently
remember how profane men mingle heavenly and earthly things; though they
occasionally have right dispositions, yet they relax immediately to their own
superstitions. Without doubt the confession which we, shall meet with directly
was confined to this single occasion. Nebuchadnezzar was not really and
completely converted to true piety, so as to repent of his errors, but he
partially recognized the supreme power to be with the God of Israel. This
reverence, however, did not correct all his idolatries, but by a sudden impulse,
as I have said, he confessed Daniel to be a servant of the true God. At the same
time he did not depart from the errors to which he had been accustomed, and he
afterwards returned to greater hardness, as we shall find in the next chapter.
So also we see Pharaoh giving glory to God, but only for a moment,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
9:27, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
10:16;) meanwhile he continued determinately proud and cruel, and never put off
his original disposition. Our opinion of the king of Babylon ought to be of the
same kind, though different in degree. King Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s obstinacy was
not equal to the pride of Pharaoh. Each, indeed, showed some sign of reverence,
bug neither was truly and heartily submissive to the God of Israel. Hence he
bows before Daniel, not thinking him a God, but mingling and confounding, as
profane men do, black and white; and we know that from the beginning even the
dullest men had some perception of the only God. For no one ever denied the
existence of a Supreme Deity, but men afterwards fabricated for themselves a
multitude of gods, and transferred a part of the divine worship to mortals. As
King Nebuchadnezzar was involved in these errors, we are not surprised at his
adoring Daniel, and at the same time confessing there is but one God! And at
this day we see how all in the papacy confess this truth, and yet they tear up
the name of God, not in word, but in reality; for they so divide the worship of
God, that each has part of the spoil and the plunder. Daniel relates what
experience even now teaches us. This adoration was, it is true, commonly
received among the Chaldeans, since the Orientals were always extravagant in
their ceremonies, and we know their kings to have been adored as gods. But since
the word for sacrificing is here used, and the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjnm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mencheh, </i>for &#8220;<i>offering</i>&#8221;<i> </i>also occurs, it is
quite clear that Daniel was worshipped without consideration, as if he had been
a demigod dropped down from heaven. Hence we must conclude that king
Nebuchadnezzar did wrong in offering this honor to Daniel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There ought to be moderation in our respect for
God&#8217;s Prophets, as we should not extol them beyond their deserts; we know
the condition on which the Lord calls us forth &#8212; -that he alone may be
exalted, while all his teachers, and prophets, and servants, should remain in
their own position. A question arises concerning the Prophet himself, &#8212;
Why did he allow himself to be worshipped? For if Nebuchadnezzar sinned, as we
have said, the Prophet had no excuse for allowing it. Some commentators labor
anxiously to excuse him; but if he passed this by in silence, we must be
compelled to confess him in some degree corrupted by the allurements of the
court, since it is difficult to be familiar there without immediately being
subject to its contagion. The defense of any man, however perfect, ought never
to interfere With this fixed principle &#8212; nothing must be subtracted from
the honor of God, and &#8212; it is a mark of perverseness whenever and
howsoever the worship which is peculiar to God is transferred to creatures.
Perhaps Daniel decidedly refused this, and so restrained the folly of the king
of Babylon; but I leave the point in doubt, as nothing is said about it.
Although it is scarcely probable that he took no notice at the time, when he saw
the honor of God partly transferred to himself; for this would have been to make
himself a partaker of sacrilege and impiety. A holy Prophet could scarcely fall
into this snare. We know many things are omitted in the narrative, and Daniel
does not record what was done, but what the king ordered. He prostrated himself
on his face; but perhaps Daniel shewed this to be unlawful. When he ordered
sacrifice to be offered, Daniel might have rejected it as a great sill. For
Peter properly corrected the error of Cornelius, which was more tolerable, since
he wished to adore Peter after the common fashion. If, therefore, the Apostle
did not endure this, but boldly rebuked the deed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441026&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:26,) what must be said about the Prophet? But, as I have said, I dare not
assert anything on either side, unless what conjecture renders probable, that
God&#8217;s servant rejected this preposterous honor. If, indeed, he allowed it,
he had no excuse for his sin; but still, as we have said, it is very difficult
for those who desire to retain their purity to have much intercourse with
courts, without contracting some spots of corruption. We see this even in the
person of Joseph. Although he was completely dedicated to God, yet in his
language, as shown by his swearing, he was tainted by the Egyptian custom.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;014215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
42:15.) And since this was sinful in him, the same may be said of Daniel. Let us

<div><font face="Palatino">This confession is quite pious and holy, and is
fraught with rectitude and sincerity; it may even be taken as a proof of true
conversion and repentance. But, as I have lately reminded you, profane men are
sometimes seized with an admiration of God and then they profess largely and
copiously whatever may be expected from God&#8217;s true worshippers. Still this
is but momentary, for all the while they remain wrapt up in their own
superstitions. God, therefore, extorts this language from them, when they speak
so piously; but they inwardly retain their faults, and afterwards easily fall
back to their accustomed habits &#8212; as a memorable example will shortly
prove to us. Whatever sense be adopted, God wished his glory to be proclaimed by
the mouth of the profane king, and desired him to be the herald of his own power
and influence. But this was peculiarly profitable to those Jews who still
remained firm in their allegiance; for the greater part had revolted &#8212;
notoriously enough, and had degenerated with great facility from the pure
worship of God. When led into captivity, they became idolaters and apostates,
and denied the living God; but a small number of the pious remained; God wished
to promote their benefit, and to strengthen their minds when he drew this
confession from the king of Babylon. But another object was gained, since the
king as well as all the Chaldeans and Assyrians were rendered more excuseless.
For if the God of Israel was truly God, why did Bel in the meantime retain his
rank</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>? He is the God of
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;</i> then it must be added at
once, he is the enemy of false gods. We observe how Nebuchadnezzar here mingles
light with darkness, and black with white, while he confesses the God of Israel
to be supreme among gods, and set continues to worship other deities. For if the
God of Israel obtains his right, all idols vanish away. Hence, Nebuchadnezzar
contends with himself in this language. But, as I have said, he is seized by a
violent impulse, and is not quite in his senses when he so freely declares the
power of the only God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As far then as words go, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truly your God is himself a God
of gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The particle <i>truly </i>is by
no means superfluous here; it is strongly affirmative. For if any one had
inquired of him whether Bel and other idols were to be worshipped as gods, he
might answer, &#8220;<i>yes</i>;&#8221; but doubtfully, and according to
pre-conceived opinion, since all superstitious worshippers are perplexed, and if
ever they defend their superstitons, they do so with the rashness which the
devil suggests, but not according to their judgment. In truth, their minds are
not composed when they dare to assert their own superstitions to be pious and
holy. But Nebuchadnezzar seems here formally to renounce his own errors; as if
he had said &#8212; Hitherto I acknowledged other gods, but I now change my
opinion; I have discovered your God to be the chief of all gods. And, truly, if
he really spoke his own mind, he might <i>perceive </i>he was doing injustice to
his own idols, if there was any divinity in them; Israel&#8217;s God was
confessedly held in utter hatred and abomination by the profane nations. By
extolling him above all gods, he degrades Bel<i> </i>and the whole crew of false
gods which the Babylonian worshipped. But, as we have said, he was swayed by
impulse and spoke without thinking. He was in a kind of enthusiasm, since God
astonished him, and then drew him on to wonder at and to declare his own power.
He calls him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord of
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which eulogium he claims for
him the supreme dominion over the world; he means to assert that Israel&#8217;s
God not only excels all others, but holds the reins of government over the
world. For if he is the Lord of kings, all people are under his hand and
dominion! and the multitude of mankind cannot be drawn away from his empire, if
he rules their very monarchs. We understand, therefore, the meaning of these
words, namely, whatever deity is worshipped is inferior to the God of Israel,
because he is high above all gods; then his providence rules over the world,
while he is Lord of all peoples and kings, and governs all things by his
will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is a revealer of
secrets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is our proof of Divinity,
as we have said elsewhere. For Isaiah, when wishing to prove the existence of
only one God, takes these two principles, viz., Nothing happens without his
permission; and his foreseeing all things. (Daniel 48:3-5.) These two principles
have been inseparably unified. Although Nebuchadnezzar did not understand what
was the true peculiarity of Divinity, yet he is here impelled by the secret
instinct of God&#8217;s Spirit clearly to set forth God&#8217;s power and
wisdom. Hence he confesses the God of Israel to excel all gods, since he obtains
power in the whole world, and nothing whatever is concealed from him. He adds
the reason &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daniel could
reveal that secret</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This reason does not
seem very good one; for he infers the world to be governed by one God, because
Daniel made this secret known. But, then &#8220;this<i> </i>has no reference to
his power.&#8221; The answer to this remark is easy; we shewed elsewhere how we
ought not to imagine a god like Apollo who can only predict future events. And,
truly, it is far too insipid to attribute to God simple prescience, as if the
events of the world had any other dependence than upon his power; for God is
said to have a previous knowledge of future events, because he determined what
he wished to have done. Hence Nebuchadnezzar concluded the dominion of the whole
world to be in God&#8217;s hands, because he could predict futurity; for unless
he had the full power over the future, he could not predict anything with
certainty. As, therefore, he really predicts future; events, this clearly
determines all things to be ordained by him, and disproves the existence of
chance, while he fulfills whatever he has decreed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this passage, how insufficient it
is to celebrate God&#8217;s wisdom and power with noisy declamation, unless we
at the same time reject all superstitions from our minds, and so cling to the
only God as to bid all others heartily farewell. No fuller verbal confession can
be required than is here set before us; and yet we observe how Nebuchadnezzar
was always involved in Satan&#8217;s impostures, because he wished to retain his
false gods, and thought it sufficient to yield the first place to the God of
Israel. Let us learn again, to do our best in purging the mind front all
superstitions, that the only God may pervade all our senses. Meanwhile, we must
observe how severe and dreadful a judgment awaits Papists, and all like them,
who at least ought to be imbued with the rudiments of piety, while they confess
the existence of but one supreme God, and yet; mingle together a great multitude
of deities, and dishonor both his power and wisdom, and at the same time
observe, what is here said by a profane king. For the Papists not; only divide
God&#8217;s power, by distributing it in parts to each of their saints; but also
when they speak of God himself, they fancy him as knowing all things beforehand,
and yet; leaving all things contingent on man&#8217;s free will; first creating
all things, and then leaving every event in suspense. Hence heaven and earth, as
they bear either men&#8217;s merits; or crimes, at one time become useful, and
at another adverse to mankind. Truly enough, neither rain, nor heat, nor cloudy
nor serene weather, nor anything else happens without God&#8217;s permission;
and whatever is adverse is a sign of his curse; whatever is prosperous and
desirable is the sign of his favor. This, indeed, is true, but when the Papists
lay their foundation in the will of man, we see how they deprive God of his
rights. Let us learn, then, from this passage, not to attribute to God less than
was conceded by this profane king.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here also another point is added, namely, how King
Nebuchadnezzar raised God&#8217;s Prophet and adorned him with the highest
honors. We have spoken of that preposterous worship which he himself displayed
and commanded others to offer. As far as concerns gifts and the discharge of
public duties, we can neither condemn Nebuchadnezzar for honoring God&#8217;s
servant, nor yet Daniel for suffering himself to be thus exalted. All
God&#8217;s servants ought to take care not to make a gain of their office, and
we know how very pestilent the disease is when prophets and teachers are
addicted to gain, or easily receive the gifts offered them. For where there is
no contempt of money, many vices necessarily spring up, since all avaricious and
covetous men adulterate God&#8217;s word and makes, traffic of it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:17.) Hence all prophets and ministers of God ought to watch
against being covetous of gifts. But as far as Daniel is concerned, he might
receive what the king offered him just as Joseph could lawfully undertake the
government of the whole of Egypt.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;014140&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
41:40.) There is no doubt that Daniel had other views than his private and
personal advantage. We must not believe him covetous of gain while he bore his
exile so patiently, and, besides this, when at the hazard of his life he had
preferred abstinence from the royal food to alienating himself from the people
of God. As he manifestly preferred the shame of the cross by which God&#8217;s
people were then oppressed, to opulence, luxury, and honor, who will think him
blinded by avarice through receiving gifts? But since he saw the sons of God
miserably and cruelly oppressed by the Chaldeans, he wished as far as he could
to succor them in their miseries. As he well knew this would afford some
consolation and support to his race, he allowed himself to be made prefect of a
province. And the same reason influenced him to seek some place of authority for
his companions, as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Some ambition may be noticed here in the Prophet,
since he procures honors for his own companions. For when the king spontaneously
offers him a command, he is obliged to accept it; he need not offend the mind of
the proud king. There was a necessity for this, because he himself seeks from
the king prefectships for others. What shall we say was the origin of this
conduct? As I have already hinted, Daniel may be here suspected of ambition, for
it might be charged against him as a crime that he made a gain of the doctrine
which he had been divinely taught. But, he rather regarded his people, and
wished to bring some comfort to them when oppressed. For the Chaldeans treated
their slaves tyrannically, and we are aware how the Jews were utterly hated by
the whole world. When therefore Daniel, through the feeling of pity, seeks some
consolation from the people of God, there is no reason for accusing him of any
fault, because he was not drawn aside by private advantage, and did not desire
honors for either himself or his companions; but he was intent on that object to
enable his companions to succor the Jews in their troubles. Hence the authority
which he obtains for them has no other object than to cause the Jews to be
treated a little more humanely, as their condition would not be so harsh and
bitter while they have prefects of their own people who should study to treat
them as brethren. We now see how Daniel may be rightly acquitted of this charge
without any difficulty or argument; for the matter itself is sufficiently clear,
and we may readily collect that Daniel was both pious and humane, and free from
all charge of sin. From the words &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was in the king&#8217;s gate,
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>we </i>ought not to understand his being a
gate-keeper. Some suppose this phrase to be used, because they were accustomed
to exercise justice there; but they transfer to the Chaldeans what Scripture
teaches us of the Jews. I take it more simply. Daniel was chief over the
king&#8217;s court, since he held the supreme command there; and that sense is
more genuine. Besides, we are fully aware of the custom of the Chaldeans and
Assyrians to make the approach to the king difficult. Daniel is therefore said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be at the
gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to prevent any entrance into the

<div><font face="Palatino">Very probably this statue was not erected by King
Nebuchadnezzar within a short period, as the Prophet does not notice how many
years had passed away; for it is not probable that it was erected within a short
time after he had confessed the God of Israel to be the Supreme Deity. Yet as
the Prophet is silent, we need not discuss the matter. Some of the rabbis think
this statue to have been erected as an expiation; as if Nebuchadnezzar wished to
avert the effect of his dream by this charm, as they say. But their guess is
most frivolous We may inquire, however, whether Nebuchadnezzar deified himself
or really erected this statue to Bel the principal deity of the Chaldeans, or
invented some new-fangled divinity? Many incline to the opinion that he wished
to include himself in the number of the deities, but this is not certain &#8212;
at least I do not think so. Nebuchadnezzar seems to me rather to have
consecrated this statue to some of the deities; but, as superstition is always
joined with ambition and pride, very likely Nebuchadnezzar was also induced by
vain glory and luxury to erect this statue. As often as the superstitious incur
expense in building temples and in fabricating idols, if any one asks them their
object, they immediately reply &#8212; they do it in honor of God! At the same
time they are all promoting their own fame and reputation. All the superstitious
reckon God&#8217;s worship valueless, and rather wish to acquire for themselves
favor and estimation among men. I readily admit this to have been
Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s intention, and indeed I am nearly certain of it. But at
the same time some pretense to piety was joined with it; for he pretended that
he wished to worship God. Hence, also, what I formerly mentioned appears more
clear, namely, &#8212; King Nebuchadnezzar was not truly and heartily converted,
but rather remained fixed in his own errors, when he was attributing glory to
the God of Israel. As I have already said, that confession of his was limited,
and he now betrays what he nourished in his heart; for when he erected the
statue he did not return to his own natural disposition, but; rather his
impiety, which was hidden for a time, was then detected. For that remarkable
confession could not be received as a proof of change of mind. All therefore
would have said he was a new man, if God had not wished it to be made plain that
he was held bound and tied by the chains of Satan, and was still a slave to his
own errors. God wished then to present this example to manifest Nebuchadnezzar
to be always impious, although through compulsion he gave some glory to the God
of Israel.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
THIRTEENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began in the last Lecture to treat of THE GOLDEN
STATUE which Nebuchadnezzar erected, and placed in the plain or open country of
Dura. We stated this statue to have been erected for a religious reason, when
the ambition of that king or tyrant was at its full sway, which we may always
observe in the superstitious. For although they always put forward the name of
God, and persuade themselves that they are worshipping <i>God, </i>yet pride
always impels them to desire the approbation of the world. Such was the desire
of King Nebuchadnezzar in erecting this statue, as its very magnitude displays.
For the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the height
of the statue was sixty cubits, and its breadth six
cubits.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Such a mass must have cost much
expense, for the image was made of gold. Probably this gold was acquired by much
rapine and plunder; but whether it was so or not, we may here view, as I have
said, the profane king so worshipping God as to propagate the remembrance of his
own name to posterity. The region in which he placed the image seems to imply
this. Without doubt the Prophet here points out some celebrated place which men
were accustomed to frequent for the sake of merchandise and other necessities.
But as far as the king&#8217;s special intention is concerned, we stated their
conjecture to be out of place who think the statue to have been erected for the
sake of expiating his dream. It is more probable, since the Jews were dispersed
throughout Assyria and Chaldea, that this image was erected, lest those
foreigners who were exiles from their country should introduce any novelty. This
conjecture carries some weight with it; for Nebuchadnezzar knew the Jews to be
so attached to the God of their fathers as to be averse to all the superstitions
of the Gentiles. He feared, therefore, lest they should seduce others to their
own opinions, and he wished to counteract this by erecting a new statue, and
commanding all his subjects to bow down to it. Meanwhile, we see how quickly the
acknowledgment of Israel&#8217;s God, whose glory and power he had so lately
celebrated, had vanished from his mind! Now this trophy is erected to reproach
him, as if he had been vanquished as well as the idols of the heathen. But, we
have said elsewhere, Nebuchadnezzar never seriously acknowledged the God of
Israel, but by a sudden impulse was compelled to confess him to be the Supreme
and only God, though he was all the while drowned in his own superstitions.
Hence his confession was rather the result of astonishment, and did not proceed
from true change of heart. Let us now come to the remainder:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We see how Nebuchadnezzar wished to establish among
all the nations under his sway a religion in which there, should be no mixture
of foreign novelty. He feared dissension as a cause of disunion in his empire.
Hence we may suppose the king to have consulted his own private ease and
advantage, as princes are accustomed to consult their own wishes rather than
God&#8217;s requirements in promulgating edicts concerning the worship of God.
And from the beginning, this boldness and rashness have increased in the world,
since those who have had supreme power have always dared to fabricate deities,
and have proceeded beyond this even to ordering the gods which they have
invented to be worshipped. The different kinds of gods are well known as divided
into three &#8212; the PHILOSOPHICAL, the POLITICAL, and the POETICAL. They
called those gods &#8220;PHILOSOPHICAL&#8221; which<i> </i>natural reason
prompts men to worship. Truly, indeed, philosophers are often foolish when they
dispute about the essence or worship of God; but since they follow their own
fancies they are necessarily erroneous. For God cannot be apprehended by human
senses, but must be made manifest. to us by his own word; and as he descends to
us, so we also in turn are raised to heaven.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:14.) But yet philosophers in their disputes have some pretexts, so
as not to seem utterly insane and irrational. But the poets have fabled whatever
pleases them, and thus have filled the world with the grossest and at the same
time the foulest errors. As all theaters resounded with their vain imaginations,
the minds of the vulgar have been imbued with the same delusions; for we know
human dispositions are ever prone to vanity. But when the devil adds fire to the
fuel, we then see how furiously both learned and unlearned are carried away. So
it; happened when they persuaded themselves of the truth of what they saw
represented in their theaters. Thus, that; religion which was founded on the
authority of the Magi was considered certain by the heathen, as they called
those gods &#8220;POLITICAL&#8221;<i> </i>which were received by the common
consent of all. Those also who were considered prudent said it was by no means
useful to object to what the philosophers taught concerning the nature of the
gods, since this would tear asunder all public rites, and whatever was fixed
without; doubt in men&#8217;s minds. For both the Greeks and Latins, as well as
other barbarous nations, worshipped certain gods as he mere offspring of
opinion, and these they confessed to have once been mortal. But philosophers at
least retained this principle &#8212; the gods are eternal; and if the
philosophers had been listened to, the authority of the Magi would have fallen
away. Hence the most worldly-wise were not ashamed, as I have mentioned, to urge
the expulsion of philosophy from sacred things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the POETS, the most politic were
compelled to succumb to the petulance of the common people, and yet they taught
at the same time what the poets reigned and fabled concerning the nature of the
gods was pernicious. This, then, was the almost universal rule throughout the
world as to the worship of God, and the very foundation of piety &#8212; namely,
no deities are to be worshipped except those which have been handed down from
our forefathers. And this is the tendency of the oracle of Apollo which Xenophon
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f175</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the character of Socrates so greatly praises, namely, every city ought, to
worship the gods of its own country! For when Apollo was consulted concerning
the best religion, with the view of cherishing the errors by which all nations
were intoxicated, he commanded them not to change anything in their public
devotions, and pronounced that religion the best for every city and people which
had been received from the furthest antiquity. This was a wonderful imposture of
the devil, as he was unwilling to stir up men&#8217;s minds to reflect upon what
was really right, but he retained them in that old lethargy<i> &#8212;
</i>&#8220;Ha! the authority of your ancestors is sufficient for you!&#8221; The
greatest wisdom among the profane was, as I have said, to cause consent to be
taken for reason. Meanwhile, those who were supreme either in empire, or
influence, or dignity, assumed to themselves the right of fashioning new
deities; for we see how many dedicated temples to fictitious deities, because
they were commanded by authority. Hence it is by no means surprising for
Nebuchadnezzar to take this license of setting up a new deity. Perhaps he
dedicated this statue to Bel, who is considered as the Jupiter of the Chaldeans;
but yet he wished to introduce a new religion by means of which his memory might
be celebrated by posterity. Virgule 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
derides this folly when he says:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he increases the number of deities by altars. For
he means, however men may erect numerous altars on earth, they cannot increase
the number of the gods in heaven. Thus, therefore, Nebuchadnezzar increased the
number of the deities by a single altar, that is, introduced a new rite to make
the statue a monument to himself, and his own name famous as long as that
religion flourished. Here we perceive how grossly he abused his power; for he
did not consult his own Magi as he might have done, nor even reflect within
himself whether that religion was lawful or not; but through being blinded by
pride, he wished to fetter the minds of all, and to compel them to adopt what he
desired . Hence we gather how vain profane men are when they pretend to worship,
God, while at the same time they wish to be superior to God himself. For they do
not admit any pure thought, or even apply themselves to the knowledge of God,
but they make their will law, just as it pleases them. They do not adore God,
but rather their own fiction. Such was the pride of King Nebuchadnezzar, as
appears from his own edict.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>King Nebuchadnezzar sent to collect
all the satraps, generals, and prefects, to come to the dedication of the image,
which King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The name of the king is always added, except in one place, as though the
royal power raised mortals to such a height that they could. fabricate deities
by their own right! We observe how the<i> </i>king of Babylon claimed the right
of causing the statue to be worshipped as a god, while it was not set up by any
private or ordinary person but by the king himself. While, the royal power is
rendered conspicuous in the world, kings do not acknowledge it to be their duty
to restrain themselves within the bounds of law, so long as they remain obedient
to God. And at this day we see with what arrogance all earthly monarchs conduct
themselves. For they never inquire what is agreeable to the word of God, and in
accordance with <i>sincere piety; </i>but they defend the errors received from
their forefathers, by the interposition of the royal name, and think their own
previous decision to be sufficient, and object to the worship of any god, except
by their permission and decree. With respect<i> </i>to the dedication, we know
it to have been customary among the heathens to consecrate their pictures and
statues before they adored them. And to this day the same error is maintained in
the Papacy. For as long as images remain with the statuary or the painter, they
ax not venerated; but as soon as an image is dedicated by any private
ceremony,<i> </i>(which the Papists call a &#8220;devotion,&#8221;)<i> </i>or by
any public and solemn rite, the tree,<i> </i>the wood, the stone, and the colors
become a god! The Papists also have fixed ceremonies among their exorcisms in
consecrating statues and pictures. Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, when he wished his
image to be esteemed in the place of God, consecrated it by a solemn rite, and
as we have said, this usage was customary among the heathen. He does not here
mention the common people, for all could not assemble in one place; but the
prefects and elders were ordered to come, and they would bring numerous
attendants with them then they bring forward the king&#8217;s edict, and each
takes care to erect some monument in his own province, whence it may spread the
appearance of all their subjects worshipping as a god the statue which the king
had erected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows &#8212; All
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the satraps, prefects, generals,
elders, treasurers, and magistrates came and stood before the image which King
Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not
surprising that the prefects obeyed the king&#8217;s edict, since they had no
religion but what they had received from their fathers. But obedience to the
king weighed with them more then reverence for antiquity; as in these times, if
any king either invents a new superstition, or departs from the papacy, or
wishes to restore God&#8217;s pure worship, a sudden change is directly
perceived in all prefects, and in all countries, and senators. Why so? Because
they had neither fear God nor sincerely reverence him, but depend on the
king&#8217;s will and flatter him like slaves, and thus they all approve, and if
need be applaud, whatever pleases the king. It is not surprising then if the
Chaldean elders, who knew nothing experimentally of the true God or of true
piety, are so prone to worship this statue. Hence also, we collect the great
instability of the profane, who have never been taught true religion in the
school of God. For they will bend every moment to any breezes, just as leaves
are moved by the wind blowing among trees; and because they have never taken
root in God&#8217;s truth, they are necessarily changeable, and are borne hither
and thither with every blast. But a king&#8217;s edict is not simply a wind, but
a violent tempest, and no one can oppose their decrees with impunity;
consequently those who are not solidly based upon God&#8217;s word, do not act
from true piety, but are borne away by the strength of the
storm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards added &#8212; A
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>herald cried out
lustily,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> or </i>among. the multitude. This
latter explanation does not suit so well &#8212; the herald crying amidst the
multitude &#8212; -since there were a great concourse of nations, and the
kingdom of Babylon comprehended many provinces.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
herald</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cried with a loud voice, An edict
is gone forth for you, O nations, peoples, and
tongues.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This would strike them with
terror, since the king made no exception to his command for every province to
worship his idol; for each person would observe the rest, and when every one
sees the whole multitude <i>obedient, </i>no one would dare to refuse; hence all
liberty is at an end. It now follows, &#8212; When
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye hear the sound of the trumpet
or horn, harp, pipe, psaltery, sackbut, etc., ye must fall down and adore the
image. But whoever did not fall down before it, should be cast the same hour
into a burning fiery furnace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This would
excite the greater terror, since King Nebuchadnezzar sanctioned this impious
worship with a punishment so severe; for he was not content with a usual kind of
death, but commanded every one who did not worship the statue to be cast into
the fire. Now, this denunciation of punishment sufficiently demonstrates now the
king suspected some of rebellion. There would have been no dispute if Jews had
not been mixed with Chaldeans ,and Assyrians, for they always worshipped the
same gods, and it was a prevailing custom with them to worship those deities
whom their kings approved. Hence it appears that the statue was purposely
erected to give the king an opportunity of accurately ascertaining whether the
Jews, as yet unaccustomed to Gentile superstitions, were obedient to his
command. He wished to cause the sons of Abraham to lay aside sincere piety, and
to submit to his corruption&#8217;s, by following the example of others, and
framing their conduct according to the king&#8217;s will and the practice of the
people among whom they dwelt. But we shall treat this
hereafter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Respecting the required adoration, nothing but
outward observance was needed. King Nebuchadnezzar did not exact a verbal
profession of belief in this deity, that is, in the divinity of the statue which
he commanded to be worshipped; it was quite sufficient to offer to it merely
outward worship. We here see how idolatry is deservedly condemned in those who
pretend to worship idols, even if they mentally refrain and only act through
fear and the compulsion of regal authority. that excuse is altogether frivolous.
We see, then, how this king or tyrant, though he fabricated this image by the
cunning of the devil, exacted nothing else than the bending the knees of all the
people and nations before the statue. And truly he had in this way alienated the
Jews from the worship of the one true God, if this had been extorted from them.
For God wishes first of all for inward worship, and afterwards for outward
profession. The principal altar for the worship of God ought to be situated in
our minds, for God is worshipped spiritually by faith, prayer, and other acts of
piety.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24.) It is also necessary to add outward profession, not only that we may
exercise ourselves in God&#8217;s worship, but offer ourselves wholly to him,
and bend before him both bodily and mentally, and devote ourselves entirely to
him, as Paul teaches.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460734&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:34;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 5:23.) Thus far, then, concerning both the adoration and the
penalty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows <i>again, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As soon as the burst of the
trumpets was heard and the sound of so many instruments, all nations, peoples,
and tongues fell down and adored the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here I may repeat what I said before
&#8212; all men were very obedient to the injunctions of their monarchs;
whatever they ordered was obeyed, so long as it did not cause complete ruin; and
they often bore the heaviest burdens with the view of perfect conformity. But we
must remark how our propensities have always a vicious tendency. If King
Nebuchadnezzar had commanded the God of Israel to be worshipped, and all temples
to be overthrown, and all altars throughout his empire to be thrown down, very
great tumults would doubtless have arisen; for the devil so fascinates
men&#8217;s minds that they remain pertinaciously fixed in the errors which they
have imbibed. Hence the Chaldeans, Assyrians, and others would never have been
induced to obey without the greatest difficulty. But now, on the appearance of
the signal, they directly fall down and adore the golden statue. Hence we may
learn to reflect upon our own character, as in a mirror, with the view of
submitting ourselves to God&#8217;s Word, and of being immovable in the right
faith, and of standing unconquered in our consistency, whatever kings may
command. Although a hundred deaths may threaten us, they must not weaken our
faith, for unless God restrain us by his Curb, we should instantly start aside
to every species of vanity; and especially if a king introduces
corruption&#8217;s among us, we are immediately carried away by them, and, as we
said, are far too prone to vicious and perverse modes of worship. The Prophet
repeats again the king&#8217;s name to shew us how little the multitude thought
of pleasing God; never considering whether the worship was sacred and sound, but
simply content; with the king&#8217;s nod. The Prophet deservedly condemns this
easy indifference.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We should learn also from this passage, not to be
induced, by the will of any man to embrace any kind of religion, but diligently
to inquire what worship God approves, and so to. use our judgment as not rashly
to involve ourselves in any superstitions. Respecting the use of musical
instruments, I confess it to be customary in the Church even by God&#8217;s
command; but the intention of the Jews and of the Chaldeans was different. For
when the Jews used trumpets and harps and other instruments in celebrating
God&#8217;s praises, they ought not to have obtruded this custom on God as if it
was the proof of piety; but it ought to have another object, since God wished to
use all means of stirring men up from their sluggishness, for we know how cold
we grow in the pursuits of <i>piety, </i>unless we are aroused. God, therefore,
used these stimulants to cause the Jews to worship him with greater fervor. But
the Chaldeans thought to satisfy their god by heaping together many musical
instruments. For, like other persons, they supposed God like themselves, for
whatever delights us, we think must also please the Deity. Hence the immense
heap of ceremonies in the Papacy, since our eyes delight in such splendors;
hence we think this to be required of us by God, as if he delighted in what
pleases us. This is, indeed, a gross error. There is no doubt that the harp,
trumpet, and other musical instruments with which Nebuchadnezzar worshipped his
idol, formed a part of his errors, and so also did the gold. God, indeed, wished
his sanctuary to manifest some splendor; not that gold, silver, and precious
stones please him by themselves, but he wished to commend his glory to his
people, since under this figure they might understand why everything precious
should be offered to God, as it is sacred to him. The Jews, indeed, had many
ceremonies, and much of what is called magnificent splendor in the worship of
God, and still the principle of spiritual worship yet remained among them. The
profane, while they invented gross deities which they reverenced according to
their pleasure, thought it a proof of perfect sanctity, if they sang
beautifully, if they used plenty of gold and silver, and if they employed showy
utensils in these sacrifices. I must leave the rest for
tomorrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, since we always

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Although their intention is not here expressed who
accused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, yet we gather from this event that the
thing was most probably done on purpose when the king set up the golden image.
We see how they were observed, and, as we said <i>yesterday, </i>Nebuchadnezzar
seems to have followed the common practice of kings. For although they proudly
despise God, yet they arm themselves with religion to strengthen their power,
and pretend to encourage the worship of God for the single purpose of retaining
the people in obedience. When, therefore, the Jews were mingled with Chaldeans
and Assyrians, the king expected to meet with many differences of opinion, and
so he placed the statue in a celebrated place by way of trial and experiment,
whether the Jews would adopt the Babylonian rites. Meanwhile this passage
teaches us how the king was probably instigated by his counselors, as they were
indignant at strangers being made prefects of the province of Babylon while they
were slaves; for they had become exiles by the right of warfare. Since then the
Chaldeans were indignant, they were impelled by envy to suggest this advice to
the king. For how did they so suddenly discover that the Jews paid no reverence
to the statue, and especially Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Truly, the thing
speaks for itself. These men watched to see what the Jews would do and hence we
readily ascertain how they, from the beginning, laid the snare by advising the
king to fabricate the statue. And when they tumultuously accuse the Jews, we
perceive how they were filled with envy and hatred. It may be said, they were
inflamed with jealousy, since superstitious men wish to impose the same law upon
all, and then their passion is increased by cruelty. But simple rivalry, as we
may perceive, corrupted the Chaldeans, and caused them clamorously to accuse the
Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain whether they spoke of the whole
nation generally, namely, of all the exiles, or pointed out those three persons
only. The accusation was probably restricted to Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego. If these three could be broken down, the victory over the rest was
easy. But few could be found in the whole people hardy enough to resist. We may
well believe these clamorers wished to attack those whom they knew to be
spirited and consistent beyond all others, and also to degrade them from those
honors which they could not bear them to enjoy. It may be asked, then, why did
they spare Daniel, since he would never consent to dissemble by worshipping the
statue which the king commanded to be set up? They must have let Daniel alone
for the time, since they knew him to be in favor wig the king; but they brought
the charge against these three, because they could be oppressed with far less
trouble. I think them to have been induced by this cunning in not naming Daniel
with the other three, lest his favor should mitigate the king&#8217;s wrath. The
form of accusation is added &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O king, live for
ever!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was the common
salutation.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Thou, O
king!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>this<i> </i>is emphatic,
as if they had said, &#8220;Thou hast uttered this edict from thy royal
authority, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whoever hears the
sound of the trumpet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or horn,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>harp, pipe, psaltery, and other
musical instruments, shall fall down before the golden statue; whoever should
refuse to do this should be cast into the burning fiery furnace. But here are
some Jews whom thou hast set over the administration of the province of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They add this through hatred,
and through reproving the ingratitude of men admitted to such high honor and yet
despising the king&#8217;s authority, and inducing others to follow the same
example of disrespect. We see then how this was said to magnify their crime.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king has set them over the
province of Babylon, and yet these men do not adore the golden image nor worship
the gods.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is the crime. We see how
the Chaldeans, throughout the whole speech, condemn Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego of this single crime &#8212; a refusal to obey the king&#8217;s edict.
They enter into no dispute about their own religion, for it would not have
suited their purpose to allow any question to be raised as to the claim their
own deities had to supreme adoration. They omit, therefore, everything which
they perceive would not suit them, and seize upon this weapon &#8212; the king
is treated with contempt, because Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego do not
worship the image as the king&#8217;s edict ordered them to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, again, we see how the superstitious do not
apply their minds to the real inquiry how they should piously and properly
worship God; but they neglect this duty and follow their own audacity and lust.
Since therefore the Holy Spirit sets before us such rashness, as in a mirror,
let us learn. that God cannot approve of our worship unless it be offered. up
with truth. Here human authority is utterly unavailing, because unless we are
sure that our religion is pleasing to. God, whatever man can do for us will only
add to our weakness. While we observe those holy men charged with the crime of
ingratitude and rebellion, we in these times ought not to be grieved by it.
Those who calumniate us reproach us with despising the edicts of kings who wish
to bind us by their errors; but, as we shall see by and bye, our defense is
obvious and easy. Meanwhile we ought to undergo this infamy before the world, as
if we were disobedient and unmanageable; and with respect to ingratitude, even
if a thousand wicked men should lead us with reproaches, we must bear their
calumnies for the time patiently, until the Lord shall shine upon us as the
assertor of our innocence. It now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This narrative clearly assures us, how kings consult
only their own grandeur by a show of piety, when they claim the place of their
deities. For it seems very wonderful for King Nebuchadnezzar to insult all the
gods, as if there was no power in heaven unless what he approved off
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What god, says he, can pluck out
of my hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>Why then did he worship any
deity? Simply to retain the people by a curb, and fires to strengthen his own
power, without the slightest affection of piety abiding within his mind. At the
beginning Daniel relates how the king was inflamed with wrath. For nothing is
more troublesome to kings than to see their authority despised; they wish every
one to be obedient to themselves, even when their commands are most unjust After
the king is cool again, he asks Shadraeh, Meshaeh, and Abed-nego, whether they
were prepared to worship his god and his golden image? Since he addresses them
doubtfully, and gives them a free choice, his words imply moderation. He seems
to free them from all blame, if they will only bow themselves down hereafter. He
now adds directly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if ye are not
prepared, behold I will throw you into a furnace of burning
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and at length breaks forth into
that sacrilegious and dreadful blasphemy &#8212; There is no god who can deliver
the saints alive out of his hand!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see, then, in the person of Nebuchadnezzar, how
kings swell with pride, while they pretend some zeal for piety; since in reality
no reverence for God influences them, while they expect all men to obey every
command. And thus, as I have said, they rather substitute themselves for God,
than desire to worship him and promote his glory. This is the meaning of the
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the statue which I have
created, and which I have made; </i></font><font face="Palatino">as if he had
said, You are not allowed to deliberate about worshipping this image or not,; my
orders ought to be sufficient for you. I have erected it purposely and
designedly; it was your duty simply to obey me. We see then how he claims the
supreme power, by fashioning a god. Nebuchadnezzar is not now treating matters
of state policy; he wishes the statue to he adored as a deity, because he had
decreed it, and had promulgated his edict. And we must always remember what I
have touched upon, namely, this example of pride is set before us, to shew us
not to attach ourselves to any religion with rashness, but to listen to God and
depend on his authority and commands, since if we listen to man, our errors
would be endless. Although kings are so proud and ferocious, yet we must be
guided by this rule &#8212; Nothing pleases God but what he has commanded in his
word; and the principle of true piety is the obedience which we ought to render
to him alone. With respect to blasphemy, it clearly demonstrates my previous
assertion, however kings put forward some desire for piety, yet they despise
every deity, and think of nothing but extolling their own magnificence. Hence,
they traffic in the name of God to attract greater reverence towards themselves;
but at the same time, if they choose to change their deities a hundred times
a-day, no sense of religion will hinder them. Religion, then, is to the kings of
the earth nothing but a pretext; but they have neither reverence nor fear of God
in their minds, as the language of this profane king proves. <i>What God?
</i>says he, clearly there is no God. If any one reply &#8212; he speaks
comparatively, since he here defends the glory of his own god whom he
worshipped, still he utters this blasphemy against all gods, and is impelled by
intolerable arrogance and diabolical fury. We are now coming to the principal
point where Daniel relates the constancy with which Shadraeh, Meshach, and
Abed-nego were endued.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this history it; is necessary to observe with what
unbroken spirit these three holy men persisted in the fear of God, though they
knew they were in danger of instant death. When, therefore, this kind of death
was placed straight before their eyes, they did not turn aside from the
straightforward course, but treated God&#8217;s glory of greater value than
their own life, nay, than a hundred lives, if they had so many to pour forth,
and opportunity had been given them. Daniel does not relate all their words, but
only their import, in which the unconquered virtue of that Holy Spirit, by which
they had been instructed, is sufficiently evident; for that denunciation was
<i>certainly </i>dreadful, when the king said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye are not prepared to fall
down at the sound of the trumpet before the image, its all over with you, and ye
shall be directly cast into a furnace of
fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When the king had so fulminated,
they might have winced, as men usually do, since life is naturally dear to us,
and a dread of death seizes upon our senses. But Daniel relates all these
circumstances, to assure us of the great fortitude of God&#8217;s servants when
they are led by his Spirit, and yield to no threats, and succumb to no terrors.
They answer the king, We do not need any long deliberation. For when they say
they care not, they mean by this word, the matter is settled; just as that
sentence of Cyprian is related by Augustine, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f188</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when courtiers persuaded him to preserve his life, for it was with great
reluctance that the emperor devoted him to death, when flatterers on all sides
urged him to redeem his life by the denial of piety, he answered, There can be
no deliberation in a matter so sacred.! Thus those holy men say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We do not
care,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we do not enter into the
consideration of what is expedient or useful, no such thing! for we ought to
settle it with ourselves never to be induced by any reason to withdraw from the
sincere worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If you please to read &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we ought not to answer
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the sense will be the same. They
imply that the fear of death was set before them in vain, because they had
determined and resolved in their inmost souls, not to depart a single inch from
the true and lawful worship of God. Besides they here give a double reason for
rejecting the king&#8217;s proposal. They say God has sufficient power and
strength to liberate them; and then, even if they must die, their life is not of
so much value as to deny God for the sake of preserving it. Hence they<i>
</i>declare themselves prepared to die, if the king persists in urging his wish
for the adoration of the image. This passage is therefore worthy of the greatest
attention. First of all we must observe the answer &#8212; for when men entice
us to deny<i> </i>the true God we must close our ears, and refuse all
deliberation; for we have already committed an atrocious insult against God,
when we even question the propriety of swerving from the purity of his worship
through any impulse or any reason whatever. And I heartily wish every one would
observe this! How excellent and striking is the glory of God, and how everything
ought to yield to it, whenever there is danger of its being either diminished or
obscured. But at this day, this fallacy deceives the multitude, since they think
it lawful to debate whether it is allowable to swerve front the true worship of
God for a time, whenever any utility presents itself on the opposite side. Just
as in our days, we see how hypocrites, of whom the world is full, have pretenses
by which they cloak their delinquencies, when they either worship idols with the
impious, or deny at one time openly, and at another obliquely, true piety.
&#8220;Oh! what can happen? &#8212; such a one will say &#8212; of what value is
consistency? I see some evident advantage if I can only dissemble a little, and
not betray what I am. Ingenuousness is injurious not only to me privately, but
to all around me!&#8221; If a king has none around him who endeavor to appease
his wrath, the wicked would give way to their passions, and by their greater
license would drive him to the extremity of cruelty. It is, therefore, better to
have, some mediators on the watch to observe whether the wicked. are planning
anything. Thus, if they cannot openly, they may covertly avert danger from the
heads of the pious. By such reasoning as this, they think they can satisfy God.
As if Shadraeh, Meshaeh, and Abed-nego, had not the same excuse; as if the
following thought would not occur to them &#8212; &#8220;Behold! we are armed
with some power in favor of our brethren; now what barbarity, what cruelty will
be exercised against them, if the enemies of the religion which they profess
succeed us? For as far as they can, they will overthrow and blot out our race
and the very remembrance of piety. Is it not better for us to yield for a time
to the tyranny and violent edict of the king than to leave our places empty?
which the furious will by and bye occupy, who will utterly destroy our wretched
race which is now dreadfully oppressed.&#8221; Shadraeh, Meshaeh, and Abed-nego
might, I say, collect all these pretenses and excuses to palliate their perfidy
if they had bent the knee before the golden image for the sake of avoiding
danger; but they did not act thus. Hence, as I have already said, God retains
his rights entire when his worship is upheld without the slightest doubt, and we
are thoroughly persuaded that nothing is of such importance as to render it
lawful and right to swerve from that profession which his word both demands and
exacts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the whole, that security which ought to confirm
the pious in the worship of God is opposed here to all those tortuous and
mistaken counsels which some men adopt, and thus, for the sake of living, lose
life itself, according to the sentiment of even a profane poet. For of what use
is life except to serve God&#8217;s glory? but we lose that object in life for
the sake of the life itself &#8212; that is, by desiring to live entirely to
the; world, we lose the very purpose of living! Thus, then, Daniel opposes the
simplicity which ought to mark the sons of God to all those excuses which
dissemblers invent. with the view of hiding their wickedness by a covering. We
<i>are not anxious, </i>say they, and why not.? Because we have already
determined God&#8217;s glory to be of more consequence than a thousand lives,
and the gratification of a thousand senses. Hence, when this magnanimity
flourishes, all hesitation will vanish, and those who are called upon to incur
danger through their testimony for the truth need never trouble themselves; for,
as I before said, their ears are closed to all the enticements of
Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And when they add &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is sufficiently powerful
to preserve us; and if not, we are prepared for
death,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they point out to us what ought
to raise our minds above all trials, namely, the preciousness of our life in
God&#8217;s sight, since he can liberate us if he pleases. Since, therefore, we
have sufficient protection in God, let us not think any method of preserving our
life better than to throw ourselves entirely on his protection, and to cast all
our cares upon him. And as to the second clause, we must remark this, even if
the Lord should wish to magnify his own glory by our death, we ought to offer up
this as a lawful sacrifice; and sincere piety does not flourish in our hearts
unless our minds are always prepared to make this sacrifice. Thus I wished to
remark these things shortly now, and with God&#8217;s permission, I will explain
them fully to-morrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, since we see the
impious carried away by their impure desires with so strong an impulse; and
while they are so puffed up with arrogance, may we learn true humility, and so
subject ourselves to thee that we may always depend upon thy word and always
attend to thy instructions. When we have learned what worship pleases thee, may
we constantly persist unto the end, and never be moved by any threats, or
dangers, or violence, from our position, nor drawn aside from our course; but by
persevering: obedience to thy word, may we shew our alacrity and obedience,
until thou dost acknowledge us as thy sons, and we are gathered to that eternal
inheritance which thou hast prepared for all members of Christ thy Son. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
FIFTEENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE said yesterday that the constancy of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, was based upon these two reasons:-Their certain
persuasion that God was the guardian of their life, and would free them from
present death by his power if it were useful. And also their determination to
die boldly and fearlessly, if God wished such a sacrifice to be<i> </i>offered.
What Daniel relates of these three men belongs to us all. Hence we may gather
this general instruction. When our danger for the truth&#8217;s sake is
imminent, we should learn to place our life in God&#8217;s hand, and then
bravely and fearlessly devote ourselves to death. As to the <i>first </i>point,
experience teaches us how very many turn aside from God and the profession of
faith, since they do not feel confidence in God&#8217;s power to liberate them.
It may be said with truth of us all &#8212; God takes care of us, since our life
is placed in his hand and will; but scarcely one in a hundred holds this deeply
and surely fixed in his heart, since every one takes his own way of preserving
his life, as if there were no virtue in God. Hence he has made some proficiency
in God&#8217;s word who has learnt to place his life in God&#8217;s care,<i>
</i>and to consider it safe under his protection. For if he has made progress
thus far, he may be in danger a hundred times, yet he will never hesitate to
follow whenever he is called. This one feeling frees him from all fear and
trembling, since God can extricate his servants from a thousand deaths, as it is
said in the Psalm, (Psalm 68:20,) The issues of death are in his power. For
death seems to consume all things; but God snatches from that whirlpool whom he
pleases. So this persuasion ought to inspire us with firm and unassailable
constancy, since it is necessary for those who so repose the whole care of their
life and safety upon God, to be thoroughly conscious and undoubtedly sure that
God will defend a good cause. And this is also expressed by these words of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold our God whom we
worship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When they bring forward
God&#8217;s worship, they bear testimony to the surliness of their support, when
they undertake nothing rashly, but are worshippers of the true God, and labor
for the defense of piety. For this is the difference, between martyrs and
malefactors, who are often compelled to suffer the penalty of their madness for
attempting to overthrow all things. We see, indeed, the majority tossed about by
their own intemperance. If they happen to suffer punishment, they are not to be
reckoned among God&#8217;s martyrs; for, as Augustine says, the martyr is made
by his cause, and not by his punishment. Hence the weight of these words,
<i>when </i>these three men attest their worship of God, since in this way they
boast in their power of enduring any urgent danger not rashly, but only as
supported by the sure worship of God. I now come to the <i>second
</i>point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If God be unwilling to deliver us
from death, be it known to thee, O king, we will not worship thy
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I said first of all, we should be
constantly prepared to undergo every conflict, to commit our life to his charge,
to submit to his will and hand, and to the protection of his custody. But the
desire of this earthly and fading life ought not; to retain its hold upon us,
and to hinder us from the free and candid confession of the truth. For
God&#8217;s glory ought to be more precious to us than a hundred lives. Hence we
cannot be witnesses for God without we lay aside all desire of this life, and at
least prefer God&#8217;s glory to it. Meanwhile, we must. remark the
impossibility of doing this, without the hope of a better life drawing us
towards itself. For where there is no promise of any eternal inheritance
implanted in our hearts, we. shall never be torn away from this world. We are
naturally desirous of existence, and that feeling cannot be eradicated, unless
faith overcome it; as Paul says, Not that we wished to be unclothed, but clothed
upon.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:4.) Paul confesses that men cannot be naturally induced to wish
for departure from the world, unless, as we have said, through the power of
faith. But when we understand our inheritance to be in heaven, while we are
strangers upon earth, then we put off that clinging to the life of this world to
which we are too much devoted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These then are the two points which prepare the sons
of God for martyrdom, and remove hesitation as to their offering their life in
sacrifice to God. <i>First, </i>if they are persuaded that God is the protector
of their life and will certainly liberate them should it be expedient; and
<i>secondly, </i>when they live above the world and aspire to the hope of
eternal life in heaven, while prepared to renounce the world. This magnanimity
is to be remarked in their language, when they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be it known to thee, O king, that
we do not worship thy gods nor adore the statue which, thou hast set
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here they obliquely accuse the king
of arrogating too much to himself, and of wishing religion to stand or fall by
his own will. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast erected
the statue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but thy authority is of no
moment to us, since we know it to be a fictitious deity whose image thou wishest
us to worship. The God whom we worship has revealed himself to us we know him to
be the maker of heaven and earth, to have redeemed our fathers from Egypt, and
to intend our chastisement by driving us into exile. Since, therefore, we have a
firm foundation for our faith hence we reckon thy gods and thy sway valueless.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, at; first sight, God seems to desert his
,servants, since he does not openly succor them. The king orders them to be
thrown into a furnace of fire: no help from heaven appears for them. This was a
living and remarkably efficacious proof of their faithfulness. But they were
prepared, as we have seen, to endure everything. These bold answers were not
prompted simply by their trust in God&#8217;s immediate help, but by a
determination to die; since a better life occupied their thoughts, they
willingly sacrificed the present life. Hence they were not frightened at this
terrible order of the king&#8217;s, but followed on their course, fearlessly
submitting to death for the worship of God. No third way was opened for them,
when a choice was granted either to submit to death, or apostatize from the true
God. By this example we are taught to meditate on our immortal life in times of
ease, so that if God pleases, we may not hesitate to expose our souls by the
confession of the true faith. For we are so timorous when we are attacked by
calamity, we are seized with fear and torpor, and then when we are not pressed
by any urgency we feign for ourselves a false security. When we are allowed to
be at ease, we ought to apply our minds to meditation upon a future life, so
that this world may become cheap to us, and we may be prepared when necessary to
pour forth our blood in testimony to the truth. And this narrative is not set
before us simply to lead us to admire and celebrate the courage of these three
holy ones, but their constancy is proposed to us as an example for
imitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With reference to King Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel here
shews, as in a glass, the pride and haughtiness of kings when they find their
decrees disobeyed. Surely a mind of iron ought to grow soft by the answer which
we have just narrated, on hearing Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego committing
their lives to God; but when it heard how they could not be drawn aside from
their faithfulness by the fear of death, its anger was only increased. In
considering this fury, we ought to take into account the power of Satan in
seizing and occupying the minds of men. For there is no moderation in them, even
if they shew some great and remarkable hope of virtues, &#8212; for, as we have
seen, Nebuchadnezzar was endued with many virtues; but as Satan harassed him, we
discern nothing but cruelty and barbarity. Meanwhile, let us remember how
pleasing our constancy is to God, though it may not produce any immediate fruit
before the world. For many indulge in pleasure through thinking they would be
rash in devoting themselves to death, without any apparent utility. And on this
pretext, they excuse themselves from not contending more boldly for the glory of
God, by supposing they would lose their labor, and their death would be
fruitless. But we hear what Christ pronounces, namely, this sacrifice is
pleasing to God, when we die for the testimony of the heavenly doctrine,
although the generation before which we bear witness to God&#8217;s name is
adulterous and perverse, nay, even hardened by our constancy.

<div><font face="Palatino">And such an example is here set before us in these
three holy men; because, although Nebuchadnezzar was more inflamed by the
freedom of their confession, yet that; liberty pleased God, and they did not
repent of it, though they did not discern the fruit of their constancy which
they wished. The Prophet also expresses this circumstance to demonstrate the
king&#8217;s fury, since </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than
before</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he chose from his own servants
the strongest of all to bind these holy men, and cast them into the furnace of
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But from the result it is very evident, that this did
not occur without God&#8217;s secret impulse; for the devil will sometimes throw
discredit on a miracle, unless all doubt is removed. Since therefore the king
ordered the furnace to be heated sevenfold more than before, next when he chose
the strongest attendants, and commanded them to follow him, God thus removed all
doubts, by liberating his servants, because light emerges more clearly from the
darkness, when Satan endeavors to shut it out. Thus God is accustomed to
frustrate the impious; and the more impious they are in opposing his glory, the
more he makes his honor and doctrine conspicuous. In like manner, Daniel here
paints, as in a picture, how King Nebuchadnezzar passed nothing by, when he
wished to strike terror into the minds of all the Jews by this cruel punishment.
And yet he obtained nothing else by his plans than a clearer illustration of
God&#8217;s power and grace towards his servants. It now follows:

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel relates the miracle by which God
liberated his servants. He has two parts: first, these three holy men walked
untouched in the midst of the flame; and the fires consumed those attendants who
east them into the furnace. The Prophet diligently enumerates whatever tends to
prove the power of God. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>since the king&#8217;s command
was urgent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, since the king
ordered in such anger the furnace to be heated, the flames devour the men who
executed his orders. For in Job,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;181805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
18:5,)
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shebib, </i>means &#8220;spark,&#8221; or the extremity of a flame. The sense
of the Prophet is by no means obscure, since the extremity of the flame consumed
those strong attendants by playing round them, while Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego walked through the fuel in the fire and flame. They were not in the
extremity of the flame; for it is as if the Prophet had said &#8212; the
king&#8217;s slaves were consumed by the very smoke, and the fire was without
the slightest effect on the servants of God. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these three fell down in the
furnace of fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By saying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
fell</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it means they could not take care
of themselves or attempt to escape; for he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were
bound.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This might at first naturally
suffocate them, till they were immediately consumed; but they remained
untouched, and then walked about the furnace loose. We hereby see how
conspicuous was God&#8217;s power, and how no falsehood of Satan&#8217;s could
obscure it. And next, when the very points of the flame, or the fiery sparks,
devour the servants, here again the deed is proved to be of God. Meanwhile, the
result of the history is the preservation of these three holy men, so
surprisingly beyond their expectation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This example is set before us, to show us how nothing
can be safer than to make God the guardian and protector of our life. For we
ought not to expect to be preserved from every danger because we see those holy
men delivered; for we ought to hope for liberation from death, if it be useful,
and yet we ought not to hesitate to meet it without fear, if God so please it.
But we should gather from our present narrative the sufficiency of God&#8217;s
protection, if he wishes to prolong our lives, since we know our life to be
precious to him; and it is entirely in his power, either to snatch us from
danger, or to withdraw us to a better existence, according to his pleasure. We
have an example of this in the case of Peter; for he was on one day led forth
from prison, and the next day put to death. Even then God shewed his care of his
servant&#8217;s life, although Peter at length suffered death. How so? Because
he had finished his course. Hence, as often as God pleases, he will exert his
power to preserve us; if he leads us onwards to death, we must be assured it is
best for us to die, and injurious to us to enjoy life any longer. This is the
substance of the instruction which we may receive from this narrative. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel relates how God&#8217;s power was
manifest to the profane &#8212; to both the king and his courtiers, who had
conspired for the death of these holy men. He says, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king
trembled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>at that miracle; since God
often compels the impious to acknowledge his power, and when they stupidity
themselves, and harden all their senses, they are compelled to feel God&#8217;s
power whether they will or not. Daniel shews how this happened to King
Nebuchadnezzar. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
trembled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and rose up quickly, and said to
his companions, Did we not cast three men bound into the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>When they say, <i>It is so,
</i>Nebuchadnezzar was doubtless impelled by Divine impulse, and a secret
instinct, to inquire of his companions to extract this confession from them. For
Nebuchadnezzar might easily approach the furnace, but God wished to extract this
confession from his enemies, that both they and the king might allow the rescue
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, to have proceeded from no earthly medium,
but from the admirable and extraordinary power of God. We may here remark, how
the impious are witnesses to God&#8217;s power, not willingly, but because God
placed this question in the king&#8217;s mouth, and also in his not permitting
them to escape or turn aside from the confession of the truth. But
Nebuchadnezzar says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four men
walked in the fire, and the face of the fourth is like the son of a
god</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No doubt God here sent one of his
angels, to support by his presence the minds of his saints, lest they should
faint. It was indeed a formidable spectacle to see the furnace so hot, and to be
cast into it. By this consolation God wished to allay their anxiety, and to
soften their grief, by adding an angel as their companion. We know how many
angels have been sent to one man, as we read of Elisha.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;120615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 6:15.) And there is this general rule &#8212; He, has given his angels
charge over thee, to guard thee in all the ways; and also, The camps of angels
are about those who fear God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
91:11, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:7.) This, indeed, is especially fulfilled in Christ; but. it is extended to
the whole body, and to each member of the Church, for God has his own hosts at
hand to serve him. But we read again how an angel was often sent to a whole
nation. God indeed does not need his angels, while he uses their assistance in
condescension to our infirmities. And when we do not regard his power as highly
as we ought, he interposes his angels to remove our doubts, as we have formerly
said. A single angel was sent to these three men; Nebuchadnezzar calls him a son
of God; not because he thought him to be Christ, but according to the common
opinion among all people, that angels are sons of God, since a certain divinity
is resplendent in them; and hence they call angels generally sons of God.
According to this usual custom, Nebuchadnezzar says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fourth man is like a son of a
god.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For he could not recognize the,
only-begotten Son of God, since, as we have already seen, he was blinded by so
many depraved errors. And if any one should say it was enthusiasm, this would be
forced and frigid. This simplicity, then, will be sufficient for us, since
Nebuchadnezzar spoke in the usual manner, as one of the angels was sent to those
three men &#8212; since, as I have said, it was then customary to call angels
sons of God. Scripture thus speaks,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:6, and elsewhere,) but God never suffered truth to become so buried in the
world as not to leave some seed of sound doctrine, at least as a testimony to
the profane, and to render them more inexcusable &#8212; as we shall treat more
at length in the next lecture.

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE a sudden change is described in the mood of this
cruel and proud king. We have already seen how confidently he extracted worship
from the servants of God, and when he saw them disobedient to his command, how
mightily he raged against them. Now Daniel shews in how short a time this pride
was subdued and this cruelty appeased; but we must remark that the king was not
so changed as entirely to put his disposition and manners. For when he was
touched with this present miracle, he gave God the glory, but only for a moment;
and still he did not return to wisdom. We cannot take too diligent notice of
examples of this kind, as many estimate the characters of others from a single
action. But the worst despisers of God can submit to him for a short time, not
merely by feigning to do so before men, but in real seriousness, since God
compels them by his power, but meanwhile they retain their pride and ferocity
within their breasts. Of this kind, then, was the conversion of King
Nebuchadnezzar. For when astonished by the miracle, he could no longer resist
the Almighty, he was still inconsistent, as we shall afterwards see. We may also
notice how the impious, who are unregenerate by God&#8217;s Spirit, are often
impelled to worship God; but this is only temporary, and this equable tenor
never remains through their whole life. But when God renews his own, he
undertakes to govern them even to the end; he animates them to perseverance, and
confirms them by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must here remark how God&#8217;s glory is
illustrated by this temporary and vanishing conversion of the reprobate;
because, whether they will or not, yet they yield to God for a time, and thus
the greatness of his power is acknowledged. God, therefore, turns an event which
does not profit the reprobate to his own glory, and at the same time punishes
them more severely. For Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s conduct was less excusable after
his once acknowledging the God of Israel to be the supreme and only God, and
then relapsing into his former superstitions. He says, therefore, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He approached the door of the
furnace, and spoke thus, &#8212; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, servants of
the most high God, come forth and come
hither</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>A short time before, he wished
his own statue to be worshipped, and his own name to be esteemed the only one in
heaven and earth, since this was pleasing to him. We then saw how he claimed the
right of subjecting the religion and worship of God to his own will and lust;
but now, as if he were a new man, he calls Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
servants of the most high God! What place, then, was left to him and to all the
Chaldeans? How could they now worship those fictitious gods and idols which they
had fabricated? But God extracted these words from the proud and cruel king, as
when criminals and compelled, by tortures, to say what they would otherwise
refuse. Thus Nebuchadnezzar confessed God to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the most high God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if he had been tortured, but
not of his own accord, or in a composed state of mind. He does not pretend this
before men, as I have said; but his mind was neither pure nor perfect, since it
was in a ferment with this temporary commotion. And this must also be added
&#8212; the instinct was rather violent; than voluntary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel afterwards relates
&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> His companions came forth
from the midst of the fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these
words he again confirms the miracle; for God could extinguish the fire of the
furnace, but he wished it to burn in the sight of all, to render the power of
this deliverance the more conspicuous. Meanwhile we must notice
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the three men walking in the
furnace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>until the king commanded them
to come forth, because God had issued no command. They saw themselves perfectly
safe and. sound in the midst of the furnace; they were content with God&#8217;s
present benefit, but still they had no free departure, until fetched by the
king&#8217;s voice. As when Noah, in the ark, saw safety prepared for him in
that tomb, yet he did not try anything until commanded to come forth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
8:16.) So also Daniel asserts that his companions did not, come forth from the
furnace till the king commanded them. Then at length they understood how what
they had heard from the king was pleasing to God; not because he was a Prophet
or teacher, but because they were cast into the furnace by his command. So also
when he recalls them, they know the end of their cross to be arrived, and thus
they pass from death unto life. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel relates how the satraps were gathered together
with the leaders, prefects, and councilors of the king. The gathering was simply
a collection of numbers, and if they deliberated about anything of importance,
they all agreed. And this confirms the miracle, since if they had been
stupefied, how could the great power of God be proposed to the eyes of the
blind? Although they were so astonished, they were not altogether foolish, And
Daniel implies this by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were assembled
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After they had discussed the
matter, he says, they came to behold that specimen of the incredible power of
God. Then he enumerates many reasons, which clearly shew these three men not to
have been preserved by any other means than God&#8217;s singular good will. He
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fire had no power over

&#8212; the fire had not penetrated. For fire must naturally consume and burn up
whatever is submitted to it; but when not even the smell of fire has passed over
any substance, the miracle is more conspicuous. Now, we understand the
Prophet&#8217;s intention. On the whole, he shews how the benefit of freedom was
no, small one, since </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shadrach,

professedly enemies to true piety, they would willingly have concealed the
miracle, had it been in their power. But God draws them against their wills, and
compels them to be eye-witnesses, and they are thus obliged to confess what

<div><font face="Palatino">This, indeed, is no common confession, but the event
proved how suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar was acted on by impulse, without having,
the living root of the fear of God in his heart. And I repeat this again, to
shew that repentance does not consist in one or two works, but in perseverance,
as Paul says, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If ye live in the
Spirit, walk also in the
Spirit.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
5:25.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here he requires constancy in the faithful, by which
they may shew themselves to be truly born again of God&#8217;s Spirit.
Nebuchadnezzar celebrated the God of Israel as if inspired by an enthusiasm, but
at the same time he mingled his idols with the true God, so that there was no
sincerity in him. So when the impious feel God&#8217;s power, they do not dare
to proceed with obstinacy against him, but wish to appease him by a false
repentance, without putting off their natural disposition. Thus we readily
conclude Nebuchadnazzar to be always the same, although God extracted from him
this <i>confession, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed, says he, be the God
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Why
does he not rather speak of him as his own God? This may be excused, had he
really devoted himself to the God of Israel, and abjured his former
superstitions. As he does not act thus, his confession is worthless; not because
he wished to obtain men&#8217;s favor or good opinion by what he said, but he
deceived himself after the manner of hypocrites. He pronounces the God of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to be blessed if he really felt this, he must
at the same time curse his idols, for the glory of the one true God cannot be
extolled without all idols being reduced to nothing. For how can God&#8217;s
praise exist without his being solely conspicuous? If any other deity is opposed
to him, his majesty is already buried in complete obscurity. Hence we may
collect that Nebuchadnezzar was not touched with true repentance when he blessed
the God of Israel. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
sent his angel, and delivered his servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here Daniel shews more clearly the absence of conversion in Nebuchadnezzar,
and his failure to embrace the God of Israel, and worship him with sound and
complete surrender of his affections. Why so? Because piety is always founded
upon the knowledge of the true God, and this requires instruction.
Nebuchadnezzar knew the God of Israel to be majestic from the display of his
power, for he had such a spectacle presented to him as he could not despise, if
he wished. Here he confesses that Israel&#8217;s God was mighty, since he was
taught it by a miracle; but this, as I have reminded you, is not sufficient for
solid piety, unless instruction is added, and occupies the first place. I allow,
indeed, that miracles prepare men to believe, but if miracles only occurred
without the knowledge of God being added from his Word, faith will vanish away
&#8212; as the example sufficiently remarkable here sets before us. We term the
faith of Nebuchadnezzar to be but momentary, because while his senses were fixed
upon the miracle, he was content with the spectacle, without inquiring into the
character of the God of Israel, and the bearing of his law. He was not anxious
about a Mediator; hence he neglected the chief point of piety, and rashly seized
upon one part of it only. We clearly observe this in many profane men, for God
often humbles them, to induce them suppliantly to fly to him for safety; but
meanwhile, they remain perplexed by their own senses; they do not deny their own
superstitions, nor regard the true worship of God. To prove our obedience to
God, we must, uphold this principle &#8212; nothing pleases him which does not
spring from faith.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:23.) But faith cannot be acquired by any miracle, or any perception of the
Divine power; it requires instruction also. The miracles avail only to the
preparation for piety or for its confirmation; they cannot by themselves bring
men to worship the true God. This is surprising indeed, when a profane king says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the angel was sent by
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is sufficiently evident from heathen writings that
something was always known about angels. This was, as it were, a kind of
anticipation and previous persuasion, since all people are persuaded that angels
exist, so that they had some idea of angels., although but a partial one. For,
when a short time ago Daniel said the fourth appearance in the furnace was
called by the king of Babylon &#8220;a son of a god,&#8221; then, as I have
explained it, Nebuchadnezzar professed some belief in angels. He now says more
expressly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God sent his
angel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As angels afford supplies to the
elect and the faithful, I treat the subject here but shortly, since I am not in
the habit of dwelling upon ordinary passages. It is enough for the present
passage to shew how the impious, who have learnt nothing from either God himself
or from piety at large, were yet imbued with these principles, since God is
accustomed to use the assistance of angels to preserve his people. For this
reason Nebuchadnezzar now says;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the angel was sent by God to
deliver his servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He next adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who trusted in
him;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and this is worthy of notice, since
it is added as a reason why these three men were so wonderfully preserved,
through reposing all their hopes on God. Although Nebuchadnezzar was very like a
log or a stone with relation to the doctrine of faith, yet God wished by means
of this stone and log to instruct us, to inspire us with shame, and to reprove
us of incredulity, since we are unable to conform our lives to his will, and to
approach all dangers boldly, whenever it becomes necessary. For if we are
thoroughly persuaded that God is the guardian of our life, surely no threats,
nor terrors, nor death itself, should hinder us from persevering in our duty.
But distrust is the cause of slothfulness, and wherever we deflect from a
straightforward course, we deprive God of his honor, by becoming backsliders,
while some want of faith betrays itself and is palpably apparent. Hence let us
learn, if we wish our life to be protected by God&#8217;s hand, to commit
ourselves entirely to him, since he will never disappoint us when we confide in
him. We saw how doubtful about the event Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were;
but their doubt did not diminish their hope and confidence. They were placed in
this alternative &#8212; either God will take us from rite furnace, or, if we
must die, he will preserve us for some better state, and gather us into his
kingdom. Although they dared not persuade themselves that he would notice them
yet they reposed their lives in the hand and care of God. Hence they are
deservedly complimented by Nebuchadnezzar, when he <i>said, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They trusted in their
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they changed the king&#8217;s
edict</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, reduced it to nothing,
and abrogated it, because they were endued with greater power. For whoever rests
in God, easily despises all mankind, and whatever is lofty and magnificent in
the world. And this context is worthy of observation, since faith ought to be
put as a foundation, and then fortitude and constancy must be added, with which
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were endowed; because any one who reposes upon
God can never be moved aside from the discharge of his duty; and however
numerous the impediments which may occur, he will be borne aloft on the wings of
his confidence. He who knows God to be on his side, will be superior to the
whole world, and will neither wonder at the scepter and diadems of kings, nor
dread their power, but rather surpass all the majesty of the earth which may
oppose him, and never to turn aside from this course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they delivered up their bodies
instead of worshipping or adoring any god except their own
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That very thing which the king is
compelled to praise in these three men, at this day many who boast themselves to
be Christians wish to escape. For they fancy their faith to be buried in their
hearths, and bring forth no fruit of their profession. There is no doubt God
wished these things to be related by his Prophet, to shew the detestable cunning
of those who wish to defraud God of his lawful honor, and at the same time
shelter themselves from his gaze, lest he should notice their insult. Such as
these are unworthy of being convinced by the word of God, but Nebuchadnezzar is
here appointed their master, censor, and judge. And we must diligently remark
this, &#8212; Nebuchadnezzar praises these three, because they refused to
worship any other god except their own. Why then did he mingle together a great
multitude of deities? For he did not depart from his own errors and give himself
up entirely to the God of Israel, and embrace his worship in its purity. Why
then does he praise in others what he does not imitate? But this is far too
common; for we see virtue praised and yet frozen to death, as in this instance,
for many are willing to offer him lip-service. (Juvenal, Sat. 1.) Although
Nebuchadnezzar seemed here to speak seriously, yet he did not consider himself;
but he took away all pretext for excuse, since he could not afterwards pretend
ignorance and error, after asserting with his own mouth that no other god ought
to be worshipped. Hence he may cause those who now wish to be called Christians
to be ashamed, unless they depart far away from all superstitions, and
consecrate themselves entirely to God, and retain his worship in its sincerity.
We must remember then how King Nebuchadnezzar does not simply praise the
constancy of these three men, because he does not acknowledge any god, for he
does reckon the God of Israel to be a true deity. Hence it follows, that all
others were fictitious and utterly vain. But he spoke to no purpose, because God
did not thereby touch his heart, as he usually works in his elect when he
regenerates them. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Nebuchadnezzar is urged further forward &#8212;
for we must use this phrase &#8212; since he does not take up the worship of one
God from his heart, and bid his errors finally farewell. Hence it is as if God
was thrusting him violently forward, while he promulgates this edict. The edict
is by itself pious and praiseworthy; but, as we have already said,
Nebuchadnezzar is borne along by a blind and turbulent impulse, because piety
had no root in his heart. Though he is always intent on this miracle, his faith
is only momentary, and his fear of God but partial. Why then is Nebuchadnezzar
now seen as the patron of God&#8217;s glory? Because he was frightened by the
miracle, and thus being acted on by impulse alone, he could not; be soundly
restrained by the fear of God alone. And finally, this desire which he expresses
is nothing but an evanescent movement. It is useful to remark this, since we see
many born along by impetuous zeal and rage to vindicate God&#8217;s glory; but
they lack tact and judgment, so that they deserve no praise. And many wander
still further &#8212; as we see in the Papacy &#8212; when many edicts of kings
and princes fly about; and if any one should ask them why they are so eager as
not to spare even human blood, they put forth indeed a zeal for God , but it is
mere madness without a spark of true knowledge. We must hold, therefore, that no
law can be passed nor any edict promulgated concerning religion and the worship
of God, unless a real knowledge of God shines forth. Nebuchadnezzar indeed had a
reason for this edict, but, as I have already said, there was a special motive
for his conduct. Some, indeed, now wish to be thought Christian princes, and yet
are only inflamed by a hypocritical zeal, and so they pour forth innocent blood
like cruel beasts. And why so? Because they make no distinction between the true
God and idols. But I shall discuss this point at greater length to-morrow, and
so pass over casually what I shall treat at length, when the fit opportunity
arrives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every people, therefore, and
nation, and language, which shall have offered a perverse speech against their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Nebuchadnezzar again extolled the
God of Israel, but how was he taught the majesty of God? By this one proof of
his power, for he neglected the chief point &#8212; the ascertaining from the
law and the prophets the nature of God and the power of his will. Thus we see,
on one side, how God&#8217;s glory is asserted here, and yet the principal point
in his worship, and in true piety, is neglected and omitted. No light punishment
is added &#8212; -</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he must be cut
in pieces, next, his house must be turned into a dunghill, since he has spoken
reproachfully of the God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Hence we gather how this severity is not to be utterly condemned, when
God&#8217;s worship is defended by severe punishments; yet a correct sentence
ought to be passed in each case. But I put this off also till to-morrow. It is
now added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because there is no
other God who can deliver after this manner</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and. this confirms what I have formerly touched upon, namely, King
Nebuchadnezzar does not regard the law in his edict, nor yet the other
requisites of piety; but he is only impelled and moved by the miracle, so as not
to bear or desire anything to be said opprobriously against the God of Israel.
Hence the edict is deserving of blame in this point, since he does not inquire
what God&#8217;s nature is, with the view of obtaining a sufficient reason for
issuing it. It is added at length, &#8212;</font><br></div>

sway ,and were restored to their former honors. In consequence of this event,
God&#8217;s power could not be unknown. It was just as it God had sent forth

they were wonderfully delivered from death by God&#8217;s special interposition.

<div><font face="Palatino">Some join these verses to the end of the third
chapter, but there is no reason for this; and it will clearly appear from the
context that the edict is here set. forth in the king&#8217;s. name, and other
events are inserted. Daniel, therefore, here, speaks in the person of the king;
he afterwards narrates what happened to the king, and then returns to his own.
person. Those who separate these three verses from the context of the fourth
chapter, do not seem to have sufficiently considered the intention and words of
the Prophet. This passage may seem harsh and rough, when Daniel introduces the
king of Babylon as speaking &#8212; then speaks in his own name &#8212; and
afterwards returns to the person of the; king. But since this variety does not
render the sense either doubtful or obscure, there is no reason why it should
trouble us. We now see how all the sentences which we shall explain in their
places are mutually united.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The contents of this chapter are as follow:
Nebuchadnezzar was sufficiently instructed in the worship of the God of Israel
as one God, and was compelled at the time to confess this; yet he did not depart
from his own superstitions; his conceptions of the true God were but momentary,
and hence he suffered the punishment due to such great ingratitude. But God
intended him to become more and more blinded, as he is accustomed to treat the
reprobate and even his elect at times. When men add sin to sin, God loosens his
reins and allows them to destroy themselves. Afterwards he either extends his
hand towards them, or withdraws them by his hidden virtue, or reduces them to
order by his rod, and completely humbles them. He treated the king of Babylon in
this way. We shall afterwards discuss the dream; but we must here briefly notice
the king&#8217;s admonition, that he might feel himself without excuse when he
was so utterly broken down. God indeed might justly punish him as soon as he saw
he was not truly converted; but before he inflicted the final chastisement
&#8212; as we shall see in its place &#8212; he wished to admonish him, if there
were any hope of his. repentance. Although he seemed to receive with the
greatest modesty what God had manifested by his dream through Daniel&#8217;s
interpretation of it, yet he professed with his mouth what he did not really
possess. And he shews this sufficiently, because, when he ought to be afraid and
cautious, he does not lay aside his pride, but glories in himself as a king of
kings, and in Babylon as the queen of the whole world! Since, then, he spoke so
confidently after being admonished by the Prophet, we perceive how little he had
profited by his dream. But God wished in this way to render him more
inexcusable, and although he did not bring forth fruit immediately, yet a long
time afterwards, when God touched his mind, he very properly recognized this
punishment to have been divinely inflicted. Hence this dream was a kind of
entrance and preparation for repentance, and as seed seems to lie putrid in the
earth before it brings forth its fruit, and God sometimes works by gentle
processes, and provides for the teaching, which seemed for a long time useless,
becoming both efficacious and fruitful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to the words themselves; the preface to
the edict is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar the
king to all peoples, nations, and languages, which dwell in the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, under his sway. He does
not mean this to be extended to Scythia, or Gaul, or other distant regions; but
since his empire extended far and wide, he spoke boastingly. Thus we see the
Romans, whose sway did not reach near so far, called Rome itself the seat of the
empire of the whole world! Here Nebuchadnezzar now predicts. the magnificence
and mightiness of his own monarchy. Hence he sends his edict
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to all peoples, and nations, and
languages, which dwell on the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
afterwards adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it seemed to me
good to relate the signs and wonders which the mighty God hath wrought with
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No doubt he feels himself to have
paid the penalty of his ingratitude, since he had so punctiliously ascribed the
glory to one true God, and yet had relapsed into his own superstitions, and had
never really said farewell to them. We see how often King Nebuchadnezzar was
chastised before he profited by the rod of the Almighty. Hence we need not be
surprised if God often strikes us with his hand, since the result of experience
proves us to be dull, and, to speak truly, utterly slothful. When God,
therefore, wishes to lead us to repentance, he is compelled to repeat his blows
continually, either because we are not moved when he chastises us with his hand,
or we seem roused for the time, and then we return again to our former torpor.
He is therefore compelled to redouble his blows. And we perceive this in the
narrative before us, as in a glass. But the singular benefit of God was this,
Nebuchadnezzar, after God had often chastised him, yielded at length. It is
unknown whether or not this confession proceeded front true and genuine
repentance: I must leave it in doubt. Yet without the slightest doubt Daniel
recited this edict, to shew the king so subdued at length, as to confess the God
of Israel to be the only God, and to bear witness to this among all people under
his sway.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile we must remark, how this edict of the king
of Babylon receives the testimony of the Spirit; for Daniel has no other object
or purpose in relating the edict, than to shew the fruit of conversion in King
Nebuchadnezzar. Hence, without doubt, King Nebuchadnezzar bore witness to his
repentance when he celebrated the God of Israel among all people, and when he
proclaimed a punishment to all who spoke reproachfully against God. Hence this
passage is often cited by Augustine against the Donatists. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f206</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For they wished to grant an act of impunity to themselves, when they disturbed
the Church with rashness and corrupted pure doctrine, and even permitted
themselves to attack it like robbers. For some were then discovered to have been
slain by them, and others mutilated in their limbs. Since, then, they allowed
themselves to act so licentiously and still desired to commit crimes with
impunity, yet they held this principle as of first importance. No punishment
ought to be inflicted on those who differ from others in religious doctrine; as
we see in these days, how some contend far too eagerly about this subject. What
they desire is clear enough. If any one carefully observes them, he will find
them impious despisers of God; they wish to render everything uncertain in
religion, and as far as they can they strive to tear away all the principles of
piety. With the view then of vomiting forth their poison, they strive eagerly
for freedom from punishment, and deny the right of inflicting punishment on
heretics and blasphemers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such is that dog Castalio 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and his companions, and all like him, such also were the Donatists; and hence,
as I have mentioned, Augustine cites this testimony in many places, and shews
how ashamed Christian princes ought to be of their slothfulness, if they are
indulgent to heretics and blasphemers, and do not vindicate God&#8217;s glory by
lawful punishments, since King Nebuchadnezzar who was never truly converted: yet
promulgated this decree by a kind of secret instinct. At all events, it ought to
be sufficient for men of moderate and quiet tastes to know how King
Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s edict was praised by the approval of the Holy Spirit. If
this be so, it follows that kings are bound to defend the worship of God, and to
<i>execute </i>vengeance upon those who profanely despise it, and on those who
endeavor<i> </i>to reduce it to nothing, or to adulterate the true doctrine by
their errors, and so dissipate the unity of the faith and disturb the
Church&#8217;s peace. This is clear enough from the Prophet&#8217;s context; for
Nebuchadnezzar says at first, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it
pleases me to relate the signs and wonders which God has prepared for
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had already explained how
wonderfully God had treated him; but this had passed away. Now God seizes him a
second and even a third time, and then he confesses it to be his boast to
explain the wonderful signs of God. He afterwards breaks forth into the
exclamation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How mighty are his
signs! How remarkable his miracles! His kingdom, is a kingdom of an age, and his
dominion is from age to age</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Without
doubt Nebuchadnezzar wished to excite his subjects to the attentive perusal of
this edict, and to the acknowledgment of its value, and thus to subject
themselves to the true and only God. He calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The High
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>meaning, doubtless, the God of
Israel; meanwhile, we do not know whether he cast away his superstitions. I
however incline to the opposite conjecture, since he did not put off his errors,
but was compelled to give glory to the Most High God. He so acknowledged the God
of Israel as to join inferior deities with him as allies and companions, just as
all unbelievers, while admitting one supreme deity, imagine a multitude of
others. So also Nebuchadnezzar confessed Israel&#8217;s God to be Most High;
yet, he did not correct the idolatry which still flourished under his sway; nay,
he mingled and confused the false gods with the God of Israel. Thus he did not
leave behind his own corruption&#8217;s. He celebrates indeed with magnificence
the glory of the supreme God, but this is not sufficient without; abolishing all
superstitions, and promoting that religion alone which is prescribed by the word
of God, and causing his pure and perfect worship to flourish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In fine, this preface might seem a proof of an
important conversion; but we shall directly see how far Nebuchadnezzar was from
being entirely purged of his errors. It ought, indeed, to affect us exceedingly
to behold the king wrapt up in so many errors, and yet seized with admiration of
the Divine virtue, since he cannot express his thoughts, but exclaims<i>,
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His signs how mighty!
his wonders how powerful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>He added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His kingdom is a perpetual
kingdom, and his dominion is from age to
age</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he confesses God&#8217;s power
not to be dependent upon man&#8217;s will, since he had just before said, the
statue which he had erected was to be worshipped, because he had chosen so to
decree it. Now, however, he remits much of this pride by confessing God&#8217;s
kingdom to be a perpetual one. The narrative now follows. Thus far we have
merely a preface, because the edict was diffused among his subjects to render
them attentive to the most important subjects.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Nebuchadnezzar here explains how he acknowledged the
Supreme God. He does not relate the proofs which he had previously received; but
since his pride was subdued in this last dream, he makes a passing allusion to
it. Meanwhile, as he doubtless recalled his former dreams to mind, and condemned
himself for his ingratitude, in burying in oblivion this great power of God, and
in wiping away the remembrance of those benefits by which God had adorned him.
Here, however, he speaks only of his last dream, which we shall see in its own
place. But before he comes as far as the dream, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he was at
rest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
seleh, </i>signifies &#8220;<i>rest</i>&#8221;<i> </i>and
&#8220;<i>happiness;</i>&#8221;<i> </i>and since prosperity renders men secure,
it is metaphorically used for &#8220;<i>security.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>David, when
he pronounces the same sentence upon himself, uses the same words:
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
30:6,) &#8220;I<i> </i>said in my prosperity,&#8221; or rest;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>selueh, </i>which some translate &#8220;abundance;&#8221; but it rather
signifies a quiet or prosperous state. Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, here marks the
circumstance of time; hence we may know him to have been divinely seized,
because prosperous fortune had rendered him stupid and drunken. There is nothing
surprising in this, for the old and common proverb is, &#8220;fullness<i> </i>is
the parent of ferocity,&#8221; as we see horses when too much fed, prance about
and throw their riders. Thus also it happens with men. For if God treats them
rather indulgently and liberally, they become fierce and insolent towards all
men, and strike off God&#8217;s yoke, and forget themselves to be but men. And
when this happened to David, what shall happen to the profane and to others who
are still too much devoted to the world? For David confesses himself to have
been so deceived by his quiet and felicity, as to determine within himself that
he had nothing else to fear, &#8212; &#8220;I said in my happiness,&#8221; or my
quiet, &#8220;I shall not be removed;&#8221;<i> </i>and he afterwards
adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O Lord, thou didst
chastise me, and I was laid low.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
38:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, therefore, David promised himself perpetual
quiet in the world, because God spared him for a time, how ought our
tranquillity to be suspected lest we should grow torpid on our lees?
Nebuchadnezzar, then, does not recite this in vain &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was quiet at home, I flourished
in my palace,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>since this was the cause
of his confidence and pride, and of his carelessly despising God. He afterwards
adds, he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw a dream and was
disturbed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He, doubtless, wished here to
distinguish his dreams from common ones, which often arise from either a
disturbance of the brain, or our daily thoughts, or other causes, as we have
elsewhere seen. It is not <i>necessary </i>to repeat what we have already
treated more copiously. It is sufficient to state, briefly, how this dream, in
which God previously informed him of the future punishment at hand, is separated
from others which are either troubled:, or fluctuating, or without reason. He,
says, therefore</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, he saw a dream,
and was disturbed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>while he was awake.
He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his thoughts were upon
his bed;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he was disturbed by visions of
the head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These expressions only look
towards that heavenly oracle, or vision, or dream, of which we shall afterwards
speak more fully. It follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
put forth a decree to summon all the wise men of Babylon to
explain,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or make
manifest,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the interpretation of
the dream</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Doubtless the king often
dreamt, and did not always call together the Magi and soothsayers, and
astrologers, and others who were skilled in the science of divination, or at
least professed to be so. He did not consult them on all his dreams; but because
God had inscribed in his heart a distinct mark by which he had denoted this
dream, hence the king could not rest till he heard its interpretation. As we
previously saw the authority of the first dream about the Four Monarchies and
the Eternal Kingdom of Christ confirmed, so the king perceived this one to have
proceeded from heaves. There is another difference between this dream and the
one formerly explained. For God blotted out the remembrance of the dream about
the Four Monarchies from King Nebuchadnezzar, so that it became necessary for
Daniel to bring his dream before the king, and at the same time to add the
interpretation. Daniel was then more obscure, for although he proved himself to
have excelled all the Chaldeans, yet King Nebuchadnezzar would have wondered at
him less if he had only been an interpreter of a dream. God wished, therefore,
to acquire greater reverence for his Prophet and his doctrine, when he enjoined
upon him two duties; first, the divination of the dream itself, and then the
explanation of its sense and purpose. In this second dream Daniel is only an
interpreter. God had already sufficiently proved him to be endued with a
heavenly spirit, when Nebuchadnezzar not only called him among the rest of the
Magi, but separated him from them all. He afterwards says:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the words used above, we have
formerly freed ourselves from all trouble, because we cannot accurately define
what science each professed. Clearly enough they covered their shamelessness by
honorable titles, although they gave themselves up to every possible imposture.
They called themselves by the usual name of learned men, when they were really
unacquainted with any art or science, and deluded mankind by miserable
predictions; hence, by these words, Daniel comprehended all the Magi,
soothsayers, astrologers, and augurs, who professed the art of divination. Here
Nebuchadnezzar confesses that he sent; for these men in vain. Hence it follows,
this whole science was a fallacy, or, at, least, Daniel&#8217;s exposition of
the dream was not by human skill, but by revelation from heaven. I embrace this
opinion, since Nebuchadnezzar wished clearly to express that Daniel&#8217;s
power of interpreting his dream did not spring from man, but was a singular gift
of the Spirit. He had considered it a settled point that, if any knowledge or
skill in divination existed, it must belong to the Magi, soothsayers, augurs,
and other Chaldeans who boasted in the possession of perfect wisdom. This,
therefore, was with. out controversy&#8212;that the astrologers and the rest
were most powerful in divination, and as far as human faculties would allow,
nothing escaped them. Hence it follows, on the other hand, that Daniel was
divinely instructed, since if he had been only an astrologer or magician, he
must, like others, have required a long&#8217; apprenticeship to this science.
Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, wishes here to extol Daniel beyond all the Magi, as
if he had said&#8212;He is a heavenly Prophet! And this, also, will appear
better from what is added, as follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the king of Babylon addresses Daniel kindly,
since he saw himself deserted by his own teachers. And hence we gather that no
one comes to the true God, unless impelled by necessity. Daniel was not either
unknown or far off; for we saw him to have been in the palace. Since then the
king had Daniel with him from the first, why did he pass him over? Why did he
call the other Magi from all quarters by his edict? Hence, as I have said, it
clearly appears he would never have given glory to God, unless when compelled by
extreme necessity. Hence he never willingly submitted to the God of Israel; and
his affections were clearly but momentary, whenever they manifested any sign of
piety. Because he besought Daniel so imploringly, we see his disposition to have
been servile; just as all proud men swell out when they do not need any
one&#8217;s help, and become overbearing in their insolence; but when they are
reduced<i> </i>to extremity, they would rather lick the dust than not obtain the
favor which they need. Such was the king&#8217;s disposition, since he willingly
despised Daniel, and purposely preferred the Magi. But as soon as he saw himself
left in difficulties, and unable to find any remedy except in Daniel, this was
his last refuge; and he now seems to forget his own loftiness while speaking

</i>We yesterday shewed King Nebuchadnezzar to be a suppliant to Daniel, when
reduced to extremity. He did not seek him at first, but consulted his Magicians,
and he is now compelled to venerate the person whom he had despised. He calls
him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Belteshazzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and doubtless the name severely wounded the Prophet&#8217;s mind; for
another name had been imposed upon him by his parents from his earliest infancy;
whence he could recognize himself as a Jew, and could draw his origin from a
holy and elect nation. For his change of name was doubtless made by the
tyrant&#8217;s cunning, as we have previously said, as to cause him to forget
his own family. King Nebuchadnezzar wished, by changing his name, to render this
holy servant of God degenerate. Hence, as often as he was called by this name,
he was clearly offended in no slight degree. But this evil could not be
remedied, since he was a captive, and knew he had to deal with a people
victorious, proud, and cruel. Thus, in the last verse, Nebuchadnezzar had used
this name according to the name of his god. Since then Daniel had a name of his
own, which his parents had given him by God&#8217;s appointment, Nebuchadnezzar
wished to blot out that sacred name, and so called him as a mark of respect
Belteshazzar, which we may believe to have been deduced from the name of an
idol. Hence this doubled the Prophet&#8217;s grief, when he was stained with
that base spot in bearing an idol&#8217;s mark on his name; but it was his duty
to endure this scourge of God among his other trials. Thus God exercised his
servant in every way by enduring a cross.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prince of the
Magi</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and this doubtless wounded the
holy Prophet&#8217;s feelings. He wished nothing better than separation from the
Magi, who deceived the world by their impostures and soothsaying. For although
they were skilled in the science of astrology, and knew some principles worthy
of praise, yet we are sure they corrupted all the sciences. Hence Daniel did not
willingly hear himself included among them; but he could not free himself from
this infamy. Thus we see his patience to have been divinely proved in various
ways. Now, Nebuchadnezzar adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because I know the spirit of the
holy gods to be in thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many understand
this of angels; and this interpretation is not objectionable, as I have hinted
elsewhere. For the existence of a supreme God was known to all the nations, but
they fancied angels to be inferior deities. Whatever be the true meaning,
Nebuchadnezzar here betrays his own ignorance, since he had made no real
progress in the knowledge of the true God; because he was entangled in his
former errors, and retained many gods, as from the beginning he had been imbued
with that superstition. This passage might have been translated in the singular
number, as some do, but it would be too forced, and the reason for such a
translation is too weak; for they think Nebuchadnezzar to have been truly
converted; but the vanity of this is proved by the whole context; and being
occupied by this opinion, they wish to relieve him from all fault. But since it
is clear that in this edict of Nebuchadnezzar many proofs of his old ignorance
are comprehended, there is no reason why we should depart from the simple sense
of the words. Hence he attributes a divine spirit to Daniel, but meanwhile
imagines many gods. Since, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of the holy gods is in
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and no secret overcomes
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anes, </i>to be troublesome; it properly signifies to compel, or to force;
for those who translate &#8220;there is no secret which can surpass thee,&#8221;
depart from the correct sense. Others translate it, &#8220;to be
troublesome.&#8221; This would be a more tolerable translation, but they would
do better by translating, &#8220;no<i> </i>secret renders thee anxious or
perplexed.&#8221; If the rules of .grammar would allow the

is necessary to remember what I said,&#8212;No secret renders thee anxious, or

to himself in his perplexity? As Daniel could free him from all perplexity, the
king&#8217;s ingratitude is proved, because he admitted the Magi to his
counsels, and neglected Daniel. We see then how he always endeavored to avoid
God, till he was drawn along by a violent. hand, and thereby displayed the
absence of conversion. For repentance is voluntary, and those only are said to
repent, who willingly return by a change of mind to the God from whom they had

not unknown, and he relates it to Daniel. There is, therefore, something
superfluous in these words, but no doubt about the sense &#8212; as
Nebuchadnezzar only asks for the explanation of his dream. It follows:

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Nebuchadnezzar relates his dream, of which the
interpretation will follow in its place. Yet because this narrative is cold and
useless unless we should say something of the subject itself, it is necessary to
make some remarks &#8212; the rest shall be deferred. First of all, under the
figure of a tree Nebuchadnezzar himself is intended, not because it fully
represents the king&#8217;s office, but because God appointed the existence of
governments in the world for this purpose&#8212;to be like trees on whose fruits
all men feed, and under whose shadow they rest. Hence this ordinance of God
flourishes, because tyrants, however they are removed from the exercise of just
and moderate dominion, whether they wish it or <i>not, </i>are compelled to be
like trees; since it is better to live under the most cruel tyrant than without
any government at all. Let us suppose all to be on one equal level, what would
such anarchy bring forth? No one would wish to yield to others; every one Would
try the extent of his powers, and thus all would end in prey and plunder, and in
the mere license of fraud and murder, and all the passions of mankind would have
full and unbridled sway. Hence I have said, tyranny is better than anarchy, and
more easily borne, because where there is no supreme governor there is none to
preside and keep the rest in check. Wherefore they philosophize too minutely who
think this to be a description of a king endued with superior virtues; for there
was no such superiority in justice and equity in King Nebuchadnezzar. God
principally wished to shew, by this figure, with what intention and with what
political order he desires the world to be governed; and why he sets over it
kings and monarchies and other magistrates. Then he desired to shew,
<i>secondly, </i>although tyrants and other princes forget their duty, it is
still divinely enjoined upon them, and yet God&#8217;s grace always shines forth
in all governments. Tyrants endeavor to extinguish the whole light of equity and
justice, and to mingle all things; but the Lord meanwhile restrains them in a
secret and wonderful manner, and thus they are compelled to act usefully to the
human race, whether they will or not. This then is the meaning of the figure or
image of the tree.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the birds of heaven dwelt amidst
the branches, and the beasts lived by its
sustenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212;which </i>ought to be
referred to mankind. For although even the beasts of the field profit by
political order, yet we know society to have been ordained by God for the
benefit of men. There is no doubt at all of the whole discourse being
metaphorical, &#8212;nay, properly speaking, it is an allegory, since an
allegory is only a continued metaphor. If Daniel had only represented the king
under the figure of a tree, it would have been a metaphor; but when he pursues
his own train of thought in a continuous tenor, his discourse becomes
allegorical. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the beasts of the field dwelt
under the tree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because we are sheltered
by the protection of magistrates; and no heat of the sun so parches and burns up
miserable men as living deprived of that shade under which God wished them to,
repose. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The birds of heaven also
nestled in its boughs and leaves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some
distinguish, with too much subtlety, between birds and beasts. It is sufficient
for us to observe the Prophet. noticing how men of every rank feel no small
utility in the protection of princes; for if they were deprived of it, it were
better for them to live like wild beasts than mutually to confide in each other.
Such protection is needful, if we reflect upon the great pride natural to all,
and the blindness of our self-love, and the furiousness of our lusts. As this is
the case, God shews, in this dream, how all orders among us need the protection
of magistrates; while </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pasture and
food and shelter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>signify the various
forms of usefulness which political order provides for us. For some might
object&#8212;they have no need of government either for one reason or another;
for if we discharge properly all the duties of life, we shall always. find
God&#8217;s blessing sufficient for us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now
added,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> its height was
great</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it grew till it reached even to
heaven, and its aspect extended itself to the furthest bounds of the
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is restricted to the
Babylonian monarchy, for there were then other empires in the world, but they
were either powerless or but slightly important. The Chaldeans, also, were then
so powerful that no prince could approach to such majesty and power. Since,
therefore, King Nebuchadnezzar was so pre-eminent, the loftiness of the tree
here described is not surprising, though it reached to heaven; while the
altitude rendered it visible throughout the whole land. Some of the rabbis place
Babylon in the middle of the earth, because it was under the same line or
parallel with Jerusalem&#8212;which is very foolish. Those also who place
Jerusalem in the center of the earth are equally childish; although Jerome,
Origen, and other ancient authors, treat Jerusalem as in the center of the
world. In this conjecture of theirs they deserve the laughter of the Cynic who,
when asked to point out the middle of the earth:, touched the ground with his
staff immediately under his feet! Then when the questioner objected to this
determination of the center of the earth, he said,&#8221; Then do you measure
the earth!&#8221; As far as concerns Jerusalem, their conjectures are not worth
mentioning. That proud Barbinel [Abarbanel] wished to seem a philosopher, but
nothing is more insipid than the Jews where they depart from their own rules of
grammar; and the Lord so blinded them and delivered them up to a reprobate
sense, when he wished them to be spectacles of horrible blindness and prodigious
stupidity,&#8212;and in a small and minute matter that silly fellow shews his
absurdity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Its boughs were beautiful, and
its fruit copious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This must be referred
to the common opinion of the vulgar; for we know men&#8217;s eyes to be dazzled
by the splendor of princes. For if any one excels others in power, all men adore
him and are seized with admiration, and are incapable of judging correctly. When
the majesty of a general or a king comes before them, they are all astonished
and perceive nothing, and they do not think it lawful for them to inquire
strictly into the conduct of princes. Since, then, the power and wealth of King
Nebuchadnezzar were so great, no wonder the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His branches were beautiful, and
their fruit copious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But meanwhile we
must remember what I lately said, namely, God&#8217;s blessing shines forth in
princes, even if they materially neglect their duty, because God does not suffer
all his grace in them to be extinguished; and hence they are compelled to bring
forth some fruit. It is much better, therefore, to preserve the existence of
some kind of dominion than to have all men&#8217;s condition equal, when each
attracts the, eyes of his neighbors. And this is the meaning of what I have
<i>said&#8212;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was food
and provision for all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as I have lately
explained it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second </i>part of the dream follows here.
Hitherto Nebuchadnezzar has described the beauty and excellency of his state
under the figure of a lofty tree which afforded shade to the beasts and on whose
fruit they fed, and next as giving, nests to the birds of heaven under its
boughs. The cutting down of the tree now follows.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
saw,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the visions of my head upon my
couch, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No doubt we ought to understand
an angel by a watcher. He is called &#8220;<i>a </i>holy one,&#8221; which is
only another form of expression for an angel; and they are worthy of this name,
because they are perpetually watchful in the performance of God&#8217;s
commands. They are not subject to slumber, they are not nourished by either food
or drink, but live a spiritual life; hence they have no use for sleep, which is
the result of drink and food. Lastly, as angels have no bodies, their very
spiritual nature makes them watchful. But this phrase not only expresses their
nature but also their duty; because God has them at hand to fulfill his bidding,
and destines them to the performance of his commands, hence they are called
&#8220;watchers.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:20.) In this Psalm angels are said to do his bidding, because, by an agility
incomprehensible to us, they run about hither and thither, and fly directly from
heaven to earth, from one end of the world to another &#8212; from the rising
even to the setting sun. Since, therefore, angels can so easily and promptly
fulfill God&#8217;s orders, they are deservedly called
&#8220;<i>watchers.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>They are called &#8220;<i>holy
</i>ones,&#8221; because they are not infected by human infirmities. But we are
filled with really sins, not merely because we are earthly, but since we have
contracted pollution from our first parents, which vitiates alike the whole body
and mind. By this expression, then, Nebuchadnezzar desired to distinguish
between angels and mortals. For although God here sanctifies his elect, yet as
long as they dwell in the prison of the body they never arrive at the holiness
of angels. Here then we mark the difference between angels and men.
Nebuchadnezzar could not understand this by himself, but he was taught of God to
perceive the destruction of the tree to arise not from man but from the
Almighty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adds&#8212;the angel cried with a
loud voice, cut down the tree, strip off the leaves, cut off its boughs, scatter
its fruits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(or throw them away,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and let the beasts flee from its
shadow, and the birds of heaven dwell no longer under its
branches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this figure God meant to
express that King Nebuchadnezzar should be for a time like a beast. This ought
not to seem absurd, although it is but rough to speak of a tree being deprived
of a human heart, since men know trees to have no other life than that usually
called vegetable. The dignity or excellence of the tree cannot be lessened by
its being without a human heart, for it never had one originally. But though
this is rather a rough mode of expression., yet it contains in it nothing
absurd, although Daniel bends a little aside from the strictness of the
allegory; <i>nay, </i>Nebuchadnezzar himself had an allegorical dream, and yet
God mingled something with it by which he might comprehend the meaning veiled
under the image of a tree. The angel, then, orders the tree to be deprived of
its human heart, and its bough and fruit to be torn down and cast away, after it
had been cut down; next he orders the heart of a beast to be given to it, and
thus its portion might be with the wild animals of the woods. But as this must
be repeated elsewhere, I now pass it by rather hastily. The general meaning is
this; King Nebuchadnezzar was to be deprived for a time not only of his empire
but even of his human sense, and to be in no way different from the beasts,
since he was unworthy of holding even the lowest place among mankind. Although
he seemed to surpass the human race in his elevation, yet he must be cast down
and thrown below even the lowest mortals!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason for this punishment follows, when it is
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven times shall pass
over him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do not cut off its lowest root,
but let the rain of heaven water it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and
next; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his portion shall be with
the wild beasts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although the
chastisement is hard and horrible, when Nebuchadnezzar is expelled from the
society of men, and rendered like wild beasts; but it is something in his favor
when God does not tear him up by the roots, but allows the root to remain, for
the tree to spring up again and flourish, and be planted again in its own place,
and recover new vigor through its roots. Here Daniel reviews the punishment
inflicted on King Nebuchadnezzar, in which God afforded a specimen of his
clemency, in sparing him and not utterly cutting him down, but in allowing his
root to remain. Some here discourse about the mitigation of penalties when God
sees those repent whom he has chastised with rods; but I do not think it
applicable here. There was no true conversion in King Nebuchadnezzar, as we said
before, and shall see again more clearly. God did not wish to press him too
hard, and this we must attribute to his clemency; because when he seems to set
no bounds to his punishment of men&#8217;s sins, yet in all temporal punishments
he allows men to taste his pity; so that even the reprobate remain without
excuse. The assertion of some&#8212;that punishments are not remitted without
the fault being excused, is false; as we see in the example of Ahab. For God
remitted the fault to the impious king, but because he seemed to shew some signs
of repentance, God abstained from greater punishment. (1 Kings 21:29.) So also
we may see the same in the case of Nebuchadnezzar. God was unwilling utterly to
root him out&#8212;for the metaphor of the tree shews this&#8212;but he desired
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven times to pass over
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some understand seven weeks, others
seven years; but we shall treat this point more copiously by and bye. Lastly, we
must notice this; in the midst of the time during which God&#8217;s wrath seemed
to rage against this wretched king, his benefits were also mingled with it. We
learn this from the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
portion shall be with the beasts of the
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, he shall feed upon some
food by which life shall be preserved; and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall be
watered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or irrigated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the rain of
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For God signifies&#8212;though
he wished to punish King Nebuchadnezzar, and to render him a remarkable example
of his wrath&#8212;his knowledge of what he could bear; hence, he so tempers his
punishment as to leave hope remaining for the future, Thus he took his food even
with the beasts of the earth, but he is not deprived of the irrigation of the
dew of heaven.</font><br></div>

<i>pethegma, </i>is concerned, it signifies &#8220;word&#8221; in Chaldee; but
here I think it properly used for &#8220;edict,&#8221; as in the first chapter
of Esther,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;170120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Esther
1:20;) and this is a very suitable sense, as the edict was promulgated in the
decree so that the &#8220;word&#8221; or vision might not prove vain and
inefficient; since God wished to point out to the king what was already fixed
and determined in heaven. We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s intention. But a
new question still remains, because it seems absurd to attribute power and
authority to those angels, lest in this way they seem to be equal to God. We
know God to be judge alone, and hence it is his proper office to determine what
pleases him; and if this is transferred to angels, it seems as if it lessened
his supreme authority, because it is not becoming to make them companions of his
Majesty. But we know it to be no new thing in Scripture for God to join angels
with himself, not as equals but as attendants, and to attribute to them so much
honor as to deign to call them into counsel. Hence angels are often called
God&#8217;s counselors. As in this place they are said to decree together with
God; and not by their own will or pleasure, as they say, but because they
subscribe to God&#8217;s judgment. Meanwhile, we must remark the double
character assigned to them. In the first clause, Daniel makes them subscribe to
the decree,<i> </i>and afterwards uses the word <i>demand. </i>And this suits
the sense well enough; because the angels urge God by their prayers to humble
all mortals and to exalt himself alone. Thus, whatever obscures his glory may be
reduced into order. It is right for angels constantly to desire this, since we
know them to desire nothing in comparison with the adoration of God by
themselves in alliance with all mankind. But when they see God&#8217;s authority
diminished by man&#8217;s pride and audacity, the object of their demand is that
God would reduce under his yoke the proud who erect their crests against
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see why Daniel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this was declared in, the decree
of the watchers, and was demanded in their
speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; as </i>if he should. say;
&#8220;<i>thou </i>hast all angels opposed to thee; for by one consent and with
Gale mouth they accuse thee before God, for as far as possible thou obscurest
his glory; and God, assenting to their prayers, has determined to cast thee
away, and to render thee an object of contempt and reproach before the whole
world; and this decree has been signed by<i> </i>all the angels, as if it were
common between him and them. For by their subscription and agreement he might
prevail[ in confirming the confidence of the profane king. Without doubt God,
after his usual manner, accommodated the vision to the understanding of a man
who never was taught in his law, but only imbued with a confused notion of his
divinity, so that he could not distinguish between God and angels. Meanwhile,
this sentiment is true &#8212; the edict was promulgated at the united consent
and demand of the whole celestial host; for angels bear with the greatest
reluctance whatever detracts from God&#8217;s glory, and all the folly of
mankind when they wish to draw and attract to themselves the peculiar attributes
of the only God. This seems to be flute genuine sense. The following sentence
flows very suitably, <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mortals must know God to be a
ruler in the kingdoms of men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For Daniel
marks the end of the demand, since angels desire God&#8217;s rights to remain
entire, and to be quite unaffected by the ingratitude of mankind. But men cannot
ascribe even the slightest merit to themselves without detracting from
God&#8217;s praise; hence angels continually seek from God the casting down of
all the proud, and that he will not permit himself to be defrauded of his proper
rights, but maintain in all its integrity his own sovereign powers. This also
must. be diligently observed &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mortals should notice how the
Lord reigns in the kingdoms of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For
even the worst of men confess the mighty power of God; they dare not draw him
down from his heavenly throne by their blasphemies, but they imagine themselves
able to obtain and defend their worldly kingdoms, by either their exertions or
their wealth, or by some other means. Unbelievers, therefore, willingly shut up
God in heaven, just as Epicurus fancied him to be enjoying his own delights at
his ease. Hence Daniel shews God to be deprived of his rights,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unless he is recognized as a
ruler in the kingdoms of men,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is,
on earth to humble all whom he pleases. So also it is said in the Psalms,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
75:7,) Power springs not from either the east or the west, but; from heaven; and
elsewhere, God raises the poor out of the mire,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
113:6.) Then in the sacred Canticle of the Virgin, he casts down the proud from
their seat, and exalts the abject and the humble.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420152&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:52.) All indeed confess this, but scarcely one in a hundred feels. in his mind
the dominion of God over the earth, and that no man can raise himself, or remain
in any post of honor, since this is the peculiar gift of God. Because men are
persuaded of this with difficulty. Daniel eloquently expresses it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord shall be lofty in the
kingdoms of men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, shall not;
only exercise his power in heaven, but also govern the human race, and assign to
every one his own grade and position.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will give it to whom he
wills</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks of different empires in
the singular number; just as if God had said, some: are raised up by
God&#8217;s. will, and others are cast down; and the whole happens according to
God&#8217;s pleasure. The meaning is this &#8212; -every one has his own
condition divinely assigned to him; and thus a, man&#8217;s ambition, or skill,
or prudence, or wealth, or the help of others, do not profit men in aspiring to
any altitude, unless God raises them by his stretched out hand. Paul also
teaches the same thing in other words; there is no power but from God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1,) and afterwards Daniel often repeats the same sentiment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he raises up the humble man above
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In a change so remarkable as
this, God&#8217;s power shines forth better while he raises from the dust those
who were formerly obscure and contemptible, and even sets them above kings. When
this happens, profane men say, God is playing with them, and rolls men about
like balls in his hand, which are first tossed upwards and then thrown down upon
the ground. But they do not consider the reason why God by open proofs wishes to
shew how we are under his absolute power, on which our condition entirely
depends; when we do not comprehend this of our own accord, examples are
necessarily set before us by which we are compelled to perceive what almost all
are willingly ignorant of. We now understand the whole intention of the Prophet.
Angels seek from God by continual prayers to declare his own power to mortals,
and thus to lay prostrate the proud who think to excel by their own power and
industry, or else by chance, or by the help of men. To induce God to punish men
for their sacrilegious deeds, the angels desire him to prostrate them, and thus
to shew himself to be not only the king and ruler of heaven, but also of earth.
Now, this not only happens in the case of a single king<i>, </i>but we know
history to be full of such proofs. Whence, then, or from what order have kings
often been created? And when there was no greater pride in the world than in the
Roman empire, we see what happened. For God brought forward certain monsters
which caused the greatest astonishment among the Greeks and all the 0rien.tals,
the Spaniards, Italians, and Gauls; for nothing was more monstrous than some of
the emperors. Then their origin was most base and shameful, and God could not
shew more clearly their empires were not transferred by the will of man, nor
even acquired by valor, counsel, and powerful troops, but remained under his own
hand to bestow upon whomsoever he pleased. Let us go on:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Nebuchadnezzar repeats what he had formerly said
about seeking an interpretation for his dream. He understood the figure which
was shewn to him, but he could not understand God&#8217;s intentions nor even
determine its relation to himself. On this point he implores Daniel&#8217;s
confidence; he affirms his vision in a dream to induce Daniel to pay great
attention to its interpretation. Then he adds, with the same purpose,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the wise men of his kingdom
could not explain the dreary; </i></font><font face="Palatino">where he
confesses all the astrologers, and diviners, and others of this kind to be
utterly vain and fallacious, since they professed to know everything. For some
were augurs, some conjectures, some interpreters of dreams, and others
astrologers, who not only discoursed on the course, distances, and orders of the
stars, and the peculiarities of each, but wished to predict futurity from the
course of the stars. Since, therefore, they boasted so magnificently in their
superior knowledge of all events, Nebuchadnezzar confesses them to have been
impostors. But he ascribes this power in reality to Daniel, because he was
endued by the divine Spirit. Hence he excludes all the wise men of Babylon from
so great a gift through his having proved them destitute of God&#8217;s Spirit.
He does not assert this in so many words, but this meaning is easily elicited
from his expressions implying all the variety of the Chaldean wise men. Then in
the second clause he exempts Daniel from their number, and states the reason to
be his excelling in the divine Spirit. Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, here asserts
what is peculiar to God, and acknowledges Daniel to be his Prophet and minister.
When he calls angels </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holy
deities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we have mentioned this already
as an expression which ought not to seem surprising in a heathen, uninstructed
in the true doctrine of piety, and only just initiated in its elements. But we
know this common opinion respecting angels being mingled together with the one
God. Hence Nebuchadnezzar speaks in the ordinary and received language when he
says, the spirit of the holy gods dwells in Daniel. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel relates how he was in some sense
astonished. And I refer this to the sorrow which the holy Prophet had <i>endured
</i>from that horrible punishment which God had shewn under a figure; nor ought
it to seem surprising for Daniel to be grievously afflicted on account of the
calamity of the king of Babylon; for although he was a cruel tyrant, and had
harassed and all but destroyed God&#8217;s Church, yet since he was under his
Sway, he was bound to pray for him. But God had deafly taught the Jews this, by
means of Jeremiah, Pray ye for the prosperous state of Babylon, because your
peace shall be in it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:7.) At the close of seventy years it was lawful for the pious worshippers of
God to beg him to free them; but until the time predicted by the Prophet had
elapsed, it was not lawful either to indulge in hatred against the king, or to
invoke God&#8217;s wrath upon him. They knew him to be the executor of
God&#8217;s just vengeance, and also to be their sovereign and lawful ruler.
Since then Daniel was treated kindly by the king when by the rights of warfare
he was dragged into exile, he ought to be faithful to his own king, although he
exercised tyranny against the people of God. This was the reason why he suffered
so much sorrow from that sad oracle. Others think he was in an ecstasy; but this
seems to suit better because he does not simply speak of being astonished, but
even disturbed and terrified in his thoughts. Meanwhile, we must remark, how
variously the Prophets were affected when God uses them in denouncing his
approaching judgments. Whenever God appointed his Prophets the heralds of severe
calamities, they were affected in two ways; on the one side, they condoled with
those miserable men whose destruction they saw at hand, and still they boldly
announced what had been divinely commanded; and thus their sorrow never hindered
them from discharging their duty freely and consistently. In Daniel&#8217;s case
we see both these feelings. The sympathy, then, was right in his condoling with
his king and being silent for about an hour. And when the king commands him to
be of good courage and not to be disturbed, we have here depicted the security
of those who do not apprehend the wrath of God. The Prophet is terrified, and
yet he is free from all evil; for God does not threaten him, nay, the very
punishment which he sees prepared for the king, afforded the hope of future
deliverance. Why then is he frightened? because the faithful, though God spares
them and shews himself merciful and propitious, cannot view his judgments
without fear, for they acknowledge themselves subject to similar penalties, if
God did not treat them with indulgence. Besides this, they never put off human
affections, and so pity takes possession of them, when they see the ungodly
punished or even subject to impending wrath. For these two reasons they suffer
sorrow and pain. But the impious, even when God openly addresses and threatens
them, are not moved, but remain stupid, or openly deride his power and treat his
threats as fabulous, till they feel them seriously. Such is the example which
the Prophet sets before us in the king of Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Belteshazzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let not thy thoughts
disturb thee; let not the dream and its interpretation frighten
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>/ </i>Yet Daniel was afraid for his
sake. But, as I have already said, while the faithful are afraid though they
feel God to be propitious, yet the impious sleep in their security, and are
unmoved and unterrified by any threats. Daniel adds the cause of his grief,
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my
lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>may the dream be for thine
enemies, and its interpretation to thy foes!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here Daniel explains why he was so astonished &#8212; because he wished so
horrible a punishment to be turned away from the person of the king; for
although he might deservedly have detested him, yet he reverenced the power
divinely assigned to him. Let us learn, therefore, from the Prophet&#8217;s
example, to pray for blessings on our enemies who desire to destroy us, and
especially to pray for tyrants if it please God to subject us to their lust; for
although they are unworthy of any of the feelings of humanity, yet we must
modestly bear their yoke, because they could not be our governors without
God&#8217;s permission; and not only for wrath, as Paul admonishes us, but for
conscience&#8217; sake,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:5,) otherwise we should not only rebel against them, but against God himself.
But, on the other hand, Daniel shews the impossibility of his being changed or
softened by any sentiment of pity, and thus turned from his intended
course:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here we see what I have touched upon, namely, how
Daniel acted respectfully to the king, and thus was mindful of his prophetic
duty, while he punctually discharged the commands of God. We must notice this
distinction, for nothing is more difficult for ministers of the Word than to
maintain this middle course. Some are always fulminating through a pretense of
zeal, and forget themselves to be but men: they shew no sign of benevolence, but
indulge in mere bitterness. Hence they have no authority, and all their
admonitions are hateful. Next, they explain God&#8217;s Word with pride and
boasting, when they frighten sinners without either humanity, or pain, or
sympathy. Others, again, who are wicked and perfidious flatterers, gloss over
the grossest iniquities; they object to both Prophets and Apostles, esteeming
the fervor of their zeal to have driven away all human affections! Thus they
delude miserable men, and destroy them by their flattery. But our Prophet, as
all the rest, here shews how God&#8217;s servants ought to take a middle course.
Thus Jeremiah, when prophesying adversity, feels sorrow and bitterness of
spirit, and yet does not turn aside from unsparing reproof of the severest
threats, as both sprang from God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
9:1.) The rest of the prophets also act in the same manner. Here Daniel, on the
one hand, pities the king, and on the other, through knowing himself to be the
herald of God&#8217;s anger, he is not frightened by any danger while setting
before the king the punishment which he had despised. Hence we gather why he was
not astonished. He felt no fear of the tyrant, although many do not dare to
discharge their duty when an odious message is entrusted to them, which
stimulates the impious and the unbelievers to madness. Daniel, however, was not
astonished with any fear of this kind; he only wished God to act mercifully
towards his king. For he says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art king
thyself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not speak with any
doubt or hesitation, neither does he use obscurity nor a number of excuses, but
plainly announces king Nebuchadnezzar to be intended by the tree which he saw.
Hence </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the tree which thou sawest
is large and strong, under the shade of which the beasts of the field were
dwelling, and in the boughs of which the birds of the air were making their

Supreme King, he did not hesitate to elevate his discourse above the
king&#8217;s command &#8212; as all the prophets do who rise up against
mountains and hills, as Jeremiah does in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:10. Thus this sentence is worthy of notice, &#8212; &#8220;I have appointed
thee over kingdoms and peoples, to pluck them up and to plant them, to build and
to destroy.&#8221; God, therefore, wishes to assert so great a reverence for his
Word, because there is nothing in the world so magnificent or splendid which
does not yield to it. Daniel, then, as far as <i>concerns </i>human events and
political order, confesses the king to be his master; but meanwhile he goes on
with the embassy entrusted to him.

We have stated why Scripture calls angels &#8220;<i>watchers,</i>&#8221;<i>

executes his decrees by their agency: I said angels always discharge this duty,

to enable them to discharge with the utmost celerity whatever God enjoins upon
them. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast seen, then, one

meaning, until a long time shall pass away. Others think months denoted; others,
years; but I willingly incline to this interpretation, since God wishes for no
short time to punish King Nebuchadnezzar. It may not seem customary, indeed, but
as he wished to put forth an example for all ages, he desired to prolong his
punishment. This, therefore, seems the meaning of the seven years; for we know
the number seven years to signify a long time in Scripture, since it denotes
perfection.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">DANIEL proceeds with the explanation of the
king&#8217;s dream, to whom the last verse which I explained yesterday applies.
This ought to be expressed, because this message was sorrowful and bitter for
the king. We know how indignantly kings are usually compelled not only to submit
to orders, but even to be cited before God&#8217;s tribunal, where they must be
overwhelmed in shame and disgrace. For we know how prosperity intoxicates the
plebeian race. What, then, can happen to kings except forgetfulness of the
condition of our nature when they attempt to free themselves from all
inconvenience and trouble? For they do not consider themselves subject to the
common necessities of mankind. As, therefore, Nebuchadnezzar could scarcely bear
this message, here the Prophet admonishes him in a few words concerning the
cutting down of the tree as the figure of that ruin which hung over him. He now
follows this up at length, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall cast thee out from
among men, and thy habitation shall be with the beasts of the
field.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When Daniel had previously
discoursed upon the Four Monarchies, there is no doubt about the king&#8217;s
mind being at first exasperated; but this was far more severe, and in the
king&#8217;s opinion far less tolerable, as he is compared to wild beasts, and
cut off from the number of mankind, and then he was driven into the fields and
woods to feed with the wild beasts. If Daniel had only said the king was to be
despoiled of his royal dignity, he would have been greatly offended by that
disgrace, but when he was subject to such extreme shame, he was, doubtless,
inwardly maddened by it. But God still restrained his fury lest he should desire
to be revenged upon the supposed injury which he suffered. For we shall
afterwards see from the context that he did not grow wise again. Since,
therefore, he always <i>cherished </i>the same pride, there is no doubt of his
cruelty, for these two vices were united; but the Lord restrained his madness,
and spared his holy Prophet. Meanwhile, the constancy of God&#8217;s servant is
worthy of observation, as he does not obliquely hint at what should happen to
the king, but relates clearly and at length how base and disgraceful a condition
remained for him. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall cast
thee out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from among
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If he had said, thou shalt be as it
were one of the common herd, and shalt not differ from the very dregs of the
people, this would have been. very severe. But when the king is ejected from the
society of mankind, so that not a single corner remains, and he is not allowed
to spend his life among ox-herds and swineherds, every one may judge for himself
how odious this would be; nor does Daniel here hesitate to pronounce such a
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The following clause has the same or at least similar
weight, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy
dwelling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be with the beasts of the
field, and its herb shall feed thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
plural number is used indefinitely in the original; and hence it may be properly
translated, &#8220;<i>Thou </i>shalt feed on grass; thou shalt be watered by the
dew of heaven; thy dwelling shall be with wild beasts.&#8221; I do not wish to
philosophize with subtlety, as some do, who understand angels. I confess this to
be true; but the Prophet simply teaches punishment to be at hand for the king of
Babylon, while he should be reduced to extreme ignominy, and differ in nothing
from the brutes. This liberty, therefore, as I have said, is worthy of notice,
to shew us how God&#8217;s servants, who have to discharge the duty of teaching,
cannot faithfully act their part unless they shut their eyes and despise all
worldly grandeur. Hence, by the example of the king, let us learn our duty, and
not be stubborn and perverse when God threatens us. Although, as we have said,
Nebuchadnezzar did not grow wise, as the context will shew us, yet we shall see
how he bore the terrible judgment denounced against him. If, therefore, we, who
are but as refuse compared to him, cannot bear God&#8217;s threats when they are
set before us,-he will be our witness and judge, who, though possessed of such
mighty power, dared nothing against the Prophet. Now, at the end of the verse,
the sentence formerly explained is repeated,<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until thou dost
acknowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>how great a Lord there is in the
kingdom of men, who delivers it to whomsoever he
will.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage teaches us again how
difficult it is for us to attribute supreme power to God. In our language,
indeed, we are great heralds of God&#8217;s glory, but still every one restricts
his power, either by usurping something to himself, or by transferring it to
some one else. Especially when God raises us to any degree of dignity, we forget
ourselves to be men, and snatch away God&#8217;s honor from him, and desire to
substitute ourselves for him. This disease is cured with difficulty, and the
punishment which God inflicted on the king of Babylon is an example to us. A
slight chastisement would have been sufficient unless this madness had been
deeply seated in his bowels and marrow, since men claim to themselves the
peculiar property of God. Hence they have need of a violent medicine to learn
modesty and humility. In these days, monarchs, in their titles, always put
forward themselves as kings, generals, and counts, by the grace of God; but how
many falsely pretend to apply God&#8217;s name to themselves, for the purpose of
securing the supreme power! For what is the meaning of that title of kings and
princes &#8212; &#8220;by the grace of God<i>?</i>&#8221;<i> </i>except to avoid
the acknowledgment of a superior. Meanwhile, they willingly trample upon that
God with whose shield they protect themselves, &#8212; so far are they from
seriously thinking themselves to reign by his permission! It is mere pretense,
therefore, to boast that they reign through God&#8217;s favor. Since this is so,
we may easily judge how proudly profane kings despise God, even though they make
no fallacious use of his name, as those triflers who openly fawn upon him, and
thus profane the name of his grace! It now follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel closes the interpretation of the dream,
and shews how God did not treat King Nebuchadnezzar so severely by not giving
way to <i>clemency. </i>He mitigates, indeed, the extreme rigor of the
punishment, to induce Nebuchadnezzar to call upon God and repent, through
indulging the hope of pardon, as a clearer exhortation will afterwards follow.
But Daniel now prepares him for penitence, by swing
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His kingdom should
stand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For God might cast him out from
intercourse with mankind, and thus he would always remain among wild beasts. He
might instantly remove him from the world; but this is a mark of his clemency,
since he wished to restore him, not to a merely moderate station, but to his
former dignity, as if it had never been trenched upon. We see, therefore, how
useful the dream was to King Nebuchadnezzar, so long as he did not despise the
Prophet&#8217;s holy admonition, through ingratitude towards God; because Daniel
not only predicted the slaughter which was at hand, but brought at the same time
a message of reconciliation. God, therefore, had instructed the king to some
purpose, unless he had been unteachable and perverse, like the majority of
mankind. Besides, we may gather from this the general doctrine of our being
invited to repentance when God puts an end to his chastisements; since he sets
before us a taste of his clemency to induce in us the hope of his being
entreated, if we only fly to him heartily and sincerely, We must notice also
what Daniel adds in the second part of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from which thou mayest know that
there is power in heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for under
these words the promise of spiritual grace is included. Since God will not only
punish the king of Babylon, to humble him, but will work in him and change his
mind, as he afterwards fulfilled, though at a long interval.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From which thou shalt know,
then</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that power is in
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have stated the grace of the
Spirit to be here promised, as we know how badly men profit, even if God repeats
his stripes an hundredfold. Such is the hardness and obstinacy of our hearts
&#8212; for we rather grow more and more obdurate, while God calls us to
repentance. And, doubtless, Nebuchadnezzar had been like Pharaoh, unless God had
humbled him, not only with outward penalties, but had added also the inward
instinct of his Spirit, to allow himself to be instructed, and to submit himself
to the judgment and power of heaven. Daniel means this when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore thou shalt
know;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for Nebuchadnezzar would never
have acquired this knowledge of his own accord, unless he had been touched by
the secret movement of the Spirit. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That there is power in
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>meaning, God governs the world
and exercises supreme power; for he here contrasts heaven with earth, meaning
all mankind. For if kings see all filings tranquil around them, and if no one
causes them terror, they think themselves beyond all chance of danger, as they
say; and through being desirous of certainty in their station, <i>they </i>look
round on all sides, but never raise their eyes upwards to heaven, as if God did
not concern himself to behold the kingdoms of the earth, and to set up whom he
would, and to prostrate all the proud. The princes of this world never consider
their power to be from heaven, as if this were entirely out of God&#8217;s
hands; but, as I have said, they look right and left, before and behind. This is
the reason why Daniel said, Power is from heaven. There is a contrast then
between God and all mankind, as if he had said, Thou shalt know God reigns
&#8212; as we have formerly seen. It follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Since interpreters do not agree about the sense of

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May my counsel therefore
please thee, and mayest thou redeem thy
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qwrp</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
peruk, </i>is here translated &#8220;<i>to </i>redeem;&#8221;<i> </i>it often
signifies &#8220;<i>to </i>break <i>off,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>or
&#8220;<i>separate,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>or &#8220;abolish.&#8221; In this passage
it may conveniently be translated, &#8220;<i>separate </i>or break off thy
sins&#8221; by pity and humanity; as if he had said, Thus thou shalt make an end
of sin, and enter upon a new course, and thus thy cruelty may be changed into
clemency, and thy tyrannical violence into pity. But this is not of much
consequence. The verb often signifies to free and to preserve; the context does
not admit the sense of preserving, and it would be harsh to say, Free thy sins
by thy righteousness. Hence I readily embrace the sense of Daniel exhorting the
king of Babylon to a change of life, so as to break off his sins in which he had
too long indulged. With respect to the clause at the end of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold there shall be a cure for
thine error</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as I have mentioned, <i>the
</i>Greeks translate, &#8220;if by chance there should be a cure;&#8221;<i>
</i>but the other sense seems to suit better; as if he had said, &#8220;this is
the proper and genuine medicine,&#8221; some translate, &#8220;a<i>
</i>promulgation,&#8221; since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;ra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arek, </i>signifies &#8220;to produce;&#8221; and at the same time they
change the signification of the other noun, for they say, &#8220;there shall be
a prolongation to thy peace or quiet.&#8221; That sense would be tolerable, but
the other suits better with the grammatical construction; besides,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>more received sense is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this
medicine may be suitable to the error</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>A
different sense may be elicited without changing the words at all;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall be a medicine for
thine errors;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>meaning, thou mayest learn
to cure thine errors. For length of indulgence increases the evil, as we have
sufficiently noticed. Hence this last part of the verse may be taken, and thus
Daniel may proceed with his exhortation; as if he had said, &#8212; it is time
to cease from thine errors, for hitherto thou hast deprived thyself of all thy
senses by giving unbridled license to thy lusts. If, therefore, there is any
moderation in thine ignorance, thou mayest open thine eyes and understand at
length how to repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to the substance of the teaching.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May my counsel please
thee!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he. Here Daniel treats the
profane king more indulgently than if he had addressed his own nation; for he
used the prophetic office. But because he knew the king did not hold the first
rudiments of piety, he here undertakes only the office of a counselor, since he
was not an ordinary teacher. As to Nebuchadnezzar sending for him, this was not
a daily thing, nor did he do this, because he wished to submit to his doctrine.
Daniel therefore remembers the kind of person with whom he was treating, when he
tempers his words and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>may
my counsel be acceptable to thee!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He
afterwards explains his counsel in a few words,<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Break
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; or </i>cast them away &#8212;
by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness, and thy
iniquities by pity to the poor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These is
no doubt that Daniel wished to exhort the king to repentance; but he touched on
only one kind, which we know was very customary with the Prophets. For when they
recall the people to obedience by repentance, they do not always explain it
fully, nor define it generally, but touch upon it by a figure of speech, and
treat only of the outward duties of penitence. Daniel now follows this custom.
If inquiry is made concerning the nature of repentance, it is the conversion of
man towards God, from whom he had been alienated. Is this conversion then only
in the hands, and feet, and tongue. Does it not rather begin in the mind and the
heart, and then pass on to outward works? Hence true penitence has its source in
the mind of men, so that he who wished to be wise must set aside his own
prudence, and put away his foolish confidence in his own reason. Then he must
subdue his own depraved affections and submit them to God, and thus his outward
life will follow the inward spirit. Besides this, works are the only testimonies
to real repentance; for it is a thing too excellent to allow its root to appear
to human observation. By our fruits therefore we must testify our repentance.
But because the duties of the second table, in some sense, open the mind of man;
hence the Prophets in requiring repentance, only set before us the duties of
charity, as Daniel says.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Redeem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
sins,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he, or break away, or east
them away &#8212; but how? namely, by righteousness. Without doubt the word
&#8220;justice&#8221; means here the same as &#8220;grace&#8221; or
&#8220;pity.&#8221; But those who here transfer &#8220;grace&#8221; to
&#8220;faith,&#8221; twist the Prophet&#8217;s words too violently; for we know
of nothing more frequent among the Hebrews than to repeat one and the same thing
under two forms of speech. As, therefore, Daniel here uses sins and iniquities
in the same sense, we conclude justice and pity ought not to be separated, while
the second word expresses more fully the sense of justice. For when men see
their life must be changed, they feign for themselves many acts of obedience
which scarcely deserve the name. They have no regard for what pleases God, nor
for what he commands in his word; but just as they approve of one part or
another, they thrust themselves rashly upon God, as we see in the Papacy. For
what is a holy and religious life with them? To run about here and there; to
undertake pilgrimages imposed by vows; to set up a statue; to found masses, as
they call it; to fast on certain days; and to lay stress on trifles about which
God has never said a single word. As, therefore, men err so grossly in the
knowledge of true righteousness, the Prophet here adds the word
&#8220;pity&#8221; by way of explanation; as if he had said, Do not think to
appease God by outward pomps, which delight mankind because they are carnal and
devoted to earthly things, and fashion for them. selves a depraved idea of God
according to their own imagination; let not then this vanity deceive you; but
learn how true justice consists in pity towards the poor. In this second clause,
then, only a part of the idea is expressed, since true just. ice is not
restricted simply to the meaning of the word, but embraces all the duties of
charity. Hence we ought to deal faithfully with mankind, and not to deceive
either rich or poor, nor to oppress any one, but to render every one his own.
But this manner of speaking ought to be familiar to us, if we are but moderately
versed in the prophetic writings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the phrase is this: &#8212; Daniel
wished to shew the king of Babylon the duty of living justly, and cultivating
faith and integrity before men, without forgetting the former table of the law.
For the worship of God is more precious than all the righteousness which men
cultivate among themselves. But true justice is known by its outward proofs, as
I have said. But he treats here the second table rather than the first: for,
while hypocrites pretend to worship God by many ceremonies, they allow
themselves to commit all kinds of cruelty, rapine, and fraud, without obeying
any law of correct living with their neighbors. Because hypocrites cover their
malice by this frivolous pretense, God sets before them a true test to recall
them to the duties of charity. This, then, is the meaning of the verse from
which we have elicited a double sense. If we retain the future time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold, there shall be a
medicine!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it will be a confirmation of
the former doctrine; as if he had said, We must not travel the long and oblique
circuits &#8212; there is this single remedy: or, if we are better pleased with
the word of exhortation, the context will be suitable; may there be a medicine
for thine errors! Mayest thou not indulge thyself hereafter as thou hast
hitherto done, but thou must open thine eyes and perceive how miserably and
wickedly thou hast lived, and so desire to heal thine errors. As the Papists
have abused this passage, to shew God to be appeased by satisfactions, it is too
frivolous and ridiculous to refute their doctrine; for when they speak of
satisfactions, they mean works of supererogation. If any one could fulfill
God&#8217;s law completely, yet he could not satisfy for his sins. The Papists
are compelled to confess this; what then remains? &#8212; The offering to God
more than he demands, which they call works not required! <i>But </i>Daniel does
not here exact of King Nebuchadnezzar any work of supererogation; he exacts
justice, and afterwards shews how a man&#8217;s life cannot be justly spent
unless humanity prevails and flourishes among men, and especially when we are
merciful to the poor. Truly there is no supererogation here! To what end then
serves the law? Surely this has no reference to satisfactions, according to the
ridiculous and. foolish notions of the Papists! But if we grant them this point,
still it does not follow that their sins are redeemed before God, as if works
compensated either their fault or penalty, as they assert; for they confess
their fault not to be redeemed by satisfactions &#8212; this is one point gained
&#8212; and then as to the penalty, they say it is redeemed; but we must see
whether this agrees with the Prophet&#8217;s intention.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will not contend about a word; I will allow it to
mean &#8220;to redeem&#8221; &#8212; Thou mayest redeem thy sins; but we must
ascertain, whether this redemption is in the judgment of God or of man? Clearly
enough, Daniel here regards the conduct of Nebuchadnezzar as unjust and inhuman,
in harassing his subjects, and in proudly despising the poor and miserable.
Since, therefore, he had so given himself up to all iniquity, Daniel shews the
remedy; and if this remedy is treated as a redemption or liberation, there is
nothing absurd in saying, we redeem our sins before men while we satisfy them. I
redeem my sins before my neighbor, if after I have injured him, I desire to
become reconciled to him, I acknowledge my sins and seek for pardon. If,
therefore, I have injured his fortunes, I restore what I have unjustly taken,
and thus redeem my transgression. But this does assist us in expiating sin
before God, as if the beneficence which I put in practice was any kind of
expiation. We see, therefore, the Papists to be foolish and silly when they
wrest the Prophet&#8217;s words to themselves. We may now inquire in the last
place, to what purpose Daniel exhorted King Nebuchadnezzar to break away from or
redeem his sins? Now this was either a matter of no consequence &#8212; which
would be absurd &#8212; or it was a heavenly decree, as the king&#8217;s dream
was a promulgation of the <i>edict, </i>as we have formerly seen. But this was
determined before God, and could not be changed in any way; it was therefore
superfluous to wish to redeem sins. If we follow a different explanation, no
difficulty will remain; but even if we allow the Prophet to be here discoursing
of the redemption of sins, yet the exhortation is not without its
use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In whatever way Nebuchadnezzar ought to prepare to
bear God&#8217;s chastisement, yet this would prove most useful to him, to
acknowledge God to be merciful. And yet the time might be contracted, during
which his obstinate wickedness should extend; not as if God changed his decree,
but because he always warns by threatening, for the purpose of treating men more
kindly, and tempering vigor with his wrath, as is evident from many other
examples. This would not have been without its use to a teachable disposition,
nor yet without fruit, when Daniel exhorted King Nebuchadnezzar to redeem his
sins, because he might obtain some pardon, even if he had paid the penalty,
since not even a single day had been allowed out of the seven years. Yet this
was a great progress, if the king had at last humbled himself before God, so as
to be in a fit state for receiving the pardon which had been promised. For as a
certain time had been fixed beforehand, or at least shewn by the Prophet, hence
it would have profited the king, if through wishing to appease his judge he had
prepared his mind for obtaining pardon. This doctrine was therefore in every way
useful, because the same reason avails with us. We ought always to be prepared
to suffer God&#8217;s chastisements; yet it is no slight or common alleviation
of our sufferings, when we so submit ourselves to God, as to be persuaded of his
desire to be propitious to us, when he sees us dissatisfied with ourselves, and
heartily detesting our transgressions.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that we may learn
to bear patiently all adverse misfortunes, and know that thou exercisest towards
us the duties of a judge, as often as we are afflicted in this world. Thus may
we prevent thy wrath, and so condemn ourselves with true humility, that trusting
in thy pity we may always flee to thee, relying upon the mediation of thy
only-begotten Son, which thou hast provided for us. Grant, also, that we may beg
pardon of thee, and resolve upon a true repentance, not with vain and useless
fictions, but by true and serious proofs, cultivating true charity and faith
among ourselves, and testifying in this way our fear of thy name, that thou
mayest be truly glorified in us by the same our Lord. &#8212;

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After Nebuchadnezzar has related Daniel to be a
herald of God&#8217;s approaching judgment, he now shews how God executed the
judgment which the Prophet had announced. But he speaks in the third person,
according to what we know to be a common practice with both the Hebrews and
Chaldees. Thus Daniel does not relate the exact words of the king, but only
their substance. Hence he first introduces the king as the speaker, and then he
speaks himself in his own person. There is no reason why this variety should
occasion us any trouble, since it does not obscure the sense. In the first,
verse, Nebuchadnezzar shews the dream which Daniel had explained not to have
been in vain. Thus the miracle shews itself to be from heaven, by its effects;
because dreams vanish away, as we know well enough. But since God fulfilled, at
his own time, what he had shewn to the king of Babylon by his dream, it is clear
there was nothing alarming in the dream, but a sure revelation of the future
punishment which fell upon the king. Its moderation is also expressed. Daniel
says, when a year had passed away, and the king was walking in his own palace,
and boasting in his greatness, at that moment a voice came down from heaven, and
repeated what he had already heard in the dream. He afterwards relates how he
had been expelled from human society, and dwelt for a long time among the
brutes, so as to differ from them in nothing. As to the use of words, since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;lhm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mehelek, </i>occurs here, some think that he walked upon the roof of his
palace, <i>whence </i>he could behold all parts of the city. The inhabitants of
the east are well known to use the roofs of their houses in this way; but I do
not interpret the phrase with such subtlety, since the Prophet seems to wish
nothing else than to shew how the king enjoyed his own ease, luxury, and
magnificence. There is nothing obscure in the rest of the
language.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now approach the matter before us. Some think
Nebuchadnezzar to have been touched with <i>penitence </i>when instructed by
God&#8217;s anger, and thus the time of his punishment was put off. This does
not seem to me probable, and I rather incline to a different opinion, as God
withdrew his hand till the end of the year, and thus the king&#8217;s pride was
the less excusable. The Prophet&#8217;s voice ought to have frightened him, just
as if God had thundered and lightened from heaven. He now appears to have been
always like himself. I indeed do not deny that he might be frightened by the
first message, but I leave it doubtful. <i>Whichever </i>way it is, I do not
think God spared him for a time, because he gave some signs of repentance. I
confess he sometimes indulges the reprobate, if he sees them humbled. An example
of this, sufficiently remarkable, is displayed in King Ahab.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;112129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 21:29.) He did not cordially repent, but God wished to shew how much he
was pleased with his penitence, by pardoning a king impious and obstinate in his
wickedness. The same might be said of Nebuchadnezzar, if Scripture had said so;
but as far as we can gather from these words of the Prophet, Nebuchadnezzar
became prouder and prouder, until his sloth arrived at its height. The king
continued to grow proud after God had threatened him so, and this was quite
intolerable. Hence his remarkable stupidity, since he would have been equally
careless had he lived an hundred years after he heard that threat! Finally, I
think although Nebuchadnezzar perceived some dreadful and horrible punishment to
be at hand, yet, while frightened for the time, he did not lay aside his pride
and haughtiness of mind. Meanwhile, he might think this prediction to be in
vain; and what he had heard probably escaped from his mind for a long time,
because he thought he had escaped; just as the impious usually abuse God&#8217;s
forbearance, and thus heap up for themselves a treasure of severer vengeance, as
Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:5.) Hence he derided this prophecy, and hardened himself more and more.
Whatever sense we attach to it, nothing else eau be collected from the
Prophet&#8217;s context, than the neglect of the Prophet&#8217;s warning, and
the oracle rendered nugatory by which Nebuchadnezzar had been called to
repentance. If he had possessed the smallest particle of soundness of mind, he
ought to flee to the pity of God, and to consider the ways in which he had
provoked his anger, and also to devote himself entirely to the duties of
charity. As he had exercised a severe tyranny towards all men, so he ought to
study <i>benevolence; </i>yet when the Prophet exhorted him, he did not act
thus, but uttered vain boastings, which shew his mind to have been swollen with
pride and contempt for God. As to the space of time here denoted, it shews how
God suspended his judgments, if perchance those who are utterly deplorable
should be reclaimed; but the reprobate abuse God&#8217;s humanity and
indulgence, as they make this an occasion of hardening their minds, while they
suppose God to cease from his office of judge, through his putting it off for a
time. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of twelve months, the king was
walking in his palace; he spoke, and said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This doubling of the phrase shews us how the king uttered the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feelings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of <i>premeditated </i>pride. The Prophet might have said more simply, The
king says, &#8212; but he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he spoke, and
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> I </i>know how customary it is with
both the Hebrews and Chaldees to unite these words together; but I think the
repetition emphatic in this place, since the king then uttered what he had long
ago conceived and concealed in his mind;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not this great Babylon, which
I have built for a royal palace, and that too in the mightiness of my valor; as
I have built it in the splendor of my
excellency?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words we do not see
any open blasphemy which could be very offensive to God, but we must consider
the king by this language to claim to himself supreme power, as if he were God!
We may gather this from the verse, &#8220;Is not this great Babylon? says he. He
boasts in the magnitude of his city, as if he wished to raise it giant-like to
heaven; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which
I,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he &#8212; using the pronoun
with great <i>emphasis &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I have built, and that
too in the greatness of my valor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see
that by claiming all things as his own, he robs God of all
honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before I proceed further, we must see why he asserts
Babylon to have been founded by himself. All historians agree in the account of
the city being built by Semiramis. A long time after this event, Nebuchadnezzar
proclaims his own praises in building the city. The solution is easy enough. We
know how earthly kings desire, by all means in their power, to bury<sub>
</sub>the glory of others, with the view of exalting themselves and acquiring a
perpetual reputation. Especially when they change anything in their edifices,
whether palaces or cities, they wish to seem the first founders, and so to
extinguish the memory<sub> </sub>of those by whom the foundations were really
laid. We must believe, then, Babylon to have been adorned by King
Nebuchadnezzar, and so he transfers to himself the entire glory, while the
greater part ought to be attributed to Semiramis or Ninus. Hence<i> </i>this is
the way in which tyrants speak, as all usurpers and tyrants do, when they draw
towards themselves the praises which belong to others. I, therefore, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have built it, by the strength of
my hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now it is easy to see what had
displeased God in this boasting of the king of Babylon, namely, his sacrilegious
audacity in asserting the city to have been built by his own mightiness. But God
shews this praise to be peculiar to himself and deservedly due to him. Unless
God builds the city, the watchman watches but in vain.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19C701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
127:1.) Although men labor earnestly in founding cities, yet they never profit
unless God himself preside over the work. As Nebuchadnezzar here extols himself
and opposes the strength of his fortitude to God and his grace, this boasting
was by no means to be endured. Hence it happened that God was so very angry with
him. And thus we perceive how this example proves to us what Scripture always
inculcates, &#8212; God&#8217;s resistance of the proud, his humbling their
superciliousness, and his detestation of their arrogance.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;191827&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:27.) Thus God everywhere announces himself as the enemy of the proud, and he
confirms it by the present example, as if he set before us in a mirror the
reflection of his own judgment.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:6;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:5.) This is one point. The reason also must be noticed why God declares
war on all the proud, <i>because </i>we cannot set ourselves up even a little,
without declaring war on God; for power and energy spring from him. Our life is
in his hands; we are nothing and can do nothing except through him. Whatever,
then, any one assumes to himself he detracts from God. No wonder then if God
testifies his dislike of the haughty superciliousness of men, since they
purposely weary him when they usurp anything as their own. Cities, indeed, are
truly built by the industry of men, and kings are worthy of praise who either
build cities or adorn them, so long as <i>they </i>allow God&#8217;s praise to
be inviolate. But when men exalt themselves and wish to render their own
fortitude conspicuous, they bury as far as they can the blessing of God. Hence
it is necessary for their impious rashness to be judged by God, as we have
already said. The king also confesses his vanity when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have built it for a royal
palace, and for the excellency of my splendor.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By these words he does not dissemble how
completely he looked at his own glory in all those buildings by which he hoped
to hand down his name to posterity. Hence, on the whole, he wishes to be
celebrated in the world, both during his life and after his death, so that God
may be nothing in comparison with himself, as I have already shewn how all the
proud strive to substitute themselves in the place of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now <i>follows, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While the speech was in the
mouth of the king, a voice descended from heaven &#8212; They say unto thee, O
King Nebuchadnezzar, thy kingdom has departed from
thee!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God does not now admonish the king
of Babylon by either the mouth of a Prophet or a dream by night; but he sends
forth his own voice from heaven; and as if he had not tamed down the pride by
which the king was puffed up, a voice is now heard from heaven which inspires
greater terror than either the Prop]let&#8217;s <i>oracle </i>or interpretation.
Thus God is in the habit of dealing with the hardened and impenitent, since he
causes his own prophets to denounce the penalty which hangs over them. Besides,
when he sees them untouched or unaffected, he doubles the terror, until the
final execution follows, as in. the case of this tyrant.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word was in the king&#8217;s
mouth when, the voice was heard. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We see how God
restrains in a moment the madness of those who raise themselves
<i>extravagantly. </i>But it is not surprising that the voice was so suddenly
heard, because time for repentance was allowed to King Nebuchadnezzar. In the
form of speech, <i>they say to thee, </i>it is not necessary to inquire
anxiously to whom these words apply. Some restrict them to angels; but I do not
agree to this; it seems rather to be used in the customary
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>way, they
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; meaning </i>&#8220;it is
said,&#8221; as if sanctioned by common consent. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they say to thee, O King
Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>God does not simply call
him by his name, but uses the word king &#8212; not for the sake of honor, but
of ridicule, and to strike away from the king all the allurements by which he
deceived himself. Thou indeed art intoxicated by thy present splendor, for while
all adore thee, thou art forgetful of thy frailty; but this royal majesty and
power will not hinder God from laying thee prostrate; for since thou: wilt not
humble thyself, thy kingdom shall be taken from thee! This indeed appeared
incredible, since Nebuchadnezzar had the tranquil possession of the kingdom in
his hand; no one dared to shew himself his enemy; he had subdued all his
neighbors; his monarchy was terrible to all nations; hence God pronounces,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The kingdom has gassed away from
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>And this shews the certainty of
the oracle; and thus Nebuchadnezzar may know the time to be fulfilled, and the
punishment to be no longer delayed, because he had trifled with God&#8217;s
indulgence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall expel thee from
among men, and thy habitation shall be with the beasts of the
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; or </i>of the <i>country,
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall make thee
eat grass like oxen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>Some think
Nebuchadnezzar to have been changed into a beast; but this is too harsh and
absurd. We need not fancy any change of nature; but he was cut off from all
intercourse with men, and with the exception of a human form, he did not differ
from the brutes, &#8212; nay, such was his deformity in his exile that, as we
shall afterwards see, he became a horrid spectacle; &#8212; all the hairs of his
body stood up and grew like eagles&#8217; feathers; his claws were like those of
birds. In these points he was like the beasts, in others like the rest of
mankind. It is uncertain whether God struck this king with madness, causing him
to escape and he hid for a length of time, or whether he was cast forth by a
tumult and conspiracy of nobles, or even the consent of the whole people. All
this is doubtful, since the history of those times is unknown to us. Whether,
then, Nebuchadnezzar was snatched away by madness, and while he continued a
maniac was separated from the society of men, or was cast forth as many tyrants
have been, his dwelling with beasts for a time, becomes a memorable example to
us. He was probably rendered stupid, by God&#8217;s leaving him a human form
while be deprived him of reason, as the context will make evident to us.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall cast thee out from
human society; thy dwelling shall be with wild beasts; they shall make thee eat
grass like an ox!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, when deprived
of all delight, nay, of the commonest and plainest food, thou wilt find no other
sustenance than that of oxen. Thou shalt eat the grass like an animal,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and seven times shall pass over
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Of the &#8220;seven times&#8221;
we have spoken before. Some restrict this to days, but this is contrary not only
to every reason, but to every pretext. Nor do I explain it of months; the space
of time would have been much too short. Hence the opinion of those who extend it
to seven years is more probable. If Nebuchadnezzar had been cast out by a
tumult, he would not have been so quickly recalled: then, since God wished to
make an example of him for all generations, I suppose him to have been driven
out from common society for a length of time. For if the penalty had been for
seven months only, we see how coolly God&#8217;s judgments would be received in
the world. Hence, with the view of engraving this penalty more deeply in the
hearts of all, he wished to protract it longer &#8212; I will not say to seven
years, since I have previously expounded the certain number as put for an
uncertain one, implying a long space of time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seven
years,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall pass
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until thou shalt know that there
is a lofty ruler in the kingdoms of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This is the end of the punishment, as we have previously said, for I need
not repeat my former remarks. But we must remember this &#8212; God mitigates
the bitterness of the penalty by making it temporary. Then he proposed this end
to induce Nebuchadnezzar to repent, as he required many blows for this purpose,
according to the old proverb about the fool who can never be recalled to a sound
mind without suffering calamity. Thus King Nebuchadnezzar ought to be beaten
with stripes, to render him submissive to God, as he never profited by any holy
admonition or any heavenly oracle. God does not treat; all in this way. Hence we
have here a special example of his clemency, which provides for the punishment
inflicted on King Nebuchadnezzar, being both useful and profitable. For the
reprobate are more and more hardened against God, and are ever stirred up and
excited to madness. It was an act, then, of special grace, when Nebuchadnezzar
was chastised for the time by the hand of God, to cause his repentance and his
owning God&#8217;s entire sway over the whole world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God may be Lord in the
kingdom of men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>because nothing is more
difficult than to persuade tyrants to submit to the power of God. On the one
side they confess themselves to reign by his grace; but at the same time, they
suppose their own sway to be obtained by either valor or good fortune, and to be
retained by their own guards, counsels, and wealth. Hence, as far as they can,
they shut God out from the government of the world, while they are puffed up
with a false conceit of themselves, as if all things were maintained in their
present state by their valor or advice. This, then, was an ordinary effect when
Nebuchadnezzar began to feel </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
to be the ruler in the kingdom of men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>since kings wish to place him somewhere between themselves and the
multitude. They confess the people to be subject to God&#8217;s power, but think
themselves exempt from the common order of events, and in possession of a
privilege in favor of their lusts, relieving them from the hand and empire of
God. Hence, as I have said, it was no common thing for Nebuchadnezzar to
acknowledge </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God to reign in the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for tyrants usually enclose God
in heaven, and think him content with his own happiness, and careless about
mingling in the concerns of men. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou mayest know him to be the
ruler.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He afterwards adds the kind of
dominion, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because God raises up
whomsoever he pleases, and casts down
others</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>God is not only supreme in the
sense of sustaining&#8217; all things by his universal providence, but because
no one without his will obtains empire at all. He binds some with a belt, and
looseth the bonds of others, as it is said in the book of Job.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;181218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
12:18.) We ought not, therefore, to imagine God&#8217;s power to be at rest, but
we should join it with present action, as the phrase is. Whether tyrants obtain
power, or sovereigns are pious and just, all are governed by God&#8217;s secret
counsel, since otherwise there could be no king of the world. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet concludes what he had said: As soon as
the voice had come down from heaven, Nebuchadnezzar was cast out from mankind!
Some occasion of expelling him might have preceded this; but since the
divination is uncertain, I had rather leave undetermined what the Holy Spirit
has not revealed. I only wished to touch upon this point shortly, when he
boasted in the foundation of Babylon by the fortitude of his own energy; since
his own nobles must have become disgusted when they saw him carried away with
such great pride; or he might have spoken in this way when he thought snares
were prepared for him, or when he felt some crowds moved against him. Whatever
be the meaning, God sent forth his voice, and the same moment he expelled King
Nebuchadnezzar from the company of mankind. Hence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the same
hour</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the speech was
fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If a long period had
interposed, it might have been ascribed to either fortune or other inferior
means, as a reason; but when such is the connection between the language and its
effect, the judgment is too clear to be obscured by the malignity of mankind,
tie says, therefore, <i>He</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
was cast forth and fed with herbs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>differing in nothing from oxen: <i>his
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>body was soaked in,
rain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>since he lay out in the open air.
We are ourselves often subject to the drenching shower, and in the fields are
sure to meet with it, and travelers often reach their inn wet through. But the
Prophet speaks of the continuance of God&#8217;s judgment, since he had no roof
to shelter him, and always lay out in the fields. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he was moistened by the dew of
heaven until</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says
he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> his nails became claws, and
his hair like the wings of eagles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
passage confirms what has been said concerning the explanation of the seven
times as a long period, for his hair could not have grown so in seven months,
nor could such great; deformity arise. Hence this change, thus described by the
Prophet, sufficiently shews King Nebuchadnezzar to have suffered his punishment
for a length of time, for he could not be so quickly humbled, because pride is
not easily tamed in a man of moderate station, how much less then in so great a
monarch! It afterwards follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again introduces King Nebuchadnezzar as
the speaker. He says, then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After
that time had elapsed, he raised his eyes to
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Without doubt, he means those
seven years. As to his then beginning to raise his eyes to heaven, this shews
how long it takes to cure pride, the disease under which he labored. For when
any vital part of the body is corrupt and decaying, its cure is difficult and
tedious; so also when pride exists in men&#8217;s hearts, and gains an entrance
within the marrow, and infects the inmost soul, it is not easily plucked out;
and this is worthy of notice. Then we are taught how God by his word so operated
upon King Nebuchadnezzar, as not immediately and openly to withdraw the effect
of his grace. Nebuchadnezzar profited by being&#8217; treated disgracefully
during those seven years or times, and by being driven from the society of
mankind; but he could not perceive this at once till God opened his eyes. So,
therefore, God often chastises us, and invites us by degrees, and prepares us
for repentance, but his grace is not immediately acknowledged. But lest I should
be too prolix, I will leave the rest till to-morrow.</font><br></div>

earnestly implore thy assistance, and distrusting ourselves, may rely upon thy

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
TWENTY-SECOND.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I SHALL now continue the comments which were
interrupted yesterday. From Nebuchadnezzar saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he raised his eyes to heaven, and
his intellect returned to him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, we
</i>understand him to have been for the time deprived of his mind. He is much
astonished, in my opinion, by feeling his own evils, but meanwhile he bites the
bit and is like a madman. Some think him to have been a complete maniac; I do
not contend about this; it is enough for me to know he was deprived of his
senses and was altogether like the brutes. But it is probable there was no
intelligence remaining, to cause him to feel torture at his slaughter.
Meanwhile, he did not raise his eyes to heaven until God drew him to himself.
God&#8217;s chastisements do not profit us unless they work inwardly by his
Spirit, as we said yesterday. The phrase only means, he began to think God to be
a just judge. For while at the time he felt the sting of his own disgrace, yet
as it is said elsewhere, he did not regard the hand of the striker.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:13.) He began, therefore, to acknowledge God to be the avenger of pride, after
the aforesaid time had elapsed. For those who east their eyes down to the earth
raise their eyes to heaven. As Nebuchadnezzar ought to awake from his stupor and
rise up towards God, of whom he had been formerly forgetful, so he ought to
prostrate himself to the earth, as he had already received the reward of his
haughtiness. He had dared to raise his head above the lot of man, when he
assumed to himself what was peculiar to God. He does not raise his eyes to
heaven by any vain confidence, as he had formerly been intoxicated by the
splendor of his monarchy; but he looked up to God, while mentally east down and
prostrate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I blessed him on high, and
praised and glorified him living for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This change shews the punishment to have been chiefly and purposely
inflicted on King Nebuchadnezzar, since he spoiled God of his just honor. He
here describes the fruit of his repentance. If this feeling flowed from
repentance, and Nebuchadnezzar really blessed God, it follows that he was
formerly sacrilegious, as he had deprived God of lawful honor and wished to
raise himself into his place, as we have already said. Hence, also, we must
]earn what the true praise of God really is; namely, when reduced to nothing, we
acknowledge and determine all firings to be according to his will; for, as we
shall afterwards see, he is the Governor of heaven and earth, and we should
esteem his will as the source of law and reason, and the final appeal of
justice. Per we may sometimes celebrate the praises of God with ostentation, but
it will then be mere pretense; for no one can sincerely and heartily praise him,
without ascribing to him all the properties which we shall afterwards see. First
of all, Nebuchadnezzar says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because his power is eternal, and
his kingdom from age to age.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the
first place, he here confesses God to be an eternal king; which is a great step.
For human frailty is opposed to this perpetuity; because the greatest monarchs,
who excel in power, have nothing firm; they are not only subject to chance and
change, as profane men express it &#8212; or rather depend upon the will of God
&#8212; but they utterly fade away through their vanity. We see the whole world
fluctuating like the waves of the sea. If there be any tranquillity, in one
direction or another, yet every moment something new and sudden may happen,
quite unexpectedly. As a tempest arises directly in a calm and serene sky, so
also we see it occur in human affairs. Since it is so, no condition upon earth
is firm, and monarchs especially disturb themselves by their own turbulent
agitation&#8217;s. This is, therefore, the perpetuity which is here predicted by
King Nebuchadnezzar; because God as an absolute sovereign rules his own empire
for himself, and is thus beyond all danger of change. This is the first point.

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the opposite clause is added to complete the
contrast, because though it follows that nothing is firm or solid in mankind,
yet this principle flourishes, namely, God is eternal; yet few reason thus,
because in words all allow God to be firm and everlasting, yet they do not
descend into themselves and seriously weigh their own frailty. Thus, being
unmindful of their own lot, they rage against God himself. The explanation then
which <i>occurs </i>here is required; for after Nebuchadnezzar praises God,
because his power is eternal, he adds by way of contrast,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the dwellers on the earth are
considered as nothing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>keleh, </i>for a single word, meaning &#8220;anything
<i>complete,</i>&#8221;<i>

</i>hlk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, keleh, </i>is to
&#8220;finish,&#8221;<i> </i>or &#8220;complete;&#8221;<i> </i>it also signifies
to &#8220;consume&#8221; sometimes, whence they think the noun to be derived,
because men are limited within their own standard, but God is immense. This is
harsh; the more received opinion is, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>he, </i>is put for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>a</i>, here; and thus Nebuchadnezzar says, men are esteemed as of no value
before God. Already, then, we see how suitably these two clauses agree together;
for God is an eternal king, and men are as nothing in comparison with him. For
if anything is attributed to men as springing from themselves, it so far
detracts from the supreme power and empire of God. It follows, then, that God
does not; entirely receive his rights, until all mortals are <i>reduced </i>to
nothing. For although men make themselves of very great importance, yet
<i>Nebuchadnezzar </i>here pronounces himself by the Spirit&#8217;s instinct, to
be of no value before God; for otherwise they would not attempt to raise
themselves, unless they were utterly blind in the midst of their darkness. But
when they are dragged into the light they feel their own nothingness and utter
vanity. For whatever we are, this depends on God&#8217;s grace, which sustains
us every moment, and supplies us with new vigor. Hence it is our duty to depend
upon God only; <i>because </i>as soon as he withdraws his hand and the virtue of
his Spirit, we vanish away. In God we are anything he pleases, in ourselves we
are nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God does according to his
pleasure in the army of the heavens, and among the dwellers upon
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may seem absurd, since God
is said to act according to his will, as if&#8217; there were no moderation, or
equity, or rule of justice, with him. But we must bear in mind, what we read
elsewhere concerning men being ruled by laws, since their will is perverse, and
they are borne along in any direction by their unruly lust; but God is a law to
himself, because his will is the most perfect justice. As often, then, as
Scripture sets before us the power of God, and commands us to be content with
it, it does not attribute a tyrannical empire to God, according to the calumnies
of the impious. But because we do not cease to cavil against God, and oppose our
reason to his secret counsels, and thus strive with him, as if he did not act
justly and fairly when he does anything which we disapprove; hence God
pronounces all things to be done according to his own will, so that the Holy
Spirit may restrain this audacity. We should remember then, when mention is made
of God, how impossible it is for anything either perverse or unjust to
belong&#8217; to him; his will cannot be turned aside by any affection, for it
is the perfection of justice. Since this is so, we should remember how extremely
unbridled and perverse our rashness is, while we dare object to anything which
God does; whence the necessity of this teaching which puts the bridle of modesty
upon us is proved, since God does all things according to his will, as it is
said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
115:3, Our God in heaven does what he wishes. From this sentence we gather that
nothing happens by chance, but every event in the world depends on God&#8217;s
secret providence. We ought not to admit any distinction between God&#8217;s
permission and his wish. For we see the Holy Spirit &#8212; the best master of
language &#8212; here clearly expresses two things; <i>first, </i>what God does;
and <i>next, </i>what he does by his own will. But <i>permission, </i>according
to those vain speculators, differs from <i>will; </i>as if God unwillingly
granted what he did not wish to happen! Now, there is nothing more ridiculous
than to ascribe this weakness to God. Hence the efficacy of action is added;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God does what he
wishes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says Nebuchadnezzar. He does not
speak in a carnal but in a spiritual sense, or instinct, as we have said; since
the Prophet must be attended to just as if he had <i>been </i>sent from heaven.
Now, therefore, we understand how this world is administered by God&#8217;s
secret providence, and that nothing happens but what he has commanded and
decreed; while he ought with justice to be esteemed the Author of all
things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some object here to the apparent absurdity of saying
God is the author of sin, if nothing is done without his will; nay, if he
himself works it! This calumny is easily answered, as the method of God&#8217;s
action differs materially from that of men. For when any man sins, God works in
his own manner, which is very different indeed from that of man, since he
exercises his own judgment, and thus is said to blind and to harden. As God
therefore commands both the reprobate and the evil one, he permits them to
indulge in all kinds of licentiousness, and in doing so, executes his own
judgments. But he who sins is deservedly guilty, and cannot implicate God as a
companion of his wickedness. And why so? Because God has nothing in common with
him in reference to sinfulness. Hence we see how these things which we may deem
contrary to one another, are mutually accordant, since God by his own will
governs all events in the world, and yet is not the author of sin. And why so?
Because he treats Satan and all the wicked with the strict justice of a judge.
We do not always see the process, but we must hold this principle with firmness
&#8212; supreme power is in God&#8217;s hands; hence we must not cavil at his
judgments, however inexplicable they may appear to us. Wherefore this phrase
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no one who can
hinder his hand, or can say unto him, Why dost thou act thus?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">When Nebuchadnezzar says, God&#8217;s hand
cannot be hindered, he uses this method of deriding human folly which does not
hesitate to rebel against God. Already they raise their finger to prevent, if
possible, the power of his hand; and even when convicted of weakness, they
proceed in their own fury. Nebuchadnezzar, then, deservedly displays their
ridiculous madness in conducting themselves so intemperately in wishing to
restrain the Almighty, and to confine him within their bounds, and to fabricate
chains for the purpose of restricting him. When mankind thus burst forth into
sacrilegious fury, they deserve to be laughed at, and this is here the force of
Daniel&#8217;s words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, No
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one can say, Why dost thou act
thus?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know how they gave way to the
language of extreme petulance; since scarcely one man in a hundred restrains
himself with such sobriety as to attribute the glory to God, and to confess
himself just in his works. But Nebuchadnezzar does not here consider what men
are accustomed to do, but what they ought to do. He says therefore, and with
strict justice, God cannot be corrected; since however the reprobate chatter,
their folly is self-evident, for it has neither reason nor the pretense of
reason to support it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The whole sense is &#8212; God&#8217;s will is our
law, against which we strive in vain; and then, if he permits us sufficient
license, and our infirmity breaks forth against him, and we contend with him,
all our efforts will be futile. God himself will be justified in his judgments,
and thus every human countenance must submit to him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;195106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:6.) This is the general rule.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now notice the addition,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s will must be done as
well in the army of heaven as among the inhabitants of
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By &#8220;the army of
heaven&#8221; I do not understand, as in other places, the sun, moon, and stars,
but angels and even demons, who may be called heavenly without absurdity, if we
consider their origin, and their being &#8220;<i>princes </i>of the
<i>air.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Hence Daniel means to imply angels, demons, and men,
to be equally governed by God&#8217;s will; and although the impious rush on
intemperately, yet they are restrained by a secret bridle, and are prevented
from executing whatever their lusts dictate. God therefore is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to do in the army of the heavens
and also among men whatsoever he wishes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>because he has the elect angels always obedient to him, and the devils are
compelled to obey his command, although they strive in the contrary direction.
We know how strongly the demons resist God, but yet they are compelled to obey
him, not willingly, but by compulsion. But God acts among angels and demons just
as among the inhabitants of the earth. He governs others by his Spirit, namely,
his elect, who are afterwards regenerated by his Spirit, and they are so treated
by him that his justice may truly shine forth in all their actions. He also acts
upon the reprobate, but in another manner; for he draws them headlong by means
of the devil; he impels them with his secret virtue; he strikes them by a spirit
of dizziness; he blinds them and casts upon them a reprobate spirit, and hardens
their hearts to contumacy. Behold how God does all things according to his own
will among men and angels! There is also another mode of action, as far as
concerns our outward condition; for God raises one aloft and depresses another.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
113:7.) Thus we see the rich made poor, and others raised from the dunghill, and
placed in the highest stations of honor. The profane call this the sport of
fortune! But the moderation of God&#8217;s providence is most just, although
incomprehensible. Thus God acts according to his will among men and angels; but
that interior action must be put in the first place, as we have said. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Nebuchadnezzar explains at length what he had
previously touched upon but shortly; for he had recovered his soundness of mind,
and thus commends God&#8217;s mercy in being content with a moderate and
temporary chastisement; and then he stretched forth his hand, and out of a beast
formed a man again! He was not changed into a brute, as we have said, but he was
treated with such ignominy, and made like wild beasts, and pastured with them.
This deformity, then, was so dreadful, that his restoration might be called a
kind of new creation. Hence with very good reason Nebuchadnezzar celebrates this
grace of God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At that

singular grace, because he had returned to a sound mind. And at the same time he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he had returned to the

&#8212; and desired among them the king who had been cast out. We do not say
this was done by them on purpose, because God made use of them, and they were
ignorantly carrying out his purposes. They had heard the voice from heaven,

<div><font face="Palatino">At the close of the edict, Nebuchadnezzar joins the
ingenuous confession of his faults with the praises of God! What he says of the
proud, he doubtless applies properly to himself; as if he had said, God wished
to constitute me a remarkable monument of his method of humbling the proud for
the instruction of all mankind. For I was inflated with pride, and God corrected
this by so remarkable a punishment, that my example ought to profit the world at
large. Hence I said, King Nebuchadnezzar does not simply return thanks to God,
but at the same time confesses his fault, for though subdued with deserved
harshness, yet his haughtiness could not be arrested by any lighter remedy.
First of all he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I praise,
extol, and glorify the king of heaven!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This heaping together of words doubtless proceeded from vehement affection.
At the same time a contrast must be understood, on the principle formerly
mentioned; since God is never rightly praised unless the ignominy of men is
detected; he is not properly extolled, unless their loftiness is cast down; he
is never glorified unless men are buried in shame and he prostrate in the dust.
Hence, while Nebuchadnezzar here praises, extols, and glorifies God, he also
confesses himself and all mortals to be nothing &#8212; as he did before &#8212;
to deserve no praise but rather the utmost ignominy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>since all his works are
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fw&ccedil;q</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tmaAynyd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>dini-ameth, </i>mean true judgments, but refer here to equity.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> are </i>therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, all integrity, as if he
had said, none of God&#8217;s works deserve blame. Then the explanation Follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All his ,ways are
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see here the praise of
God&#8217;s perfect justice; this ought to be referred to Nebuchadnezzar
personally, as if he had said, God does not deal with me too strictly; I have no
reason for expostulating with him, or for murmuring as if he were too severe
with me. I confess, therefore, that I deserve whatever punishment I sustain. And
why so? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All his ways are
justice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>meaning the highest rectitude.
Then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All his works are
truth;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, nothing contrary to
equity is found there, nothing crooked, but everywhere the highest justice will
shine forth. We see then how Nebuchadnezzar by this language condemns himself
out of his own mouth by declaring God&#8217;s justice to be in all his works.
This general form of expression does not prevent Nebuchadnezzar from openly and
freely confessing himself a criminal before God&#8217;s tribunal; but it
acquires greater force by his example, which admonishes us by the general
confession of God&#8217;s justice, rectitude, and truthfulness in whatever he
does. And this is worthy of notice, since many find no difficulty in celebrating
God&#8217;s justice and rectitude when they <i>are </i>treated just as they
<i>like; </i>but if God begins to treat them with severity, they then vomit
forth their poison, and begin to quarrel with God, and to accuse him of
injustice and cruelty. Since therefore Nebuchadnezzar here confesses God to be
just and true in all his works, without any exception, notwithstanding his own
severe chastisements, this confession is not feigned; for he necessarily utters
what he says from the lowest depths of his heart, through his having experienced
the rigor of the divine judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds at last,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He can humble those who walk in
pride.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here Nebuchadnezzar more openly
displays his own disgrace, for he is not ashamed to confess his fault before the
whole world, because his punishment was known to every one. As God then wished
his folly to be universally detested, by making so horrible an example of him by
his punishment, so Nebuchadnezzar now brings his own case forward, and bears
witness to the justice of the penalty, in consequence of his extreme pride. Here
then we see God&#8217;s power joined with his justice, as we have previously
mentioned. He does not attribute to God a tyranny free from all law; for as soon
as ]Nebuchadnezzar had confessed all God&#8217;s ways to be just, he condemns
himself of pride directly afterwards. Hence he does not hesitate to expose his
disgrace before mankind, that God may be glorified. And this is the true method
of praising God, not only by confessing ourselves to be as nothing, but also by
looking back upon our failings. We ought not only to acknowledge ourselves
inwardly guilty before him, but also openly to testify the same before all
mankind whenever it is necessary. And when he uses the word
&#8220;humility,&#8221; this may be referred to outward dejection; for
Nebuchadnezzar was humbled when God east him out into the woods to pass his life
in company with the wild beasts. But he was also humbled for another reason, as
if he had been a son of God. Since this humbling is twofold, Nebuchadnezzar
wishes here to express the former kind, because God prostrates and throws down
the proud. This is one kind of humiliation; but it becomes profitless unless God
afterwards governs us by a spirit of submission. Hence Nebuchadnezzar does not
here embrace the grace of God, which was worthy of no common praise and
exaltation; and in this edict he does not describe what is required of a pious
man long trained in God&#8217;s school; yet he shews how he<b> </b>had profited
under God&#8217;s rod, by attributing to him the height of power. Besides this,
he adds the praise of justice and rectitude, while he confesses himself guilty,
and bears witness to the justice of the punishment which had been divinely
inflicted on him.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">DANIEL here refers to the history of what happened at
the taking of Babylon; but meanwhile he leaves those judgments of God to the
consideration of his readers, which the Prophets had predicted before the people
had become exiles. He does not use the prophetic style, as we shall afterwards
see, but is content with simple narrative; while the practice of history may be
learnt from the following expressions. It is our duty now to consider how this
history tends towards building us up in the faith and fear of God. First of all
we notice the time at which Belshazzar celebrated this banquet. Seventy years
had passed away from the time when Daniel had been led into exile with his
companions. For although Nebuchadnezzar will soon be called the father of
Belshazzar, yet it is clear enough that Evil-Merodach lived between them; for he
reigned twenty-three years. Some. reckon two kings before Belshazzar; for they
place Regassar after Labassardach; and these two will occupy eight years.
Metasthenes has stated it so, and he has many followers. But Nebuchadnezzar the
Great, who took Daniel captive, and was the son of the first king of that name,
evidently reigned forty-five years. Some transfer two years to the reign of his
father; at any rate, he held the regal power for forty-five years; and if the
twenty-three years of Evil-Merodach are added, they will make sixty-eight years
&#8212; in which Belshazzar had reigned eight years. We see, then, how
seventy-two years had passed away from the period of Daniel being first led
captive. Metasthenes reckons thirty years for the reign of Evil-Merodach; and
then, if we add eight years, this makes more than eighty years &#8212; which
appears probable enough, although Metasthenes seems to be in error in supposing
different kings instead of only different names. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f242</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">For Herodotus does not call Belshazzar, of
whom we are now speaking, a king, but calls his father Labynetus, and gives him
the same name. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Metasthenes makes some mistakes in names, but I readily embrace his computation
of time, when he asserts Evil-Merodach to have reigned thirty years. For when we
treat of the seventy years which Jeremiah had formerly pointed out, we ought not
to begin with Daniel&#8217;s exile, no,&#8217; yet with the destruction of the
city, but with the slaughter which occurred between the first victory of king
Nebuchadnezzar, and the burning and ruin of the temple and city. For when the
report concerning the death of his father was first spread abroad, as we have
elsewhere said, he returned to his own country, lest any disturbance should
occur through his absence. Hence we shall find the seventy years during which
God wished the people&#8217;s captivity to last, will require a longer period
for the reign of Evil-Merodach than twenty-three years; although there is not
any important difference, for soon after Nebuchadnezzar returned, he carried off
the king, leaving the city untouched. Although the temple was then standing, yet
God had inflicted the severest punishment upon the people, which was like a
final slaughter, or at least nearly equal to it. However this was, we see that
Belshazzar was celebrating this banquet just as the time of the deliver-ante
drew nigh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we must consider the Providence of God, in
arranging the times of events, so that the impious, when the time of their
destruction is come, cast themselves headlong of their own accord. This occurred
to this wicked king. Wonderful indeed was the stupidity which prepared a
splendid banquet filled with delicacies, while the city was besieged. For Cyrus
had begun to besiege the city for a long time with a large army. The wretched
king was already half a captive; and yet, as if in spite of God, he provided a
rich banquet, and invited a thousand guests. Hence we may conjecture the extent
of the noise and of the expense in that banquet. For if any one wishes to
entertain only ten or twenty guests, it will occasion him much trouble, if he
wishes to treat them splendidly. But when it was a royal entertainment, where
there were a thousand nobles with the king&#8217;s wife and concubines, and so
great a multitude assembled together, it became necessary to obtain from many
quarters what was required for such a festival; and this may seem incredible!
But Xenophon though he related many fables and preserved neither the gravity nor
the fidelity of a historian, because he desired to celebrate the praises of
Cyrus like a rhetorician; although he trifles in many things, yet here had no
reason or occasion for deception. He says a treasure was laid up, so that the
Babylonians could endure a siege of even ten or more years. And Babylon was
deservedly compared to a kingdom; for its magnitude was so large as to surpass
belief. It must really have been very populous, but since they drew their
provisions from the whole of Asia, it is not surprising that the Babylonians had
food in store, sufficient to allow them to close their gates, and to sustain
them for a long period. But in this banquet it was most singular that the king,
who ought to have been on guard, or at least have sent forth his guards to
prevent the city from being taken, was as intent upon his delicacies as if he
had been in perfect peace, and exposed to no danger from any outward enemy. He
had a contest with a strong man, if any man ever was so. Cyrus was endued with
singular prudence, and in swiftness of action by far excelled all others. Since,
then, the king was so keenly opposed, it is surprising to find him so careless
as to celebrate a banquet. Xenophon, indeed, states the day to have been a
festival. The assertion of those Jews who think the Chaldeans had just obtained
a victory over the Persians, is but trifling. For Xenophon &#8212; who may be
trusted whenever he does not falsify history in favor of Cyrus, because he is
then a very grave historian, and entirely worthy of credit; but when he desires
to praise Cyrus, he has no moderation &#8212; is here historically correct, when
he says the Babylonians were holding a usual annual festival. He tells us also
how Babylon was taken, viz., by Gobryas and Gadatas his generals. For Belshazzar
had castrated one of these to his shame, and had slain the son of the other in
the lifetime of his father. Since then the latter burnt with the desire of
avenging his son&#8217;s death, and the former his own disgrace, they conspired
against him. Hence Cyrus turned the many channels of the Euphrates, and thus
Babylon was suddenly taken. The city we must remember was twice taken, otherwise
there would not have been any confidence in prophecy; because when the Prophets
threaten God&#8217;s vengeance upon the Babylonians, they say their enemies
should be most fierce, not seeking gold or silver, but desiring human blood; and
then they narrate every kind of atrocious deed which is customary in war.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:42.) But nothing of this kind happened when Babylon was taken by Cyrus; but
when the Babylonians freed themselves from the Persian sway by casting off their
yoke, Darius recovered the city by the assistance of Zopyrus, who mutilated his
person, and pretended to have suffered such cruelty from the king as to induce
him to betray the city. But then we collect how hardly the Babylonians were
afflicted, when 3000 nobles were crucified!<i> </i>And what usually happens when
8000 nobles are put to death, and all suspended on a gallows &#8212; nay, even
crucified? Thus it easily appears, how severely the Babylonians were punished at
the time, although they were then subject to a foreign power, and treated
shamefully by the Persians, and reduced to the condition of slaves. For they
were forbidden the use of arms, and were taught from the first to become the
slaves of Cyrus, and dare not wear a sword. We ought to touch upon these things
shortly to assure us of the government of human events by the judgment of God,
when he casts headlong the reprobate when their punishment is at hand. We have
an illustrious example of this in King Belshazzar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The time of the deliverance predicted by Jeremiah was
at hand &#8212; the seventy years were finished &#8212; Babylon was besieged.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:11.) The Jews might now raise up their heads and hope for the best, because
the arrival of Cyrus approached, contrary to the opinion of them all; for he had
suddenly rushed down from the mountains of Persia when that was a barbarous
nation. Since, therefore, the sudden coming of Cyrus was like a whirlwind, this
change might possibly give some hope to the Jews; but after a length of time, so
to speak, had elapsed in the siege of the city, this might east down their
spirits. While king Belshazzar was banqueting with his nobles, Cyrus seems able
to thrust him out in the midst of his merriment and hilarity. Meanwhile the Lord
did not sit at rest in heaven; for he blinds the mind of the impious king, so
that he should willingly incur punishments, yet no one drew him on, for he
incurred it himself. And whence could this arise, unless God had given him up to
his enemy? It was according to that decree of which Jeremiah was the herald.
Hence, although Daniel narrates the history, it is our duty, as I have said, to
treat of things far more important; for God who had promised his people
deliverance, was now stretching forth his hand in secret, and fulfilling the
predictions of his Prophets.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242526&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:26.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>King Belshazzar was drinking
wine before a thousand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some of the
Rabbis say, &#8220;he strove with his thousand nobles, and contended with them
all in drinking to excess;&#8221; but this seems grossly ridiculous. When he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he drank wine before a
thousand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he alludes to the custom of
the nation, for the kings of the Chaldeans very rarely invited guests to their
table; they usually dined alone, as the kings of Europe now do; for they think
it adds to their dignity to enjoy a solitary meal. The pride of the kings of
Chaldea was of this kind. When, therefore, it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Belshazzar drank wine before a
thousand,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>something extraordinary is
intended, since he was celebrating this annum banquet contrary to his ordinary
custom, and he deigned to treat his nobles with such honor as to receive them as
his guests. Some, indeed, conjecture that he drank wine ordeals, as he was
accustomed to become intoxicated when there were no witnesses present; but there
is no force in this comment: the word <i>before </i>means in the presence or
society of others. Let us go on:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here king Belshazzar courts his own punishment,
because he furiously stirred up God&#8217;s wrath against himself, as if he was
dissatisfied with its delay while God put off his judgment for so long a period.
This is according to what I have said. When the destruction of a house is at
hand, the impious remove the posts and gates, as Solomon says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
17:19.) God therefore, when he wishes to execute his judgments, impels the
reprobrate by a secret instinct to rush forward of their own accord, and to
hasten their own destruction. Belshazzar did this. His carelessness was the sign
of his stupidity, and also of God&#8217;s wrath, when in the midst of his own
pride and crimes he could delight in reveling. Thus his blindness more clearly
points out God&#8217;s vengeance, since he was not content with his own
intemperance and excesses, but must openly declare war against God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He ordered, therefore, says he,
the gold and silver vessels to be brought to him which he had taken away from
Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These vessels appear to
have been laid up in the treasury; hence Nebuchadnezzar had never abused these
vessels in his lifetime; we do not read that Evil-Merodach did anything of this
kind, and Belshazzar now wishes purposely to inflict this insult on God. There
is no doubt he brought forth those vessels by way of ridicule, for the purpose
of triumphing over the true God, as we shall afterwards see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have already explained the sense in which the
Prophet calls Nebuchadnezzar the father of Belshazzar, since it is usual in all
languages to speak of ancestors as fathers; for Belshazzar was of the offspring
of Nebuchadnezzar, and being really his grandson, he is naturally called his
son; and this will occur again. There are some who think Evil-Merodach was
stricken with that grievous affliction mentioned in the last chapter: possibly
his name was Nebuchadnezzar, but there is no reason for adopting their opinion; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f247</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is frivolous to fly directly to this conjecture when the name of the father
occurs. the Prophet says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Belshazzar committed this under
the influence of wine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[f</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tegnem, </i>signifies &#8220;to taste,&#8221; no doubt he here speaks of
tasting; and since this may be metaphorically transferred to the understanding,
some explain it to mean being impelled by wine, and thus his drunkenness took
the place of reason and judgment. Nights and love and wine, says Ovid, have no
moderation in them. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f248</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This explanation I think too forced; it seems simply to mean, when Belshazzar
grew warm with wine, he commanded the vessels to be brought to him; and this is
the more usual view. When, therefore, the savor of the wine prevailed, &#8212;
that is, when it seized upon the king&#8217;s senses,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then he ordered the vessels to be
brought</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is worth while to notice
this, to induce us to be cautious concerning intemperance in drinking, because
nothing is more common than the undertaking many things far too rashly when our
senses are under the influence of wine. Hence we must use wine soberly, that it
may invigorate not only the body but the mind and the senses, and may never
weaken, or enervate, or stupify our bodily or mental powers. And this is, alas!
too common, since the vulgar proverb is well known &#8212; pride springs from
drunkenness. For this reason the poets supposed Bacchus to have horns, since
intemperate men are always puffed up, and the most wretched fancy themselves
kings. What then must happen to monarchs, when in their forgetfulness they dream
themselves kings of kings, and even deities? The Prophet wishes to mark this
fault when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Belshazzar,
under the influence of wine, ordered vessels to be brought to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet shews more distinctly and clearly
how the king insulted the true and only God, by ordering his vessels to be
brought to him. For when they had been brought forth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
praised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all their gods of gold and
silver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>meaning in defiance of the true
God they celebrated the praises of their false deities, and thanked them, as we
find in Habakkuk.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;350116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
1:16.) Although there is no doubt they sacrificed heartily the produce of their
industry, as the Prophet there expresses it, yet they exalted their own gods,
and thus obliterated the glory of the true God. And this is the reason why the
Prophet now takes pains to state those vessels to have been brought from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the temple of God</i>&#8217;<i>s
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For he here strengthens the
impiety of the king and his nobles for erecting their horns against the God of
Israel. There is then a great contrast, between God who commanded his temple to
be built at Jerusalem, and sacrifices to be offered to him and false gods. And
this was the head and front of Belshazzar&#8217;s offending, because he thus
purposely rose up against God, and not only tyrannically and miserably oppressed
the Jews, but triumphed over their God &#8212; the Creator of heaven and earth.
This madness accelerated his ultimate destruction, and it occurred for the
purpose of hastening the time of their deliverance. Hence I have represented him
to have been drawn by God&#8217;s great instinct to such madness that vengeance
might be ripened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
drank</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wine, and praised their
gods.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The<i> </i>Prophet does not ascribe the
praise of their gods to drunkenness, but he obliquely shews their petulance to
have been increased by drink. For if each had been sober at home, he would not
have thus rashly risen up against God; but when impiety exists in the heart,
intemperance becomes an additional stimulus. The Prophet seems to me to mean
this, when he repeats, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were
drinking;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he had said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king and his nobles, his
wife, and concubines, were drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
now inculcates the same thing in similar words, but adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they drank
wine,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; meaning<i> </i>their madness was
the more inflamed by the excitement of the wine.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then they praised the gods of
silver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The Prophet here
reproachfully mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gods of
gold, silver, brass, wood, and stone</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>since we know God to have nothing in common with either gold or silver. His
true image cannot be expressed in corruptible materials; and this is, the reason
why the Prophet calls all the gods which the Babylonians worshipped,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>golden, silver, brazen, wooden,
and stone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Clearly enough the heathen
never were so foolish as to suppose the essence of Deity to reside in gold, or
silver, or stone; they only called them images of their deities; but because in
their opinion the power and majesty of the deity was included within the
material substance, the Prophet is right in so completely condemning their
criminality, because we hear how carefully idolaters invent every kind of
subtlety. In the present times, the Papacy is a glaring proof how men cling to
gross superstitions when they desire to excuse their errors; hence the Prophet
does not here admit those vain pretenses by which the Babylonians and other
heathens disguise their baseness, but he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their gods were of silver and
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And why so? for although they
orally confessed that gods reign in heaven, (so great was the multitude and
crowd of their deities that the supreme God was quite shrouded in darkness,)
although therefore the Babylonians confessed their gods to have dwelt in heaven,
yet they fled to statues and pictures. Hence the Prophet deservedly chides them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for adoring gods of gold and
silver.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As to his saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then the vessels were
brought</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it shews how the slaves of
tyrants obey them in the worst actions, because no delay intervened in bringing
the vessels from the treasury. Daniel therefore signifies how all the
king&#8217;s servants were obedient to his nod, and desirous of pleasing a
person brutish and drunken; at the same time he shews the shortness of that
intemperate intoxication; for he says, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel begins his narration of the change which
took place, for at that instant the king&#8217; acknowledged something sorrowful
and disturbing to be at hand. Yet, as he did not at once understand what it was,
God gave him a sign as an omen of calamity, according to the language of the
profane. In this way God sent him warning when he saw the king and his nobles
raging with mad licentiousness.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There
appeared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says the Prophet, using this
expression from its similitude and form. We are sure it was not a man&#8217;s
hand; it had the appearance of one, and hence was called so. Scripture often
uses this method of expression, especially when treating external symbols. This
is, then, a sacramental form of speech, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f253</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">if I may use the expression. God, indeed,
wrote the inscription by his own power, but he shews King Belshazzar the figure
as if a man had written it on the wall; hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fingers of a hand were put
forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression conduces in no
slight degree to the reality of the miracle; for if Belshazzar had seen this on
the wall from the very first, he might have supposed some artifice had placed
the hand there; but when the wall was previously bare, and then the hand
suddenly appeared, we may readily understand the hand to have been a sign from
heaven, through which God wished to shew something&#8217; important to the king.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fingers of a
hand,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were put forth, and wrote from
the midst of the candlestick,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or lamp.
Clearly, then, this was a feast by night, and Babylon was taken in the midst of
the night. No wonder their banquets were protracted to a great length, for
intemperance has no bounds. When men are accustomed to spend the day in luxury,
I confess indeed they do not usually continue their banquets till midnight; but
when they celebrate any splendid and remarkable feast, they do not find the
daylight sufficient for their festivites and the grosser indulgences of the
table.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand appeared from the
candlesticks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to render it the more
conspicuous. That hand, says the Prophet, wrote on the surface of the palace
wall. If any one had announced to the king this appearance of a human hand, he
might have doubted it; but he says the king was an eye-witness, for God wished
to terrify him, as we shall afterwards see, and hence he set before him this
spectacle. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perceived
it;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>perhaps his nobles did not; and we
shall afterwards see how the terror operated upon the king alone, unless,
indeed, some others trembled with him. When, therefore, they saw his countenance
changed and exhibiting proofs of terror, they began to fear, although they were
all desirous of affording him some consolation. Hence God wished to summon this
impious king to His tribunal when the hand of a man appeared before him in the
act of writing. We shall see what it wrote in its proper place.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel shews how the king&#8217;s mind was
struck with fear, lest any one should think his fright without foundation. But
he expresses, by many <i>circumstances, </i>how disturbed the king was, and thus
the sufficiency of the reason would easily appear. It was needful for him to be
so struck, that all might understand how God was seated on his throne, and
summoned him as a criminal. We mentioned before how Daniel impresses us with the
pride of this king, and his careless security is a clear proof of it. When the
daily siege of the city ought to have rendered him anxious, he was celebrating
his usual banquets, as if in profound peace. Whence he appears to be corrupted
by a kind of spiritual drunkenness, so as not to feel his own calamities. This,
then, is the reason why God roused him up and awakened him from his lethargy,
because no ordinary means were effectual in recalling him to soundness of mind.
The fear which he experienced might seem a convenient preparation for penitence.
But we see the same thing in this case as we do in that of Esau; for he was not
only touched with contrition when he saw himself cut off, but he uttered a loud
and piercing&#8217; lamentation when seeking his father&#8217;s
&#8220;blessing,&#8221; and yet he was too late.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
27:24.) A similar occurrence is related here of King Belshazzar, but we must
remark upon everything in order. Daniel says.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king&#8217;s countenance was
changed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the joints of his limbs were
loosened, and he was disturbed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or
frightened, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
thoughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and lastly, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his knees smote
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word properly signifies,
to strike one against another. By these signs the Prophet shews how King
Belshazzar was frightened by the vision already mentioned. Without doubt, as I
have just said, God inspired him with this terror, for we know even when God has
openly ascended to his own tribunal, how stupid the reprobate remain, and how
immovable! But God wished to affect the mind of this impious king, and to render
his ignorance without excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we may remark, generally, in how many ways God
touches men&#8217;s hearts &#8212; not those of the reprobate only, but also of
his elect, for we see even the best men slow and slothful when God summons them
to his judgment-seat. It becomes necessary to chastise them with rods, otherwise
they never approach God of their own accord. He might, indeed, move their minds
without violence; but he wishes to set before us, as in a glass, our slowness
and slothfulness, since we do not obey his word with natural willingness. Hence
he tames his children with cords when they will not profit by his word. With
regard to the reprobate, he often chides their obstinacy, because, before he
undertakes the office of judge, he kindly entices them; when they do not profit
by this, he threatens; and when his threats are useless and devoid of efficacy,
he then calls them to his tribunal. Respecting the fate of the King of Babylon,
God had suffered Daniel to be silent, for his ingratitude and pride had closed
the door, so as to prevent Daniel from undertaking the office of a teacher as he
was prepared to do; hence the King of Babylon continued without one. But God
suddenly appeared as a judge, by the writing of which we have shortly spoken,
and of which we shall say more in the proper place. Whatever its meaning may be:
we see King Belshazzar not only admonished by an outward sign of his approaching
death, but inwardly stirred up to acknowledge himself to be dealing with God.
For the reprobate often enjoy their own pleasures, as I have said, although God
shews himself to be their judge. But he treats King Belshazzar differently: he
desires to inspire him with terror, to render him more attentive to the perusal
of the writing. This time was, as I have said, a preparation for repentance; but
he failed in the midst of his course, as we see too many do who tremble at the
voice of God and at the signs of his vengeance, as soon as he admonishes them;
but these feelings are but evanescent; thus proving how little they have learnt
of the necessary lesson.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The example of Esau is similar to this, since he
despised God&#8217;s grace when he heard himself deprived of the inheritance
divinely promised him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012533&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
25:33.) He treated the blessing as a fable, till he found it a serious matter;
he then began to lament, but all in vain. Such also was the fright of King
Belshazzar, as we shall soon perceive. Even when Daniel explained the writing to
him, he was by no means moved by it, but adorned Daniel with royal tokens of
regard. Yet the object and use of this was totally different, for when the
nobles were moved, and the reality became manifest, God in this way demonstrated
his glory: and Darius, who took the city, with his son-in-law Cyrus, understood
how his own valor and perseverance were not the sole cause of his victory, and
how the satraps, Gobryas and Gadata, would not have assisted him so materially
unless the whole affair had been under God&#8217;s auspices. Thus God shewed
himself as in a glass to be the avenger of his people, as he had promised
seventy years previously. It now follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet narrates how King Belshazzar sought a
remedy for his anxiety; hence we gather how his mind was so immediately wounded,
and how he felt he could not escape God&#8217;s hand, otherwise he would not
have called the wise men so suddenly in the midst of the banquet. Again, when
the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He cried out
loudly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he was clearly so astonished as
to forget his being king, for to cry out at table was not consistent with his
dignity. But God expelled all pride from him, by compelling him to burst forth
into a cry, like a man completely beside himself. We must now consider the
remedy to which he resorted: he ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Chaldeans, and magi, and
astrologers to be called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We learn from
this how exceedingly prone men are to vanity, lying, and falsehood. Daniel ought
to have been first, even among the Chaldeans, for that was an answer worthy of
remembrance which he had given to the grandfather of this king, when he
predicted his becoming like the beasts of the forest. Since this prophecy was
verified by the event, his authority ought to have flourished even to a thousand
years. He was daily in the king&#8217;s sight, and yet he was neglected, while
the king sent for all the Chaldeans, and astrologers, and diviners, and magi.
Truly enough, these men were then in so great repute that they deservedly
obscured the fame of Daniel, for they were indignant at a captive being
preferred to native teachers, when they knew their own glory amongst all peoples
depended upon the persuasion of their being the only wise men. As, therefore,
they wished to retain their good opinion, as being God&#8217;s counselors, no
wonder they despised this stranger. But this feeling cannot avail for a moment
before God: for what can be urged in defense of the king&#8217;s impiety? His
grandfather was a memorable instance of God&#8217;s vengeance, when rejected
from the company of men, and compelled to dwell among the wildest beasts of the
forest. This, truly, could not appear a matter of chance. God, then, had first
admonished him by a dream, and next sent his own Prophet as the interpreter of
the oracle and the vision. As I have said, the fame of this event ought to have
been perpetual among the Chaldeans, yet the grandson of King Nebuchadnezzar had
forgotten his example, insulted the God of Israel, profaned the vessels of the
temple, and triumphed with his idols! When God sets before him the sign of his
judgment, he calls together the magi and the Chaldeans, and passes by Daniel.
And what possible excuse can he have for this?. We have seen, as I have said,
how very prone men are to be deluded by Satan&#8217;s impostures, and the
well-known proverb becomes true, &#8212; The world loves to be
deceived!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, also, is worthy of notice, because in the
present day, and in troublous times, many protect themselves behind the shield
of their ignorance. But the explanation is at hand &#8212; they are willingly
blind; they shut their eyes amidst the clearest light; for if God considered
King Belshazzar without excuse when the Prophet. was once <i>presented to
</i>him, what excuse can the &#8216;blind of these days allege? Oh! if I could
determine what God&#8217;s will is for me, I would submit myself instantly to
it, because God daily and openly calls to us and invites us, and shews us the
way; but none answer him, none follow him, or at least how very few! Hence we
must diligently consider the example of the King of Babylon when we see him full
of anxiety, and yet not seeking God as he ought. And why so? He wanders about in
great hesitation; he sees himself constrained, and yet he cannot fly from the
judgment of God, but seeks consolation in magi, Chaldeans, and other impostors;
for, as we have seen, they had been once or twice proved so, and this ought to
have been sufficiently celebrated and notorious to all men. We see, then, how
blind King Belshazzar was, since he closed his eyes to the light offered him. So
in the present day almost all the world continues in blindness; it is not
allowed to wander in darkness, but when light shines upon it, it closes its
eyes, rejects God&#8217;s grace, and purposely desires to cast itself headlong.
This conduct is far too common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet <i>says, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king promised the wise
men a present of a chain of gold to whoever read the
writing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and besides
this</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, raiment of purple, and the
third rank in the kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>This shews
him not to have been sincerely touched by the fear of God. And this repugnance
is worthy of observation in the wicked, who dread God&#8217;s judgments, and yet
the pride of their hearts is not corrected and subdued, as we saw in the case of
this king. For </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his knees smote
one against the other, and the joints of his loins were
loosened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he trembles throughout his
entire frame, and becomes half dead with fear, because God&#8217;s terror seizes
on all his senses. Meanwhile, we see a hidden pride lurking in his mind, which
breaks forth in the promise,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whoever shall interpret the
writing, shall be the third in rank in the
kingdom!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God had already deprived him of
his royal dignity; yet he still wishes to raise others on high in defiance of
God! What, then, is the meaning of this? We see how often the wicked are
terrified, and how deeply they cherish a hidden contumacy, so that God never
subdues them. They shew, indeed, many signs of repentance; but if any one
carefully weighs all their words and deeds, he will find the Prophet&#8217;s
narration concerning King Belshazzar completely verified, because they rage
against God, and are never teachable or obedient, but utterly stupefied. We saw
this partly in former verse, and shall see it again more clearly at the end of
the chapter. As to the latter clause of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall rule as third in the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is uncertain whether he
promises the third portion or the third rank; for many think the queen, of whom
mention will soon be made, was the wife of King Nebuchadnezzar, and grandmother
of King Belshazzar. It follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel relates how deceived the king was in his
opinion, in hoping for any interpretation of the writing from either the magi or
the astrologers, the Chaldeans or the soothsayers; for none of them could read
it. Hence he pays here the punishment of his ingratitude in passing over
God&#8217;s Prophet, while he knew he had predicted truth to his grandfather
just as it. had happened, as well as Daniel&#8217;s general excellence in
wisdom, Hence the proofs of his calling were sufficiently numerous and
trustworthy. Since, then, he had so despised God&#8217;s unparalleled benefit,
he is destitute of counsel:, and sees himself call in vain upon all the
Chaldeans and astrologers. For Daniel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was no one who could read
the writing or reveal its interpretation to the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because this seems absurd, many
Rabbis have hazarded various conjectures. Some think the letters were
transposed; others guess that they were changed into their counterparts and
equivalents; and others think the char-actors were changed. But we have
elsewhere shewn how bold the Jews are in their conjectures, whenever they have
no certain guide. We do not require their guesses, because, very probably, the
writing was visible to the king and concealed from all the Chaldeans, or else
they were so blind that they could see nothing; just as God denounced against
the Jews a stupor of this kind. We see what he pronounces, by Isaiah, (Isaiah
29: 11,) &#8220;Your law shall be like a. sealed book: If it shall be said to
any one, &#8216;Read it,&#8217; he shall say, &#8216;The book is sealed, I
cannot:&#8217; or the book may be opened and ye shall all become blind: even
those who seem to be sharper than all others, shall say they are ignorant and
unlettered men.&#8221; Whatever God threatened against the Jews we know was
fulfilled, and is fulfilled to this day, since a veil is put before their eyes,
as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:14.) Hence they were blind in the midst of the brightest light.
What wonder then if the same thing happened to the Chaldeans, so flint they
could not read the writing? There is no necessity to conjecture any
transposition of letters, or any inversion of their, order, or any change of one
into another; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lqt</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
tekel, </i>went first, and afterwards
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">anm</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">anm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
Mena, Mena. </i>These guesses then are frivolous; and thus much is certain, God
wished the king to be made aware of his approaching destruction; next, his soul
was moved, not with repentance, but only enough to render his sloth without
excuse; and hence, whether willingly or not, he was compelled to send for some
remedy, since he knew himself to be dealing with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, with regard to the writing itself, God could not
be a free agent unless he possessed the power of addressing one man at one time,
and a number of men at another. He wished King Belshazzar to be conscious of
this writing, while the magi were all as unable to read it as if they were
blind. And then, with reference to the interpretation, their perplexity need not
surprise us. For God spoke enigmatically, when he said MENE, MENE, and then
TEKEL, that is <i>weighed, </i>and PERES, <i>divided. </i>If the magi could have
read these words a hundred times over, they could never either <i>conjecture
</i>or comprehend their true meaning. The prophecy was allegorical, until an
interpreter was divinely ordained for it. So far as the mere letters are
concerned, there is no reason why we should be surprised at the eyes of the magi
being blinded, since God pleased it to be so, and wished to <i>cite </i>the king
to his tribunal, as we have already said. The Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king was frightened, his
countenance was changed, and the princes also were
disturbed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The publicity of the event
ought to have increased the sense of God&#8217;s judgment, for, as we shall
afterwards see, King Belshazzar himself was slain that very<i> </i>night. Cyrus
entered while the Babylonians were feasting, and enjoying their luxuries in
security. So remarkable an example of God&#8217;s justice might have been
instantly buried in that drunken revel, had it not been rendered conspicuous to
many bystanders. Hence Daniel repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king was disturbed,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">after he saw no prospect of either aid or
advice from his magi and astrologers. He says also,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his princes were astonished,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">because not only the king ought to be troubled
but the whole Court, and the report ought to flow forth not only through the
city, but to foreign nations, since there is no doubt that Cyrus was afterwards
informed of this prophecy; for he would not have courted Daniel so much, nor
honored him so remarkably, unless this <i>occurrence </i>had been made known to
him. It afterwards follows:</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel relates the occasion of his being brought
before the king, as the reader and interpreter of the writing. The queen, he
says, did this. It is doubtful whether it was the wife of King Belshazzar, or
his grandmother. She was probably an old woman, as she refers to events in the
time of King Nebuchadnezzar This conjecture has no sufficient foundation, and
hence it is better to suspend our judgment than to assert anything rashly;
unless, as we before saw, his wife was at table with him. As far as we can
gather the words of the Prophet with certainty, we must diligently notice them,
and thus convict the king of ingratitude, because he did not admit Daniel among
the magi, Chaldeans, and astrologers. The holy man had no wish to be reckoned in
that company; he would have deserved to lose God&#8217;s prophetic spirit had he
thus mingled with impostors; and he is clearly to be distinguished from them.
King Nebuchadnezzar had set him over all the magi; he had no wish to exercise
this honor, unless, as I have just said, he would deprive himself of the
singular gift of prophecy; for we must always take care how far we can go. We
know how very prone we are to be enticed by the blandishments of the world,
<i>especially </i>when ambition blinds us and disturbs all our senses. No plague
is worse than this, because when any one sees a prospect of the acquisition of
either profit or honor, he does not regard either what he ought to do or what
God permits, but is hurried on by a blind fury. This would have happened to
Daniel, unless he had been restrained by a sense of true piety, and hence he
repudiated the honor offered him by King Nebuchadnezzar. He never wished to be
reckoned among soothsayers, and astrologers, and impostors of this kind, who
deluded that nation with prodigies. Here the queen enters and mentions Daniel;
but this does not render the king without excuse; for, as we have already said,
Daniel had acquired a name of renown among men of all ages, and God wished to
signalize him by a distinct mark, to fix the minds of all upon him, as if he
were an angel from heaven. As King Belshazzar was ignorant of the existence of
such a Prophet in his kingdom, this was the result of his gross and brutish
indifference. God, therefore, wished King Belshazzar to be reproved by a woman,
who said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not thy thoughts
disturb thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>She calms him quietly,
because she saw how frightened he was; but, meanwhile, she shews him the
grossness of his error in wandering about in uncertainty, when the way was plain
before him. God had put his torch in the Prophet&#8217;s hand for the very
purpose of lighting the king, unless he willfully desired to wander in darkness,
as all the wicked do. Hence, we may learn from the example of this king, the
common fault of our nature; for no one runs out of the right way, unless he
indulges in his own ignorance, and desires all light to be extinct within him.
As to the language of the queen,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The spirit of the holy gods is in
Daniel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>we have elsewhere explained its
meaning. It is not surprising that the profane use this language, since they
cannot discern between the one God and angels. Hence they promiscuously call
anything divine and celestial, <i>a god. </i>Thus also the queen calls angels,
<i>holy gods, </i>and places the true God among them. But it is our privilege to
acknowledge the true God as shining forth alone, and the angels as all taking
their own ranks without any excellence in heaven or earth to obscure the glory
of the only God. The writing has this tendency &#8212; the exaltation of God in
the highest degree, and the magnifying of his <i>excellency </i>and his majestic
supremacy. We here see how needful it is for us to be instructed in the
essential unity of God, since from the very beginning of the world men have
always been persuaded of the existence of some Supreme Deity; but after they
became vain in their imaginations, this idea entirely escaped them, and they
mingled God and angels in complete confusion. Whenever we perceive this, let us
feel our need of Scripture as a guide and instructor which shines on our path,
urging us to think of God as inviting us to himself and willingly revealing
himself to us.</font><br></div>

further, I pray thee, to be subject to thine only-begotten Son, to hold on in
the right course of our holy calling, and to be always pressing onwards to that

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
TWENTY-FIFTH<i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began yesterday to explain the passage where
Daniel relates how the queen advised King Belshazzar to send for the Prophet. We
shewed how the king was here convicted of ingratitude, in suffering such a
Prophet of God to be in obscurity so long, because that memorable prophecy,
already treated, ought to have been well known and in everybody&#8217;s mouth,
as conferring a permanent authority on the holy man. Now, when Daniel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the queen entered the
banqueting-room</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>very probably she was
not the king&#8217;s wife, but his grandmother. I have expressed my intention of
not contending the point, since in doubtful cases every one ought to enjoy his
own unbiased judgment. But it is incongruous to say, The king was feasting with
his wife and concubines, and then to add, &#8220;the queen entered the
banqueting-room.&#8221; Hence we suppose her to be called Queen, through the
honor, rank, and respect which she still enjoyed, without any power. The
testimony of Herodotus confirms this view, for he praises the queen of King
Nebuchadnezzar for her singular prudence, calling him Labynetus and her
Nitocris. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f261</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is far more probable that this matron was absent from a banquet unsuitable to
her age and gravity, since she would scarcely be feasting with those who were
thus devoting themselves to luxury. When she enters the room, she reminds the
king of Daniel, and she now gives the reason why he surpasses all the magi and
soothsayers, the diviners and the Chaldees.</font><br></div>

folly. The queen therefore deservedly claims these three qualities for Daniel,
while shewing his superiority to all others. <i>Hence </i>she reasons with
authority when she says, A name was imposed upon him by the king. We have
already spoken of this name, Belteshazzar; but the queen now refers to this
name, to inform the king in what great esteem and honor he was held by his
grandfather. The name of his father is here expressed, since Belshazzar might
despise all strangers; yet reason would dictate the propriety of deferring to
the judgment of his grandfather, whom every one knew to be a most remarkable
character, whom God humbled for a time, as we saw, and as Daniel will now allude

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the king does not acknowledge his own folly, but
without any modesty he interrogates Daniel, and that, too, as a captive,

Daniel.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I have

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the spirit of the gods is in
thee, since thou canst unravel intricacies and reveal
secrets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>With regard to the spirit of
the gods, we have already mentioned how King Belshazzar, by the common custom of
all nations, promiscuously mingled angels with God; because those miserable ones
could not extol God as they ought, and treat angels as entirely under his feet.
But this sentence shews men never were so brutal as not to ascribe all
excellence to God, as we see in profane writers; whatever promotes human
advantage, and is remarkable for superiority and dignity, they treat as benefits
derived from the gods. Thus the Chaldeans called the gift of intelligence a
spirit of the gods, being a rare and singular power of penetration; since men
acknowledge they do not acquire and attain to the prophetic office by their own
industry, but it is a heavenly gift. Hence men are compelled by God to assign to
him his due praise; but because the true God was unknown to them, they speak
implicitly, and, as I have said, they called angels gods, since in the darkness
of their ignorance they could not discern which was the true God. Whatever be
the meaning, Belshazzar here shews in what estimation he holds Daniel, saying,
he depends on the reports received from others, and thus displaying his own
slothfulness. He ought to have known the Prophet by personal experience; but
from his being content with simple rumor, he proudly neglected the teacher
offered to him, and neither reflected upon nor wished to confess his own
disgrace. But thus God. often extracts a confession from the impious, by which
they condemn themselves, even if they wish exceedingly to escape
censure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The following phrase has the same meaning:<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the wise men were brought
before me, and the soothsayers or diviners, to read this writing to me, and to
reveal its interpretation; and they could not do
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>said he; for God punished him by
shewing how profitless were all the Chaldeans and soothsayers, in whom he
trusted at the moment of his extremity. While he was thus disappointed in his
hopes, he acknowledges himself to have been deceived; and when he preferred the
magi and soothsayers, he thought himself fortified by their counsel, as long as
they were on his side. Meanwhile his rejection of the holy Prophet was
deservedly</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">intolerable to God. Belshazzar confesses this without
intending to do so; hence I said his confession was not ingenuous or voluntary,
but violently extorted by the secret instinct of God. He also promises Daniel
what he had previously promised the <i>magi, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be clothed in
purple if thou canst read this writing, and wear a golden chain round thy neck,
and thou shalt reign as the third person in the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But the end of his reign was
now close at hand, and yet in security he offers this dignity to Daniel. This
shews how rapidly the terror which God had occasioned him had vanished away. He
is agitated by the greatest uneasiness, just like madmen, for they having no
certainty exult amidst their terror, and wish to leap or fly towards heaven
itself. Thus also this tyrant though he trembles at God&#8217;s judgment, yet
retains a hidden obstinacy in his heart, and imagines his kingdom will
permanently continue, while he promises wealth and honors to others. It now
follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">First of all, Daniel here rejects the proffered
gifts. We do not read of his doing so before; he rather seemed to delight in the
honors conferred by King Nebuchadnezzar. We may inquire into the reason for this
difference. It is not probable that the intention, feeling, or sentiments of the
Prophet were different. What then could be his intention in allowing himself to
be previously ennobled by Nebuchadnezzar, and by now rejecting the offered
dignity? Another question also arises. At the end of this chapter we shall see
how he was clothed in purple, and a herald promulgated an edict, by which he
became third in the kingdom. The Prophet seems either to have forgotten himself
in receiving the purple which he had so magnanimously rejected, or we may ask
the reason why he says so, when he did not refuse to be adorned in the royal
apparel. With respect to the first question, I have no doubt of his desire to
treat the impious and desperate Belshazzar with greater asperity, because in the
case of King Nebuchadnezzar there still remained some feelings of honor, and
hence he hoped well of him and treated him more mildly. But with regard to King
Belshazzar, it was <i>necessary<sub> </sub>to </i>treat him more harshly,
because he had now arrived at his last extremity. This, I have no doubt, was the
<i>cause </i>of the difference, since the Prophet proceeded straight forward in
his course, but his duty demanded of him to distinguish between different
persons, and as there was greater pertinacity and obstinacy in King Belshazzar,
he shews how much less he deferred to him than to his grandfather. Besides, the
time of his subjection was soon to be finished, and with this end in view he had
formerly honored the Chaldean empire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the contrast apparent between his reply and his
actions, which we shall hereafter see, this ought not to seem absurd, if the
Prophet had from the beginning borne his testimony against the king&#8217;s
gifts, and that he utterly re-jeered them. Yet he does not strive very<sub>
</sub>vehemently, lest he should be thought to be acting cunningly, for the
purpose of escaping danger. In each case he wished to display <i>unconquered
</i>greatness of mind; at the beginning he asserted the king&#8217;s gifts to be
valueless to him, for he knew the end of the kingdom to be at hand, and
afterwards he received the purple with other apparel. If he had entirely refused
them, it would have been treated as a fault and as a sign of timidity, and would
have incurred the suspicion of treason. The Prophet therefore shews how
magnificently he despised all the dignities offered him by King Belshazzar, who
was already half dead. At the same time he shews himself intrepid against all
dangers; for the king&#8217;s death was at hand and the city was taken in a few
hours &#8212; nay, in the very same hour! Daniel therefore did not reject this
purple, she wing his resolution not to avoid death if necessary. He would have
been safer in his obscurity, had he dwelt among the citizens at large, instead
of in the palace; and if he had resided among the captives, he might have been
free from all danger. As he did not hesitate to receive the purple, he displays
his perfect freedom from all fear. Meanwhile he, doubtless, wished to lay
prostrate the king&#8217;s foolish arrogance, by which he was puffed up, when he
says, Let </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy gifts remain with
thee, and give thy presents to another! </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>I
</i>care not for them. Because he so nobly despises the king&#8217;s liberality,
there is no doubt of his desire to correct the pride by which he was puffed up,
or at least to wound and arouse his mind to feel God&#8217;s judgment, of which
Daniel will soon become both the herald and the witness. It now follows,

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before Daniel recites the writing, and adds its
interpretation, he explains to King Belshazzar the origin of this prodigy. He
did not begin the reading at once, as he might conveniently have done, saying
<i>Mene, Mene! </i>as we shall see at the end of the chapter, since the king
could not have pro-fired by his abrupt speech. But here Daniel shews it to be by
no means surprising, if God put forth his hand and shewed the figure of a hand
describing the king&#8217;s destruction, since the king had too obstinately
provoked his anger. We see then why Daniel begins by this narrative, since King
Nebuchadnezzar was a most powerful monarch, subduing the whole world to himself
and causing all men to tremble at his word, and was afterwards hurled from the
throne of his kingdom. Hence it more clearly appears that Belshazzar did not
live in ignorance, for he had so signal and remarkable an example [hat he ought
to have conducted himself with moderation. Since then that domestic admonition
did not profit him, Daniel shews the time to be ripe for the denunciation of
God&#8217;s wrath by a formidable and portentous sign. This is the sense of the
passage. Passing on to the words themselves, he first says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To King Nebuchadnezzar God gave
an empire, and magnificence, and loftiness, and
splendor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if he had said, he was
magnificently adorned, as the greatest monarch in the world. We have stated
elsewhere, and Daniel repeats it often, that empires are bestowed on men by
divine power and not by chance, as Paul announces, There is no power but of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1.) God wishes his power to be specially visible in kingdoms. Although,
therefore, he takes care of the whole world, and, in the government of the human
family even the most miserable things are regulated by his hand, yet his
singular providence shines forth in the empire of the world. But since we have
often discussed this point at length, and shall have many opportunities of
recurring to it, it is now sufficient just briefly to notice the principle, of
the exaltation of earthly kings by the hand of God, and not by the chances of
fortune.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Daniel confirms this doctrine, he adds, On
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>account of the magnificence which
God conferred upon him, all mortals trembled at the sight of
him!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he shews how
God&#8217;s glory is inscribed on kings, although he allows them to reign
supreme. This indeed cannot be pointed out with the finger, but the fact is
sufficiently clear; kings are divinely armed with authority, and thus retain
under their hand and sway a great multitude of subjects. Every one desires the
chief power over his fellow-creatures. Whence happens it, since ambition is
natural to all men, that many thousands are subject to one, and suffer
themselves to be ruled over and endure many oppressions? How could this be,
unless God entrusted the sword of power to those whom he wishes to excel? This
reason, then, must be diligently noticed, when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All men trembled at the sight of
King Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God
conferred upon him that majesty, and wished him to excel all the monarchs of the
world. God has many reasons, and often hidden ones, why he raises one man and
humbles another; yet this point ought to be uncontroverted by us. No kings can
possess any authority unless God extends his hand to them and props them up.
When he wishes to remove them from power, they fall of their own accord; not
because there is any chance in the changes of the world, but because God, as it
is said in the Book of Job,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;181218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
12:18,) deprives those of the sword whom he had formerly entrusted with
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom he wished to slay he slew,
and whom he wished to strike he struck</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Some think the abuse of kingly power is here described; but I had rather
take it simply, for Nebuchadnezzar being able to east down some, and to raise
others at his will, since it was in his power to give life to some and to slay
others. I, therefore, do not refer these words to tyrannical lust, as if
Nebuchadnezzar had put many innocent persons to death, and poured forth human
blood without any reason; or as if he had despoiled many of their fortunes, and
enriched others and adorned them with honor and wealth. I do not take it so. I
think it refers to his arbitrary power over life and death, and over the rise of
some and the ruin of others. On the whole, Daniel seems to me to describe the
greatness of that royal power which they may freely exercise over their
subjects, not through its being lawful, but through the tacit consent of all
men. Whatsoever pleases the king, all are compelled to approve of it, or at
least no one dares to murmur at it. Since, therefore, the regal license is so
great, Daniel here shews how King Nebuchadnezzar was not carried away by his own
plans, or purposes, or good fortune, but was entrusted with supreme power and
rendered formidable to all men, because God had designed him for his own glory.
Meanwhile, kings usually despise what they are permitted to enjoy, and what God
allows them. For powerful as they are, they must hereafter render an account to
the Supreme King. We are not to gather from this, that kings are appointed by
God without any law, or any self-restraint; but the Prophet, as I have said,
speaks of the royal power in itself. Since kings, therefore, have power over
their subjects for life and death, he says, the life of all men was in the hand
of King Nebuchadnezzar. He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When his heart was exalted, then
he was cast down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(or ejected)from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the throne of his kingdom, and
they deprived him of his majesty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
follows up his own narrative, tie wishes to shew King Belshazzar how God bears
with the insolence of those who forget him, when they have obtained the summit
of power. Desiring to make this known, he says, King Nebuchadnezzar, thy
grandfather, was a mighty monarch. He did not obtain this mightiness by himself,
nor could he have retained it, except he had been supported by God&#8217;s hand.
Now his change of circumstances was a remarkable proof that the pride of those
who are ungrateful to God can never be endured unto the end, as they never
acknowledge their sway to proceed from his benevolence.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, says he</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, his heart
was raised up and his spirit strengthened in
pride</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, a </i>sudden change occurred. Hence
you and all his posterity ought to be taught, lest pride still further deceive
you, and ye profit not by the example of your father; as we shall afterwards
relate. Hence this writing has been set before thee, for the purpose of making
known the destruction of thy life and kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>

down to destruction. Grant us also, to conduct ourselves so modestly in our

that he was not suddenly elated by folly, as vain men often swell with pride
without a cause; nor does any interior affection of the mind precede; but he
wishes to express in addition, the length of time during which this pride had
been conceived; as if he had said, he was not seized by any sudden vanity, but
his pride was studied, and obstinacy and obduracy were added to it. The change
of number which afterwards occurs from singular to plural, some refer to the
angels, as if they deprived him by God&#8217;s command; but I rather think these
words are taken indefinitely, implying merely his being deprived of his glory,

brute;&#8221; and others, that the grass supported him. The number is changed,
but there is no doubt about the sense; for if we read, &#8220;The herb of the
field supported him,&#8221;<i> </i>the expression will be indefinite, similar to
many others previously noticed; but if any one prefers using the plural number,
the sense will be equally suitable; for &#8220;the<i> </i>herbs of the field
gave him nourishment.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This verse does not need any long explanation, since
Daniel only repeats what he had formerly written: His grandfather,
Nebuchadnezzar, although not changed into a wild beast, was driven from the
common society of men, and his whole body was deformed, whilst he abhorred the
habits of men and preferred to dwell with the brutes. This was a horrible
prodigy, especially in so great a monarch; and it was an example worthy of being
handed down by posterity even to a thousand generations, had the monarchy
endured so long. But his grandson quickly forgot this event, and thus he is
deservedly convicted of the basest slothfulness. This is the reason why Daniel
repeats the history again, He </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was
driven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the children of men; his
heart was placed among the beasts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>meaning he was deprived of reason and judgment. We know this to be the
principal difference between men and brutes &#8212; men understand and reason,
but brutes are carried away by their senses. God, therefore, set forth a
memorable example in despoiling this king of his reason and intelligence, H<i>is
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dwelling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was with the wild
asses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>formerly he had dwelt in a
palace, conspicuous throughout the world at large, from whom all the people of
the East sought their laws. Since he was habitually worshipped as a god, this
was a horrible judgment, since he afterwards dwelt among wild beasts, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like a bull received his
sustenance from the grass of the field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>when he had previously reveled in every delicacy, and was accustomed to
luxurious habits, and to the whole wealth of a kingdom; ,especially, when we
know how luxuriously the Orientals indulged themselves. Babylon was the mother
of all indulgences, and when the king&#8217;s condition was thus changed, no one
could be ignorant of its cause &#8212; not mere chance or accident:, but the
rare and singular judgment of God!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds what he had formerly said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His body was moistened by the
dews of heaven, until he acknowledged God to reign supreme in the kingdom of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here again the end of the
punishment is expressed &#8212; that Nebuchadnezzar might feel himself to have
been created king by divine power, and to shew how earthly kings could not stand
unless God propped them up by his hand and influence. They think themselves
placed beyond the changes of fortune, and although they verbally boast of
reigning by the grace of God, yet they despise every deity and transfer the
glory of the divinity to themselves! We gather from these words that this is the
folly of all kings. For if Nebuchadnezzar had been persuaded of God&#8217;s
appointment of kings, of their dependence upon his will, and of their fall or
stability according to his decree, he had not needed this punishment, as these
words clearly imply, tie excluded God, then, from the government of the world;
but this is common with all earthly kings, as I have lately stated. All indeed
will profess something, but the Holy Spirit does not regard those false
protestations, as they are called. Hence in the character of King Nebuchadnezzar
we have set before us, as in a glass, the drunken confidence of all kings, in
supposing themselves to stand by their own power, and to free themselves from
the authority of God, as if he were not seated as a judge in heaven,
Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, ought to be humbled, until he acknowledged
God&#8217;s reign upon earth, since the common opinion fixed him up in heaven,
as if contented with his own ease, and careless of the affairs of the human
race. At length it is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
whom he wills, he exalts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or sets up.
What has been said obscurely is better expressed, since Nebuchadnezzar
acknowledged, by being severely punished and subdued, the reign of God on the
earth. For when earthly kings see themselves surrounded by guards, powerful in
riches, and able to collect mighty armies by their nod; when they see they
inspire universal terror, they think God deprived of his rights, and are unable
to conceive any change; as it is said in the Psalms of all the proud,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;191004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
10:4,) and as Isaiah says to the same purport, Even should a blast pass by, or a
deluge overwhelm the whole earth, yet evil shall not touch us.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15.) As if they had said, although God should thunder from heaven, yet we
shall be safe from all disaster and disturbance. Kings persuade themselves of
this. Hence they begin to acknowledge ,God as king of the earth, when they feel
themselves in his hand and at his disposal, to east down those whom he has
raised up, and to exalt the lowly and abject, as we have already seen. This
clause of the verse, then, is an explanation of the former sentence. It now
follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet continues his own sentence, and confirms
what I have said, namely, King Belshazzar was intractable and willfully blind to
God&#8217;s judgment. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou

insolently against men, his sin would be worthy of punishment; but when he had
provoked God on purpose, this arrogance neither could nor ought to be borne.
Again, therefore, the Prophet increases the guilt of the king&#8217;s pride by
saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he raised himself against
the King of heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He also expresses

commanding the vessels of the temple to be brought to sight; he drank from
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This profanation was an

he used these vessels for luxury and foul debauchery, abusing them in the

against God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in praising his gods

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel here explains these four verses which were
written upon the wall. The king could not read them, either through stupor, or
because God blunted all his senses, and blinded his eyes, as was formerly said.
The same thing must be said of the magi and the soothsayers, for they could have
read, had they not been rendered blind. First of all, Daniel recites the four
words, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSN, and then adds their interpretation. he
repeats the word MENE twice. Some conjecture this to apply to the numbering of
the years of the king&#8217;s life, and also to the time of his reign; but the
guess seems to be without any foundation. I think the word is used twice for the
sake of confirmation; as if the Prophet meant the number to be completed, since
men usually allow calculations to be liable to error. To impress upon Belshazzar
that his &#8216;life and kingdom were at stake, God affirms the number to be
complete, meaning, not a moment of time can be added to the boundary already
determined. So also Daniel himself interprets it:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has numbered thy
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>implying, God has appointed and
prescribed a fixed end to thy kingdom; hence it must necessarily come to an end,
since its period is fulfilled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Although God here addresses but one king by the
writing set before his eyes, we may still gather this general instruction
&#8212; God has prescribed a certain time for all kingdoms.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;181405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
14:5.) The Scripture bears the same witness concerning the life of <i>each
</i>of us. If God has prescribed to each of us the length of his life, surely
this applies more forcibly to public empires, of so much greater importance.
Hence we may know how not only kings live and die according to God&#8217;s
pleasure, but even empires are changed, as we have formerly said. He fixes alike
their origin and their destiny. <i>Hence </i>we may seek consolation, when we
see tyrants rushing on so impetuously, and indulging their lust and cruelty
without moderation. When, therefore, they rush on, as if they would mingle
heaven and earth, let us remember this instruction, Their years are numbered!
God knows how long they are to rage; He is not deceived; He knows whether it is
useful to the Church and his elect, for tyrants to prevail for a time. By and
bye he will surely restrain them, but since he determined the number of their
days from the beginning, the time of his vengeance is not yet quite at hand,
while he allows them a little longer to abuse without restraint the power and
the sway which he had divinely granted them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The exposition of the word TEKEL, <i>to weigh,
</i>now follows: &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since
thou hast been weighed in the balance, or scale, and found
wanting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here Daniel shews God so
moderating his judgments, as if he was carrying a balance in his hand. The
emblem is taken from the custom of mankind; for men know the use of the balance
for accurate measurement. So also God is said to treat all things by weight and
measure, since he does nothing with confusion, but uses moderation; and,
according to ordinary language, nothing is more or less than it should be.
(Wisdom 11:21.) For this reason, Daniel says God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weighed Belshazzar in a
balance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>since he did not make haste to
inflict punishment, but exacted it with justice according to his own uniform
rule of government. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since he was
found deficient</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, was found
light and without weight. As if he had said, Thou thinkest thy dignity must be
spared, since all men revere thee; thou thinkest thyself worthy of honor; thou
art deceived says he, for God judges otherwise; God does not use a common scale,
but holds his own, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and there art
found deficient</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, thou art found
a man of no
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consequence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in any way. From these words there is no doubt that the tyrant was greatly
exasperated, but as his last end was approaching, he ought to hear the voice of
the herald. And God, without doubt, restrained his fierceness, that he should
not rise up against Daniel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">srp</font><font face="Palatino">,
PHERES, is added, for the word PHERSIN, meaning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his kingdom was
divided</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>among the Medes and Persians. I
have no doubt that by this word God signified the dispersion of the Monarchy
which was at hand. When, therefore, he says UPHARSIN,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall
divide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it signifies the instability of
the Monarchy, since he wished to destroy or utterly abolish it. But the Prophet
alludes <i>very </i>appositely to the division made between the Medes and
Persians; and thus his disgrace was <i>increased </i>by the Babylonians being
compelled to serve many masters. This is indeed a grave and serious disgrace,
when a people has obtained a wide and extensive empire, to be afterwards
conquered and subjected to the yoke of a single master; but when it suffers
under two masters, then the indignity is greatly <i>increased. </i>So Daniel
here shews how God&#8217;s wrath was complicated in the destruction of the
monarch of Babylon, since it added to the severity of their punishment, to be
subdued by both Medes and Persians. The city, indeed, was truly taken by the
valor and industry of Cyrus; but since Cyrus admitted his father-in-law to the
great honor of allowing him to partake of the royal authority, hence the Medes
and Persians are said to have divided the kingdom, although there was properly
no division of the kingdom. Cyrus afterwards engaged in other expeditions, as he
was led away by his insatiable avarice and ambition. But Darius, as we shall
afterwards see, died at the age of sixty years, dwelt quietly at home, and it is
very well known that he was a Mede; and if we may believe the majority of
historians, his sister, the mother of Cyrus, had been banished to Persia, in
<i>consequence </i>of the oracle concerning the fortune and greatness of Cyrus.
Since his grandfather had exposed him, he afterwards avenged the injury, yet,
not so cruelly as to take his life,-for he desired him to retain some dignity,
and hence appointed him a satrap. But his son afterwards reigned over the Medes,
with the full permission of Cyrus, who next married his daughter; and thus, on
account of this relationship, and through the influence of this new alliance, he
wished to have him as a partner in the empire. In this sense, then, Daniel
narrates the division of the Monarchy to be at hand, since the Medes and the
Persians should divide it among them. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This order of the king may excite surprise, since he
had been so sharply reproved by the Prophet. He next seemed to have lost all
spirit, for he had grown pale a hundred times, and would have devoted the holy
Prophet of God to a thousand deaths! How happens it, then, that he ordered him
to be adorned with royal apparel, and next to be proclaimed by his own herald
the third person in the kingdom? Some think this was done because the laws of
kings were sacred among the Babylonians; nay, their very words were held as
binding, and whatever they proclaimed, they desired it to be esteemed firm and
inviolable. They suppose King Belshazzar to have acted thus through ambition,
that he might keep his promises. My opinion is, that he was at first utterly
astonished, and through listening to the Prophet he became like a stock or a
stone! I think he did so to consult his own ease and safety; otherwise he would
have been contemptible to his nobles. To shew himself unmoved, he commands
Daniel to be clothed in these robes, as if his threat had been perfectly
harmless. He did not despise what the Prophet had said, but he wished to
persuade his nobles and all his guests of his perfect indifference to
God&#8217;s threats, as if he did not utter them for the purpose of executing
them, but only of terrifying them all. Thus kings, when greatly terrified, are
always exceedingly careful not to shew any sign of their timidity, since they
think their authority would become materially weakened. To continue, therefore,
his reverence among his subjects, he is desirous of appearing exceedingly
careless and undisturbed; and I do not hesitate to pronounce this to have been
the tyrant&#8217;s intention in ordering Daniel to be clad in purple and in
royal magnificence.</font><br></div>

in our station of life as to serve thee, and to extol and glorify thy sacred
name, without being even separated from thee. Grant us also so to bear thy yoke

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE Daniel shortly relates how his prophecy was
fulfilled that very night. As we have before explained it, a customary feast-day
had occurred which the Babylonians celebrated annually, and on this occasion the
city was betrayed by two satraps, whom Xenophon calls Gobryas and Gadatas. On
this passage the Rabbis display both their impudence and ignorance; as,
according to their usual habit, they babble with audacity about what they do not
understand. They say the king was stabbed, because one of his guards heard the
Prophet&#8217;s voice, and wished to execute that heavenly judgment; as if the
sentence of God depended upon the will of a single heathen! We must pass by
these puerile trifles and cling to the truth of history; for Belshazzar was
seized in his own banqueting-room, when he was grossly intoxicated, with his
nobles and concubines. Meanwhile, we must observe God&#8217;s wonderful kindness
towards the Prophet. He was not in the slightest danger, as the rest were. He
was clad in purple, and scarcely an hour had passed when the Medes and Persians
entered the city. He could scarcely have escaped in the tumult, unless God had
covered him with the shadow of his hand. We see, then, how God takes care of his
own, and snatches us from the greatest dangers, as if he were bringing us from
the tomb. There is no doubt that the holy Prophet was much agitated amidst the
tumult, for he was not without sensibility. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F280</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But he ought to be thus exercised to cause
him to acknowledge God as the faithful guardian of his life, and to apply
himself more diligently to his worship, since he saw nothing preferable to
casting all his cares upon him!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom was transferred to
the king of the Medes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>whom he calls
Darius, but Xenophon terms him Cyaxares. It is clear enough that Babylon was
taken by the skill and under the auspices of Cyrus; since he was a persevering
warrior possessed of great authority, though he is not mentioned here. But since
Xenophon relates that Cyaxares, here called Darius, was Cyrus&#8217;s
father-in-law, and thus held in the highest honor and estimation, it is not
surprising to find Daniel bringing that king before us. Cyrus was content with
his own power and with the praise and fame of his victory, and readily conceded
this title to his father-in-law, whom he perceived to be now growing aged and
infirm. It is uncertain whether he was the son of Astyages, and thus the uncle
of Cyrus. Many historians concur in stating that Astyages was the grandfather of
Cyrus who married his daughter to Cambyses; because the astrologers had informed
him how an offspring should be born of her who should possess the sovereignty
over all Asia! Many add the story of his ordering the infant Cyrus to be slain,
but since these matters are uncertain, I leave them undecided. I rather think
Darius was the uncle of Cyrus, and also his father-in-law; though, if we believe
Xenophon, he was unmarried at the capture of Babylon; for his uncle, and perhaps
his father-in-law, had sent him to bring supplies when he was inferior in
numbers to the Babylonians and Assyrians. However this may be, the
Prophet&#8217;s narrative suits the circumstances well enough, for Darius, as
king of the Medes, obtained the royal authority. Cyrus was, indeed, higher than
he in both rank and majesty, but he granted him the title of King of Babylon,
and under this name he reigned over the Chaldeans. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">As to the translation, some translate the last clause
of the second verse, &#8220;That the king should not have any trouble;&#8221;
but since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qzn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nezek, </i>signifies &#8220;to<i> </i>suffer loss,&#8221; I willingly adopt
this sense; because the king did not escape trouble, through a desire for ease,
as he might have done, being an old man, but he willingly managed his own
affairs, and committed the care of them to three men, lest anything should be
lost through passing through too many hands. For experience shews us how
confusion is caused by a multitude. If there had been only there an hundred and
twenty governors of provinces, many inconveniences must have happened, and much
loss would have occurred; hence the king placed three prefects over these
hundred and twenty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here again we may perceive how God cared for his
Prophet, not so much for any private reason or through private respect, as by
his aid the wretched captives and exiles should be benefited. God wished to
stretch forth his hand to the Jews by means of Daniel. And we may deservedly
call him God&#8217;s hand in sustaining the Jews. The Persians, being
barbarians, were not naturally more merciful than others; hence God interposed
his servant Daniel to succor them. We must notice, in the context of this
history, how Daniel alone was chosen by Darius one of these three superior
officers. He was the third in rank under king Belshazzar, although for a moment,
yet it might occasion envy under the new king that so great an honor was
conferred upon him. Very probably Darius was informed of the previous
predictions of Daniel; how the hand appeared upon the wall, how he interpreted
the writing, and became a heaven-sent messenger to denounce destruction on king
Belshazzar. For unless this rumor held reached Darius, Daniel would never have
obtained so much authority under him. His own army abounded in numbers, and we
know how every conqueror is surrounded in war by many dependents, all of whom
wish to share in the spoil. Darius, therefore, would never have noticed a
stranger and a captive, and admitted him to such great honor and power, unless
he had understood him to be a known Prophet of God, and also a herald in
denouncing destruction against the Babylonish monarchy. Thus we gather how
providential it was for him to be among the first satraps, and even third in the
kingdom, as this brought him more quickly under the notice of Darius. For if
Daniel had been cast down by king Belshazzar he would have remained at home in
concealment; but when he appeared clothed in royal apparel, the king inquired
who he was? He heard the means of his arriving at so high an honor; hence he
acknowledged him as God&#8217;s Prophet, and appointed him one of the three
prefects. Here also God&#8217;s providence is again set before us, not only in
preserving his servant in safety, but in providing for the safety of the whole
Church, lest the Jews should be still more oppressed by the change of masters.
But a temptation is afterwards inflicted, by which the holy Prophet and the
whole people were severely tried; for the Prophet says:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now relates, as I have said, the origin
of a temptation which might naturally cast down the spirits of the elect people
as well as his own. For although Daniel alone was cast into the
lion&#8217;s-den, as we shall afterwards see, yet, unless he had been liberated,
the condition of the people would have been more grievous and severe. For we
know the wicked petulantly insult the wretched and the innocent, when they see
them suffering any adversity. If Daniel had been torn by the lions, all men
would have risen up in a body against the Jews. God, therefore, here exercised
the faith and patience of his servant, and also proved all the Jews by the same
test, since they saw themselves liable to the most extreme sufferings in the
person of a single individual, unless God had speedily afforded the assistance
which he rendered. Daniel, first of all, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he excelled all others, since a
more excellent or superior spirit was in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It does not always happen that
those who are remarkable for prudence or other endowments obtain greater
authority and rank. In the palaces of kings we often see men of brutal
dispositions holding high rank, and we need not go back to history for this. In
these days kings are often gross and infatuated, and more like horses and asses
than men! Hence audacity and recklessness obtain the highest honors of the
palace. When Daniel says <i>he excelled, </i>he brings to our notice God&#8217;s
two-fold benefit: <i>first, </i>a greater portion of his Spirit was bestowed
upon him; and <i>secondly, </i>Darius acknowledged this, and raised him to honor
when he saw him endued with no ordinary industry and wisdom. We now understand
the Prophet&#8217;s teaching, here, as first divinely adorned with prudence and
other endowments; and then, Darius was a competent judge of this, in estimating
his prudence and other virtues, and holding them in great repute. Since,
therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a noble spirit was in
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he overcame all
others</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he; therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king determined to set him
above the whole kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, to
place him first among the three satraps. Although it was a singular privilege
with which God once blessed his people and his Prophet, yet we ought to weep
over the heartlessness of kings in these days, who proudly despise God&#8217;s
gifts in all good men who surpass the multitude in usefulness; and at the same
time enjoy the society of the ignorant like themselves, while they are slaves to
avarice and rapine, and manifest the greatest cruelty and licentiousness. Since,
then, we see how very unworthy kings usually are of their empire and their
power, we must weep over the state of the world, because it reflects like a
glass the wrath of heaven, and kings are thus destitute of counsel. At the last
day, King Darius alone will be sufficient to condemn them, for he had discretion
enough not to hesitate to set a captive and a foreigner over all his satraps;
for this was a royal, nay, a heroic virtue in Darius to prefer this man to all
his own friends. But now kings think of nothing else than preferring their own
panders, buffoons, and flatterers; while they praise none but men of low
character, whom God has branded with ignominy. Although they are unworthy of
being reckoned among mankind, yet they esteem themselves the masters of their
sovereigns, and treat the kings of these days as their slaves. This happens
through their mere slothfulness, and their discarding every possible anxiety.
Hence they are compelled to deliver up their command to others, and retain
nothing but the title. This, as I said, is a sure proof of the wrath of heaven,
since the world is at this day unworthy of the government which God exercises
over it by his hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the envy felt by the nobles, we see
this vice rampant in all ages, since the aspirants to any greatness can never
bear the presence of virtue. For, being guilty of evil themselves, they are
necessarily bitter against the virtue of others. Nor ought it to seem surprising
that the Persians who sustained the greatest labors, and passed through numerous
changes of fortune, should be unable to bear with an obscure and unknown person,
not only associated with them, but appointed as their superior. Their envy,
then, seems to have had some pretext, either real or imaginary. But it will
always be deserving of condemnation, when we find men selfishly pursuing their
own advantage without any regard for the public good. Whoever aspires to power
and self-advancement, without regarding the welfare of others, must necessarily
be avaricious and rapacious, cruel and perfidious, as well as forgetful of his
duties. Since, then, the nobles of the realm envied Daniel, they betrayed their
malice, for they had no regard for the public good, but desired to seize upon
all things for their own interests. In this example we observe the natural
consequence of envy. And we should diligently notice this, since nothing is more
tempting than gliding down from one vice to a worse. The envious man loses all
sense of justice while attempting every scheme for injuring his adversary. These
nobles report Daniel to have been preferred to themselves unworthily. If they
had been content with this abuse, it would have been, as I said, a vice and a
sign of a perverse nature. But they go far beyond this, for they seek for an
occasion of crime in Daniel. We see, then, how envy excites them to the
commission of crime. Thus all the envious are perpetually on the watch, while
they become spies of the fortunes of those whom they envy, to oppress them by
every possible means. This is one point; but when they find no crime, they
trample upon justice, without modesty and without humanity, and with cruelty and
perfidy lay themselves out to crush an adversary. Daniel relates this of his
rivals. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They immediately
sought occasion against him, and did not find
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then he adds how unjustly and
perfidiously they sought occasion against him. There is no doubt they knew
Daniel to be a pious man and approved by God; hence, when they plot against his
holy Prophet, they purposely wage war with God himself, while they are blinded
with the perverse passion of envy. Whence, then, does it spring? Surely from
ambition. Thus we see how pestilential a plague ambition is, from which envy
springs up, and afterwards perfidy and cruelty!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides this, Daniel admonishes us by his own example
to study to strive after integrity, and thus to deprive the malevolent and the
wicked of all occasion against us, which they seek. We shall find no better
defense against the envious and the slanderous than to conduct ourselves
righteously and innocently. Whatever snares they may lay for us, they will never
succeed, for our innocence will repel their malice like a shield. Meanwhile we
see how Daniel escaped utter ruin, since they sought a pretext against him in
something else, namely, his worship of God. Hence let us learn how we ought to
esteem piety and an earnest desire for it of more value than life itself. Daniel
was faithful and upright in his administration: he discharged his duty so as to
close the mouth of his enemies and detractors. Thus, as I have said, integrity
is the best of all protectors. Again, Daniel was in danger because he would not
leave off the sincere worship of God and its outward profession. Hence we must
bravely undergo all dangers whenever the worship of God is at stake. This
temporary life ought not to be more precious to us than that most sacred of all
things &#8212; the preservation of God&#8217;s honor unstained. We therefore see
how we, by these means, are urged to the cultivation of integrity, since we
cannot be more secure than when fortified by a good conscience, as Peter in his
first epistle exhorts us to the same purpose,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 3:16.) Now, whatever we may fear, and whatever events await us, even if we
become subject to a hundred deaths, we ought never to decline from the pure
worship of God, since Daniel did not hesitate to submit to death and enter the
lion&#8217;s den, because he openly professed the worship of Israel&#8217;s God.
As these nobles entered into this barbarous and cruel counsel for oppressing
Daniel under the pretense of religion, here, again, we gather the blindness and
rashness of mankind when ambition and envy seize upon their minds. For it is a
matter of no moment with them to come into collision with the Almighty, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f286</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for they do not approach Daniel as a fellow-creature, but they leap into an
insane and sacrilegious contest when they wish to extinguish the worship of God
and give way to their own indulgence. Thus, as I have said, we are admonished by
this example how ambition is to be guarded against and avoided, and also the
envy which arises from it. The nature of this charge &#8212; the worship of God
&#8212; afterwards follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The nobles of the kingdom purposely endeavored to
ruin the holy Prophet, either by casting him into the lion&#8217;s den to perish
or else by causing him to desist from the outward profession of worshipping God.
They knew him to be so really in earnest that he would not redeem his life by so
great an act of impiety, and hence they thought him doomed to death. We perceive
in them great cunning; but God met them on the other hand and aided his servant,
as we shall see. Meanwhile their malice was the more detestable, since they
desired to destroy Daniel by this very pretense. Although they did not worship
Israel&#8217;s God, they knew the Prophet&#8217;s mind to be pious and
straightforward, and then they experienced the power of that God who was unknown
to them. They did not condemn Daniel, nor blame the religion which he practiced;
for, as I have said, their hatred of this man urged them to such cruelty that
they rushed against the Almighty. They could not disguise from themselves the
duty of worshipping God: they worshipped and adored unknown deities, and did not
dare to condemn the worship of Israel&#8217;s God. We see how the devil
fascinated them when they dared to impute this as a crime to the holy Prophet;
while we are ignorant of the manner in which their opinion was
changed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some suppose this was done because Darius could not
bear with composure the glory of his son-in-law. For since he was an old man,
and his relative in the flower of his age, he thought himself despised. Others
think Darius to have been touched by secret emulation, and that he allowed his
nobles to approach him for the purpose of deceiving the miserable and doting old
man, and thus to throw dust in his eyes. But this conjecture does not seem to me
sufficiently valid. Nor need I give myself much trouble in this matter, because
it might happen that at the beginning of a new reign they wished to congratulate
the king, and they fixed upon something new and unaccustomed, as we see often
done by flatterers of royalty. Hence the old man might be deceived in this
matter, since the monarchy was newly established. The king had hitherto ruled
over none but Medes; now Chaldeans, Assyrians, and many other nations were added
to his sway. Such an addition might intoxicate him with vain-glory, and his
nobles might think this a plausible reason for offering to him divine honors.
This single reason seems to me sufficient; I do not inquire further, but embrace
what is probable and obvious at first sight. I defer the remainder till
to-morrow.</font><br></div>

we may learn to restrain ourselves within that moderation to which thou
restrictest us. May we be content with our humble station and strive to prove

<div><font face="Palatino">WE said, yesterday, that the nobles who laid snares
against Daniel were inspired with great fury when they dared to dictate to the
king the edict recorded by Daniel. It was an intolerable sacrilege thus to
deprive all the deities of their honor; yet he subscribed the edict, as we shall
afterwards see, and thus put to the test the obedience of his people whom he had
lately reduced under the yoke by the help of his son-in-law. There is no doubt
of his wish to subdue the Chaldees, who up to that time had been masters; and we
know how ferocity springs from the possession of authority. Since then the
Chaldees had formerly reigned so far and wide, it was difficult to tame them and
render them submissive, especially when they found themselves the slaves of
those who had previously been their rivals. We know how many contests there were
between them and the Medes; and although they were subdued in war, their spirits
were not yet in subjection; hence Darius desired to prove their obedience, and
this reason induced him to give his consent. He does not purposely provoke the
anger of the gods; but through respect for the men, he forgets the deities, and
substitutes himself in the place of the gods, as if it was in his power to
attract the authority of heaven to himself! This, as I have said, was a grievous
sacrilege. If any one could enter into the hearts of kings, he would find
scarcely<i> </i>one in a hundred who does not despise everything divine.
Although they confess themselves to enjoy their thrones by the grace of God, as
we have previously remarked, yet they wish to be adored in his stead. We now see
how easily flatterers persuade kings to do whatever appears likely to extol
their magnificence. It follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, as I have said, it is sufficiently apparent how
inclined to fallacies are the minds of kings when they think they can benefit
themselves and increase their own dignity. For the king did not dispute long
with his nobles but subscribed the edict; for he thought it might prove useful
to himself and his successors: if he found the Chaldeans obedient to himself and
rather prepared to deny the existence of every god than to refuse whatever he
commanded! As to the use of the word, some, translate

13:31.) As to his joining the Medes with the Persians, this arises from what we
said before, since Cyrus and Darius reigned in common as colleagues. Greater
dignity was granted to Darius, while the power was in the hands of Cyrus;
besides, without controversy, his sons were heirs of either kingdom and of the
Monarchy of the East, unless when they began to make war on each other. When
they say, the law of the Medes and Persians <i>is immutable, </i>this is worthy
of praise in laws, and sanctions their authority; thus they are strong and
obtain their full effect. When laws are variable, many are necessarily injured,
and no private interest is stable unless the law be without variation; besides,
when there is a liberty of changing laws, license succeeds in place of justice.
For those who possess the supreme power, if corrupted by gifts, promulgate first
one edict and then another. Thus justice cannot flourish where change in the
laws allows of so much license. But, at the same time, kings ought prudently to
consider lest they promulgate any edict or law without grave and mature
deliberation; and secondly, kings ought to be careful lest they be counteracted
by cunning and artful plots, to which they are often liable. Hence, constancy is
praiseworthy in kings and their edicts, if only they are preceded by prudence
and equity. But we shall immediately see how foolishly kings affect the fame of
consistency, and how their obstinacy utterly perverts justice. But we shall see
this directly in its own place. It follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel now relates how he was clothed in the boldness
of the Spirit of God to offer his life as a sacrifice to God, because he knew he
had no hope of pardon left, if his violation of the king&#8217;s edict had been
discovered; he knew the king himself to be completely in shackles even if he
wished to pardon him &#8212; as the event proved. If death had been before the
Prophet&#8217;s eyes, he preferred meeting it fearlessly rather than ceasing
from the duty of piety. We must remark that the internal worship of God is not
treated here, but only the external profession of it. If Daniel had been
forbidden to pray, this fortitude with which he was endued might seem necessary;
but many think he ran great risks without sufficient reason, since he increased
the chance of death when only outward profession was prohibited. But as Daniel
here is not the herald of his own virtue, but the Spirit speaks through his
mouth, we must suppose that this magnanimity in the holy Prophet was pleasing to
God. And his liberation shewed how greatly his piety was approved, because he
had rather lose his life than change any of his habits respecting the worship of
God. We know the principal sacrifice which God requires, is to call upon his
name. For we hereby testify him to be the author of all good things; next we
shew forth a specimen of our faith; then we fly to him, and cast all our cares
into his bosom, and offer him our prayers. Since, therefore, prayer constitutes
the chief part of our adoration and worship of God, it was certainly a matter of
no slight moment when the king forbade any one to pray to God; it was a gross
and manifest denial of piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here, again, we collect how blind was the
king&#8217;s pride when he could sign so impious and foul an edict! Then how mad
were the nobles who, to ruin Daniel as far as they possibly could, endeavored to
abolish all piety, and draw down God from heaven! For what remains, when men
think they can free themselves from the help of God, and pass him over with
security? Unless he prop us up by his special aid, we know how entirely we
should be reduced to nothing. Hence the king forbade any one to offer up any
prayer during a whole month &#8212; that is, as I have said, he exacts from
every one a denial of God! But Daniel could not obey the edict without
committing an atrocious insult against God and declining from piety; because, as
I have said, God exacts this as a principal sacrifice. Hence it is not
surprising if Daniel cordially opposed the sacrilegious edict. Now, with respect
to the profession of piety, it was necessary to testify before men his
perseverance in the worship of God. For if he had altered his habits at all, it
would have been a partial abjuration; he would not have said that he openly
despised God to please Darius; but that very difference in his conduct would
have been a proof of perfidious defection. We know that God requires not only
faith in the heart and the inward affections, but also the witness and
confession of our piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel, therefore, was obliged to persevere in the
holy practice to which he was accustomed, unless he wished to be the very
foulest apostate! He was in the habit of praying with his windows open: hence he
continued in his usual course, lest any one should object that he gratified his
earthly king for a moment by omitting the worship of God. I wish this doctrine
was now engraven on the hearts of all men as it ought to be; but this example of
the Prophet is derided by many, not perhaps openly and glaringly, but still
clearly enough, the Prophet seems to them too inconsiderate and simple, since he
incurs great danger, rashly, and without any necessity. For they so separate
faith from its outward confession as to suppose it can remain entire even if
completely buried, and for the sake of avoiding the cross. they depart a hundred
times from its pure and sincere profession. We must maintain, therefore, not
only the duty of offering to God the sacrifice of prayer in our hearts, but that
our open profession is also required, and thus the reality of our worship of God
may clearly appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not say that our hasty thoughts are to be
instantly spread abroad, rendering us subject to death by the enemies of God and
his gospel; but I say these things ought to be united and never to be separated,
namely, faith and its profession. For confession is of two kinds: first, the
open and ingenuous testimony to our inward feelings; and secondly, the necessary
maintenance of the worship of God, lest we shew any sign of a perverse and
perfidious hypocrisy, and thus reject the pursuit of piety. With regard to the
first kind, it is neither always nor everywhere necessary to profess our faith;
but the second kind ought to be perpetually practiced, for it can never be
necessary for us to pretend either disaffection or apostasy. For although Daniel
did not send for the Chaldeans by the sound of a trumpet whenever he wished to
pray, yet he framed his prayers and his vows in his couch as usual, and did not
pretend to be forgetful of piety when he saw his faith put to the test, and the
experiments made whether or not he would persevere in his constancy. Hence he
distinctly says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he went
home</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>after being made acquainted with
the signing of the decree. Had he been admitted to the council, he would
doubtless have spoken out, but the rest of the nobles cunningly excluded him,
lest he should interfere with them, and they thought the remedy would be too
late, and utterly in vain as soon as he perceived the certainty of his own
death. Hence, had he been admitted to the king&#8217;s council, he would there
have discharged his duty, and heartily interposed; but after the signing of the
edict, and the loss of all opportunity for advising the king, he retired to his
house.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must here notice the impossibility of finding an
excuse for the king&#8217;s advisers, who purposely escape when they see that
unanimity of opinion cannot be obtained, and think God will be satisfied in this
way, if they only maintain perfect silence. But no excuse can be admitted for
such weakness of mind. And, doubtless, Daniel is unable to defend them by his
example, since, as we have already said, he was excluded by the cunning and
malice of the nobles from taking his place among them as usual, and thus
admonishing the king in time. He now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His windows were open towards
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The question arises, Whether
it was necessary for Daniel thus to open his windows? For some one may object
&#8212; he did this under a mistaken opinion; for if God fills heaven end earth,
what signified his windows being open towards Jerusalem? There is no doubt that
the Prophet used this device as a stimulus to his fervor in prayer. For when
praying for the liberation of his people, he directed his eyes towards
Jerusalem, and that sight became a stimulus to enflame his mind to greater
devotion. Hence the opening of the Prophet&#8217;s windows has no reference to
God, as if he should be listened to more readily by having the open heaven
between his dwelling and Judea; but he rather considered himself and his natural
infirmity. Now, if the holy Prophet, so careful in his prayers, needed this
help, we must see whether or not our sloth in these days has need of more
stimulants! Let us learn, therefore, when we feel ourselves to be too sluggish
and cold in prayer, to collect all the aids which can arouse our feelings and
correct the torpor of which we are conscious. This, then, was the
Prophet&#8217;s intention </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
opening his windows towards Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Besides, he wished by this symbol to shew his domestics his perseverance, in the
hope and expectation of the promised redemption. When, therefore, he prayed to
God, he kept Jerusalem in sight, not that his eyes could penetrate to so distant
a region, but he directed his gaze towards Jerusalem to shew himself a stranger
among the Chaldeans, although he enjoyed great power among them, and was adorned
with great authority, and excelled in superior dignity. Thus he wished all men
to perceive how he longed for the promised inheritance, although for a time he
was in exile. This was his second reason for opening his
windows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayed three times
a-day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is worthy of observation,
because, unless we fix certain hours in the day for prayer, it easily slips from
our memory. Although, therefore, Daniel was constant in pouring forth prayers,
yet he enjoined upon himself the customary rite of prostrating himself before
God three times a-day. When we rise in the morning, unless we commence the day
by praying to God, we shew a brutish stupidity, so also when we retire to rest,
and when we take our food and at other times, as every one finds most
advantageous to himself. For here God allows us liberty, but we ought all to
feel our infirmities, and to apply the proper remedies. Therefore, for this
reason, Daniel was in the habit of praying thrice. A proof of his fervor is also
added, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
prostrated himself on his knees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>not
that bending the knee is necessary in prayer, but while we need aids to
devotion, as we have said, that posture is of importance. First of all, it
reminds us of our inability to stand before God, unless with humility and
reverence; then, our minds are better prepared for serious entreaty, and this
symbol of worship is pleasing to God. Hence Daniel&#8217;s expression is by no
means superfluous: <i>H</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>e,
fell upon his knees whenever he wished to pray to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he uttered prayers and
confessions before God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or he praised
God, for we must diligently notice how many in their prayers mutter to God. For
although they demand either one thing or another, yet they are carried along by
an immoderate impulse, and, as I have said, they are violent in their requests
unless God instantly grants their petitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why Daniel joins praises or the
giving of thanks with prayers; as, also, Paul exhorts us respecting both. Offer
up, says he, your prayers to God, with thanksgiving,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:6,) as if he had said, We cannot rightly offer vows and prayers to God unless
when we bless his holy name, although he does not immediately grant our
petitions. In Daniel&#8217;s case we must remark another circumstance: he had
been an exile for a long time, and tossed about in many troubles and changes;
still he celebrates God&#8217;s praises. Which of us is endued with such
patience as to praise God, if afflicted with many trials through three or four
years? Nay, scarcely a day passes without our passions growing warm and
instigating us to rebel against God! Since Daniel, then, could persevere in
praising God, when oppressed by so many sorrows, anxieties, and troubles &#8212;
this was a remarkable proof of invincible patience. And, doubtless, he signifies
a continuous act, by using the demonstrative pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>deneh, </i>which refers to his ordinary habit &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as he had done before, and from
former times</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By noticing the time, he
marks, as I have said before, a perseverance, since he was not only accustomed
to pray once or twice, but by a regular constancy he exercised himself in this
duty of piety every day. It afterwards follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the nobles of Darius display their fraud when

they agree together, and find
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daniel uttering prayers and
supplications to his God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If Daniel had
prayed with the slightest secrecy, he would not have been a victim to their
snares; but he did not refuse the prospect of death. He knew the object of the
edict, and expected the arrival of the nobles. We see, then, how willingly he
submitted to instant death, and for no other purpose than to retain the pure
worship of God, together with its outward profession. Go to, now, ye who desire
to shield your perfidy, pretending that you ought not to incur danger rashly,
and when the wicked surround you on all sides! You become cautious lest you
should rashly throw away your lives! For Daniel, in their opinion, was to be
blamed for too great simplicity and folly, since he willingly and knowingly
encountered certain danger. But we have already said, he could not escape from
their snare without indirectly revolting from God, for he might have been
immediately reproached &#8212; Why do you desist from your accustomed habit? Why
do you close your windows? Why do you not dare to pray to your God? It appears,
then, you regard the king of more importance than the reverence and fear of God.
Because God&#8217;s honor would have been thus sullied, Daniel, as we have
already seen, spontaneously offered himself to death as a sacrifice. We are
taught, also, by this example, how snares are prepared for the sons of God,
however circumspectly they act, and however soberly they conduct themselves. But
they ought to conduct themselves so prudently as neither to be too cunning nor
too anxious, that is, they should not regard their own security so as in the
meantime to forget God&#8217;s requirements, and the preciousness of his name,
and the necessity of a confession of faith in the proper place and time. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the king&#8217;s nobles approach the king as
conquerors, but they do so cunningly; for they do not openly say anything about
Daniel, whom they knew to be a favorite with the king; but they repeat their
previous assertion concerning the impossibility of changing the edict, since the
law of the Medes and Persians is inviolable and cannot be rendered void. Again,
therefore, as far as they possibly can, they sanction that edict, lest the king
should afterwards be free, or dare to retract what he had once commanded. We
must mark the cunning with which they indirectly circumvent the king, and
entangle him, by preventing the change of a single word;

consistency and obstinacy. For kings ought to reflect upon their own decrees, to
avoid the disgrace of retracting what they have hastily promulgated. If anything
has escaped them without consideration, both prudence and equity require them to
correct their errors; but when they have trampled upon all regard for justice,
they desire every inconsiderate command to be strictly obeyed! This is the
height of folly, and we ought not to sanction a perseverance in such obstinacy,

TWENTY-NINTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began yesterday to explain Daniel&#8217;s
narrative of the calumny invented against him before King Darius. The nobles of
the kingdom, as we have said, used cunning in their interview with the king;
because if they had begun with Daniel, the king might have broken his word. But,
they dwell upon the royal decree; they shew the imminence of the danger, unless
the authority of all the king&#8217;s decrees was upheld. By this artifice we
see how they obtained their object; for the king confirms their assertion
respecting the wickedness of rendering abortive what had been promulgated in the
king&#8217;s name. For kings are pleased with their own greatness, and wish
their own pleasure to be treated as an oracle. That edict was detestable and
impious by which Darius forbade entreaties to be offered to any deity; yet he
wished it to remain in force, lest his majesty should be despised by his
subjects. Meanwhile, he does not perceive the consequences which must ensue.
Hence we are taught by this example, that no virtue is so rare in kings as
moderation, and yet none is more necessary; for the more they have in their
power, the more it becomes them to be cautious lest they indulge their lusts,
while they think it lawful to desire whatever pleases them. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when Daniel&#8217;s calumniators see that King
Darius had no wish to defend his cause, they open up more freely what they had
previously conceded; for, as we have said, if they had openly accused Daniel,
their accusation could have been instantly and completely refuted; but after
this sentiment had been expressed to the king, their statement is final, since
by the laws of the Medes and Persians a king&#8217;s decree ought to be
self-acting; hence, after this is accomplished, they then come to the person.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daniel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

the Jewish captives,&#8221; they doubtless intended to magnify his crime and to
render him odious. For if any Chaldean had dared to despise the king&#8217;s
edict, his rashness would not have been excused. But now when Daniel, who was
lately a slave and a Chaldean captive, dares to despise the king&#8217;s
command, who reigned over Chaldea by the right of conquest, this seemed less
tolerable still. The effect is the same as if they had said, &#8220;He was
lately a captive among thy slaves; thou art supreme lord, and his masters to
whom he was subject are under thy yoke, because thou art their conqueror; he is
but a captive and a stranger, a mere slave, and yet he rebels against
thee!&#8221; We see then how they desired to poison the king&#8217;s mind
against him by this allusion, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
is one of the captives!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The words are
very harmless in themselves, but they endeavor to sting their monarch in every

narrative, Daniel has not obeyed thy command in praying to his own God; but, as

malicious men. It now follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, Daniel recites that the king was
disturbed, when he perceived the malice of his nobles which had formerly escaped
him; for their intention and their object had never occurred to him; he
perceives himself deceived and entrapped, and hence he is disturbed. Here again
we are taught how cautiously kings ought to avoid depraved counsels, since they
are besieged on every side by perfidious men, whose only object is to gain by
their false representations, and to oppress their enemies, and those from whom
they hope for booty or who may favor their evil courses. Because so many snares
surround kings, they ought to be the more cautious in providing against cunning.
They are too late in acknowledging themselves to have been overreached, when no
remedy is left, partly through fear, and partly through wishing to consult their
own credit; and they prefer offending God to suffering any outward disrespect
from men. Since, therefore, kings consider their own honor so sacred, they
persevere in their evil undertakings, even when their conscience accuses them;
and even if justice itself were to appear visibly before them, yet this
restraint would not be sufficient to withhold them, when ambition urges them in
the opposite direction, and they are unwilling to lose the slightest portion of
their reputation among men. The case of Darius supplies us with an example of
this kind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First of all, it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was sorrowful when he heard
these words, and was anxious till the setting of the sun about the way of
snatching Daniel from death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He wished
this to be done, if his own honor were sound and safe, and his nobles were
satisfied. But on the one side, he fears disunion if his nobles should conspire
to produce disturbance; and on the other side, he is moved by a foolish fear,
because he does not wish to incur the charge of levity which awaited him, and
hence he is vanquished and obeys the lusts of the wicked. Although, therefore,
he labored till the setting of the sun to free Daniel, yet that perverse shame
prevailed of which I have spoken, and then the fear of dissension. For when we
do not lean upon God&#8217;s help, we are always compelled to vacillate,
although anxious to be honestly affected. Thus Pilate wished to liberate Christ,
but was terrified by the threats of the people, when they denounced against him
the displeasure of Caesar.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:12.) And no wonder, since faith is alone a certain and fixed prop on which we
may lean while fearlessly discharging our duty, and thus overcome all fears. But
when we want confidence, we are, as I have said, sure to be changeable. Hence
Darius, through fear of a conspiracy of his nobles against himself, permitted
Daniel to be an innocent sufferer from their cruelty. Then that false shame is
added which I have mentioned, because he was unwilling to appear without
consideration, by suddenly revoking his own edict, as it was a law with the
Medes and Persians that whatever proceeded from kings was inviolable! Daniel now
states this. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those men
assembled together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>when they saw the
king hesitate and doubt, they became fierce and contentious with him. When it is
said they meet together, this relates to their inspiring him with fear. They
say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know, O
king!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He knew it well enough, and they
need not instruct him in any unknown matter, but they treat him in a threatening
manner. &#8220;What? dost thou not see how utterly the royal name will be
hereafter deprived of its authority if he violates thine edict with impunity?
Will you thus permit yourself to become a laughingstock? Finally, they intimate,
that he would not be king unless he revenged the insult offered him by Daniel in
neglecting his commandment. <i>Know, </i>therefore, O king,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the Persians and
Medes</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; he was himself king of the Medes,
but it is just as if they said, What kind of rumor will be spread through all
thy subject provinces; for thou knowest how far this prevails among the Medes
and Persians &#8212; the king must not change his edict. If, therefore, thou
shouldst set such an example, will not all thy subjects instantly rise against
thee? and wilt thou not be contemptible to them?&#8221; We see, then, how the
satraps rage against their king, and frighten him from any change of counsel.
And they also join the edict with the statute, which the king had resolved upon,
with the view of impressing upon him the necessity of not changing a single
decree which he had often and repeatedly sanctioned. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The king, as we have said, frightened by the
denunciation of the nobles, condemns Daniel to death. And hence we gather the
reward which kings deserve in reference to their pride, when they are compelled
to submit with servility to their flatterers. How was Darius deceived by the
cunning of his nobles! For he thought his authority would be strengthened, by
putting the obedience of all men to this test of refusing all prayer to any god
or man for a whole month. He thought he should become superior to both gods and
men, if all his subjects really manifested obedience of this kind. We now see
how obstinately the nobles rise against him, and denounce ultimate revolt,
unless he obey them. We see that when kings take too much upon themselves, how
they are exposed to infamy, and become the variest slaves of their own servants!
This is common enough with earthly princes; those who possess their influence
and favor applaud them in all things and even adore them; they offer every kind
of flattery which can propitiate their favor; but, meanwhile, what freedom do
their idols enjoy? They do not allow them any authority, nor any intercourse
with the best and most faithful friends, while they are watched by their own
guards. Lastly, if they are compared with the wretches who are confined in the
closest dungeon, not one who is thrust down into the deepest pit, and watched by
three or four guards, is not freer than kings themselves! But, as I have said,
this is God&#8217;s most just vengeance; since, when they cannot contain
themselves in the ordinary rank and station of men, but wish to penetrate the
clouds and become on a level with God, they necessarily become a laughingstock.
Hence they become slaves of all their attendants, and dare not utter anything
with freedom, and are without friends, and are afraid to summon their subjects
to their presence, and to intrust either one or another with their wishes. Thus
slaves rule the kingdoms of the world, because kings assume superiority to
mortals. King Darius is an instance of this when he sent for Daniel, and
commanded him to be thrown into the den of lions; his nobles force this from
him, and he unwillingly obeys them. But we should notice the reason. He had
lately forgotten his own mortality, he had desired to deprive the Almighty of
his sway, and as it were to drag him down from heaven! For if God remains in
heaven, men must pray to him; but Darius forbade any one from even daring to
utter a prayer; hence as far as he could he deprived the Almighty of his power.
Now he is compelled to obey his own subjects, although they exercise an almost
disgraceful tyranny over him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel now adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king said this to him, Thy
God, whom thou servest,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or worshipest,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithfully, he will deliver
thee!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This word may be read in the
optative mood, as we have said. There is no doubt that Darius really wished
this; but it may mean, Thy God whom thou worshipest will deliver thee &#8212; as
if he had said, &#8220;Already I am not my own master, I am here tossed about by
the blast of a tempest; my nobles compel me to this deed against my will; I,
therefore, now resign thee and thy life to God, because it is not in my power to
deliver thee;&#8221; as if this excuse lightened his own crime by transferring
to God the power of preserving Daniel. This reason causes some to praise the
piety of King Darius; but as I confess his clemency and humanity to be manifest
in this speech, so it is clear that he had not a grain of piety when he thus
wished to adorn himself in the spoils of deity! For although the superstitious
do not seriously fear God, yet they are restrained by some dread of him; but he
here wished to reduce the whole divinity to nothing. What sort of piety was
this? The clemency of Darius may therefore be praised, but his sacrilegious
pride can by no means be excused. Then why did he act so humanely towards
Daniel? Because he had found him a faithful servant, and the regard which
rendered him merciful arose from this peculiarity. He would not have manifested
the same disposition towards others. If a hundred or a thousand Jews had been
dragged before his tribunal, he would carelessly have condemned them all because
they had disobeyed the edict! Hence he was obstinately impious and cruel. He
spared Daniel for his own private advantage, and thus embraced him with his
favor; but in praising his humanity, we do not perceive any sign of piety in
him. But he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God whom
thou worshipest, he will deliver thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because, he had formerly known Daniel&#8217;s prophecy concerning the
destruction of the Chaldean monarchy; hence he is convinced, how Israel&#8217;s
God is conscious of all things, and rules everything by his will; yet, in the
meantime, he neither worships him nor suffers others to do so; for as far as he
could he had excluded God from his own rights. In thus attributing to God the
power of delivering him, he does not act cordially; and hence his impiety is the
more detestable, when he deprives God of his rights while he confesses him to be
the true and only one endued with supreme power; and though he is but dust and
ashes, yet he substitutes himself in his place! It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt that God&#8217;s counsel provided
that the nobles should seal the stone with their own rings, and thus close the
mouth of the cave, and render the miracle more illustrious. For when the king
approached on the morrow, the rings were all entire, and the seals all unbroken.
Thus the preservation of this servant of God was manifestly by the aid of heaven
and not by the art of men. Hence we see how boldly the king&#8217;s nobles had
compelled him to perform their pleasure. For he might seem deprived of all royal
power when he delivered up to them a subject dear and faithful to himself, and
ordered him to be thrown into the lions&#8217; den. They are not content with
this compliance of the king; they extort another point from him &#8212; the
closing up of the mouth of the cave; and then they all seal the stone, lest any
one should release Daniel. We see, then, when once liberty has been snatched
away, all is over, especially when any one has become a slave by his own faults,
and has attached himself to the counsels of the ungodly. For, at first, such
slavery will not prevail as to induce a man to do everything which he is
ordered, since he seems to be free; but when he has given himself up to such
slavery as I have described, he is compelled to transgress not once or twice,
but constantly and without ceasing. For example, if any one swerves from his
duty through either the fear of man or flattery, or any other depraved
affection, he will grant various things, not only when asked, but when urgently
compelled. But when he has once submitted to the loss of freedom, he will be
compelled, as I have already said, to consent to the most shameful deeds at the
nod of any one. If any teacher or pastor of the Church should turn from the
right path through the influence of ambition, the author of his declension will
come to him again and say, What! do you dare to refuse me? Did I not obtain from
you, yesterday or the day before, whatever I wished? Thus he will be compelled
to transgress a second time in favor of the person to whom he has joined
himself, and will also be forced to repeat the transgression continually. Thus
princes also, who are not free agents through being under the tyranny of others,
if they permit themselves to be overcome contrary to their conscience, lay aside
all their authority, and are drawn aside in all directions by the will of their
subjects. This example, then, is proposed to us in the case of King Darius, who
after inflicting unjust punishment upon Daniel, adds this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He must be enclosed in the
cave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the stone must be
sealed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; and for what object? &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest the doom should be changed;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">meaning, he did not dare to attempt anything in
Daniel&#8217;s favor. We see, then, how the king submitted to the greatest
disgrace, because his nobles had no confidence in him; they refused to trust him
when he ordered Daniel to be thrown into the lions&#8217; den, but they exacted
a guarantee against his liberation, and would not suffer him to attempt
anything. We thus see how disgracefully they withdrew their confidence from
their king; next they use their authority against him, lest he should dare to
remove the stone which had been sealed, unless he would incur the charge of
falsehood by corrupting the public signatures, and of deception by falsifying
the public documents. Hence this passage admonishes us against prostituting
ourselves in slavery to the lust of men. Let every one serve his nearest
neighbors as far as charity will allow and as custom demands. Meanwhile, no one
ought to permit himself to be turned aside in different directions contrary to
his conscience, because when he loses his free agency, he will be compelled to
endure many affronts and to obey the foulest commands. This we see exemplified
in the case of the panders to the avarice, or ambition, or cruelty of princes;
for when once they are under the power of such men, they are most miserable
victims; they cannot avoid the most extreme necessities, they become wretched
slaves, and call down against themselves, a hundred times over, the anger of
both God and man. It now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel relates the tardy repentance of the king,
because although he was in the greatest grief, yet he did not correct his fault.
And this occurs to many who are not hardened by contempt of God and their own
depravity; they are drawn aside by others, and are dissatisfied with their own
vices, while they still indulge in them. Would that the examples of this evil
were rare in the world! but they occur everywhere before our eyes. Darius
therefore is here proposed to us as intermediate between the ungodly and the
wicked &#8212; the righteous and the holy. The wicked do not hesitate to stir up
the Almighty against them, and after they have dismissed all fears and all
shame, they revel in their own licentiousness. Those who are ruled by the fear
of God, although they sustain hard contests with the flesh, yet impose a check
upon themselves, and bridle their perverse affections. Others are between the
two, as I have said, not yet obstinate in their malice, and not quite satisfied
with their corruption&#8217;s, and still they follow them as if bound to them by
ropes. Such was Darius; for he ought constantly to have repelled the calumny of
his nobles; but when he saw himself so entangled by them, he ought to have
opposed them manfully, and to have reproved them for so abusing their influence
over him; yet he did not act thus, but rather bent before their fury. Meanwhile
he bewails in his palace, and abstains from all food and delicacies. He thus
shews his displeasure at the evil conduct at which he connived. We see then how
ineffectual it is for our own conscience to smite us when we sin, and to cause
us sorrow for our faults; we must go beyond this, so that sorrow may lead us on
to repentance, as also Paul teaches us.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10.) Darius, then, had reduced himself to difficulties; while he
bewails his fault, he does not attempt to correct it. This was, indeed, the
beginning of repentance, but nothing more; and when he feels any compunction,
this stirs him up and allows him neither peace nor comfort. This lesson, then,
we are to learn from Daniel&#8217;s narrative of King Darius passing the whole
of that night in wailing. It follows afterwards, &#8212;</font><br></div>

is not yet angry with his nobles till he sees the servant of God perfectly safe.

<div><font face="Palatino">WANT of time compelled me to break off our last
Lecture at the point where Daniel relates how
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king approached the
cave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now he reports his words, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Daniel, servant of the living
God! thy God whom thou worshipest constantly, has he been able to deliver thee?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">says he. Darius declares the God of Israel to
be the living One. But if there is a living God, he excludes all those imaginary
deities whom men fancy for themselves by their own ingenuity. For it is
necessary that deity should be one, and this principle is acknowledged by even
the profane. However men may be deluded by their dreams, yet they all confess
the impossibility of having more gods than one. They distort, indeed,
God&#8217;s character, but they cannot deny his unity. When Darius uttered this
praise of the God of Israel, he confesses all other deities to be mere fictions;
but he shews how, as I have said, the profane hold the first principle, but
afterwards allow it to escape entirely from their thoughts. This passage does
not prove, as some allege, the real conversion of King Darius, and his sincere
adoption of true piety; for he always worshipped his own idols, but thought it
sufficient if he raised the God of Israel to the highest rank. But, as we know,
God cannot admit a companion, for he is jealous of his own glory.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
42:8.) It was too cold, then, for Darius simply to acknowledge the God whom
Daniel worshipped to be superior to all others; because where God reigns, all
idols must of necessity be reduced to nothing; as also it is said in the Psalms,
Let God reign, and let the gods of all nations fall before him. Darius then
proceeded so far as to devote himself to the true and only God, but was
compelled to pay the greatest respect to Israel&#8217;s God. Meanwhile he always
remained sunk in his own superstitions to which he had been
accustomed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy God, whom thou worshipest
continually, could he free thee from the
lions?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here speaks doubtfully, as
unbelievers do, who seem to have some ground for hope, but no firm or sure
persuasion in their own minds. I suppose this invocation to be natural, since a
certain secret instinct naturally impels men to fly to God; for although
scarcely one in twenty leans upon God&#8217;s word, yet all men call upon God
occasionally. They wish to discover whether God desires to assist them and to
aid them in their necessities; meanwhile, as I have said, there is no firm
persuasion in their hearts, which was the state of the mind of King Darius.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Could God deliver
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he; as if God&#8217;s power
could possibly be doubted! If he had said, Has God delivered thee? this would
have been tolerable. For God was not bound by any law to be always snatching his
people from death, since, we very well know, this rests entirely with his good
pleasure. When, therefore, he permits his people to suffer under the lusts of
the impious, his power is by no means diminished, since their liberation depends
upon his mere will and pleasure. His power, therefore, ought by no means to be
called in question. We observe, that Darius was never truly converted, and never
distinctly acknowledged the true and only God, but was seized with a blind fear,
which, whether he would or not, compelled him to attribute the supreme honor to
Israel&#8217;s God. And this was not an ingenuous confession, but was rather
extorted from him. It now follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel answers the king moderately and softly,
although he had been cast into the cave by his command. He might have deservedly
been angry and expostulated with him, because he had been so impiously deserted
by him, for King Darius had found him a faithful servant, and had used his
services for his own advantage. When he saw himself oppressed by unjust
calumnies, the king did not take his part so heartily as he ought; and at
length, being overcome by the threats of his nobles, he ordered Daniel to be
cast into the pit. Daniel might, as I have said, have complained of the
king&#8217;s cruelty and perfidy. He does not do this, but is silent concerning
this injury, because his deliverance would sufficiently magnify the glory of
God. The holy Prophet desired nothing else, except the king&#8217;s welfare,
which he prays for. Although he uses the ordinary phrase, yet he speaks from his
heart, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O king, live
for ever!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, may God protect thy
life and bless thee perpetually. Many salute their kings and even their friends
in this way through mere form; but there is no doubt that Daniel heartily wished
the king the enjoyment of long life and happiness. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent his angel, and shut the
lions&#8217; mouths!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Thus we see that
Daniel openly assigns to angels the duty of rendering assistance, while the
whole power remains in the hands of God himself. He says, therefore, that he was
freed by the hand and assistance of an angel, but shews how the angel was the
agent and not the author of his safety.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent his
angel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have often seen how
indistinctly the Chaldeans spoke when mentioning the Deity; they called their
deities holy, but Daniel here ascribes the entire glory to God alone. He does
not bring forward a multitude of deities according to the prevalent opinion
among the profane. He puts prominently forward the unity of God; and then he
adds the presence of angels as assisting God&#8217;s servants, shewing how they
perform whatever is enjoined upon them. Thus the whole praise of their salvation
remains with the one God, since angels do not assist whomsoever they please, and
are not moved by their own will, but solely in obedience to God&#8217;s
commands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now notice what follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God had shut the lions&#8217;
mouths</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For by these words the Prophet
shews how lions and the most cruel beasts are in the hands of God, and are
restrained by his secret curb, so that they can neither rage nor commit any
injury unless by God&#8217;s permission. We may thus learn that savage beasts
are only so far injurious to us as God may permit them to humble our pride.
Meanwhile, we may perceive that no beast is so cruel as to injure us by either
his claws or his teeth, unless God give him the reins. And this instruction is
worthy of especial notice, since we tremble at the least danger, even at the
noise of a falling leaf. As we are necessarily exposed to many dangers on all
sides, and surrounded by various forms of death, hence we should be harassed by
wretched anxiety unless this principle supported us; not only is our life under
God&#8217;s protection, but nothing can injure us while he directs everything by
his will and pleasure. And this principle ought to be extended to the devils
themselves, and to impious and wicked men, for we know the devil to be always
anxious to destroy us, like a roaring lion, for he prowls about seeking whom he
may devour, as Peter says in his First Epistle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:8.) For we see how all the impious plot for our destruction continually,
and how madly they are inflamed against us. But God, who can close the
lion&#8217;s mouth, will also both restrain the devil and all the wicked from
hurting any one without his permission. Experience also shews us how the devil
and all the impious are controlled by him, for we should perish every moment
unless he warded off by his opposing influence the numberless evils which ever
hang over us. We ought to perceive how the singular protection of God preserves
us in daily safety amidst the ferocity and madness of our foes. Daniel says he
suffered no loss of any kind,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because before God his
righteousness was found in him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These
words signify that his preservation arose from God wishing to vindicate his own
glory and worship which he had commanded in his law. The Prophet does not here
boast in his own righteousness, but rather shews how his deliverance arose from
God&#8217;s wishing to testify by a certain and clear proof his approval of that
worship for which Daniel had contended even to death. We see, then, how Daniel
refers all things to the approval of the worship of God. The conclusion is, he
was the advocate of a pious and holy cause, and prepared to undergo death, not
for any foolish imagination, nor by any rash impulse, nor any blind zeal, but
because he was assured of his being a worshipper of the one God. His being the
defender of the cause of piety and holiness was, as he asserts, the reason of
his preservation. This is the correct conclusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we readily gather the folly of the Papists who,
from this and similar passages, endeavor to establish the merit and
righteousness of good works. Oh! Daniel was preserved because righteousness was
found in him before God; hence God repays every man according to the merits of
his works! But we must first consider Daniel&#8217;s intention in the narrative
before us; for, as I have said, he does not boast in his own merits, but wishes
his preservation to be ascribed to the Deity as a testimony to his true and pure
worship, so as to shame King Darius, and to shew all his superstitions to be
impious, and especially, to admonish him concerning that sacrilegious edict by
which he arrogated to himself the supreme command, and, as far as he could,
abolished the very existence of God. With the view, then, of admonishing Darius,
the Prophet says his cause was just. And to render the solution of the
difficulty more easy, we must remark the difference between eternal salvation
and special deliverance&#8217;s. God frees us from eternal death, and adopts us
into the hope of eternal life, not because he finds any righteousness in us but
through his own gratuitous choice, and he perfects in us his own work without
any respect to our works. With reference to our eternal salvation, our
righteousness is by no means regarded, because whenever God examines us, he only
finds materials for condemnation. But when we consider particular
deliverance&#8217;s, he may then notice our righteousness, not as if it were
naturally ours, but he stretches forth his hand to those whom he governs by his
Spirit and urges to obey his call; and if they incur any danger in their efforts
to obey his will, he delivers them. The meaning then is exactly the same as if
any one should assert that God favors righteous causes, but it has nothing to do
with merits. Hence the Papists trifle, like children, when they use this passage
to elicit from it human merits; for Daniel wished to assert nothing but the pure
worship of God, as if he had said, not only his reason proceeded from God, but
there was another cause for his deliverance, namely, the wish of the Almighty to
shew the world experimentally the justice of his cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And even before
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> O king,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have committed nothing
wrong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is clear that the Prophet had
violated the king&#8217;s edict. Why, then, does he not ingenuously confess
this? Nay, why does he contend that he has not transgressed against the king?
Because he conducted himself with fidelity in all his duties, he could free
himself from every calumny by which he knew himself oppressed, as if he had
despised the king&#8217;s sovereignty. But Daniel was not so bound to the king
of the Persians when he claimed for himself as a god what ought not to be
offered to him. We know how earthly empires are constituted by God, only on the
condition that he deprives himself of nothing, but shines forth alone, and all
magistrates must be set in regular order, and every authority in existence must
be subject to his glory. Since, therefore, Daniel could not obey the
king&#8217;s edict without denying God, as we have previously seen, he did not
transgress against the king by constantly persevering in that exercise of piety
to which he had been accustomed, and by calling on his God three times a-day. To
make this the more evident, we must remember that passage of
Peter,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Fear God, honor
the king.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Peter 2:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The two commands are connected together, and cannot
be separated from one another. The fear of God ought to precede, that kings may
obtain their authority. For if any one begins his reverence of an earthly prince
by rejecting that of God, he will act preposterously, since this is a complete
perversion of the order of nature. Then let God be feared in the first place,
and earthly princes will obtain their authority, if only God shines forth, as I
have already said. Daniel, therefore, here defends himself with justice, since
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he had not committed any crime
against the king;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he was compelled
to obey the command of God, and he neglected what the king had ordered in
opposition to it. For earthly princes lay aside all their power when they rise
up against God, and are unworthy of being reckoned in the number of mankind. We
ought rather utterly to defy than to obey them whenever they are so restive and
wish to spoil God of his rights, and, as it were, to seize upon his throne and
draw him down from heaven. Now, therefore, we understand the sense of this
passage. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

palace, had abstained from food and drink, and had laid aside all pleasures and
delights, so also he rejoiced in hearing of the wonderful deliverance from death
of God&#8217;s holy servant. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And by the king&#8217;s command
Daniel was drawn out of the cave, and no corruption was found in
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This cannot be ascribed to good
fortune. Hence God made his power conspicuous in providing for Daniel&#8217;s
safety from the grasp of the lions. He would have been torn to pieces had not
God closed their mouths; and this contributes in no slight degree to magnify the
miracle, since no scratch or touch was found upon his body. As the lions then
spared him, it arose from God&#8217;s secret counsel; and he marked this more
clearly, when his calumniators were thrown into the cave, and were immediately
torn by the lions, as he will soon add. But we must notice the reason which is
given: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was preserved, since he
trusted in his God! It</i></font><font face="Palatino"> will often happen, that
a person may have a good cause, and yet succeed badly and unhappily; because he
adds to what is otherwise worthy of praise, too great a confidence in his own
counsels, prudence, and industry. Hence it is not surprising if those who
undertake good causes often fail of success, as we often see among the profane.
For the history of all ages bears witness, to the perishing of those who cherish
a just cause; but this arises through their perverse confidence, since they
never contemplated the service of God, but rather considered their own praise
and the applause of the world. Hence, as ambition seized them, they became
pleased with their own plans. Thus arose that saying of Brutus, &#8220;Virtue is
a frivolous thing!&#8221; because he thought himself unworthily treated in
fighting for the liberty of Rome, while the gods were adverse instead of
propitious. As if God ought to have conferred upon him that aid which he had
never hoped and never sought. For we know the pride of that hero&#8217;s
disposition. I bring forward but one example; but if we diligently weigh the
motives which impel the profane when they fight strenuously for good objects, we
shall find ambition to be the prevailing motive. No wonder then if God deserted
them in this particular, since they were unworthy of experiencing his help. For
this reason Daniel states, that he was safely preserved,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he trusted in his
God.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle refers to this in the eleventh chapter of
the Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:33,) where he says some were snatched away or preserved from the mouths of
lions through faith. Hence he assigns the cause of Daniel&#8217;s escaping in
safety, and recalls us to faith. But we must here consider the meaning and force
of the word &#8220;believing.&#8221; For the Prophet does not simply speak of
his deliverance as springing from believing Israel&#8217;s God to be the true
and only God, the Maker of heaven and earth, but from his committing his life to
him, from his reposing on his grace, from his fixed determination that his end
must be happy, if he worshipped him. Since, therefore, Daniel was certainly
persuaded that his life was in God&#8217;s hand, and that his hope in him was
not in vain, he boldly incurred danger, and intrepidly suffered for the sincere
worship of God; hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
believed in God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see then that the
word &#8220;belief&#8221; is not taken coldly, as the Papists dream, since their
notion implies an unfolded or dead and shapeless faith, for they think faith
nothing else but a confused apprehension of the Deity. Whenever men have any
conception of God at all, the Papists think this to be faith; but the Holy
Spirit teaches us far otherwise. For we must consider the language of the
Apostle, &#8212; We do not properly believe in God, unless we determine him to
be a rewarder of all who diligently seek him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:6.) God is not sought by foolish arrogance, as if by our merits we could
confer an obligation upon him; but he is sought by faith, by humility, and by
invocation. But when we are persuaded that God is the rewarder of all who seek
him, and we know how he ought to be sought, this is true faith. So Daniel did
not doubt that God would deliver him, because he did not distrust that teaching
of piety which he had learnt from a boy, and through reliance on which he had
always called upon God. This, therefore, was the cause of his deliverance.
Meanwhile, it is clear that Daniel&#8217;s trust in God did not spring from any
previous instruction concerning the result; for he rather committed his life to
God, since he was prepared for death. Therefore Daniel could not acknowledge
this before he was cast into the cave, and exposed to the lions, being ignorant
whether God would deliver him, as we previously saw in the case of his
companions, &#8220;God, if he pleases, will deliver us; but if not, we are
prepared to worship Him, and to disobey thy edict.&#8221; If Daniel had been
taught the issue beforehand, his constancy would not have deserved much praise;
but since he was willing to meet death fearlessly for the worship of God, and
could deny himself and renounce the world, this is a true and serious proof of
his faith and constancy. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
believed therefore in God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not because
he hoped for such a miracle, but because he knew his own happiness to consist in
persisting in the true worship of God. So Paul says, Christ is gain to me, both
in life and in death.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:21.) Daniel therefore rested in the help of God, but he closed his eyes to the
event, and was not remarkably anxious concerning his life, but since his mind
was erected towards the hope of a better life, even if he had to die a hundred
times, yet he never would have failed in his confidence, because our faith is
extended beyond the boundaries of this frail and corruptible life, as all the
pious know well enough. What I have already touched upon afterwards follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">By this circumstance God&#8217;s virtue shone forth
more clearly  in preserving Daniel, because those who had accused him were
immediately destroyed by the lions. For if any one should say that the lions
were satisfied, or there was any other reason why Daniel was not destroyed, why,
when he was withdrawn, did such great madness immediately impel those beasts to
tear and devour, not one man only, but a great multitude? Not one of the nobles
was preserved; next their wives and children were added. Lions scarcely ever
proceed to such a pitch of savageness, and yet they all perished to a man; then
how did Daniel escape? We surely see how God by this comparison wished to bear
witness to his own virtue, lest any one should object that Daniel was left by
the lions because they were already gorged, and desired no other prey, for they
would have been content with either three or four men; but they devoured men,
women, and children. Hence the mouths of the lions were clearly restrained by
the divine power, since Daniel was safe during a whole night, but they perished
immediately, as soon as they were cast into the cave; because we again see how
these beasts were impelled by sudden madness, so that they did not wait till
their prey arrived at the bottom, but devoured them as they fell. We shall leave
the rest till to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
THIRTY-FIRST.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">AT the end of yesterday&#8217;s Lecture, the enemies
of Daniel who had malignantly, enviously, and cruelly slandered him, were cast
into the lions&#8217; den, and were torn to pieces with their wives and
children; and thus the miracle was more clearly conspicuous, as we have
previously said. Here, again, we may learn how lions are governed by God&#8217;s
hand, and are restrained from shewing their ferocity everywhere and against
every one, except when God permits them. As it is said in the ninety-first
Psalm, Thou shalt walk upon the lion and the basilisk, and tread upon the lion
and the dragon;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
91:13.) So also, on the other hand, God denounces against the unbelievers by the
Prophet Amos,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;300519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:19,) The lions shall come to meet them, if they go forth from their houses. We
see, then, how God restrains the cruelty of lions as often as he pleases, and
how he excites them to madness when he wishes to punish mankind. With regard to
their wives and children being also cast into the den, we need not dispute with
any anxiety, whether or not this punishment was just. For it seems to be a sure
rule of equity, that punishment should not pass on to the innocent, especially
when it involves their life. In all ages, it has been the custom of well-ordered
States, for many punishments to be inflicted on children as well as their
parents, as in a public sale of goods, or any charge of violence or treason; in
criminal cases also, the infamy of parents extends to the children, (but this is
far more severe, to slay children with their parents,) though they cannot
possibly be guilty of the same crime. Yet, although this is not one of the
customary cases, we must not hastily condemn it as unjust. We see how God orders
whole families to be exterminated from the world as a mark of his hatred; but,
as a just Judge, he always is moderate in his severity. This example, then,
cannot be precisely condemned, but we had better leave it in doubt. We are aware
of the cruel and barbarous manner in which the kings of the East exercise their
sway, or rather their tyranny, on their subjects. Hence there is no reason why
any one should fatigue himself with the question, since King Darius was so much
grieved at his being deceived. Hence he not only exacted punishment from these
wicked slanderers for oppressing Daniel, but because he was himself affected by
their injustice. He wished rather to avenge himself than Daniel; he was not
content with retaliation, but condemned their children also to destruction. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Daniel adds the king&#8217;s edict, which he
wished to be promulgated. And by this edict he bore witness that he was so moved
by the deliverance of Daniel, as to attribute the supreme glory to the God of
Israel. Meanwhile, I do not think this a proof of the king&#8217;s real piety,
as some interpreters here extol King Darius without moderation, as if he had
really repented and embraced the pure worship prescribed by the law of Moses.
Nothing of this kind can be collected from the words of the edict &#8212; and
this circumstance shews it &#8212; for his empire was never purged from its
superstitions. King Darius still allowed his subjects to worship idols; and he
did not refrain from polluting himself with such defilement&#8217;s; but he
wished to place the God of Israel on the highest elevation, thus attempting to
mingle fire and water! We have previously discussed this point. For the profane
think they discharge their duty to the true God, if they do not openly despise
him, but assign him some place or other; and, especially, if they prefer him to
all idols, they think they have satisfied God. But this is all futile; for
unless they abolish all superstitions, God by no means obtains his right, since
he allows of no equals. Hence this passage by no means proves any true and
serious piety in King Darius; but it implies simply his being deeply moved by
the miracle, and his celebrating through all the regions subject to him the name
and glory of the God of Israel. Finally, as this was a special impulse on King
Darius, so it did not proceed beyond a particular effect; he acknowledged
God&#8217;s power and goodness on all sides; but he seized upon that specimen
which was placed directly before his eyes. Hence he did not continue to
acknowledge the God of Israel by devoting himself to true and sincere piety;
but, as I have said, he wished him to be conspicuously superior to other gods,
but not to be the only God. But God rejects this modified worship; and thus
there is no reason for praising King Darius. Meanwhile his example will condemn
all those who profess themselves to be catholic or Christian kings, or defenders
of the faith, since they not only bury true piety, but, as far as they possibly
can, weaken the whole worship of God, and would willingly extinguish his name
from the world, and thus tyrannize over the pious, and establish impious
superstitions by their own cruelty. Darius will be a fit judge for them, and the
edict here recited by Daniel will be sufficient for the condemnation of them
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The edict was written for all
people, nations, and tongues, who dwell in the whole
earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see how Darius wished to make
known God&#8217;s power not only to the neighboring people, but studied to
promulgate it far and wide. He wrote not only for Asia and Chaldea, but also for
the Medes and Persians. He had never been the ruler of Persia, yet since his
father-in-law had received him into alliance in the empire, his authority
extended thither. This is the sense of the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This does not refer to the whole
habitable world, but to that monarchy which extended through almost the entire
East, since the Medes and Persians then held the sway from the sea as far as
Egypt. When we consider the magnitude of this empire, Daniel may well say, the
edict was promulgated </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the
whole earth. Peace be multiplied unto you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>!
</i>We know how kings in this way soothe their subjects, and use soft
persuasions for more easily accomplishing their wishes, and thus obtain the
implicit obedience of their subjects. And it is gratuitous on their part to
implore peace on their subjects. Meanwhile, as I have already said, they court
their favor by these enticements, and thus prepare their subjects to submit to
the yoke. By the term &#8220;peace,&#8221; a state of prosperity is implied;
meaning, may you be prosperous and happy. He afterwards
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, the decree is placed in
their sight,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, they display their
command before all their subjects. This, then, is the force of the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my edict has been
placed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, if my authority and
power prevail with you, you must thus far obey me; <i>that all may fear, </i>or,
that all may be afraid and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tremble before the God of
Daniel!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By fear and terror he means
simply reverence, but he speaks as the profane are accustomed to do, who abhor
God&#8217;s name. He seems desirous of expressing how conspicuous was the power
of the God of Israel, which ought properly to impress every one, and induce all
to worship with reverence, and fear, and trembling. And this method of speaking
is derived from a correct principle; since lawful worship is never offered to
God but when we are humbled before him. Hence God often calls himself terrible,
not because he wishes his worshippers to approach him with fear, but, as we have
said, because the souls of men will never be drawn forth to reverence unless
they seriously comprehend his power, and thus become afraid of his judgment. But
if fear alone flourishes in men&#8217;s minds, they cannot form themselves to
piety, since we must consider that passage of the Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;With thee is
propitiation that thou mayest be
feared.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
130:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God, therefore, cannot be properly worshipped and
feared, unless we are persuaded that he may be entreated; nay, are quite sure
that he is propitious to us. Yet it is necessary for fear and dread to precede
the humiliation of the pride of the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is the meaning of the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all should fear or be afraid
of the God of Daniel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The king calls him
so, not because Daniel had fabricated a God for himself, but because he was his
only worshipper. We very properly speak of Jupiter as the god of the Greeks,
since he was deified by their folly, and hence obtained a name and a celebrity
throughout the rest of the world. Meanwhile, Jupiter, and Minerva, and the crowd
of false deities received their names from the same origin. There is another
reason why King Darius calls the God whom Daniel worshipped
<i>Daniel</i>&#8217;<i>s God, </i>as he is called the God of Abraham, not
through deriving any precarious authority from Abraham, but through his
manifesting himself to Abraham. To explain this more clearly &#8212; Why is he
called the God of Daniel rather than of the Babylonians? because Daniel had
learnt from the law of Moses the pure worship of God, and the covenant which he
had made with Abraham and the holy fathers, and the adoption of Israel as his
peculiar people. He complied with the worship prescribed in the Law, and that
worship depended on the covenant. Hence this name is not given as if Daniel had
been free to fashion or imagine any god for himself; but because he had
worshipped that God who had revealed himself by his word. Lastly, this phrase
ought to be so understood as to induce all to fear that God who had made a
covenant with Abraham and his posterity, and had chosen for himself a peculiar
people. He taught the method of true and lawful worship, and unfolded it in his
law, so that Daniel worshipped him. We now understand the meaning of the clause.
Thus we may learn to distinguish the true God from all the idols and fictions of
men, if we desire to worship him acceptably. For many think they worship God
when they wander through whatever errors they please, and never remain attached
to one true God. But this is perverse, nay, it is nothing but a profanation of
true piety to worship God so confusedly. Hence, we must contemplate the
distinction which I have pointed out, that our minds may be always included
within the bounds of the word, and not wander from the true God, if indeed we
desire to retain him and to follow the religion which pleases him. We must
continue, I say, within the limits of the word, and not turn away on either one
side or the other; since numberless fallacies of the devil will meet us
immediately, unless the word holds us in strict obedience. As far as concerns
Darius, he acknowledged the one true God, but as we have already said, he did
not reject that fictitious and perverse worship in which he was brought up;
&#8212; such a mixture is intolerable before God!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he is alive, and remains
for ever! </i></font><font face="Palatino">This seems to reduce all false gods
to nothing; but it has been previously said, and the circumstances prove it
true, that when the profane turn their attention to the supreme God, they begin
to wander directly. If they constantly acknowledged the true God, they would
instantly exclude all fictitious ones; but they think it sufficient if God
obtains the first rank; meanwhile they add minor deities, so that he lies hid in
a crowd, although he enjoys a slight pre-eminence. Such, then, was the reasoning
and the plan of Darius, because he held nothing clearly or sincerely concerning
the essence of the one true God; but he thought the supreme power resident in
the God of Israel, just as other nations worship their own deities! We see,
then, that he did not depart from the superstitions which he had imbibed in his
boyhood; and hence, we have no reason for praising his piety, unless in this
particular case. But, meanwhile, God extorted a confession from him, in which he
describes his nature to us. He calls him &#8220;the living God,&#8221; not only
because he has life in himself, but out of himself, and is also the origin and
fountain of life. This epithet ought to be taken actively, for God not only
lives but has life in himself; and he is also the source of life, since there is
no life independent of him. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He remains for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and thus distinguishes him from
all creatures, in which there is no firmness nor stability. We know also how
everything in heaven, as well as heaven itself, is subject to various changes.
In this, therefore, God differs from everything created, since he is
unchangeable and invariable. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His kingdom is not corrupted, and
his dominion remains for ever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he
clearly expresses what he had formerly stated respecting the firmness of
God&#8217;s estate, since he not only remains essentially the same, but
exercises his power throughout the whole world, and governs the world by his own
virtue, and sustains all things. For if he had only said, &#8220;God remains for
ever,&#8221; we are so perverse and narrow-minded as to interpret it merely as
follows: &#8212; God, indeed, is not changeable in his own essence, but our
minds could not comprehend his power as universally diffused. This explanation,
then, is worthy of notice, since Darius clearly expresses that God&#8217;s
kingdom is incorruptible and his dominion everlasting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Secondly, </i>he calls God his deliverer. Those
who consider this edict as an illustrious example of piety, will say Darius
spoke evangelically as a herald of the mercy of God. But, as we have previously
said, Darius never generally embraced what Scripture teaches concerning
God&#8217;s cherishing his people with clemency, his helping them through his
being merciful to them, and nourishing them with a father&#8217;s kindness. King
Darius knew nothing of this reason. Daniel&#8217;s deliverance was well known;
this was a particular proof of God&#8217;s favor. If Darius had only partially
perceived God&#8217;s loving-kindness towards his servants, then he would have
acknowledged his readiness to preserve and deliver them. This would be too
frigid unless the cause was added, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is a
deliverer!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>since he has deigned to
choose his servants, and bears witness to his being their Father, and listens to
their prayers, and pardons their transgressions. Unless, therefore, the hope of
deliverance is founded on God&#8217;s gratuitous adoption and pity, any
acknowledgment of him will be but partial and inefficient. Darius, then, does
not speak here as if truly and purely instructed in the mercy of God; but he
speaks of him only as the deliverer of his own people. He correctly asserts in
general, &#8220;God is a deliverer,&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>since he snatched Daniel from the
mouth of lions,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, from their
power and fierceness. Darius, I say, reasons correctly, when he derives from one
example the more extensive doctrine concerning the power of God to preserve and
snatch away his people whenever he pleases; meanwhile, he acknowledges
God&#8217;s visible power in a single act, but he does not understand the
principal cause and fountain of God&#8217;s affection to Daniel to be, his
belonging to the sons of Abraham, and his paternal favor in preserving him.
Hence this instruction should profit us and touch our minds effectually, since
God is our deliverer; and, in the first place, we must confess ourselves to be
admitted to favor on the condition of his pardoning us, and not treating us
according to our deserts, but indulging us as sons through his amazing
liberality. This then is the true sense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he performs signs and wonders in
heaven and earth!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This ought to be
referred to power and dominion, as previously mentioned; but Darius always
considers the events before his eyes. He had seen Daniel dwelling safely with
lions, and all the rest destroyed by them; these were manifest proofs of
God&#8217;s power; hence he properly asserts,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he performs signs and
wonders.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But there is no doubt, that
Darius was admonished by the other signs which had taken place before he
possessed the monarchy; he had doubtless heard what had happened to King
Nebuchadnezzar, and then to King Belshazzar, whom Darius had slain when he
seized his kingdom. He collects, therefore, more testimonies to God&#8217;s
power, for the purpose of illustrating his glory in the preservation of Daniel.
In short, if Darius had renounced his superstitions, the confession of his piety
would have been pure, and full, and ingenuous; but because he did not forsake
the worship of his false gods, and continued his attachment to their pollution,
his piety cannot deserve our praise, and his true and serious conversion cannot
be collected from his edict. This is the complete sense. It now
follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jlx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tzelech, </i>properly signifies to &#8220;pass over,&#8221; and the
signification is here metaphorical, in the sense of being prosperous. There is
no doubt, however, of there being a silent contrast between the kingdom of the
Persians and the Chaldean monarchy, that is, to speak more concisely and
clearly, between the twofold condition of Daniel. For, as we have said, he was
for some time in obscurity under Nebuchadnezzar; when this monarchy was about to
perish he became conspicuous; and throughout the whole period of the reign of
the Chaldeans he was obscure and contemptible. All indeed had heard of him as a
remarkable and illustrious Prophet, but he was rejected from the palace. At one
time he was seated at the king&#8217;s gate, in great honor and respect, and
then again he was cast out. During the continuance of the Chaldee monarchy,
Daniel was not held in any esteem; but under that of the Medes and Persians he
prospered, and was uniformly treated with marked respect, for Cyrus and Darius
were not so negligent as instantly to forget the wonderful works of God
performed by his hand. Hence the word &#8220;passing through,&#8221; pleases me,
since, as I have said, it is a mark of the continual possession of honor; for
not only King Darius, but also Cyrus exalted him and raised him into the number
of his nobles, when he heard of his favor. It is clear that he left Babylon and
went elsewhere. Very probably he was not long among the Medes, for Darius or
Cyaxares died without any heirs, and then his whole power passed to Cyrus alone,
who was his nephew, through his sister, and his son-in-law being his
daughter&#8217;s husband. No doubt, Daniel here commends God&#8217;s favor and
kindness towards himself, because this was not the usual solace of exile, to
obtain the highest favor among foreign and barbarous nations, or attain the
largest share of their honor and reverence. God, therefore, alleviated his
sorrow by this consolation in his exile. Hence Daniel here not only regards
himself in his private capacity, but also the object of his dignity. For God
wished his name to be spread abroad and celebrated over all those regions
through which Daniel was known, since no one could behold without remembering
the power and glory of Israel&#8217;s God. Daniel, therefore, wished to mark
this. On the other hand also, no doubt, it was a matter of grief to him to be
deprived of his country, not like the rest of mankind, but because the land of
Canaan was the peculiar inheritance of God&#8217;s people. When Daniel was
snatched away and led off to a distance, as far as Media and Persia, without the
slightest hope of return, there is no doubt that he suffered continual distress.
Nor was the splendor of his station among the profane of such importance as to
induce him to prefer it to that pledge of God&#8217;s favor and paternal
adoption in the land of Canaan. He had doubtless inscribed on his heart that
passage of David&#8217;s,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I had rather be in the court of
the Lord, than in the midst of the greatest riches of the ungodly: then, I had
rather be a despised one in the house of God, than to dwell in the tents of the
unrighteous.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
84:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus Daniel had been taught. Ezekiel, too, properly
includes him among the three most holy men who have lived since the beginning of
the world.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
14:14.) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f322</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This was of the greatest moment; for when he was a youth, or at least but middle
aged, he was joined with Job and Noah, and was the third in rare and almost
incredible sanctity! Since this was his character, he was no doubt affected with
the greatest sorrow when he perceived himself subject to perpetual exile,
without the slightest hope of return, and of being able to worship God in his
temple and to offer sacrifice with the rest. But lest he should be ungrateful to
God, he desires to express his sense of the uncommon benevolence with which,
though an exile and a stranger, and subject to reproach among other captives, he
was treated and even honored among the Medes and Persians. This, therefore, is
the simple meaning of the passage. It is quite clear, as I have lately said,
that Cyrus, after the death of Darius, succeeded to the whole monarchy; and we
shall afterwards see in its proper place how Daniel dwelt with Cyrus, who
reigned almost thirty years longer. Thus, a long time intervened between his
death and that of Darius. This, therefore, did not occur without the remarkable
counsel of God, since the change in the kingdom did not influence the position
of Daniel, as it usually does. For new empires we know to be like turning the
world upside down. But Daniel always retained his rank, and thus God&#8217;s
goodness was displayed in him, and wherever he went he carried with him this
testimony of God&#8217;s favor. I shall not proceed further, as we shall discuss
a new prophecy to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>THE THIRD YEAR OF KING

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>DANIEL
1:1</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A CORRECT idea of the scope and interpretation of
these prophecies cannot be obtained without a due attention to the chronology of
the events recorded. Hence, throughout these Dissertations it will be necessary
to discuss some apparently unimportant points, and to combat some seemingly
harmless opinions. We are thus compelled to enter into details which some may
pronounce devoid of interest, but which will prove worth the labor bestowed upon
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The necessity for comment on this first verse arises
from the difficulty of reconciling its statement with the twenty-fifth chapter
of Jeremiah. The relation of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar must be harmonized with
those of the three last kings of Judah, to enable us to reconcile Daniel and
Jeremiah. We must first ascertain the historical events which concern Jehoiakim,
and fix their dates by comparing the Books of Kings and Chronicles, and the
various allusions to him in Ezekiel and other prophets. Next, we must accurately
define the events of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign; and afterwards so compare
them as to draw a correct inference from the whole, notwithstanding much
apparent discrepancy. This has been done by some commentators, the results of
whose labors will here, be placed before the reader. WILLET&#8217;S remark on
Calvin is worthy of notice: &#8220;Calvin thinketh to dissolve this knot by the
distinction of Nebuchadnezzar the father, and Nebuchadnezzar the son; that in
one place the one is spoken of, and the other in the other, but the question is
not concerning the year of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign, but the year of
Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign wherein Jerusalem should be besieged; so that the doubt
remaineth still.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f323</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He also answers Calvin&#8217;s solution, by referring Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s
second year not to the period of his reign, but &#8220;rather to the time of
Daniel&#8217;s ministry and employment with the king, that in the second year of
his service he expounded the king&#8217;s dream.&#8221; Many learned Jews are of
opinion that the last year of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign is intended, meaning the
last of his independent sovereignty, since they treat him in former years as
simply a tributary king to either the Egyptians or Babylonians. Josephus in his
<i>Antiq., </i>(Book 10:6,) is supposed to favor this theory; for he places
Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s attack in the eighth year of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign, and
does not allude to any previous one. WINTLE, however, does not consider that the
words of Josephus justify this inference, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f324</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and suggests that the difference in the methods used by the Jews and Babylonians
in computing their years, may tend to obviate the inconsistency. WINTLE suggests
some reasons for dating the commencement of the seventy years&#8217; captivity
from the completion of the siege in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, when Daniel
and his associates were among the first captives. <i>Prideaux </i>supposes this
event to have occurred six hundred and six years A.C., or the one hundred and
forty-second year of Nabonassar&#8217;s era; <i>Vignoles </i>and <i>Blair
</i>fix the year following. <i>Wintle </i>agrees with the latter date, supposing
the captivity not to continue during seventy solar years, and fixing their
termination about 536 A.C.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another commentator, who has paid great attention to
chronology, deserves special notice, since he advocates a new theory respecting
Cyrus and Nebuchadnezzar, which is worthy of remark, though it has been severely
criticized. THE DUKE OF MANCHESTER has an elaborate chapter on this date, from
which we shall extract the conclusions at which he has arrived. He understands
&#8220;Daniel to speak of Jehoiakim&#8217;s independent reign, reckoning from
the time that he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jehoiakim was taken captive in the seventh of Nebuchadnezzar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The oldest expositors felt the difficulty of the
passage. <i>Rabbi Solomon Jarchi </i>asks, &#8220;How can this be said?&#8221;
and then replies as follows: &#8212; This was the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar
and the third of Jehoiakim&#8217;s rebellion against him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">HENGSTENBERG has not been forgetful to defend our
Prophet from the charge of historical inaccuracy, to which this verse has given
rise. He treats the assumption, that Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem before his
accession to the throne, as inadmissible. &#8220;The assertion of his being
associated by his father in the co-regency at that time is not adequately
sustained.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
CH. B. MICHAELIS and BERTHOLDT have made various attempts to reconcile the
discrepancy. &#8220;The assumption,&#8221; says Hengstenberg, &#8220;that
Nebuchadnezzar undertook his first expedition in the eighth year of Jehoiakim,
is an hypothesis grounded merely on one passage.&#8221; Still, this passage, far
from containing an error, affords a striking proof of the writer&#8217;s
historical knowledge. <i>Berosus, </i>as quoted by <i>Josephus,
</i>(<i>Arch.</i> 10:11, 1,)narrates the victory of Nebuchadnezzar at
Carchemish, which occurred about the close of Jehoiakim&#8217;s third year.
Carchemish was a city on the banks of the Euphrates, taken by Pharaoh-Necho
about three years previously. Immediately after this victory, the conqueror
marched against Jerusalem and took it. The process by which Hengstenberg arrives
at this result, the various authors whom he quotes, and the complete refutation
which he supplies of all the conjectures of his Neologian opponents, will be
found amply detailed in the valuable work already quoted. ROSENMULLER also
discusses the point, but leans too much to those writers whom Hengstenberg
refutes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">DISSERTATION

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>NEBUCHADNEZZAR &#8212; ONE KING OR
TWO?</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Chapter
1:1</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE difficulty of reconciling the various statements
of Scripture with themselves and with profane history, has raised the question
whether there were two Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s or only one. The DUKE OF
MANCHESTER is a strenuous advocate for the former hypothesis, and his view of
the case is worthy of perusal. The first king he supposes to have overthrown
<i>Necho</i>&#8217;<i>s </i>army in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as we have
already stated. He came from the north into Judea, and took the people captive
after the overthrow of Assyria. His eleventh year corresponds with the fourth of
Zedekiah, while he reigned on the whole about twenty-nine years. He is to be
identified with Cyrus, the father of Cambyses, well known in Persian history, so
that the second Nebuchadnezzar was Cambyses himself. Although the astronomical
Canon of Ptolemy is a formidable adversary, this writer shews much ingenuity in
bending it to his purpose. The first king of this name began his reign A.C. 511,
while Paulus Orosius determines the taking of Babylon &#8220;by Cyrus&#8221;
about the time of the expulsion of the kings from Rome (A.C. 510.) Thus
sixty-nine years elapsed between the overthrow of Necho and the conquest of
Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar the second; and in the eighteenth year of the reign of
this latter king the golden image was set up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having identified the second king with Cambyses, this
writer brings forward many testimonies in favor of his being a Persian, and
shews that the Chaldeans were not Babylonians but Persians. He treats him as
identical with the Persian Jemsheed, the contemporary of Pythagoras and Thales,
and the founder of Pasargad&aelig; and Persepolis, and justifies his positions
by the authorities of Diocles, Hecataeus, Cedrenus, the Maccabees, Abydenus, and
Alexander Polyhistor. &#8220;The evidence is deduced from direct testimony, from
geographical position, from similarity in language and religion, in manners and
customs, in personal character and alliances; from Babylonian bricks and
cylinders; as also from historical synchronism&#8217;s and identity of
actions.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f327</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The statements of Herodotus are fully discussed and compared with the Egyptian
sculptures, with the view of shewing that the second Nebuchadnezzar was the
Cambyses of Herodotus, the son-in-law of Astyages and the conqueror of Egypt.
The story of his madness, after profaning the temple of Apis, is said to apply
accurately to this second monarch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It could not be expected that a theory of this kind
could be introduced into the world without severe and searching examination.
Accordingly, BIRKS, in his preface to &#8220;<i>The two later Visions of
Daniel,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>writes as follows: &#8220;I have examined closely the
two difficulties which alone give a seeming strength to his Grace&#8217;s
theory, &#8212; the succession of names in the Persian history, and the two
covenants under Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, &#8212; and feel confident I can meet
them both with a full and complete answer. It seems to me surprising that a
paradox of two Scripture Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s, and a Scripture Cyrus, totally
unknown to profane history, in the reign of Longimanus, contemporary with Cimon
and Pericles, can ever be received by any mind accustomed to pay the least
regard to the laws of evidence. Every fresh inquiry has only increased my
confidence in the usual chronology derived from the Canon of Ptolemy, and its
truth, I believe, may be almost entirely established even by Scripture evidence
alone.&#8221; VAUX, the learned author of &#8220;<i>Nineveh and
Persepolis,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>furnishes a clear sketch of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s
career, by combining the accounts of Herodotus and the Scriptures. In the
thirty-first year of Josiah&#8217;s reign, Necho fought the battle of Megiddo,
in which Josiah was mortally wounded. He then took Cadytis, &#8220;the holy
city&#8221; of the Jews, and at length returned to Egypt with abundance of
spoil. After a lapse of three years he invaded the territory of the king of
Babylon. The reigning monarch &#8212; Nabopolassar &#8212; was aged and infirm;
he gave the command of his army to his son Nebuchadnezzar, who defeated the
Egyptians at Carcesium or Carchemish, and drove them out of Asia. He marched to
Jerusalem, and reinstated Jehoiakim as its king, in subjection to himself; he
spoiled the temple of the chief ornaments and vessels of value, and among the
prisoners transmitted to Babylon were Daniel and his three friends. He next
carried on war against the Egyptians, till the news of his father&#8217;s death
caused his return. The revolt of Jehoiakim caused a second attack upon the city,
and the carrying off of many prisoners, among whom was Ezekiel, to the banks of
the distant Chebar. Zedekiah, the brother of Jehoiakim, having been placed on
the throne, and having made an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra, the Apries of
Herodotus, he is deposed by the King of Babylon, and carried captive in
blindness and chains. Thus for the third and last time this conqueror invaded
Judea and profaned the temple. After a lapse of four years he besieged Tyre; for
thirteen years it resisted his arms, but was at length razed to the ground. He
next succeeded in an expedition against Egypt, dethroned Apries, and leaving
Amasis as his viceroy, returned to his imperial city. In the language of
Jeremiah, &#8220;he arrayed himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd
putteth on his garment.&#8221; He next occupies himself in beautifying the city,
and erecting a palace of extraordinary magnificence, and in constructing those
hanging gardens mentioned by Diodoras, Megasthenes, and Arrian. The remainder of
his history is easily gathered from the Prophet&#8217;s narrative. &#8220;A
careful consideration of the authorities seems to shew that CLINTON is right in
his supposition that the reign of this prince was about forty-four years in
duration, and that he was succeeded after a short interval by Belshazzar.&#8221;

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Daniel
1:1</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To understand aright the history of these times, we
must take a cursory glance at the period both preceding and following that of
the great Chaldean chieftain. His ancestors were largely concerned in the
overthrow of the Assyrian empire. The origin of this monarchy is involved in
great obscurity, and we are at this moment in a transition state with respect to
our knowledge of its history. The deciphering of those inscriptions which have
lately been brought home is rapidly proceeding, and will lead to a more complete
knowledge of the events of this obscure epoch. Early in the Book of Genesis we
read of Nimrod, the grandson of Ham, as the founder of an extensive monarchy in
the land of Shinar. Out of this land he went forth into Ashur, or perhaps it is
Ashur who went forth and built Nineveh and other cities. The records of
succeeding ages are too few to enable us to follow the stream of history: we
have nothing to guide us but myths, and legends, and traditionary sovereigns,
whose names are but the fictions of imagination. It must never be forgotten that
many centuries elapsed between Noah and Solomon, and that the most ancient
profane history is comparatively modern. The late discoveries in Egypt, and the
high state of civilization attained by these &#8220;swarthy barbarians,&#8221;
have led the learned to the conclusion that we have hitherto lost many centuries
between the flood and Abraham; and since the long list of Egyptian dynasties, as
given by Manetho, has been proved accurate, it may fairly be supposed that the
Assyrian sculptures will rather add to the credit of Ctesias than detract from
it. At all events, Nineveh was &#8220;no mean city&#8221; when Athens was a
marsh, and Sardis a rock. Whether Ninus is a fabulous creation or not, monarchs
as mighty as the eagle-headed worshipper of Nisroch his god, swayed the scepter
for ages over a flourishing and highly civilized people. Herodotus gives us a
hint of the antiquity and pre-eminence of Assyria when he says, &#8220;The Medes
were the first who began to revolt from the Assyrians, who had possessed the
supreme command over Upper Asia for five hundred and twenty years.&#8221;
Whether we adopt the view of Bishop Lowth or not, that Ninus lived in the time
of the Judges, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we may correctly assume that some successful conqueror enlarged and beautified
Babylon, five hundred years before the Chaldean era of Nabonassar, 747 A.C.
Whatever the source of this wealth, whether derived from the spoils of conquered
nations, according to Montesquieu, or from intercourse with India through Egypt,
according to Bruce, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the lately discovered remains imply a very high style of art at a very remote
period in the history of Assyria. The &#8220;Pul&#8221; of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;121519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:19, was by no means the founder of the monarchy, as Sir Isaac Newton
and others have supposed; he was but one amidst those &#8220;servants of
Bar,&#8221; whose names are now legible on the Nimroud obelisk in the British
Museum. The next king mentioned in Scriptures is Tiglath-Pileser, whose name we
have lately connected with Pul and Ashur; and after him follow Shalmaneser,
Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, the three kings who are thought to have built the
palace at Khorsabad, founded Mespila, and constructed the lions in the
south-west palace of Nimroud. As the Medes revolted first, so the Chaldeans
rebelled afterwards, according to the usual law of separation from the parent
stock, when the tribe or race grows strong enough to establish its independence.
The first prince who is known to have lived after this revolt is Nabonassar, the
founder of the era called by his name. In process of time, other kings arose and
passed away, till in the thirty-first year of Manasseh, Esarhaddon died, after
reigning thirteen years over Assyria and Babylon united. He was succeeded by his
son Laosduchius, the Nabuchodonosor of the Book of Judith, whose successor
commenced his reign in the fifty-first year of Manasseh, being the hundred and
first of the above mentioned era. From this effeminate king his Chaldean general
Nabopolassar wrested Babylon, and reigned over his native country twenty-one
years. This revolt is said to have taken place in the eighteenth year of King
Josiah, when the powers of Media uniting with the power of Babylonia, took and
destroyed the great city of Nineveh, and reduced the people under the sway of
the rising monarchy. His son Nebuchadnezzar is said to have married the daughter
of Astyages, the king of the Medes, and thus brings down the history to the
times of our Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Among the ancient cities of the world, Nineveh is
conspicuous for its grandeur. The phrase of Jonah, &#8220;that great
city,&#8221; is amply confirmed by the historian, Diodorus Siculus, (lib. 2
section. 23.) who uses precisely the same expression, recording its
circumference as four hundred and eighty stadia, with high and broad walls. The
inference from the statement of the Book of Jonah is, that it was populous,
civilized, and extensive. The language of both Jonah and Nahum imply exactly
what the buried sculptures have exhibited to us, a state of society highly
organized, with various ranks, from the sovereign to the soldier and the
workman, yet effeminated by luxury and self-indulgence. The expressions of
Scripture give us exalted ideas of its size and splendor, while they assign its
wickedness as a reason for the complete destruction by which it was annihilated.
Prophet after prophet recognizes its surpassing opulence, its commercial
greatness, and its deep criminality. The voice of Zephaniah is soon followed by
the sword of Arbaces, and Sennacherib and Sardanapalus are eclipsed by the
rising greatness of Nabopolassar and Cyaxares. Its temples and its palaces had
become so encrusted in the soil during eight centuries of men, that Strabo knows
it only as a waste, and Tacitus treats it as a <i>Castellum; </i>and in the
thirteenth century of our era, Abulfaragius confirms the prophecy of Nahum and
the narrative of Tacitus, by recording nothing but the existence of a small
fortification on the eastern bank of the Tigris. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f331</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The dates assigned to these events vary considerably;
the following may be trusted as the result of careful comparison. In the year
A.C. 650, Nebuchodonosor is found on the throne of Assyria, &#8220;a
date,&#8221; says Vaux, &#8220;which is determined by the coincidence with the
forty-eighth year of Manasseh, and by the fact that his seventeenth year was the
last of Phraortes, king of Media, A.C. 634. The Book of Judith informs us of an
important engagement at Ragau between this Assyrian king and Arphaxad the king
of the Medes. This victory at Ragau, or Rhages, occurred A.C. 634, just
&#8220;fifty-seven years after the loss of Sennacherib&#8217;s army.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f332</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
After returning from Ecbatana, the capital of Media, the conqueror celebrated a
banquet at Nineveh which lasted one hundred and twenty days. Cyaxares, the son
of Phraortes, at length avenged his father&#8217;s death at Rhages, and by the
aid of Nabopolassar, threw off the yoke of Assyria, attacked and took Nineveh
about 606 A.C., and thus, by fixing the seat of empire at Babylon, blotted out
the name of Nineveh from the page of the world&#8217;s history.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This renowned general is usually held to be the
father of Nebuchadnezzar, on the authority of Berosus, as quoted by Josephus,
and of the <i>Astronomical Canon </i>of <i>Ptolemy. </i>But the author of
&#8220;The Times of Daniel&#8221; endeavors to identify him with either
Sardanapalus or Esarhaddon; the arguments by which this supposition is supported
will be found in detail in the work itself, while the original passages in
Josephus and Eusebius are found at length in the notes to Grotius on
&#8220;<i>The truth of the Christian religion.</i>&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f333</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He died A.C. 695.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">HIS SUCCESSORS. &#8212; According to the Canon of
Ptolemy, Evil-Merodach succeeded Nebuchadnezzar, reigned two years, and was
slain by his brother-in-law Neri-Glissar, who reigned four years; his son,
Laborosoarchod, reigned nine months, though quite a child, and was slain by
Nabonadius, supposed to be Belshazzar, a grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned
seventeen years. Evil-Merodach is mentioned in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122527&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 25:27, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;245231&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
52:31, but not by Daniel, and this gives some countenance to the supposition,
that Belshazzar was the son and not the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. It is not
easy to assign with certainty the correct dates to each of these kings, the
reckoning of Josephus is here followed, which he derives from Berosus. The
testimony of profane antiquity to the truth and historical accuracy of Daniel
may be found in a convenient form in <i>Kitto</i>&#8217;<i>s Bibli. Cyclop.,
Art. Nebuchadnezzar, </i>page 406. The authorities are quoted at length, and the
whole subject is ably elucidated. The limited space necessarily allowed for
illustrating these Lectures, must be our apology for merely indicating where
valuable information is to be obtained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>New Monthly Magazine </i>for August and

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Chapter
1:5</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To determine the question which was raised in our
last DISSERTATION, we must investigate the origin of the Chaldeans, as it was
the tribe whence Nebuchadnezzar sprung. &#8220;The question,&#8221; says Heeren,
&#8220;what the Chaldeans really were, and whether they ever properly existed as
a nation, is one of the most difficult which history presents.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f334</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They are first mentioned in Genesis
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:28,) as <i>Casdim,</i> (<i>Lecture 5</i>;) they were situated north of Judea,
and are identical with the people who should, according to Jeremiah, destroy the
temple from the north.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:13, 14, etc.) They are not mentioned by name again in the books of Scripture
till many centuries afterwards they had become a mighty nation. The word
<i>Chasdim </i>in the Hebrew and <i>Chasdaim </i>in the Chaldee dialects, is
clearly the same as the Greek
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Caldai~oi</font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>and Gesenius supposing the root to have been originally <i>card, </i>refers
them to the race inhabiting the mountains called by Xenophon <i>Carduchi.
</i>Forster, indeed, has argued at considerable length in favor of their Arabian
origin, and supposes them the well known Beni Khaled, a horde of Bedouin Arabs. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f335</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
From this opinion we entirely dissent. The view of Gesenius in his Lectures at
Halle in 1839, quoted in &#8220;The Times of Daniel,&#8221; appears preferable,
&#8212; &#8220;The Chaldeans had their original seat on the east of the Tigris,
south of Armenia, which we now call Koordistan; and, like the Koords in our day,
they were warlike mountaineers, without agriculture, shepherds and robbers, and
also mercenaries in the Assyrian army; so Xenophon found them.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f336</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Vaux quotes Dicaearchus, a Greek historian of the time of Alexander the Great,
as alluding to a certain Chaldean, a king of Assyria, who is supposed to have
built Babylon; and in later times, Chaldea implied the whole of Mesopotamia
around Babylon, which had also the name of Shiner. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f337</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Their religion and their language are also of
importance. The former consisted in the worship of the heavenly bodies. They are
supposed to have brought with them to Babylon a knowledge of astronomy superior
to any then known, since they reduced their observations on the sun, moon, five
planets, signs of the zodiac, and the rising and setting of the sun, to a
regular system; and the Greeks are said by Herodotus to have derived from them
the division of the day into twelve equal parts. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f338</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The lunar year was in common use, but the solar year, with its division of
months similar to the Egyptian, was employed for astronomical purposes. The
learned class gradually acquired the reputation and position of
&#8220;priests,&#8221; and thus became astrologers and soothsayers, and
&#8220;wise men&#8221; in their day and generation. Michaelis and Sehlozer
consider their origin to be Sclavonic, and, consequently, distinct from the
Babylonians, who were descendants of Shem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THEIR LANGUAGE. &#8212; The original <i>language
</i>of this people is a point of great interest to the biblical critic. If the
people were of old northern mountaineers, they spoke a language connected with
the Indo-Persic and Indo-Germanic stem rather than the Semitic. In treating this
question, we should always allow for the length of time which elapsed between
the original outbreak of those hordes from their native hills; and their
conquest of Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar. Gesenius, in his <i>Lectures on
Biblical Archaeology, </i>reminds us of their being first tributary to the
Assyrians, of their subsequent occupation of the plains of Mesopotamia for some
centuries previously to their becoming the conquerors of Asia under successful
leaders. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f339</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the fourth verse of chapter 2
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:4) we learn that they spoke the Aramaic dialect, which the Alexandrine
Version, as well as Theodotion&#8217;s, denominates the Syriac. From the
Cyropaedia (Book 7:24) we ascertain that the Syriac was the ordinary language of
Babylon. Strabo also informs us that the same language was used throughout all
the regions on the banks of the Euphrates. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f340</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Diodorus Siculus calls the Chaldeans the most ancient inhabitants of Babylonia,
and assigns to their astrologers a similar position to that of the Egyptian
priests. Their devotion to philosophy and their practice of astronomy gained
them great credit with the powerful, which they turned to account by professing
to predict the future and to interpret the visions of the imaginative and the
distressed.

Hengstenberg has tested the historical truthfulness of the author of this book,
by comparing his account of the Chaldean priest-caste with those of profane
history. According to chapter. 2:48, the president of this caste was also a
prince of the province of Babylon. Thus, according to Diodorus Siculus, Belesys
was the chief president of the priests, &#8220;whom the Babylonians call
Chaldeans,&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f343</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and governor of Babylon. In Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

of the palace.&#8221; So much confidence was necessarily reposed in these
domestic officers, that many affairs of the utmost importance and delicacy were

<i>sepher, </i>&#8220;book,&#8221; in which he was to instruct them, must be
extended to all the literature of the Chaldees. Oecolampadius treats it as
including rhetoric, eloquence, and all those elevating pursuits which cultivate
the mind and refine the manners. He then proceeds to treat the narrative as an
allegory; the &#8220;prince of Babel, or, of the world,&#8221; represents Satan;
Daniel and his companions, the elect members of Christ. The family of David is
supposed to imply this spiritual household of God, and the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymtrp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pharth-mim, </i>nobles, is pressed into this service by a preference for the
rendering of Saadias, &#8220;perfect fruit.&#8221; The eunuch is said to typify
those spiritual flatterers who entice the children of God by flatteries and
allurements to sin, and by substituting worldly sophistry for true wisdom, draw
souls from Christ. Although such reflections are very profitable, yet CALVIN has
shewn his matured judgment by excluding all fanciful allegory from his comments.
OECOLAMPADIUS supposes the king to be liberal and benevolent in ordering the
captives to be fed from his table, and prudent in proposing this indulgence as a
reward for their diligence in study. Here also the king&#8217;s character is
allegorized; he becomes a model of Satan enticing God&#8217;s elect, and
offering them to partake of his own dainties, that he may win them more blandly
to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In commenting, too, on the change of names,
<i>Oecolampadius </i>gives the usual meaning to the Hebrew words, but observes,
how the name of God was omitted from them all, and the worthiness attributed to
the creature. This, he thinks, to have been the eunuch&#8217;s intention, while
he points to the change as an instance of the contrast between human and divine
wisdom. The conduct of Daniel may be illustrated by the practice of the early
Christians, against whom it was objected by Caecilius, that they abhorred meats
offered to idols when commanded to partake of them.

GREAT?</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Daniel
1:21</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE last verse of this chapter is connected with an
interesting inquiry, viz., Was the CORESH here mentioned CYRUS THE GREAT, or any
other Cyrus? The noble author of &#8220;<i>The Times of Daniel</i>&#8221;<i>
</i>has thrown much &#8220;life&#8221; into the subject by his elaborate defense
of a theory which we now proceed to state and discuss. Cyrus the Great he thinks
identical with Nebuchadnezzar the First, and Cambyses with his son
Nebuchadnezzar the Second; the exploits of the hero of Herodotus and Xenophon
are attributed to the former, while Coresh becomes but a minor character,
contemporary with Darius the Mede, after whom he is said to reign, and before
Darius the son of Ahasuerus. This view also brings the story of Esther within
the period of the captivity of Babylon. It has always been a subject of great
difficulty with commentators on Daniel, to reconcile the scriptural narrative
with those of both Herodotus and Xenophon. The majority finding this impossible,
have decided in favor of one or the other of these historians; and the best
modern writers usually prefer Herodotus. <i>Lowth, </i>in his Notes on
<i>Isaiah, </i>says, &#8220;the Cyrus of Herodotus was a very different
character from that of the Cyrus of the Scriptures and Xenophon;&#8221; and
<i>Archbishop Secker </i>has taken great pains to compare all the profane
historians with Scripture, and shews that the weight of the argument lies
against the truth of the Cyropaedia. Whether Cyrus was the grandson of Astyages
or not, many believe with Ctesias that he overcame him in battle, and founded
the Persian empire upon the ruins of the Median dynasty. It is scarcely possible
that it should be left for this nineteenth century to discover the identity
between a first Nebuchadnezzar and this conqueror of the East; and while the
clearing up of every historical discrepancy is impossible, yet it is desirable
to reconcile the occurrences which are related by both Herodotus and Xenophon.
The son of Cambyses the Persian, and of Mandane the daughter of Astyages king of
the Medes, is said to have conquered Craesus king of Lydia, enlarged the Persian
empire, subdued Babylon and the remnant of the Assyrian power, and placed his
uncle Cyaxares over the united territories of Media and Babylon. After the death
of this relative, he reigned over Asia, from India to Ethiopia, a territory
consisting of 127 provinces. The manner of his death is uncertain, all the
historians differ in their accounts, but the place of his burial is allowed to
be Pasargadae, as Pliny has recorded in his Natural History. This tomb was
visited by Alexander the Great, and has lately been noticed and described by
European travelers. The plains of Murghab are watered by a river which bears the
name of Kur, and is thought to be identical with the Greek Cyrus. A structure in
a ruinous state has been found there, apparently of the same date as the remains
at Persepolis, bearing cuneiform inscriptions which are now legible. The legend
upon one of the pilasters has been interpreted, &#8220;I am Cyrus the
Achaemenian;&#8221; and no doubt is entertained by the learned that this
monument once contained the remains of the founder of the Persian monarchy. A
single block of marble was discovered by Sir R. K. Porter, on which he
discovered a beautiful sculpture in bas-relief, consisting of the figure of a
man, from whose shoulders issue four large wings, rising above the head and
extending to the feet. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f346</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The whole value of such an inscription to the reader of Daniel is the legend
above the figure, in the arrow-headed character, determining the spot as the
tomb of Cyrus the Great. It shews, at the least, that he cannot be identified
with Nebuchadnezzar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The manner in which the author of &#8220;<i>The Times
of Daniel</i>&#8221;<i> </i>has commented on the prophecies relating to the
overthrow of Babylon, is worthy of notice here.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:14, is referred by <i>Dr. Keith </i>to Cyrus, and objection is made to the
supposed fulfillment in the person of Cyrus, <i>Keith </i>is said to apply to
Cyrus the primary historical fulfillment of all the prophecies relating to the
overthrow of Babylon, and the justness of this inference is doubted. Isaiah
13-14:27, is one of the passages where the asserted allusion to Cyrus is
questioned, since it relates to a period in which the power of Assyria was in
existence. The Assyrian is supposed to be Sennacherib, to whose predecessor both
Babylon and Media were subject. &#8220;The Chaldeans, mentioned in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
13:19, I have already explained to have been a colony of astronomers, planted in
Babylon by the Assyrian kings to carry on their astronomical observations, in
which science they excelled.&#8221; Again,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
21:2, &#8220;Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media,&#8221; is applied by <i>Dr. Keith
</i>to Cyrus, to which the noble author objects, as well as to the supposition
&#8220;that the overthrow of Belshazzar during his drunken revelry was predicted
in Scripture, and that the minute fulfillment by Cyrus is recorded by
Xenophon.&#8221; &#8220;The feast of Belshazzar,&#8221; it is added, &#8220;does
not appear to correspond with the festival described by Xenophon, which was
apparently periodical, and which, not a portion of the nobles, but all the
Babylonians, observed by drunkenness and revelry during the whole night.&#8221;
&#8220;It also agrees with the mode in which Zopyrus got possession of
Babylon.&#8221; <i>Calvin </i>seems to give it this turn, &#8220;A treacherous
one shall find treachery,&#8221; etc. Further comments are then made upon Isaiah
44 and 45, and on Jeremiah 50 and 51, evading the force of their application to
Cyrus, and combating with some degree of success the assertions of <i>Keith;
</i>for the noble author, who is earnest in pulling down, is ingenious in
building up. &#8220;From this short examination, it appears that the prophecy of
Jeremiah (Jeremiah 50 and 51) corresponds with the capture of Babylon by Darius
the Mede of Scripture, and by Darius Hystaspes, according to Herodotus.&#8221;
Some writers have supposed Cyrus to be identical with this Darius the Mede; and
<i>Archbishop Secker </i>acknowledges some ground for such a conjecture.
&#8220;The first year of Darius the Mede is by the LXX. translated the first
year of Cyrus,&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f347</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and the Canon of Ptolemy favors the identity. &#8220;Now all agree, as far as I
have seen,&#8221; says <i>Wintle, </i>&#8220;that the year of the expiration of
the captivity, or the year that Cyrus issued his decree in favor of the Jews,
was the year 212 of the era of Nabonassar, or 536 A.C.; and there is no doubt
but Darius the Mede, whoever he was, reigned, according to Daniel, from the
capture of Babylon, till this same first year of Cyrus, or till the commencement
of the reign alloted by Scripture to Cyrus the Persian.&#8221; &#8220;The Canon
certainly allots nine years&#8217; reign to Cyrus over Babylon, of which space
the two former years are usually allowed to coincide with the reign of Cyaxares
or Darius the Mede, by the advocates of Xenophon.&#8221; (Prelim. Dissertation.)
Herodotus, Xenophon, and Ctesias all agree in the original superiority of the
Medes, till the victories of Cyrus turned the scale, and gave rise to the
Persian dynasty. At the fall of Babylon, and during the life of Darius, the
Medes are mentioned by Daniel as superior, but at the accession of Cyrus this
order is reversed, and Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, all assign the foremost place
to the Persians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The life of Daniel, <i>Rosenmuller </i>reminds us,
was prolonged beyond the first year of king
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wrk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Coresh, </i>for the tenth chapter informs us of his vision in the third year
of that monarch&#8217;s reign. He explains the apparent contradiction, by saying
that it was enough for Daniel to live, or to the liberation of the Jews in the
first year of the reign of Coresh; that was the crowning event of his prolonged
existence. The conjectures of <i>Bertholdt </i>and <i>Aben-Ezra </i>are
mentioned, only to be disposed of by a few words of censure. An ingenious
conjecture of a French critic is found in the <i>Encycl. Theol., </i>Liv. 27.
The objection of Bleek, Ewald, Winer, and De Wette, are ably treated at length
by <i>Hengstenberg, </i>and really meet with more serious attention than they
deserve. It is a useless waste of precious time to enter minutely into every
&#8220;phantasy&#8221; of the restless neology of Germany, while the chronology
of Daniel&#8217;s life will form the subject of a subsequent Dissertation. As
some Neologians dwell much on the historian CTESIAS, and lest the unlearned
reader should be misled by their confident assertions, we may here state that we
have only an epitome of his work preserved by the patriarch Photius. <i>Bahr</i>
states that he lived about 400 B.C., in the reign of Darius Nothus, being a
Greek physician who remained seventeen years at the Persian court. Diodorus
informs us that he obtained his information from the royal archives, but there
are so many anachronisms and errors of various kinds, that his statements cannot
be safely followed as if historically correct. Ctesias, for instance, denies all
relationship between Cyrus and Astyages. According to him, he defeated Astyages,
invested his daughter Amytis with the honors of a queen, and afterwards married
her. F. W. NEWMAN, indeed, prefers this narrative to that of both Herodotus and
Xenophon, and thereby renders their testimony to the scriptural record uncertain
and valueless. He also treats &#8220;the few facts&#8221; in regard to the
Persian wars, &#8220;which the epitomator has extracted as differing from
Herodotus,&#8221; as carrying with them &#8220;high probability.&#8221; The
closing scene of his career, as depicted in the narrative of Ctesias, is
pronounced &#8220;beyond comparison more credible&#8221; than that of Herodotus.
This great conqueror died the third day after his wound in a battle with
&#8220;the Derbices,&#8221;<i> </i>and was buried in that monument at
Pasargadae, which the Macedonians broke open two centuries afterwards,
(<i>Strabo, </i>lib. 15 &#167; 3; <i>Arrian, </i>lib. vi. &#167; 29,) and which
has lately been explored and described by Morier and Sir R. K. Porter.

<div><font face="Palatino">Notwithstanding the hypothesis which has lately found
favor with the modern writers whose worlds we have quoted, we feel that the
views of the older critics are preferable; and, on the whole, CALVIN&#8217;S
exposition can only be improved upon in minor details. The authorities
enumerated by <i>Archbishop Secker, </i>as given by <i>Wintle </i>in his
preface, page 18 and following, are worthy of attentive perusal; and we must

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Daniel
2:1</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ITS DATE. &#8212; The assertion of the first verse
has created some difficulty, in consequence of its not allowing time enough for
the Jewish youth to become a man. Jerome attempts to solve it by supposing the
point of departure to be not his reign over Judea, but of his dominion over
other nations, as the Assyrians and Egyptians. He seems justified in this view
by the words of Josephus, (<i>Antiq., </i>lib. 10 chapter 10. &#167; 3,) who
distinctly refers the dream to the second year &#8220;after the laying waste of
Egypt.&#8221; <i>Rosenmuller </i>objects to this explanation, and to that of
<i>C. B. Michaelis, </i>and adopts that of <i>Saadias, </i>who supposes the
dream to have happened in the second year, but not to be interpreted till the
conclusion of the third.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ITS ORIGIN. &#8212; Nothing is more difficult to
reduce to philosophic laws than the theory of dreams and their interpretation.
The researches of physical science have thrown more light on the subject than
all the guesses of ancient or modern divines. Jerome, for instance, thought that
in this case, &#8220;the shadow of the dream remained,&#8221; a sort of breath
(<i>aura</i>)<i> </i>and trace remaining in the mind of the king. It is of no
use whatever to seek for much light on these subjects in the works of the
ancients, whether Fathers or Reformers; they are constantly displaying their
ignorance whenever they treat of subjects within the domain of psychological
science. The physician has now become a far safer guide than the divine.
Although Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream was supernatural in its origin, yet it
seems like ordinary ones in its departing from the sleeper while he is
completely unconscious of its subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Physical researches have proved the truth of
Calvin&#8217;s assertion on verse third, that &#8220;<i>Scientia est generalis
et perpetua.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Explanations have happily passed away from the
theologian and the metaphysician to the physician and the chemist. The brain is
now admitted to be the organ through which the mind acts during both the
activity and the repose of the body, and dreams are now known to depend upon
<i>physical causes </i>acting through the nerves upon the brain. The late
researches of the celebrated chemist Baron Reichenbach seem to have led us one
step nearer to the true explanation of these singular phenomena; the discovery
of <i>odyle, </i>a new imponderable agent, like caloric and electricity, has
enabled the modern philosopher to trace some of the laws of natural and
artificial sleep. The existence of odyle in magnets, crystals, and the animal
frame, and its intimate connection with lucidity, and impressions conveyed to
the sensorium during magnetic sleep, seems now to be received by the best
psychologists; their experiments will, doubtless, lead to our ascertaining the
laws which regulate dreaming; and if the results said to be obtained by Mr.
Lewis, Major Buckley, and Dr. William Gregory of Edinburgh, are ultimately
admitted as facts by the scientific world, a new method of explaining the
operations of the mind in sleep will be completely established. &#8212; See the
&#8220;Letters&#8221; published by the Professor of Chemistry in the University
of Edinburgh, 1 volume 12mo. 1851.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This contrast between the ancient and modern methods
of explanation is strikingly exemplified by Calvin&#8217;s reference to the
<i>Daimones </i>on page 119, which requires some elucidation to render it
intelligible to the general reader.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The philosophers of Greece held various theories
concerning them, among which that recorded by Plato in the Phaedrus is the most
singular. He commences by asserting the immortality of the soul, and its
essential existence from all eternity. The explanation of this idea, as it
really is, he treats as divine, but its similitude as human and readily
comprehended. The simile is remarkable. The deities have all a chariot and
horses, which are perfect, but ours have two horses, each of contrary
dispositions. A whole armament of these winged spirits are led on under the
concave of heaven, Jupiter himself leading the armament of gods and daimones. In
attempting to ascend, the perfect horses of the deities succeed in reaching the
convex surface, which no poet ever has described or will describe worthily; but
some charioteers fail in their efforts, because one of their horses is depraved,
and ever tends downwards towards the earth. In consequence of this depravity,
the utmost confusion occurs &#8212; the daimones loose their wings and fall to
earth, and become human souls. But the various ranks which arise from them
deserve especial notice. Those who have beheld most of the glories beyond the
heavenly concave become philosophers, and the next to them kings and warriors.
Seven other classes of men spring up in the following order: &#8212;
politicians, physicians, prophets, poets, farmers, sophists, and tyrants. After
ten thousand years, the soul may recover its wings, and be judged &#8212; some
in heaven and others in courts of justice under the earth, while some pass into
beasts and then return again to bodies of men. This notion of the origin of the
soul from the daimones is a very singular one, and helps us to understand the
double sense of the word, like that of angels among us, both good and bad.
Though it is not difficult to perceive its connection with dreaming, as the
medium of intercourse between the souls of men and the disembodied spirits, yet
such conjectures throw no light whatever upon the king&#8217;s dream before
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The passages alluded to by Calvin from Cicero are
found in the First and Second Books <i>De Divinatione. </i>They consist of
extracts from Ennius, and relate the fabled dreams of Priam, Tarquinius
Superbus, and the mother of Phalaris, as well as that remarkable one which the
magi are said to have interpreted for Cyrus. In the Second Book, Cicero argues
wisely and strenuously against the divine origin of dreams. To pay the slightest
attention to them he deems the mark of a weak, superstitious, and driveling
mind. He inveighs strongly against the pretense to interpret them, which had
become a complete traffic, and displayed the imposture which always flourishes
wherever there are dupes to feed it. He combats the views of Aristotle, which
Calvin quotes, and supplies much material for discussion though but little
illustration of our subject. The passages above referred to will be found quoted
and explained in <i>Colquhoun</i>&#8217;<i>s History of Magic, </i>volume 1,
while some useful observations on <i>sleep and dreams </i>occur in page 60 and
following.</font><br></div>

has arisen whether this expression relates to Nebuchadnezzar personally, or to
his empire and dynasty continued to his grandson. The principle is an important
one, although history has already removed all difficulty as to the facts. <i>C.

representative of his empire, not only during his life but until its overthrow.
In the quaint language of <i>Willet, </i>&#8220;In this short sentence, <i>thou

<i>Wintle </i>interprets the golden head as representing the duration of the

objectionable, since the father of <i>Nebuchadnezzar </i>was of a different race
from the early sovereigns of Babylon, and the vision becomes far more emphatic,
by being limited to Nebuchadnezzar and his immediate successors.
<i>Oecolampadius </i>limits the period to his own times, and gives an ingenious

<div><font face="Palatino">The THIRD KINGDOM is that of the Greeks, but the
FOURTH is variously interpreted. It relates to either the successors of
Alexander or to the Romans. The majority of the older commentators agreed with
CALVIN in thinking it to mean the Roman empire, viz., Oecolampadius, Bullinger,
Melancthon and Osiander, while Grotius and Rosenmuller, and Cosmas, the Indian
traveler whom we have previously referred to as known to us through Montfaucon,
advocate its reference to the Seleucidae and Lagidae. <i>Poole</i>&#8217;<i>s
Synopsis </i>will furnish the reader with long lists of varying opinions, each
fortified by its own reasons, and <i>Willet </i>has carefully collected and
arranged the arguments on both sides. The divines of Germany have added their
conjectures to those which have preceded them. Kuinoel in his theological
commentaries has preserved the view of <i>Velthusen</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f350</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and others; while the absurdities which some of them propose may be

&#8220;<i>Observations on Daniel,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>approve the foolish
conjecture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A third view, very different from those which
preceded it, has been ably stated and laboriously defended. DR. TODD of Dublin,
in his valuable &#8220;<i>Lectures on Antichrist,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>considers
the fourth empire as yet to come. The kingdoms of Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, and
Cyrus, are said to be signified by the golden head, that of Alexander by the
silver breast and arms, the Roman by the brass, while the iron prefigures the
cruel and resistless sway of Antichrist, which shall not be overthrown till the
second advent of Messiah. We shall have future opportunities for discussing this
theory more at length; it has necessarily enlisted him in the ranks of the
Futurists, whom <i>Birks </i>has confuted at length in his &#8220;<i>First
Elements of Sacred Prophecy.</i>&#8221;<i> We </i>refer the student to these two
worlds, each excellent of its kind, while we defer the discussion of this most
interesting question till we treat the chapters contained in our second
volume.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In descending to details, the arms of the image have
been treated as symbols of the Medo-Persian empire; <i>Theodoret </i>considering
the right arm to represent one, and the left the other. Various reasons have
been given for the implied inferiority. <i>Willet </i>adopts one the direct
contrary of C<i>alvin</i>&#8217;<i>s. </i>While one author treats the
inferiority as moral, in consequence of a general corruption of manners,
<i>Willet </i>thinks the &#8220;government more tolerable and equal toward the
people of God.&#8221; Some have thought the silver to refer to remarkable
wealth, and others to superior wisdom and eloquence. The belly and thighs being
of brass, are thought to prefigure the intemperance, and yet the firmness of the
Grecian powers. Alexander&#8217;s personal debauchery and extravagance is said
to be hinted at. The brass is said to imply his warlike disposition and his
invincible spirit. The iron is thought to be peculiarly characteristic of the
conquests of Rome; the mingling with clay signifies &#8220;the<i> </i>division
and dissension of the kingdom,&#8221; says Willet; while others refer it to the
marriages between the Roman generals and the barbarians, or generally to the
intermingling of the conquerors of the world with the tribes whom they subdued.
The two legs are said to be the two great divisions of the Roman empire after
the time of Constantine, though those who treat them as belonging to the
successors of Alexander, think they mean Egypt and Syria. The mingling with the
seed of men
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270243&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:43) is interpreted of the admission of the subject allies to the freedom of
the state (<i>donati civitate</i>)<i>, </i>and also of the fusion between the
barbarians and the Romans, in the late periods of the declining empire. Whether
the toes represent individual kings or distinct kingdoms, has been discussed by

<div><font face="Palatino">THE STONE &#8220;CUT OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN&#8221; is
generally interpreted of the kingdom of Messiah, some writers applying it to his
first Advent, and others to his second. If the fourth kingdom be the Roman, then
the stone was cut &#8220;without hands,&#8221; either at the birth of Christ,
or, as Calvin when answering Abarbanel prefers, at the first spread of the
Gospel. The reason why a &#8220;stone&#8221; here symbolizes &#8220;the kingdom
of the heavens,&#8221; is because Christ is spoken of in Scripture as a chief
corner-stone. The passages in the Psalms, Isaiah, and Matthew, and others, are
too familiar to the reader to require quotation. The mountain is supposed to be,
either the Virgin Mary, or the Jewish people; without hands, may allude to our
Savior&#8217;s marvelous birth, or to his spiritual independence of all human
agency. The ancient fathers, as well as the modern reformers, agree in this
allusion to Christ. See <i>Justin Martyr Dial. cum Tryph</i>., section 32;
Irenaeus adv. Haer., verse 21; Tertullian, De Resur., page 61; Apolog., page
869; Cyprian adv. Jud., lib. 2. section 17; Augustine in Psalm
98.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question of the greatest interest is, whether
this prophecy has been fulfilled at the first Advent, or is yet to be
accomplished at the second. Willet has taken Calvin to task for his
&#8220;insufficient&#8221; answers to the &#8220;Rabbine Barbanel,&#8221; but as
they vary only on minor points, it is not necessary to quote the corrections of
his thoughtful monitor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The theory of Joseph Mede, the great advocate of the
year-day system, may be noticed here. He supposes the stone cut out at the first
Advent, but not to smite the image till the second. This involves the existence
of the Roman empire, throughout the whole Christian dispensation &#8212; an
admission that Calvin would not make, and should not be hastily allowed. DR.
TODD correctly remarks, &#8220;it assumes the Roman empire to be still in
existence,&#8221; and it further assumes that the prophecies revealed to Daniel
advance beyond the first Advent of Messiah. CALVIN and the older commentators
treat them as terminating with the establishment of the Gospel dispensation.
TERTULLIAN, indeed, applies this passage to the second Advent, but MALDONATUS
considers that expositor as &#8220;insanus,&#8221; who thinks the Roman empire
to be still existing. Yet both BELLARMINE, and BIRKS argue for its present
continuance, and each founds upon it his own views of Scripture
prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we shall have other opportunities for discussing
these questions in our second volume, we simply state that CALVIN and our chief
Reformers considered all Daniel&#8217;s prophecies summed up and satisfied by
the first Advent of Christ. As they did not adopt the year-day system, they
treated these predictions as pointing the Jews to the coming of their Messiah,
and as depicting the various kingdoms and sovereigns which should arise, and
affect by their progress and dissensions the Holy Land. It never once occurred
to them that the Book of Daniel relates in any way to the details of the history
of modern Europe, and of either the Court or the Church of
Rome.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another view hinted at, but disapproved by BISHOP
NEWTON, is that the third empire relates solely to Alexander, the fourth to his
successors in Syria and Egypt, and the stone cut without hands to the Roman
dominion. But with this popular writer as well as with Joseph Mede &#8212; the
received view of the iron portion of the image is &#8220;little less than an
article of faith.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f351</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The stone he reminds us was quite different from the image, so the kingdom of
Christ was utterly distinct from the principalities of this world. He asserts
that its smiting power was displayed at the first Advent, and is continued
throughout the subsequent history of the world. But as BISHOP NEWTON is an
advocate of the historical system of interpreting days for years, which CALVIN
did not uphold, it is unnecessary to quote him further. The reader will,
however, derive benefit from consulting the authorities which he has brought
forward in rich abundance. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f352</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As he is a valuable and a popular expounder of prophecy, it is necessary to make
this passing allusion to so valuable an author; while the reader of these
Lectures must be cautioned against adopting any views of prophecy which are
inconsistent with the great principle upon which the Almighty deals with us, in
our new covenant through Christ our Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">OECOLAMPADIUS in his comment upon
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270244&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:44, treats the kingdom of Christ as spiritual and eternal; like other earnest
writers, he considers the troubles of his own days as peculiarly the marks of
Antichrist. The blasphemy of the Mahometans, and the arrogance of the
&#8220;Cata-baptists,&#8221; seem to him intolerable. He is especially vehement
against those who urge the necessity of a second baptism, and deny the value of
outward ordinances, as the ministry and the sacraments; and argues for the
permanence of external ceremonies till the second Advent of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He considers verse forty-five to relate to the second
coming of Christ and the resurrection of mankind to judgment, but does not
condemn the opinion of Jerome and other &#8220;fathers,&#8221; who refer it to
the incarnation of our Lord. The mountain, says he, is Zion, and the people the
Jews, and by his crucifixion, Christ is said to grow into a mountain and fill
the earth. He quotes Hippolytus as sanctioning its reference to the second
Advent; and objects to the views of Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Lactantius, who as
Chiliasts turned this passage to their purpose. The gross ideas of some Jews and
Christians, respecting a thousand years of carnal enjoyment upon earth, are
wisely reprobated, and some very profitable remarks are made upon the spiritual
reign of Christ in the hearts and souls of his people. Oecolampadius is on this
occasion remarkably practical and searching in his comment; he is not so
critical and literal as CALVIN, but he develops more of the deep feelings of the
mature Christian than any other Reformer does on the OLD
TESTAMENT.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
In whose honor was it erected? Willet agrees with Calvin in thinking it was
consecrated to some deity, as Bel, the chief object of his
worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The<i> place</i> of its erection was the plain called by <i>Ptolemy</i>, Deira,
between Chaltopis and Cissia, in the region of Susan. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f353</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The editor of the Chisian Codex derives it from the Persian word <i>dooran</i>,
meaning an enclosure, thus strengthening the view of Jerome, that it was erected
in an enclosure within the city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A singular feature in the earliest commentators is
the mystical application of such subjects. <i>Chrysostom, </i>for instance,
takes it to denote covetousness; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f354</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and <i>Jerome, </i>(<i>in loc.,</i>)<i> </i>false doctrine and heresy; and
<i>Irenaeus, </i>the pomp and pride of the world, under the mastery of Satan. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f355</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The disproportion of its form has occasioned some
difference among expositors. <i>Bertholdt, </i>as usual, is full of
faultfinding. &#8220;How was it possible for it to stand of itself?&#8221; But
there is no proof that the statue had throughout a human form. Columns with a
human head on the top were often erected by the Asiatics in honor of their
deities. <i>M&uuml;nter </i>in his <i>Religion of the Babylonians, </i>treats it
as similar to the Amyclaean Apollo, a simple column, to which a head and feet
were added. <i>Gesenius, </i>too, has observed that the ruins of the tower of
Belus are imposing only from their colossal size, and not from their
proportions; the Babylonians preferred everything huge, irregular, and
grotesque. Idol-pillars were commonly erected by the Assyrians in honor of their
deities. If, however, we strictly limit the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tzelem, </i>to a human figure complete in all its parts, we may still
vindicate the truth of Daniel by allowing for a pedestal which would be
necessary. The proportion of six to one is correct: for a human figure; hence
with a pedestal, ten to one by no means violates the principles of art. Of the
difficulty of raising it we are no judges. The able remarks of <i>Heeren </i>are
exactly suited to the occasion, &#8212; &#8220;The circle of our experience is
too limited for us to assign at once the scale of what is possible in other
lands, in a different clime, and under other circumstances. Do not the Egyptian
pyramids, the Chinese wall, and the rock temple at Elephanta, stand, as it were,
in mockery of our criticism, which presumes to define the limits of the united
power of whole nations?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f356</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The material of the Colossus is worthy of notice. It
is scarcely possible that it could be all of gold. Some, have thought it to have
been hollow like the Colossus of Rhodes, which exceeded it in height by ten
cubits. (<i>Pliny His. Nat., </i>34 &#167; 18.) <i>Chrysostom </i>thought it
made of wood, and only covered with gold plating, and certainly we have
authority for such a view from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023938&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
39:38, where an altar made of acacia wood, and covered with gold, is termed
golden; and that in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023939&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
39:39, merely covered with brass, is termed brazen. The immense treasures heaped
together at Babylon favor the possibility of sufficient gold being at hand to
cover so large a statue; while the weight of the golden statue of Bel, with its
steps and seat, as recorded both by Herodotus and Diodorus, is far from
sufficient to allow of their being massive gold throughout. Thus profane history
becomes exceedingly valuable in enabling us to interpret correctly the language
of the Old Testament. Many minds are inclined at once to discredit the erection
of any such colossus all of gold; the mechanical and artistic difficulties are
far too great; but when we find such historians giving us accounts of similar
erections made of plated wood, or consisting of a mere hollow case, plated over,
the whole of the difficulties vanish, everything is reduced at once within the
bounds of credibility, the historical accuracy of Daniel is vindicated, the
captious insinuations of disbelievers are repelled, and the mind of the earnest
inquirer is at rest on the firm rock which patient investigation has provided
for it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Hengstenberg</i>&#8217;<i>s </i>attention is
occupied throughout this chapter with noticing the objections of his Neologian
predecessors. <i>De Wette, Bertholdt, and Bleek, </i>have each attempted to
discredit the historical veracity of Daniel. The period of the erection of the
image &#8212; if ever erected at all &#8212; was that of Antiochus Epiphanes,
say they, and his character is the supposed original of the fabulous
Nebuchadnezzar, and the writer &#8220;merely invented these tales in order to
inspire the Jews with fortitude under the religious persecutions of
Antiochus.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f357</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Bertholdt </i>also considers the address of the three Jews to the king as an
instance of &#8220;revolting insolence and levity;&#8221; while <i>Theodoret
</i>is quoted as &#8220;being amazed at the courage of these youths, their
wisdom, their piety,&#8221; in language exactly in the spirit of Calvin himself.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f358</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The preparation of the furnace has created some difficulty, especially when
<i>Chardin </i>relates that a whole month has been taken up with feeding two
ovens with fire, for the purpose of destroying criminals; but this objection is
removed by the natural supposition that the king anticipated refusal, and had
prepared beforehand to execute summary vengeance on all who disobeyed.
&#8220;What result is gained by the miracle?&#8221; ask the disbelievers.
&#8220;How disproportionate was the colossus,&#8221; he exclaims, &#8220;no such
statue ever existed, no such miracle was ever performed.&#8221; But history puts
to flight a whole host of conjectures, for Herodotus mentions a statue in the
temple of Belus, and Diodorus Siculus confirms his account.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Daniel

<div><font face="Palatino">It is not possible to define, as <i>Calvin
</i>reminds us, what these instruments were. Researches have been made into the
etymology of the Chaldee words, and a comparison instituted between the
properties implied and those of modern use and construction. Travelers in the
East have compared the music of the present day with that recorded in this
verse. A similarity, too, has been pointed out between the instruments of the
Syrians and Greeks. As no practical advantage can arise from quoting the
conjectures of various writers, we simply refer to <i>Wintle </i>and
<i>Rosenmuller in loc., </i>where some interesting information is given <i>in
extenso. Poole</i>&#8217;<i>s Synopsis </i>also supplies much verbal criticism.
<i>Oecolampadius </i>passes by altogether any explanation of these instruments,
but makes some very appropriate practical comments. True religious worship, he
justly observes, does not need this variety of external incentive; a pure
conscience with trust in God and obedience to his laws is the best music in his
eyes, while he applauds Plato&#8217;s description of the best music which a soul
can offer to its Creator. Antichrist, he asserts, delights in such outward and
sensual gratification&#8217;s, while the advanced Christian worships in spirit,
calmly, quietly, and inwardly. True religion is thus the antagonist of all
outward and idolatrous service; it is not prompted by fear nor promoted by a
tyrant&#8217;s command, but requiring no visible parade of instrumental
minstrelsy, it worships with a cheerful heart and a free and buoyant spirit,
inspired by the hope of everlasting life through the promises of God in Christ.
This sentiment, although 300 years old, is worthy of the Reformer who uttered

astonishment in this way than allude to what he could not comprehend, the
appearance of the Logos in human form. <i>Calvin </i>correctly states it to be
&#8220;one of the angels.&#8221; Angels are called in Scripture, says <i>Wells,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;183807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
38:7. &#8220;Some angelic appearance&#8221; is the correct comment of <i>Wintle.
Jerome </i>takes it as a type of Christ descending into Hades, and <i>Munter
</i>asserts it to be our Lord himself. <i>Wells </i>neither affirms nor denies
this view, which has been held by a number of commentators who consider that the
Logos appeared in human form on several occasions during patriarchal and
Ante-Messianic times. <i>Justin Martyr </i>makes the same assertion when
describing the pre-existence of the Logos to his philosophic persecutors.
<i>Willet </i>leans to this view, after summing up a variety of opinions from
able writers. Some of his reflections on the general narrative are edifying; but
his discussion on the nature of angels is fancifully unprofitable, and his
ignorance of natural science is singularly displayed in his treatment of the
ordinary and extraordinary action of fire. <i>Rosenmuller </i>translates,
&#8220;like a son of the gods,&#8221; that is an angel, and the writers quoted
by <i>Poole </i>come to the same conclusion; but <i>Oecolampadius, </i>thinks

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Daniel
4:25</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE narrative of this chapter has met with much
disbelief among the skeptical school of theology. The want of corresponding
profane history is a subject of complaint. <i>Origen </i>found himself deserted
by all ancient historians, and <i>Jerome</i> searched them in vain for any
confirmation of the sacred text. We must remember, however, that the historians
whom we reckon ancient, are very modern with reference to these early times.
<i>Megasthenes, </i>for instance, wrote rather earlier than <i>Berosus,
</i>about 280 A.C., at the court of Seleucus Nicator, king of Babylon, and we
have only portions of their writings second hand. <i>Diocles, </i>the author of
a Persian history, and <i>Abydenus, </i>of an Assyrian and Median, obtained
their materials from Chaldee traditions, many ages after the events recorded.
The Chaldee chroniclers, <i>Hengstenberg </i>assures us, were, notorious for
their national vanity and boasting, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f360</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and were not likely to record anything derogatory to their earliest hero. But
even <i>Bertholdt </i>is compelled to confess that Abydenus has preserved a
legend similar to the narrative of this chapter. &#8220;On ascending the roof of
his palace, he became inspired by some god, and delivered himself as follows:
&#8212; Babylonians! I Nebuchadnezzar foretell you a calamity that is to happen,
which neither my ancestor Bel nor queen Beltis can persuade the Fates to avert.
There shall come a Persian mule, (one having parents of different countries,)
having your own gods in alliance with him, and shall impose servitude upon you,
with the head of a Mede, the boast of the Assyrians.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f361</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now madness and inspiration were usually connected by the ancients; the time and
place too, correspond with Daniel&#8217;s narrative; the extasis occurred after
the completion of his conquests, and the phrase, &#8220;by some god,&#8221;
refers to a foreign deity, whom we know to be the Jehovah of the Hebrews. The
narrative of the frenzy which rendered him unfit for government, is allowed to
be credible by the chief skeptics of the continent. <i>Michaelis </i>allows
&#8220;that this calamity more frequently attacks great and extraordinary minds
than ordinary men.&#8221; Our physicians can now explain the reason through
their improved knowledge of the brain and its functions. Pathological and
psychological science is here more useful than all the conjectures of
disbelieving theologians. In the early days of the Church, the greatest
difficulty was found in taking this narrative literally: hence expositors
treated it as an allegory. The king was held to represent Satan falling from
heaven, and the whole account of his dwelling with the beasts of the field was

<div><font face="Palatino">The disbelief of the narrative above referred to may
have arisen from an erroneous interpretation of the sacred text. For some
writers have affirmed a complete metamorphosis of the man into the beast; a
conclusion by no means warranted by the language of the passage. <i>Tertullian
</i>has correctly explained the clause, &#8220;his hair became like
eagle&#8217;s feathers,&#8221; by <i>capilli incuria horrorem aquilinum
pr&aelig;ferente, </i>since it was a natural consequence of his wild mode of
life, and a usual mark of the sensualizing effect of prolonged insanity. And
with reference to the time of this affliction, <i>Hengstenberg </i>quotes
<i>Calvin </i>with approbation, for agreeing with the idea of an indefinite
period implied by the word &#8220;seven.&#8221; <i>Calvin, </i>however, inclines
too much towards the theory of the indefinite use of definite numbers. There
seems no good reason why the number &#8220;seven&#8221; should not be taken
strictly and literally, nor why the word &#8220;times&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wnd[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gni-danin, </i>should not mean years. Even <i>Hengstenberg </i>gives way too
much to the plausible conceits of his wily antagonists. <i>Rosenmuller
</i>correctly limits the expression to seven years, a period by no means
unnatural for the continuance of a highly excited state of the brain, producing
mania, accompanied by all the symptoms mentioned in this chapter.
<i>Oecolampadius </i>views it as a case of mental disease, and quotes many
similar narratives from <i>Aben-Ezra, Pausanias, </i>and <i>Augustine,
</i>bringing forward the fables of the heathen poets, as illustrating the
passage. For the opinion of <i>Tertullian, </i>and various Jewish and
continental writers, <i>Kitto</i>&#8217;<i>s Bibl. Cyclop. </i>may be consulted,

<div><font face="Palatino">THIS monarch probably lived but a single year after
his recovery; and some writers have thought that his restoration produced a
conversion to the worship of the one true God. But <i>Hengstenberg </i>agrees
with our author: &#8220;Compare CALVIN on the passages,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;who strikingly proves from them the incorrectness of the opinion of very
many expositors as to the radical and entire conversion of
Nebuchadnezzar.&#8221; <i>Calvin </i>is clearly right, for it was customary with
the Persians to blend the doctrines of Zoroaster with the Babylonian astrology. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f363</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The scriptural language of the king has been treated as an argument against the
authenticity of the decree. <i>Eichhorn and Bertholdt </i>object to his speaking
like an orthodox Jew in the phraseology of the Old Testament. But the affinity
of certain phrases with other passages of Scripture, is no argument against its
authenticity. The monarch had held much intercourse with Daniel; he had
doubtless heard his method of expressing reverence and respect for the one true
God, and he would repeat such expressions the more exactly in proportion to his
want of personal experience of their meaning. In the case of the edict of Cyrus,
brief as it is, several references are found to the prophecies of Isaiah.

As to the change of person from the third to the first, <i>Hengstenberg
</i>approves of <i>Calvin</i>&#8217;<i>s </i>suggestion. <i>Oecolampadius
</i>considers the king really converted, and through knowing the angel to be the
Christ, he supposes him not only a convert, but an apostle. This is far too
favorable a view of his character; but it is instructive to ascertain the
decisions of various eminent Reformers, and to observe which of them stands the
scrutinizing test of an appeal to posterity.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THIS monarch is here said to be the son of
Nebuchadnezzar. The Duke of Manchester takes this literally, while the usual
opinion is that he was his grandson. &#8220;No king,&#8221; says he, &#8220;in
Berosus, Megasthenes, or Polyhistor, corresponds with him. The Scripture says
that Nebuchadnezzar was his father, which most people say means grandfather, and
it is not to be denied, that by son, grandson may be intended; but in this case
it is contrary to all the evidence we have on the subject. The author of the
Scholastical History reports that Belshazzar was son of the daughter of Darius.
Nebuchadnezzar the Second did, as I conceive, marry the daughter of Darius,
which would make Belshazzar his son. But admitting that Belshazzar was paternal
grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, none of the successors of Nebuchadnezzar could have
been in that relation to him.&#8221; The Persian writer Merkhond is the next
quoted, by whose help the duke identifies Ka&#8217;oos with Nebuchadnezzar the
First, Afrasiab with Astyages, and Siyawesh, the son of Ka&#8217;oos, with
Belshazzar. It is then conjectured that this king never reigned except during
his father&#8217;s lifetime: if he was &#8220;the king&#8221; during his
father&#8217;s madness, the omission of his name by profane historians is thus
accounted for. An Oxford MS. is quoted to shew &#8220;that Nebuchadnezzar and
Belshazzar were reigning at Babylon when Darius and Coresch were reigning over
Persia.

through the life of his son and his son&#8217;s son. Ptolemy&#8217;s
Astronomical Canon is the best known authority for the history of
Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s successors, as we have detailed them in a former

The last of these kings is Nabonadius, and he is supposed to be the same as the
Nabonnedus of Berosus, the Labynetus of Herodotus, and the Belshazzar of Daniel.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f368</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
During his reign, says Berosus, the walls of the city near the river were
strengthened by brick-work and bitumen; and in its seventeenth year Cyrus
advanced against Babylon, the king met him with a large army, but was defeated,
and then enclosed himself within Borsippa. Cyrus then took Babylon, and having
determined to pull down its outer fortifications, he returned to Borsippa and
besieged it. Nabonnedus then gave himself up, and Cyrus permitted him to close
his life peaceably in Carmania, where he remained till his death. The narrative
of Herodotus is slightly at variance with this. Cyrus made war against
Labynetus, the son of Nitocris, a very spirited and powerful queen, and
succeeded to the kingdom of Assyria &#8220;from his fathers.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f369</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Having turned the stream of the river Euphrates, he entered the city through its
bed, and when the center was captured, those who dwelt at the extremities were
ignorant of their disaster, for they &#8220;were celebrating a festival that day
with dancing and all manner of rejoicing, till they received certain information
of the general fate. And thus Babylon was the first time taken.&#8221; Herodotus
also records its second capture through the treachery of Zopyrus, in the reign
of Darius Hystaspes, (lib. 3 section. 159;) and with this second capture the
noble duke supposes the scriptural narrative to be co-incident.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Cyropaedia of Xenophon affords its testimony to a
similar event, and as its historic value has been altogether denied, we cannot
certainly pronounce the event <i>the same. </i>Vitringa has vindicated its
historical truth, and <i>Gesenius </i>and <i>Bertholdt </i>have admitted it.
<i>Hengstenberg </i>quotes lib. 7 section. 5, combines it with Herod., lib. 1
section. 191, and remarks, &#8220;This testimony of Xenophon, too, is so much
the more in our favor, as it confirms the particular circumstance that the
nobles were at the feast assembled at the table of the king.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f370</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He adds, &#8220;The precise agreement of Daniel with Herodotus and Xenophon is
acknowledged by <i>Munter, </i>50 100 page 67, to be astonishing, and even
<i>Gesenius, Z. Jes. </i>1, page 655, cannot help calling it very
astonishing.&#8221; For a fuller discussion of all details, we refer at length
to his conclusive work, merely giving our vote in his favor, and against the
ingenious hypothesis which it has become necessary to state and
explain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE GREAT FEAST. &#8212; The original word for feast
is &#8220;bread,&#8221; and this being united with &#8220;wine,&#8221;<i>
</i>becomes the usual mode of describing an eastern feast, where the people are
all great eaters of bread. &#8220;To eat bread,&#8221; and to &#8220;set on
bread,&#8221; is the scriptural method of indicating a feast. The number of the
guests may not have amounted to a thousand, as this is an eastern expression for
a large and surprising number, yet it is not incredible, since Harmer has
informed us that &#8220;a quadrangular court, within the first or outer gate of
the palace, was made use of for this purpose.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f371</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Willet </i>reminds us of this eastern way of multiplying numbers by alluding
to the 10,000 guests said to be present at Alexander&#8217;s feast, and each of
whom received a golden cup. Ptolemy, the father of Cleopatra, made a similar
banquet for Pompey. It is supposed to have been an annual solemnity in honor of
some deity, and the art of &#8220;tasting of the wine&#8221; (verse 2) alludes
to the custom of tasting the libation previous to the sacrifice. <i>Wintle
</i>very appositely quotes <i>Virgil, AEn. </i>lib. i. 741,

of sacrificing to small images, of various metals, in human shape, an idolatry
described in Baruch, Daniel 6: 3. <i>Willet </i>quotes Junius as stating that
this feast occurred on the 16th day of the month Loon, when it approached in
character the Saturnalia and Bacchanalia of the Greeks. &#8220;Tasting the
wine&#8221; is rendered by the Vulgate and the Alexandrine version as if its
sense were &#8220;drunken,&#8221; and thus the general idea of licentious
revelry is carried out.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">CALVIN doubts whether this was the wife or
grandmother of Belshazzar. But there is another possible solution. <i>Prideaux
</i>supposes she was the mother of the king, following the narrative of
Herodotus, though <i>Grotius </i>and <i>Josephus </i>represent her as the widow
of Nebuchadnezzar. The author of &#8220;The Times of Daniel&#8221; differs from
the received view of the times of Nitocris; she reigned, he concludes, &#8220;in
the generation before Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s father.&#8221;  Her name is not
found in the Astronomical Canon, and consequently either Herodotus or the Canon
must be mistaken. Nitocris, says Herodotus, lived five generations after
Semiramis, but then, according to <i>Bryant, </i>eight different periods have
been assigned for his reign, between A.C. 2177 and 713. Notwithstanding the
celebrity which Herodotus has conferred upon his name, it is impossible now to
ascertain whether she was the queen-mother alluded to in the text, but it is
equally injudicious to pronounce positively that she was not. <i>Hengstenberg
</i>has discussed this question with his usual sagacity. <i>Heeren </i>makes her
the contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar, and probably his wife; but <i>Hengstenberg
</i>inclines to the view of her being the queen-mother. &#8220;We may then
justly compare what Herodotus says of Nitocris with that which occurs here of
the queen, and it only need be quoted to shew a perfect agreement.&#8221;

some of the arguments which induce the best divines to rely on its historical
accuracy.</font><br></div>

chadi, </i>the third son of Japhet, but this conjecture is rendered futile, when
we remember that the first establishment of the kingdom dates only 150 years
before Cyrus. It must never be forgotten, when treating of these early times,
how very modern all writers are who lived after the times of Solomon. <i>To us
</i>they appear ancient, and their authority for the truth of an event
conclusive; but those historians of Asia, upon whom we are compelled to rely,
lived many ages after the occurrences which they record. It seems now to be
admitted, that we have lost many centuries between the flood and Abraham; hence
the attempt to assign the origin of any empire to the immediate descendants of
Noah is highly deceptive. We can only take the best testimony which we have, but
with it we must correct the uncertainty of even the most positive assertions.
The Medes, if we may trust Herodotus, were an offset from the Assyrians. They
broke off from their sway, after the Assyrians had held the empire of Upper Asia
for five hundred and twenty years. The interesting story of Deioces, and the
foundation of Ecbatana is recorded, the account of that city corresponding
precisely with that handed down to us in the Book of Judith. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f374</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In process of time the neighboring tribes were subdued and united, till
Phraortes, having reduced the Persians under his dominion, led the united
nations against the Assyrians. Cyaxares his son succeeded him, and both extended
and consolidated the Median sway. Astyages, the grandfather of Cyrus, was his
son and successor; and during the whole period of these monarchs&#8217; reigns
province after province was added to the growing empire. The constant testimony
of history from Herodotus to Ctesias asserts the acquisition of Media by Cyrus
to have been a forcible seizure. Here our chief object is to impress upon the
reader the scantiness of our early materials, and the distance of time at which
some of the historians who record them lived after the events. Ctesias, for
instance, was a young physician at the Court of Artaxerxes, the brother of Cyrus
the younger. Although he wrote twenty-three books of Persian history, we have
but a few fragments collected by the diligence of Photion. Our attention is
therefore turned with the greatest earnestness towards the deciphering of the
monuments which abound on the banks of the rivers of Babylonia, and throughout
the whole land of Shinar. These have become the best evidence in favor of the
trustworthiness of Daniel, and against the ingenious and inconsistent guesses of

corresponds with Darius the first in profane history? that the second in each
equally agree; and that the third Darius, with whom the list terminates in
Scripture, is the third Darius with whom the line of Persian kings
closes?&#8221; There are strong marks in corroboration of the Median of this
verse being Hystaspes; some of these are as follows: &#8212; <i>First, </i>each
is said to have taken Babylon. Both levied taxes, so that the second verse of
chapter. 6 is said to be parallel to Herodotus, Book 3, and Strabo, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f375</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

10:1, who reigned &#8220;from India even to Ethiopia.&#8221;

1:1.) &#8220;Now, Ahash-verosh, (meaning Ahasuerus,) who succeeded Darius the
Median, reigned over India,&#8221; and, according to Herodotus, Darius Hystaspes
conquered India; hence this Mede was Darius Hystaspes. Pliny&#8217;s testimony
is brought forward to shew that Susa was built by this Darius; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f376</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Ahasuerus resided at Shushan, which is identical with Susa, hence the conclusion
is the same. Other reasons are given, and other collateral assertions made.
Authorities are quoted by which it is laid down that Ahasuerus was Xerxes, the
history of Esther occurred during the captivity, the son of Ahasuerus was Darius
Nothus, the third Darius was Codomanus. &#8220;To complete the evidence, I will

<div><font face="Palatino">The commonly received view is stated shortly by

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f378</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the son of Astyages, the uncle and father-in-law of Cyrus. AEschylus, in his
tragedy of the <i>Persae,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f379</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>introduces Darius the son of Hystaspes, recounting his origin from Darius
the Mede. <i>Josephus, </i>in the tenth Book of his Antiquities, says he was the
son of Astyages; and <i>Theodoret, </i>in his Commentary, identifies him with
Cyaxares. <i>Jerome </i>states that, in conjunction with his uncle Cyrus, he
subverted the Chaldean empire.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f380</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
says <i>Wintle, </i>&#8220;we cannot be at a loss to determine who was Darius
the Mede; and if even the defeat of Astyages be received according to Herodotus,
and it be placed in the tenth year of Cyrus&#8217;s reign over Persia Proper,
yet there seems no necessity to conclude but that the kingdom of Media might
still, with the consent of Cyrus, be continued to Cyaxares, his mother&#8217;s
brother, who might retain it till his death, after the conquest of Babylon,
which Herodotus attributes to Cyrus, after he had reduced the neighboring
powers.&#8221; He next proceeds to obviate one or two chronological difficulties
often considered as weighty objections to Xenophon&#8217;s account. &#8220;The
name of Darius is omitted in the Canon, although he is allowed to have reigned
more than one year, if he reigned at all. How shall we then reconcile his
history with the Canon? and where or in what part must this reign be placed? The
same answer will serve for both inquiries. The Canon certainly allots nine years
to Cyrus over Babylon, of which space the two former years are usually allowed
to coincide with the reign of Cyaxares or Darius the Mede by the advocates of
Xenophon.&#8221; A MS. of <i>Archbishop Secker </i>is then quoted, in which he
gives reasons why Berosus might have overlooked this reign as short-lived and
nominal. <i>Prideaux </i>and <i>Usher, </i>and the <i>Ancient Universal History,
</i>are referred to for additional information. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f381</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
With reference to the period before us, it is concluded, from the close of this
Daniel 5, &#8220;that Darius the Mede did not begin his reign till after the
capture of Babylon; and this event I am inclined to place in the next year after
the 17th of Nabonadius, in the 210th year of the Chaldean era, or 538 years
before Christ, which was the first of Cyrus&#8217;s nine years. Whether the
defeat of Nabonadius and the taking of the city happened near the same time, I
need not determine; but it seems clear from Daniel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270531&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:31,) as well as from Xenophon, that the king was slain on the same night that
the city was taken; and this, I apprehend, must have happened about the real
year of the captivity 67, supposing the fourth of Jehoiakim to agree with the
year 605 before Christ, according to Blair.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the researches of <i>Hengstenberg
</i>afford us valuable aid in discussing and reconciling the various statements
of historians. The silence of Herodotus and Ctesias concerning a Median king of
Babylon is noticed, and even concealment on the part of the Persians is shewn to
be highly probable.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">IF the period of the city&#8217;s capture could be
accurately determined, many difficulties would be cleared up. CALVIN supposes it
to have occurred in the last and eighth year of Belshazzar&#8217;s reign, but
the majority of commentators place it in the seventeenth or eighteenth year.
<i>Willet </i>makes his third year his last, as also <i>Bullinger </i>and
<i>Oecolampadius, </i>and this is done by following the short Hebrew Chronicle,
which places it at the fifty-second year of the desolation of Jerusalem, and the
seventieth of the kingdom of Babylon. The Oriental Chronicle, according to the
author of &#8220;<i>The Times of Daniel,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>assigns twenty years,
and the Alexandrian Chronicle only four to this monarch; and such being the
conflicting testimony of the most ancient and authentic documents, it naturally
happens that modern writers select their own dates and their own systems
according, first, to their own acquaintance with the subject; and next, to their
own judgment of the best selection of authorities which can be made. The only
class of divines who appear disingenuous in such selections are those Germans
who attempt to impugn the historical accuracy of this Prophet, by tacitly
assuming that there is no real, and positive, and consistent knowledge to be
obtained from profane writers, and then by asserting that a pseudo-Daniel has
displayed either ignorance, carelessness, or deception. They appeal to the
historians of Greece, as if they were contemporary with the events which they
record, and prefer throwing doubt upon the sacred narrative, to sifting the
evidence upon which they believe the profane.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Daniel

<div><font face="Palatino">THIS division of the kingdom into 120 provinces is
exactly in accordance with the assertion of Xenophon, who says that Cyrus
appointed satraps over the conquered nations. <i>Usher, </i>in his <i>Annals,
</i>thinks that Darius followed the suggestion of Cyrus, who instituted this
method of government. This verse is reconciled with the first of Esther, by
remembering that after the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, and of Thrace and
India by Darius Hystaspes, seven provinces were added to the number. <i>Junius,
</i>according to <i>Willet, </i>states, that after spending a year in settling
the affairs of Babylon, he resigned all power to Darius. He approves of
Calvin&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;<i>regnare in commune,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>implying
the joint reign of both kings. <i>Josephus </i>is in error in multiplying the
number by three. The reason for the appointment of these presidents may be
understood variously. The Latin interpreter, says <i>Willet,
</i>translates</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">
qzn</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>nezek, </i>by <i>molestiam, </i>meaning
&#8220;trouble,&#8221; Darius is represented as sixty-two years of age, and
naturally fatigued by the wear and tear of an active life. Daniel is elevated to
an office equivalent to that of the Turkish grand Vizier, and the crime imputed
to him seems similar to that of Rome &#8212; &#8220;crimen laesae
<i>majestatis,</i>&#8221; a kind of high treason. The word

<i>gnillah,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel

the forensic sense, equivalent to the Greek<i> aijtiva. </i>These presidents and
princes came in concourse and tumultuously before the king. The Vulgate
&#8220;surripuerunt,&#8221; came by stealth, is disapproved by
<i>Wintle.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Daniel
6:7.</b></font><font face="Palatino"> THE DECREE<i> </i>by which Daniel was
entrapped has occasioned the special cavil of <i>Bertholdt </i>and his
adherents. They have treated it as an erroneous fiction, but have been
appositely refuted by <i>Hengstenberg. </i>Oriental kings, he reminds us, were
often treated as objects of exclusive worship. <i>Heeren </i>has stated
&#8220;that the kings of the Medes and Persians were regarded and worshipped as
representations and incarnations of Ormuzd.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f382</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the sacred books of the Zend religion, &#8220;Iran, the Medo-Bactrian kingdom
under Gustasp, is to him the image of the kingdom of Ormuzd; the king himself
the image of Ormuzd; Turan, the northern nomad land, where Afrasiat rules, is
the image of the kingdom of darkness, under the rule of Ahriman.&#8221; The king
was the visible manifestation of Ormuzd, like him, commanding, with unlimited
power, the seven princes of the empire; next in rank to him were the
representatives of the seven Amshaspands, who stood round the throne of Ormuzd.
Similar testimony respecting the worship paid to the monarchs of the East, is
given by Plutarch, Xenophon, Socrates, and Arrian. Curtius distinctly asserts,
that the Persians worshipped their kings among their gods, so that the
credibility of Daniel is fully vindicated by the records of profane antiquity.
On the royal tombs at Persepolis, there are various sculptures representing the
Persian kings as gods, and in De Sacy&#8217;s Persian inscriptions, they are
termed the offspring of gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Daniel
6:10</b></font><font face="Palatino">. DANIEL&#8217;S CONDUCT AND PRAYER, as
here recorded, have been questioned by some German critics, on the ground of
practices and usages as yet unknown in Upper Asia. The custom of praying towards
Jerusalem, it is said, did not arise among the Jews living abroad, till after
the rebuilding of the temple. But it must not be forgotten that it prevailed
among the Jews from early times. David prayed towards the sanctuary, and raised
his hands towards it. The Dedication prayer of Solomon contains a distinct
injunction to the same effect. The very place, says Stolberg, where the temple
had stood and was again to stand, was holy to Daniel. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f383</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The hours, at which the Prophet offered up his prayer are said to belong to the
fine-spun religiousness of the later Jews. But this assertion is made in
forgetfulness of the ancient custom of all nations to have fixed and invariable
periods for the worship of their deities. <i>Willet </i>approves of
<i>Calvin</i>&#8217;<i>s </i>comments on this passage, and <i>Oecolampadius
</i>considers it a thanksgiving for the encouraging beginning, happy success,
and prosperous end of our undertakings. <i>Willet </i>also discusses the
propriety of Daniel&#8217;s exposing himself thus openly to the malice of his
enemies, after he knew of the king&#8217;s decree. He agrees on the whole with
the practical comment of <i>Calvin, </i>and adduces it as an example of
perseverance in the line of duty, in full confidence of the protecting power of
God, and in defiance of all the malice of the most inveterate
foes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>Daniel 6:10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino">THE OPEN WINDOWS TOWARDS JERUSALEM. &#8212;
Various writers have supposed this action of the Prophet&#8217;s to be the
result of ostentation. <i>Calvin </i>has treated this point ably, and
<i>Wetstein, </i>in his Notes on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
1:13, has explained the nature of &#8220;the upper chamber&#8221; in the Jewish
houses, and their use either as oratories or for other solemn or festive
purposes. <i>Shaw, </i>in his Travels, alludes to their structure and use. The
light was usually admitted into these upper rooms through large windows, and the
Jews naturally turned towards Jerusalem in prayer, with earnest longing for
speedy deliverance. The &#8220;three times a-day&#8221; has been used by
<i>Bellarmine</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f384</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as an argument for the canonical hours of the Romish Church, and <i>Pintus
</i>goes further to insist on seven, according to Psalm 119. But all these
arguments which enforce Christian duties by Jewish practices are erroneous.
<i>Calvin</i>&#8217;<i>s </i>principle is judiciously stated, but it is founded
on enlightened and Christian common sense, and not in a blind adherence to
Jewish traditions. Similar principles should guide us as to praying towards the
east. <i>Oecolampadius </i>refers to the supposed Apostolic tradition of
worshipping towards the east, but he reprobates it as superstitious. <i>Nos
patriam nostram in c&aelig;lis habemus, et a Deo originem. </i>Irenaeus 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f385</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
ascribes this superstition as a heresy to the Ebionites. Daniel&#8217;s open
profession of his faith in God has been censured as too bold and in judged for
our imitation, but it has also been ably vindicated as an example of
perseverance in religious duty when our conscience justifies us in maintaining
God&#8217;s truth before men. <i>Willet </i>approves of <i>Calvin</i>&#8217;<i>s
</i>distinction &#8220;of Confession, that it is of two sorts, <i>cum palam
testamur, quod est in animo, et ne aliquod perversoe simulationis signum

<div><font face="Palatino">While this sheet is passing through the press, a very

<div><font face="Palatino">COULD we ascertain accurately when death closed
&#8220;the reign of Darius,&#8221; most of the controversies concerning the
history of these times and personages would be set at rest. We have first to
determine <i>who Darius was? </i>and secondly, to discover whether a portion of
his reign is contemporaneous with that of Cyrus? With respect to the first
point, it ought to be fully understood that there is no actual correspondence
between this monarch and any well-attested ruler mentioned in profane history.
The balance of probabilities is in favor of his being Cyaxares, but we have
already stated how Xenophon, Ctesias, and Herodotus differ on the point; and we
are careful to repeat this, because the futility of the Neologian arguments
might otherwise entrap the unwary. For instance, <i>Dr. Wells </i>has the
following Note: &#8212; &#8220;It is to be observed that in Ptolemy&#8217;s
Canon the two years of Darius the Mede&#8217;s reign are reckoned to Cyrus, who
accordingly has therein nine years assigned for his reign; whereas Xenophon
assigns but seven years to it, reckoning the first year the same as Ezra doth,
viz., from the death of Darius and Cambyses.&#8221; <i>Wintle </i>again states,
&#8220;there is no doubt but Darius the Mede, whoever he was, reigned, according
to Daniel, from the capture of Babylon till this same first year of Cyrus, or
till the commencement of the reign allotted by Scripture to Cyrus the
Persian.&#8221; (Preface, where reference is made to a Memoir by <i>M. Freret,
</i>containing many just and accurate dates assigned to the life and
transactions of Cyrus.) The reader cannot fail to perceive that this sentence
leaves the two important questions in as much doubt as ever. DR. EADIE, of the
American Presbyterian Church, states, too, positively, &#8220;The kingdom of
Babylon was given by Cyrus to Darius the Mede, or Cyaxares II., as a reward for
his services; and after his death, at the end of two years, this kingdom
returned to Cyrus, and hence Cyrus is spoken of as if he were the successor of
Darius at Babylon.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270628&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
6:28.&#8221; &#8212; (Art., <i>Daniel, </i>in his <i>Bibl. Cycl.</i>)<i> Willet
</i>informs us that <i>Tertullian </i>and <i>Cyril of Jerusalem </i>took Darius
for Darius Hystaspes, and the noble Duke, to whom we have already referred,
agrees in this opinion, and argues very elaborately in its
favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The German Neologians have not been slow to construct
a charge of inaccuracy against Daniel, in consequence of these historic
difficulties. Bertholdt, Bleek, and De Wette, treat it as an error to call
Cyaxares II. by the name of Darius, and suppose it a confusion with the son of
Hystaspes. But before the commentator on Scripture ventures to use the phrase,
&#8220;historic inaccuracy,&#8221; he must first clearly ascertain what historic
accuracy really is. An unlearned reader might suppose from their reasonings that
all the profane historians agreed in their accounts, and that the only element
of confusion was that introduced by the narrative of Scripture. But the truth is
far otherwise. No two authors agree in their statements throughout. Ancient
history is, in fact, simply an ideal deduction from a variety of conflicting
traditions. Of Cyaxares II., for instance, neither Herodotus nor Justin say
anything. Neither of them mention any son of Astyages. Diodorus Siculus, Strabo,
and Polyaenus, agree with them in asserting that the Median empire closed with
Astyages, and the Persian began at once with Cyrus; and yet there is evidence to
shew that Darius the Mede was a real person. &#8220;Still farther,&#8221; says
Hengstenberg, &#8220;the author agrees in another special fact with profane
history. Xenophon relates 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f386</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that soon after the taking of Babylon, the conquered lands were divided into
provinces, and governors set over them. All this is stated in our book,
too.&#8221; Are we, indeed, to infer, from a mere difference of names, that the
author is chargeable with confounding them? The Cambyses of profane writers is
called in the book of Ezra, Achaschverosh (Ahasuerus). Pseudo-smerdis bears in
profane writers two different names &#8212; in Ctesias, Spendates; in Justin,
Oropastes; and in Ezra he appears under a third name, Artachshasta (Artaxerxes).
&#8220;Now, why is this appearance in all other cases unanimously explained on
the ground that the names of kings were not <i>nomina propria, </i>but surnames,
whilst, on the contrary, in this single instance, this explanation is not once
proposed as possible? And yet in this very case this explanation is quite
natural, since it is generally allowed that the name Darius in particular is an
appellation. That it was a mere title appears from this, that several different
kings bear it.&#8221; Herbelot says the name Dara is Persian, and appellative,
signifying &#8220;sovereign.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f387</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we descend to the historians of the Christian
era, we find in the Armenian Chronicle of Eusebius a confirmation of the
narrative under review. In a short appendix to a fragment of Abydenus, found
also in the <i>Praeparatio Evangelica, </i>Darius is distinctly mentioned as
king; so that if it be impossible to be certain as to the identity of this king
with Cyaxares, yet it must be remembered that profane history, <i>independently
of Scripture, </i>is at variance with itself, and that no new clement of discord
is introduced by our Prophet. Let the objector first settle what the events
connected with the overthrow of Babylon from uninspired authorities really were,
and we shall then be prepared to shew that the writer of this book was free from
inaccuracies, and that all the obscurity hovering over the subject arises from
our very imperfect knowledge of the occurrences of this period. And the more
fully the assertions of the Neologists are investigated, the more baseless will
their charges against this Prophet of Jehovah appear.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE prolongation of our Prophet&#8217;s life till the
era specified in this verse, is worthy of our notice, that we may, if possible,
accurately ascertain his age at leading periods of his history. We cannot
ascertain precisely the year of his entrance into public life. He was born
shortly before King Josiah&#8217;s death, probably about 620 B.C.; and thus he
had many opportunities of cultivating that early piety for which he was
conspicuous. He was about fourteen years old when taken captive to Babylon.
Three years afterwards, the king of Israel threw off the Babylonian yoke, and
thus he and his companions became hostages and forerunners of the capture of the
whole nation. From <i>Jahn</i>&#8217;<i>s Biblical Antiquities,</i> we learn how
skilled he was in various sciences after three years&#8217; training, (pages 99,
100;) and the high opinion which was entertained of his integrity, wisdom, and
piety, is confirmed by this remarkable honor paid to him by the Prophet
<i>Ezekiel. </i>He is connected, <i>while alive, </i>with Noah and Job. (See
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
14:14, and Calvin&#8217;s comment on the passage in our Edition, volume

<div><font face="Palatino">The dream and its interpretation in Daniel 2 occurred
during Daniel&#8217;s youth, and resulted in his promotion with his three
friends to the highest offices of the kingdom. We now lose sight of him for
thirty years, and it is impossible to determine whether he sat at the
king&#8217;s gate during the whole of this period. The erection of the image on
the plains of Dura, and the subsequent punishment of his three companions, seem
inconsistent with his residence at that time at Babylon as an adviser of his
sovereign. The three &#8220;children,&#8221; as they are termed in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
1:17, were now about fifty years of age; and it has become necessary to remark
this, because some have spoken of them as still children when thus miraculously
delivered from destruction. We too often take for granted impressions of this
kind, which we have imperceptibly imbibed in our earliest days; and besides
this, the works of the great masters in painting have fostered the error. These
splendid productions of European art are often glaringly untrue, yet while based
upon fabulous anachronisms, they too often adhere to the imagination, and
influence our thoughts in days of more mature advancement. At the period of the
dream in Daniel 4 Daniel was about fifty years of age; and thus we have another
gap of about fifteen years. Belshazzar had now ascended his grandfather&#8217;s
throne. The mystic characters on the wall soon reveal a fearful reality. Darius
the Mede still esteems the upright counselor, and he had become a venerable
&#8220;ancient of days&#8221; before he is thrust into the lion&#8217;s den.
During the first year of King Darius, he learned, from the Book of Jeremiah, the
approaching period of Judah&#8217;s deliverance. During the third year of Cyrus,
he is favored with a vision on the banks of the Tigris.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:1-4.) We cannot ascertain how long he lived after this period, but he was at
least eighty years of age when he died. Various assertions and traditions exist
among the Jews respecting both the time and place of his decease, and these have
passed current, through the unsuspecting simplicity of some of our older
expounders, who record as certain the hazardous statements of the authorities on
which they rely. <i>Dr. Wells, </i>after comparing various dates, concludes,
&#8220;that Daniel was about eighty-nine or ninety years old in the third year
of Cyrus;&#8221; he pays no regard to the conjectures of some, who make him to
have lived one hundred and thirty-eight, or one hundred and fifty years, and
adds the possibility of his reaching one hundred years.</font><br></div>

to disabuse the public mind of the Romish ideas connected with what they term,

While perusing this volume, the reader must often have felt the difference
between the state of the world in the days of Nebuchadnezzar and his own. Those
were emphatically days of visions, and marvels, and visibly divine
interpositions. We, on the contrary, pass on along the even tenor of the walk of
life, without expecting to behold a hand-writing on the wall, or to experience
the all-devouring heat of a &#8220;burning fiery furnace.&#8221; We see no
vision in the night season foretelling the wonders of an unknown future, and
expect neither magician nor prophet to expound with the authority of heaven the
images of our sleeping hours. Yet, with our Reformer, we see the world agitated
in all quarters with unexpected revolutions. Oppression, and intrigue, and
tyranny, prevail among the rulers of Europe and of Christendom, and there seems
no human means adequate to the task of stemming the tide of recklessness and
infidelity as it overflows the nations. If these comments on scriptural prophecy
are to be useful in our day and generation, they need some connecting links of
interpretation which may apply the general principles enunciated to the
practical problem to be worked out. Otherwise, we either make no intelligent use
of such a history as this volume contains, or else we apply it wrong. The latter
error is a very common one; and as many are liable to its commission, we trust
these CONCLUDING REMARKS will be found suitable and instructive. It may appear
to many readers that CALVIN in his PRACTICAL EXHORTATIONS overlooks this
difference between a miraculous dispensation and the ordinary condition of
God&#8217;s people under the New Covenant. If he be somewhat open to this
charge, it is readily accounted for by the times in which he lived. CALVIN, like
Daniel, was an exile from his fatherland. The house of Valois and their tyrant
kings were to him the exact counterparts of the Babylonian monarchs. They were
absolute sovereigns, and most ferocious persecutors of the people of the Lord.
The Medici, the Guises, and the Lorraines of his day were to him the very
antitypes of the nobles who fawned upon Nebuchadnezzar, and of the presidents
who inveigled Darius. In his DEDICATORY EPISTLE prefixed to this volume, the
pious in France are represented as in a position exactly similar to that of the
Jews during their captivity. The parallel being in each case so striking and so
different to what we see and experience in these days, we need not be surprised
at CALVIN&#8217;S expectation of special interpositions, and at our own
backwardness to appreciate the full suitability of his comments. Now there is
clearly a sense in which such &#8220;special deliverance&#8217;s&#8221; are
real, and a sense in which they are not. And as this is a point of some
importance involving the idea of the Almighty which our Reformer has presented
to us in the preceding pages, we shall comment at some length on a few passages
of importance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For instance, on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:21, and following, we have a full reply to unbelieving objections to
God&#8217;s providential government of the world. The profane are said to
consider all things acted upon by a &#8220;blind impulse,&#8221; and
&#8220;others affirm the human race to be a kind of sport to God, since men are
tossed about like balls.&#8221; The chief cavils of the Reformation Period were
those which proceeded from complete skepticism. Philosophers having thrown off
the superstitions of Popery naturally doubted and disputed all things. The
reasoners of CALVIN&#8217;S days were something like those intelligent Hindoos
who are now worshippers of neither Brahma nor Christ. They are in a transition
state, and having unlearned so much, they scarcely know where to lay the
foundation-stone of trustworthy belief. Throughout these Lectures, our author is
constantly answering the arguments of those contemporaries who felt the
hollowness of Rome, and had not yet tried the firmness of Geneva. Still <i>to us
</i>his replies may not be convincing. This remark applies to the following
passage. &#8220;If the sun always rose and set at the same period, or at least
certain symmetrical changes took place yearly, without any casual change; if the
days of winter were not short, and those of summer not long, we might then
discover the same order of nature, and in this way God would be rejected from
his dominion.&#8221; Here we must remember that in Calvin&#8217;s days most men
were ignorant of those general laws and all-pervading principles by which the
Author of nature governs and sustains the universe. In his day, there was
scarcely any choice between the system which represented the Almighty removed in
a kind of Epicurean repose far away from the works of his hand, and a system
which supposed him to interfere arbitrarily and suddenly in favor of one party,
and to rim discomfiture of another. Since this period, the researches of modern
science have discovered for us the numerous, the simple, and seemingly
self-acting principles, according to which the days of winter are short, and
those of summer long. We can contemplate humbly &#8220;the same order of
nature&#8221; from year to year with undeviating regularity, and yet never be
tempted &#8220;to reject God from his dominion.&#8221; Yea, the marvel is this,
the more we are trained to view the comprehensive theories of physical
astronomy, and chemistry, and magnetism, the more are we led to adore and to
magnify the Great and the All-powerful Original. Such studies do not lead us to
&#8220;erect nature into a deity,&#8221; and to reject the Creator from his own
dominion. They rather lead us to detect the fallacy in the expression
&#8220;nature does this or that;&#8221; they prove to us that there is no such
existence as &#8220;nature,&#8221; but that the word is but an expression for a
complex and comprehensive idea of external objects, in the minds of men. The
Almighty is seen by the true naturalist, in all his works, not as interposing
visibly and surprisingly at one time, and leaving all things to themselves at
another; but rather as impressing on every created particle of matter its own
condition of obedience to certain laws which we call either mechanical or
chemical, vital or organic. And it is the merciful arrangement of providence
that a persevering study of God&#8217;s works prepares the mind for an
intelligent perusal of his word. The habit of looking for such general
principles as gravitation, attraction, organization, and development, of
applying these theories to practice by the process of mathematical reasoning, or
anatomical dexterity, and of arriving at results indisputably true, &#8212; this
habit of mind is an excellent preparative for the equally discursive pursuit of
revealed theology. Thus we readily detect the fallacy of ascribing the events of
life to either fortune, or chance, or nature. CALVIN had to contend with them as
if they were realities; we may profit by Locke&#8217;s chapter on complex ideas,
and treat them as expressions comprehending many separate existence&#8217;s, so
related to each other that we form &#8220;a collective idea&#8221; of the
whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By continuing this process of thought we are enabled
to explain, although not to defend certain phrases of CALVIN&#8217;S respecting
the prerogatives of God. On
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:11, men are said to &#8220;mingle God and angels in complete confusion,&#8221;
and on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:21, God is said to be &#8220;excluded from the government of the world,&#8221;
The moment our attention is turned to the point, we perceive that the ideas only
of God and angels can be mingled, and in imagination only can men exclude the
Almighty from his sway over the wills of mankind. Such phrases, we must
remember, are the remnants of that <i>realism </i>which lingered in the minds of
many of the Reformers, and still clings to the writings of some of their
successors. Such expressions as we meet with on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
6:10, &#8220;Draw down God from heaven,&#8221; and on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
6:16, &#8220;to deprive the Almighty of his sway,&#8221; are better avoided. The
same thought may be expressed in language more adapted to our enlarged views of
the glory of our Creator. The Hebrew Prophets, it has been said,
&#8220;dramatized the particulars of their mission,&#8221; and their symbolical
portraits of the Almighty were afterwards received as exact and literal
descriptions of his character. The Jewish people, even in the time of Daniel,
were but in the infancy of moral and intellectual growth; and to them the
well-known proverb most aptly applies, &#8220;<i>Omne ignotum, pro
magnifico.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Everything marvelous was attributed at once to the
direct agency of a deity, disturbing rather than controlling the occurrences of
life. Thus the world, and its surprising tumults, successes, struggles, and
reverses, appeared but a scene of fortuitous and capricious chance. But the more
we advance from infancy to manhood, the more we gain power to methodize these
moral phenomena under some fixed and intelligible arrangement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is possible to present from the word of God
another reply to the Epicurean suppositions of CALVIN&#8217;S day, on principles
in advance of those which he adopts. While he represents kings as actually
contending with the Almighty, and really attempting to hurl him from his throne
in heaven, we must remember that such language can only be suggestive. The
foundation of all true reverence for Deity is the idea of an infinite and
invisible Being, of whose wisdom and might the material universe is the product,
and of whose moral nature the conscience of man is the image. When asked for
rigid proof of this assertion, we are constrained to refer it to that faith
which is peculiarly his gift. The double postulate of that essential existence
which is spiritual, and of something in ourselves, which is his image, is the
necessary rock upon which we must be placed before we can understand our origin
and our destiny &#8212; our position in the universe &#8212; our moral relation
to that system of providence into which we find ourselves born. And this series
of providential occurrences is in many respects exactly the opposite to that
described in these six chapters of Daniel. Miraculous and supernatural agency is
here variously employed to counteract what are known to us as the ordinary laws
of nature. The simple will of the Almighty annihilates the effect of fire in the
furnace, and the ferocity of lions in their den. A sweeping act of his power
converts one despot into the appearance of a beast of prey, and affrights
another by the ominous appearance of a hand writing vengeance on a wall. We
cannot expect such special revelations, judgments, or deliverance&#8217;s. Our
study of the character of Deity is contained in the revealed record of such
wonders, and in the present and past history of man and of the physical world.
Moral and natural philosophy, under the guidance of revealed religion, is for us
the exponent of the idea of Deity. The omnipresence of mind in outward nature is
now all but visible to every student. Vast as the universe is, we know it to be
pervaded by a moral purpose, and this presents that view of Deity which provides
for adoration, and love, and reverence, without limit, and satisfies the
longings for worship which are implanted deeply in the human soul. Thus we
clothe the idea of an infinite spirit with the attributes of a human conscience;
we are not satisfied with &#8220;a dynamic center of the universe,&#8221; we
desire to feel our souls overflow with that mingled wonder and love which
constitutes the highest and noblest worship of him who is GOOD. The history of
nations and of families impresses upon us the idea of a personal providential
Divinity, having fellow-feeling with the wants and distresses, the joys and the
sorrows of mankind. Now, we also believe that there are general, harmonious,
ever-acting laws of his providential government as well as of his physical. And
the study of ordinary sciences disciplines the mind, and qualifies it to
perceive, and arrange, and reason upon analogous laws in the moral and religious
government of our immortal spirits. A firm persuasion that there is no disorder
or disturbance in God&#8217;s moral sway &#8212; that he is not influenced by
caprice, or swayed by favoritism, or turned aside by passionate entreaty, is
necessary as the key-stone to the arch of Christian wisdom. Those very
confusions of which our Reformer writes so vigorously in his DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
ascribing them to the &#8220;red and sanguinary cohorts and horned
beasts,&#8221; were all in accordance with those uniformity&#8217;s of action
which we now designate <i>general laws. </i>So far from considering it possible
for God to &#8220;sit at ease in heaven and desert and betray his own
cause,&#8221; our firm reliance on the permanence of those principles which
underlie and encompass all others, is thereby tested and increased. The
phenomena of political government, of religious persecution, and of social
outbursts of fury and fanaticism, obey laws as orderly and as undeviating as
those which regulate the motion of a planet or the passage of electricity along
the wire. Through and by means of this &#8220;setting up and pulling down of
kings,&#8221; the Almighty speaks a language addressed alike to our reason, our
conscience, and our faith. But the great guarantee of our spiritual improvement
is the fundamental belief that there is harmony, and classification, and
inflexible regularity throughout the whole moral government of God. The very
possibility of accident, or favoritism, or isolated marvel, must be banished
from our thoughts. We know, by long course of proof and experience, that they do
not exist in the physical world, and we cannot allow them a single foot-print
within the domain of our moral and spiritual nature. Nothing here can be an
anomaly, nothing an exception. In the uncultivated mind, there is an avidity for
the marvelous, and a morbid eagerness for a cheap and easy solution of the
solemn mysteries concerning God and the soul; but our educated religious life is
like &#8220;a star hovering on the horizon&#8217;s verge between night and
morning.&#8221; Thus, by faith we stand at the parting of the two roads,
imagined by Plate&#8217;s great Parmenides, between the seeming and the true. As
this star shines brighter over our path, mere external ceremonies and notional
expressions become more and more objects of distrust; and the ideas of God and
of the soul, of sin and of conscience, of heaven and of glory, become more and
more vivid and real to us. And if any are afraid that the pursuit of either
scientific, or moral, or religious truth, according to the principles here laid
down, will injure true religion or saving faith, the single antidote to this
fear is found in the exhortation, &#8220;Have faith in God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
11:22.) Throughout these LECTURES our Reformer ever clings to this scriptural
principle, and even illustrates his subject ably, practically, and improvingly;
while he all along labors under the difficult task of rendering a narrative
interspersed with miracle available for the improvement of modern Christians who
live under a totally different dispensation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As another illustration of this difficulty, we may
turn to
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
6:25-27, where our commentator asserts of the profane, that they so unite minor
deities with the true that &#8220;he lies hid in a crowd, although he enjoys a
slight pre-eminence.&#8221; Such simple and racy language is easily
intelligible, but scarcely dignified enough. It justifies the assertion that in
the infancy of great truths, language is an index of our ignorance rather than
of our knowledge. Truly enough all men &#8220;wander confusedly&#8221; when they
attempt to render palpable to others their contemplations of a Deity. This idea
is the most vague and comprehensive of all &#8212; a universal solvent of all
problems in the early stage of our religious existence. The Egyptians and the
Greeks saw a god everywhere &#8212; in hill, in brook, in bird and beast. They
manifested no lack of faith in the existence of beings far superior to
themselves; and when the priest set up the ugly idol in its gorgeous temple, he
never imagined he was creating a god for either himself or the people. He only
attempted, after his fashion, to give fixity and embodiment to the ideas of
Deity which were floating about indefinitely in the minds of the multitude. But
the interval was wide indeed between these metaphorical symbols and the simple
abstract idea of one self-acting Being ruling the conscience and swaying the
future destinies of all men. When the tree of knowledge was separated from the
tree of life, a dark and forlorn interval succeeded, during which mankind
underwent long struggles of disquietude in &#8220;feeling after&#8221; the
Almighty One. And we have been permitted to find him. To believe in his
permanent presence and providence, to cling to him with the trust of a child to
a parent, to follow after him, with no voice but his word acting on conscience
and cheering while it guides, to trust him even amid the darkest prospects,
&#8212; this it is to have faith in God. And this trust is not the mere result
of reason, or understanding, or sentiment, or speculation. It is woven into our
deepest instincts and our noblest aspirations. It unites them all. It is
completed in love. What the profane call Nature, all who sympathize in
Darius&#8217;s proclamation concerning Daniel&#8217;s God, feel to be a
legislation of love. A parent whose government is unerring and complete is ever
setting before us the unalterable Law as an exhibition of unchanging love. The
very severity and uncompromising character of this idea of Deity proves the
crowning beneficence of his kingship over the powers of this world. Inflexible
justice and unerring certainty become the highest proofs of all-pervading
benevolence. Herein lies the perfection of constancy and truth. The conscience
is thus felt to be the vicegerent of this Divinity within. Forms of thought and
expression must change, and since CALVIN&#8217;S time, in the course of three
centuries, they have passed through many changes; and man&#8217;s religious
condition must always be modified by the extension of his knowledge, his
experience, and his educated capacities. Many habitual modes of thought current
in the days of <i>Oecolampadius </i>and <i>Willet </i>have been set aside; the
disturbance of feeling which this occasioned has subsided, and our comprehension
of God&#8217;s moral sway over the affairs of men has been enlarged and purified
by the change. His hand-writing is now legible to us on ten thousand walls where
of old it was a blank. The wonder which has been removed from special facts has
been transferred to general laws; and if &#8220;the dream and its
interpretation&#8221; are not now sent as proofs of his providence, there has
sprung up instead equally striking indications of it in every dewdrop and in
every flower.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENT which is so appositely made
of every occurrence throughout this historical portion of the LECTURES,
constitutes a large share of their value. They always plead fervently for
justice; always and everywhere they place justice first. They shew us that the
absolute will of the most unbending tyranny must ultimately yield to the Divine
omnipotence of justice, and that all defenses which human power may raise
against human rights are utterly vain. He who would be god-like must first be
just, and whatever else may be avoided, there is no escape from an avenging
judge and a self-torturing conscience. These LECTURES encourage us to harbor no
distrust that permanent evil will arise to us from doing manfully our duty; they
banish all fear that religion should suffer from the withdrawing of any supports
which are proved to be unsound. They stir us up to do the work assigned to us
while yet it is day with affectionate fidelity and all earnestness of zeal, and
are specially instructive in an age like ours, more remarkable for the variety
of its creeds than the intensity of its faith. Certainly the ancient spirit of
righteousness, which flourished so vigorously under the crushing despotism of
the House of Valois, is not strong within us. That spirit may be characterized
as moral courage and religious earnestness combined with love to Christ and
readiness to peril life for his name. And while it has almost died out in these
days, the practical exhortations of these LECTURES may, by God&#8217;s blessing,
aid in its revival.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Connected with the practical exposition of our
Prophet, we find a passage in Daniel 5 which demands our notice. In commenting
on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:5, and explaining that the hand which wrote upon the wall was not real, but
only a figure, it is said, &#8220;Scripture often uses this form of speech, and
especially when treating external symbols.&#8221; &#8220;<i>Est ergo haec etiam
sacramentalis loquutio, ut ita loquar.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>It would surprise us to
find the word &#8220;sacramental&#8221; introduced here, if we were unacquainted
with the modes of thought and expression in which CALVIN was brought up. But
when we remember the very strong hold which the phraseology of the schoolmen had
upon the minds of all who were early imbued with it, we enter at once into the
fullness of its meaning. We have already stated in our DISSERTATIONS ON EZEKIEL,
that the theology of Europe was, during the middle ages, entirely moulded
according to the teaching of either the Realists or the Nominalists. It was so
then, and it is so now. These two classes of mental cultivation still govern the
theological studies of mankind, and will probably do so till the end of our
Christian dispensation. The theology of Rome is the growth of the scholastic
philosophy built up by the Realists; the teaching of the Reformers springs
entirely from that of the Nominalists. All leanings to Rome have in them the
essence of Realism, made manifest by some Romanizing tendencies; and all
Ultra-Protestantism verges towards a series of negatives based upon Nominalism.
We have already alluded to the first nominalist, to whom Luther and Melancthon
own their deep obligations. &#8220;The real originator of the Protestant
principle,&#8221; says the author of <i>The Vindication of Protestant
Principles, </i>&#8220;the first man who truly emancipated himself from the
trammels of Popish ecclesiolatry, the first, in fact, who referred everything to
Scripture, and asserted the right of private judgment in its interpretation, was
our own countryman, William of Ockham, in Surrey.&#8221; He died at Munich in
the year 1347, just 170 years before Luther fastened his ninety-five
propositions to the church doors at Wittenberg. Leopold Ranke also asserts that
the celebrated nominalist, Gabriel Biel, was chiefly an epitomizer of this
favorite writer of Melancthon&#8217;s. (See Vindic. Prot. Prin.) The Zurich
Letters (Ep. 23, Park. Soc.) inform us of the language of Bishop Jewel when
writing to Peter Martyr, 5th November 1559, &#8212; &#8220;We have deserted the
ranks of Scotus and Aquinas for those of the Occamists and Nominalists,&#8221;
1842. This sentence condenses under a short formula the very essence of the
controversies which now agitate Christendom at large. We cannot dwell here on
the proofs of this important statement; we can only remind the reader of these
LECTURES that he will find some lingering traces of the realism which once
pervaded the theology of Europe, and in which CALVIN was brought up. We all know
how exceedingly difficult it is utterly to efface the earliest impressions made
upon an earnest and deeply speculative mind. Whenever, for instance, some of the
expressions with respect to the Almighty seem alien to our present modes of
thinking, we are now able to trace them to their source, and to set them aside
as remnants of a system which our Reformer energetically and vigorously opposed.
He is always leading us to cultivate the idea of a moral mind pervading all that
we know and read of now, and can know hereafter. This germinant truth shines
like light within our souls; the images and visions, the trials and triumphs of
Daniel and his companions, are no longer insulated atoms in chaos &#8212; a
mighty maze, and all without a plan &#8212; but portions of one organic whole,
in which we are personally bound up for both time and eternity. And the more we
surrender ourselves to this trust in our Parent Spirit, the more shall we find
our ignorance of the plans of Providence removed, and the cloud of mystery
hanging over the prevalence of evil brightened and dispersed. Thus the discovery
of the laws by which the universe is governed by no means excludes the Supreme
Cause from our contemplation; on the contrary, he becomes more manifest to us by
his pervading and perpetual presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Throughout these LECTURES we are ever taught that we
can see God only by being pure in heart. The preparation for spiritual insight
into holy mysteries is purity of conscience and singleness of eye. But even
these able comments do not clear up everything. Our lot on earth must be to walk
more by faith than by sight. This is the chief exercise of the soul, which is
essential to its vitality and growth. We must have at times our mountains of
vision as well as our valleys of the shadow of death. Never let us doubt the
essential permanence of justice, and righteousness, and truthfulness. By this we
shall be borne up through regions of cloud into realms of light. Thus will our
spirituality be strengthened and refined: thus we shall be permitted to obtain
larger perceptions of God&#8217;s character and maturer judgments of his
purposes.</font><br></div>

explained.&#8221; The Editor strongly recommends all the works of Mr. Birks on
prophecy; though he differs in opinion on some points of interest, he is deeply

Calvin&#8217;s expression is <i>tam brutus homo </i>in Latin, and <i>si stupide
et brutal </i>in French; but he is evidently too severe on so valuable an
analyst, who, in so many passages, confirms and elucidates the scriptural
narrative. Besides, Calvin seems to have overlooked the passage in his Antiq.,
lib. 11. cap. 8, section 5, where this Book is mentioned, and its contents

&#8216;This word has caused great difference of opinion among commentators.
Theodotion does not attempt to explain it. Symmaehus takes it for the Parthians.
Jerome interprets it by <i>tyranni, </i>and Saadias by their off&#8217;-spring.
Aben-Ezra considers it a foreign word; and R. Salom. Jarehi calls it Persian,
and translates it &#8220;leaders&#8221; Hottinger and Aug. Pfeiffer both treat
it as Persian, but derive it from different roots. &#8220;Nobles&#8221; or

his judgment is worthy of notice. It may be added, too, that the perplexity is
increased when Chaldee forms are used, although there is a uniform change of

The Rabbi Barbinel, to whose opinion Calvin&#8217;s attention was drawn, was the
celebrated Jewish statesman and commentator, Isaac Abarbanel. He claimed descent
from the family of King David, being born in Lisbon 1437, and died at Venice
1508. From Dr. M&#8217;Caul&#8217;s preface to Tegg&#8217;s <i>-Prideaux,
</i>(1845,) we learn that his &#8220;Commentary to Daniel&#8221; was entitled
<i>Mayene ha-yeshuah, </i>and published after his death in 1551, 4to, and also
at Amsterdam, 1647. The younger Buxtory translated it into Latin, and it was
refuted at length by Carpzov, Hulsius, and Varenius. Several of his works are
still unprinted. He was a strong opponent of the Christian interpretation ox
Daniel, and an equally determined combatant of the rationalistic views of Moses
the Egyptian, the son of Maimon.</font><br></div>
