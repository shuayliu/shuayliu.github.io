<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">TRANSLATOR'S
PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">CONTAINED in this Volume, as in the last, are the
Writings of <i>three </i>Prophets: and they are explained and elucidated in the
Author's peculiar manner; every sentence being dissected and examined, and the
meaning ascertained according to the context, without the introduction of any
extraneous matters. The main object throughout seems to have been to exhibit the
genuine sense and design of the Sacred Writers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Book of JONAH is a plain narrative, and no part
is supposed to have been written in the style of poetry except the prayer in the
second chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some things in this Book have furnished Infidels with
objections, and have induced some learned men, bearing at least the name of
believers, to indulge in inventions. To satisfy Infidels or themselves, they
have endeavored to prove, that this Book is either an historical allegory, or a
parable, or a dream, or a moral fiction, or something else still more absurd and
extravagant. But all these are mere vagrant conjectures, wholly groundless,
rendered plausible only by a show of learning, and calculated to do tenfold more
mischief than all the sneers and cavils of Infidels. THE BIBLE IS A BOOK OF
MIRACLES as well as of PROPHECIES; and an attempt to divest it of its Miracles
is an attempt to divest it of one of its distinctive properties. Its Prophecies,
which are continued Miracles, capable in many instances of ocular demonstration,
attest those Miracles which were confined to certain times and occasions, as
these were also in some cases performed for the purpose of gaining credit at the
time to what was predicted. But there are no Miracles recorded in Scripture,
which involve as much exercise of divine power as the fulfillment of Prophecies,
though less visible in its operation.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe1t</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The fact that Miracles of some sort form a part of
the records of false religions and of superstitious times, is no reason for
disbelieving the Miracles of Scripture. Almost all errors are imitations of
truth, and superstition is man's substitute for true Religion. The existence of
a false coin is no evidence that there is no genuine coin, but, on the contrary,
proves that it exists. Independently of the general character of the Miracles
recorded in Scripture, what has been just stated, their <i>connection </i>with
indubitable Prophecies is an argument in their favor, which neither heathen nor
Christian superstition is capable of adducing. Both must stand or fall together.
If the truth of Prophecies be allowed, then the reality of Miracles cannot with
any reason be denied. They are so connected together, that they cannot possibly
be separated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Learned men, being driven back, as it were, by
manifest and palpable absurdities, have sometimes resiliated beyond the limits
of reason and truth; being disgusted, and justly so, by Heathen and Popish
Miracles, they have often been imperceptibly led to doubt all Miracles, as when
we are frequently deceived, we are tempted to conclude that there is no such a
thing as honesty in the world. And hence has arisen the attempt to obliterate
Miracles from Scripture; and various hypotheses have been suggested, and
supported in some instances by no small measure of ingenuity and learning: but
it is an attempt which ought in the strongest manner to be deprecated and
condemned as being nothing less than a sacrilege, the robbing of God's Word of
one of its peculiar characteristics, even of that by which God has visibly
proved his supreme power; for by reversing and changing those laws of nature,
which at the creation he had fixed and established, he has given a manifest
demonstration of his Omnipotence and Sovereignty. He has made it known to the
world by Miracles, that He who has constructed the wonderful mechanism of
nature, can alter, change, and reconstruct it whenever He
pleases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The opinion,&#8221; says Dr. <i>Henderson,
&#8220;which </i>has been most generally entertained is that which accords to
the Book a strictly historical character; in other words, which affirms that it
is a relation of facts which actually took place in the life and experience of
the Prophet. Nor can I view it in any other light while I hold fast an
enlightened belief in the divine authority of the Books composing the Canon of
the Old Testament, and place implicit reliance on the authority of the Son of
God. Into the fixed and definite character of the Canon I need not here enter,
having fully discussed the subject elsewhere; but assuming that all the Books
contained in it possess the divine sanction, the test to which I would bring the
question, and by which, in my opinion, our decision must be mainly formed, is
the unqualified manner in which the personal existence, miraculous fate, and
public ministry of JONAH are spoken of by our Lord. He not only explicitly
recognizes the prophetic office of the son of Amittai,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Iwna tou
profhtou</font><font face="Palatino">,)just as he does that of Elisha, Isaiah,
and Daniel, but represents his being in the belly of the fish as a real miracle,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to
shmeion</font><font face="Palatino">,)<i> </i>grounds upon it, as a fact, the
certainty of the future analogous fact in his own history; <i>assumes </i>the
actual execution of the commission of the Prophet at Nineveh; positively asserts
that the inhabitants of that city repented at his preaching; and concludes by
declaring respecting himself, <i>&#8220;Behold </i>! a greater than Jonah is
here,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401239&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
12:39-41; 16:4.) Now is it conceivable that all these historical circumstances
would have been placed in this prominent light, if the person of the Prophet,
and the brief details of his narrative, had been purely fictitious? On the same
principle that the historical bearing of the reference in this ease is rejected,
may not that to the Queen of Sheba, which follows in the connection, be set
aside, and the portion in the First Book of Kings, in which the circumstances of
her visit to Solomon are recorded, be converted into an allegory, a moral
fiction, or a popular tradition? The two eases, as adduced by our Lord, are
altogether parallel; and the same may be affirmed of the allusion to Tyre and
Sidon, and that to Sodom in the preceding chapter.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This reasoning is conclusive on the subject, and
cannot be fairly evaded. Our learned author adds another consideration: &#8212;
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Certainly in no other instance in which our
Savior adduces <i>passages </i>out of the Old Testament for the purpose of
illustrating or confirming his doctrines, can it be shown that any point or
circumstance is thus employed which is not historically true. He uniformly
quotes and reasons upon them as containing accounts of universally admitted
facts, stamps them as such with the high sanction of his own authority, and
transmits them for the confident belief of mankind in all future
ages.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the preservation of JONAH in the bowels of the
fish was an impossibility according to the course and nature of things, as they
now exist, is quite evident: but it was no greater reversion of nature than the
parting of the Red Sea, or the dividing of the streams of Jordan, or the
sustentation of life in Moses during his stay on the Mount for forty days. The
laws of nature were equally suspended in all these instances; and to deny to
Him, who made these laws to be what they are, the power of changing them, is an
inconsistency which no reason can justify.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The next Prophet is MICAH; and his Book is especially
interesting on account of the prediction it contains of the birth-place of our
Savior, and also of the establishment of his Kingdom, and the spread of his
Gospel. The prophecy recorded in the fourth chapter is one of the most splendid
in all the Writings of the Prophets. We find the same in the second chapter of
ISAIAH; but it is fuller and given more at large by MICAH. The idea of borrowing
seems not compatible with the fact, that each declares that what they delivered
was conveyed to them by a vision: and there is nothing unreasonable in the
thought, that the Divine Spirit communicated the very same things, to a certain
extent, to two individual Prophets; and the fact that more, on the same subject,
was revealed to one than to the other, seems to favor the notion, that the whole
was communicated to each separately.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a subject worthy of being noticed, &#8212; that
it was not the practice of the Prophets to refer to the testimony of one
another, or even expressly to the commandments included in the Law of Moses.
Isaiah indeed once said, &#8220;To the Law and to the Testimony.&#8221; Though
the sins which generally prevailed were distinctly condemned in the Law,
especially the idolatry which was so common, they yet never quoted the
commandments, and brought them to bear on the reigning corruptions. This may
appear singular: but the way to account for it seems to be this, &#8212; that
the Prophets' authority was the same with that of Moses: Their communications
proceeded from the same Author; and there was no necessity to confirm what they
said by referring to what the Law sanctioned. The same God, who gave the Law by
Moses, sent his messages to the people by his Prophets. And hence arises a
strong, though, as it were, an incidental, proof of the Divine character of what
they have written.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The style of MICAH much resembles, in some respects,
the style of HOSEA. His transitions are sometimes abrupt, and the sudden change
of persons is not unfrequent. <i>Lowth </i>in his Prelections describes him as
&#8220;being brief in words, sententious, concise, pointed, &#8212; sometimes
bordering on the obscurity of HOSEA, &#8212; in many parts lofty and fervid, and
highly poetical.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe2t</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Marckius </i>says, that, &#8220;his diction is elegant, not very unlike that
of Isaiah.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe3t</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Henderson's </i>account is more extensive, but on the whole just, as well as
dis<i>criminating, &#8212; &#8220;His </i>style is concise, yet
<i>perspicuous,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe4t</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>nervous, </i>vehement, and energetic; and, in many instances, equals that of
ISAIAH in boldness and sublimity. He is rich and beautiful in the varied use of
tropical language, indulges in paranomasias, preserves a pure and classical
diction, is regular in the formation of parallelisms, and exhibits a roundness
in the construction of his periods, which is not surpassed by his more
celebrated contemporary. Both in administering threatenings and communicating
promises, he evinces great tenderness, and shows that his mind was deeply
affected by the subjects of which he treats. In his appeals he is lofty and
energetic. His description of the character of Jehovah, chap. 7:18-20, is
unrivalled by any contained elsewhere in Scripture.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Some of his prophecies,&#8221; says
<i>Newcome, &#8220;</i>are distinct and illustrious ones, as

7:16, 17.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>three </i>first chapters are throughout
comminatory, in which judgments are denounced on both nations, the Jews and the
Israelites, and in which are also enumerated the various evils which prevailed,
idolatry as the chief, and its accompanying sins &#8212; injustice, oppression,
and cruelty. &#8212; The <i>fourth </i>and the <i>fifth </i>chapters are of an
opposite character, being prophetic of blessings, appertaining more especially
to the Kingdom of Christ, while at the same time the previous sufferings and
trials of the Church are graphically described. &#8212; In the <i>sixth</i>
chapter the people are summoned to a trial; the Lord had a controversy with
them. Being proved guilty of ingratitude, ignorance, injustice, and idolatry,
they are threatened with awful judgments. &#8212; In the <i>seventh </i>and last
chapter the Prophet bewails the paucity of good men, deplores the faithlessness
and perfidy of the people, turns to the Lord, entertains hope, foretells the
restoration of the Church and the fall of its enemies, and ends with a rapturous
exclamation, having been evidently favored with a glimpse of the rich and
abundant mercies which God had in reserve for his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet NAHUM has but one subject &#8212; the
FALL OF NINEVEH &#8212; and he keeps to his subject without diverging to any
other. In mentioning the sins of Nineveh, the first thing he states is a wicked
design against the Lord, referring no doubt to the purpose formed of entirely
destroying the Kingdom of JUDAH. In describing afterwards the vices of the
people of Nineveh, he especially mentions their rapaciousness, deceit,
injustice, oppression, and barbarous cruelty, and compares Nineveh to the den of
lions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The special design of the Prophet in the description
he gives, at the beginning of <i>the first </i>chapter, of the character of the
Almighty, was to delineate him as He is to his enemies, as the God of vengeance,
who vindicates his own honor, and defends his own cause against profane and
rebellious opponents. He only makes a transient allusion to his goodness towards
his people. The other subject was that which was suitable to his purpose. He was
going to denounce irrevocable judgment on God's adversaries; he therefore
described Him as the God of vengeance: and the extremely awful character here
presented to us by one who spoke, as he was inspired from above, ought to be
well weighed and seriously considered, especially by all those who are not
become God's friends, but still continue his enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The<i> second </i>chapter contains a vivid
description of the fierce assailants of NINEVEH, of their success, of the
plunder of the city, and of the captivity of its people, with an exultation over
the den of lions. To prevent, as it were, any hope of escape, the Prophet, in
the <i>third </i>chapter, gives, according to CALVIN and many other
Commentators, a graphic view of the ransack of the city, as though he were an
eye-witness; then he states the reasons for this dreadful overthrow, reminds the
Ninevites of what had happened to another powerful and well fortified city,
shows the uselessness of resistance, and declares the doom of the city to be
irrevocable and irremediable. How wonderfully exact has been the fulfillment of
this Prophecy! 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe5t</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Who can
contemplate it without acknowledging that He who spoke by the Prophets is the
supreme, who rules and overrules all the events of time?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The style of NAHUM has been admired by all critics.
<i>Lowth </i>says, that <i>&#8220;no </i>one of the minor Prophets seems to
equal the sublimity, the vehemence and the boldness of NAHUM: besides, his
Prophecy is a complete and finished poem; his exordium is magnificent, and
indeed majestic; the preparation for the destruction of Nineveh, and the
description of its ruin, and its greatness, are expressed in most vivid colors,
and possess admirable perspicuity and fulness.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe6t</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Volume contains a very interesting portion of
The Minor Prophets. The History of JONAH is in many respects very instructive. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fe7t</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophecies of MICAH are some of the most remarkable in the Old Testament. NAHUM
exhibits in language the most awful the vengeance of the Almighty against the
enemies of his Church. And readers will find that our Commentator continues to
exercise his talents in that capacity with his wonted vigor, penetration, and
judgment. An impartial consideration of his labors cannot fail to impress our
minds with veneration for his character, and especially with gratitude to the
only Giver of all good for having so richly endued his servant, and for having
employed him in services so conducive to the interest of true religion. Such was
the respect in which he was held by Bishop <i>Horsley, </i>whose learning and
acuteness were not of an ordinary kind, that in quoting his comment on a portion
of the eighteenth chapter of ISAIAH, he calls him&#8221; THE VENERABLE
CALVIN.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>J.O.</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>THRUSSINGTON,
July 1847.</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PREFACE
BY THE AUTHOR</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At what time Jonah discharged the office of a
Teacher, we may in some measure learn from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;121401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 14:1 for it is certain that he is the person there mentioned in Sacred
history, as he is expressly called the son of Amittai 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. It is
said there that Jeroboam, the son of Joash, had enlarged the borders of his
kingdom, from the entrance into Hamath to the sea of the desert, according to
the word of Jonah, the servant of God, the son of Amittai, who came from Gath.
It was then at that time, or shortly before, that Jonah prophesied. And it is
certain that he was not only sent to the Ninevites, but that he also was counted
a Teacher among the people of Israel. And the beginning also of his Book seems
to intimate what I have said, &#8212; that he was an ordinary Prophet among the
people of Israel, for it begins with a copulative, <i>And the Word of the Lord
came to Jonah.</i> Though the Holy Spirit does in other places speak sometimes
in this manner, yet I doubt not but that Jonah intimates that he was recalled
from the discharge of his ordinary office, and had a new charge committed to
him, &#8212; to denounce, as we shall see, on the Ninevites a near
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now then understand, that Jonah taught among
the people of Israel, but that he received a command to go to the Ninevites. Of
this command we shall take notice in its proper place; but it is right that we
should know that he was not then only made a Prophet, when he was given as a
Teacher to the Ninevites, but that he was sent to the Ninevites after having for
some time employed his labors for God and his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Book is partly historical and partly didactic.
For Jonah relates what happened to him after he had attempted to avoid the call
of God, and what was the issue of his prophecy: this is one thing. But at the
same time he mentions the kind of doctrine which he was commanded to proclaim,
and he also writes a Song of Thanksgiving. This last part contains doctrines and
is not a mere narrative.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As I have before observed, Jonah seems here
indirectly to intimate, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he
had been previously called to the office of a teacher; for it is the same as
though he had said, that he framed this history as a part of his ordinary
function. The word of God then was not for the first time communicated to Jonah,
when he was sent to Nineveh; but it pleased God, when he was already a Prophet,
to employ him among other nations. It might have been then, that he was sent to
Nineveh, that the Lord, being wearied with the obstinacy of his own people,
might afford an example of pious docility on the part of a heathen and
uncircumcised nation, in order to render the Israelites more inexcusable. They
made a profession of true religion, they boasted that they were a holy people;
circumcision was also to them a symbol and a pledge of God&#8217;s covenant; yet
they despised all the Prophets, so that their teaching among them was wholly
useless. It is then probable that this Prophet was taken away from them, that
the Ninevites by their example might increase the sin of Israel, for in three
days they turned to God, after Jonah had preached to them: but among the
Israelites and their kindred he had, during a long time, effected nothing, when
yet his authority had been sufficiently ratified, and thus, as we have already
said, in their favor: for Jonah had predicted, that the kingdom of Israel would
as yet stand; and however much they deserved to perish, yet the Lord fulfilled
what he had promised by the mouth at his servant. They ought then to have
embraced his doctrine, not only because it was divine, but especially because
the Lord had been pleased to show his love to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not indeed doubt, but that the ingratitude of
the people was in this manner arraigned, since the Ninevites repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and that for a short time, while the Israelites ever
hardened themselves in their obstinacy. And hence some have refinedly expounded
that passage in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401239&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
12:39-41, &#8216;This perverse generation seeketh a sign, and a sign shall not
be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet,&#8217; as though this
intimated, that the Gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, inasmuch as Jonah
was taken away from his own nation, and was given as a teacher to foreign and
heathen nations. They therefore suppose, that we are to understand this as a
prophecy respecting the future call of the Gentiles, as though Christ had said,
that he would hereafter go to the Gentiles, after having found the wickedness of
the chosen people past recovery. But as Christ expressly applies this
comparison, we ought not to draw his words here and there  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. He
indeed confines the similitude to one particular thing, that is, &#8220;As Jonah
had been three days in the whale&#8217;s bowels, so also he would be three days
in the bowels of the earth;&#8221; as though he had said, that in this he would
be like to Jonah, for he would be a Prophet brought to life again. And this was
said designedly by Christ, because he saw that he was despised by the Jews, and
that his labors were in vain: &#8220;Since ye now hear me not, and regard me as
nothing, know that I shall be hereafter a new Prophet, even after my
resurrection; so at length I shall begin to speak more effectually both to the
Jews and to the Gentiles, as Jonah converted Nineveh, after having returned
again to life.&#8221; This then is the simple meaning of the passage. Hence
Jonah was not a type of Christ, because he was sent away unto the Gentiles, but
because he returned to life again, after having for some time exercised his
office as a Prophet among the people of Israel. They then who say that his going
forth was a token of the call of the Gentiles, adduce indeed what is plausible,
but it seems to be supported by no solid reason; for it was in fact an
extraordinary thing. God, then, had not as yet openly showed what he would do at
the coming of Christ. When Naaman the Syrian was converted to the faith,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 5:15) and a few others, God changed nothing in his ordinary proceedings:
for there ever existed the special call of the race of Abraham, and religion was
ever confined within the ancient limits; and it remained ever true, that God had
not done to other nations as he had to the Jews, for he had revealed to them his
judgments,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:20.) It was therefore God&#8217;s will that the adoption of the race of
Abraham should continue unaltered to the conning of Christ, so that the Jews
might excel all other nations, and differ from them through a gratuitous
privilege, as the holy and elect people of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those who adopt the contrary opinion say, that the
Ninevites were converted to the Lord without circumcision. This is true; but I
know not whether that was a true and legitimate conversion, which is hereafter
mentioned; and of this, the Lord being willing, I shall again speak more fully:
but it seems more probable, that they were induced by the reproofs and
threatening of the Prophet, suppliantly to deprecate the impending wrath of God:
hence God once forgave them; what took place afterwards does not clearly appear.
It is certainly not probable that the whole city was converted to the Lord: for
soon after that city became exceedingly hostile both to the Israelites and the
Jews; and the Church of God was by the Ninevites continually harassed with
slaughters. Since it was so, there is certainly no reason to think, that they
had really and from the heart repented. But I put off a full discussion of this
subject until we come to another passage. Let us go on now with our
text.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great
city.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Nineveh is called a great city, and not
without reason; for it was in circumference, as heathen writers say, 400 stadia:
and we shall see that Jonah was three whole days in going through the squares
and streets of the city   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. It
hence follows, that it was a very large city, and this all allow. Profane
writers call it Ninus, and say that it is a name derived from its founder; for
it was Ninus, the son of Betas, who built it. But more correct is their opinion,
who think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwnyn</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>Ninue, </i>is a Hebrew word: and hence what Herodotus and Diodorus, and
others of the same class, say, is certainly fabulous, both as to the origin of
the city and as to the whole progress of the kingdom, and their legends can
easily be disproved by testimonies from holy Scripture. It is at the same time
admitted by all, that Nineveh was a very large and a well fortified city.
Babylon was afterwards built by Semiramis, who had been the wife of Betas: after
her husband&#8217;s death she wished to show that she also excelled in mind and
industry, and that she had wisdom above her sex. But with regard to the founder
of Nineveh, it is certain that the city was first built by Asshur: whether it
was enlarged by Ninus, I know not: this, then, I leave as uncertain; for I wish
not to contend about what is doubtful. But it is certain, from what Moses has
said, that the founder of this city was Asshur,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
10:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the largeness of the city, even if profane
writers had not said a word, the testimony of Jonah ought to be sufficient to
us. Now, since he is bidden to go and proceed to Nineveh, the Lord gives him
some hope of success. He indeed wrought effectually by the hand of his servant,
Nahum; who, though he continued at home, yet prophesied against the Ninevites;
but with a different view, and for another end. For as the people were then
miserably distressed, and saw the kingdom or monarchy of Assyria in a
flourishing state, they must have despaired, had not some solace been afforded
them. Hence Nahum showed that God would be a judge against the Ninevites; that
though he for a time favored and spared them, there was yet impending over them
the dreadful judgment of which he speaks. Nahum, then, was not given as a
teacher to the Ninevites, but was only a proclaimer, that the Jews might
strengthen their faith by this comfort &#8212; that they were not wholly
rejected by the Lord, as he would some time avenge their wrongs. The case with
Jonah was different: for he was sent to the city itself, to exhort the Ninevites
to repent. Now the Lord, by speaking expressly of the largeness of the city,
intended thus to prepare him with firmness, lest he should be frightened by the
splendor, wealth, and power of that city: for we know how difficult it is to
take in hand great and arduous undertakings, especially when we feel ourselves
destitute of strength. When we have to do with many and powerful adversaries, we
are not only debilitated, but our courage wholly vanishes away. Lest, then, the
greatness of Nineveh should fill Jonah with terror, he is here prepared and
armed with firmness. &#8220;<i>Go</i> then<i> to Nineveh, </i>and let not the
power of that monarchy prevent thee to fulfill what I command thee; which is, to
show to the Ninevites their sins, and to denounce on them destruction, if they
repent not.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why Nineveh was called<i> a
great city:</i> for had it not been for the reason just stated, it would not
have been necessary that this should have been said to Jonah. The Israelites, I
doubt not, knew well that it was a large city, and also possessed of strength
and of a large number of men: but the Lord intended to set before his servant
what might have been a hindrance to him in the discharge of his office;
<i>Go</i> then <i>to this great city.</i> In short, God designed in this way to
try Jonah, whether he would prefer his command to all the hindrances of this
world. And it is a genuine proof of obedience when we simply obey God, however
numerous the obstacles which may meet us and may be suggested to our minds, and
though no escape may appear to us; yea, when we follow God, as it were with
closed eyes, wherever he may lead us, and doubt not but that he will add
strength to us, and stretch forth also his hand, whenever need may require, to
remove all our difficulties. It was then the Lord&#8217;s purpose to deal thus
with Jonah; as though he had said to him, &#8220;remember who I am, and be
content with my authority; for I have ready at hand all resources; when any
thing stands in your way, rely on my power, and execute what I command
thee.&#8221; This is the import of the passage. Whenever then God demands any
service from us, and we at the same time see that what the discharge of our duty
demands is either difficult or apparently impossible, let this come to our
minds, &#8212; that there is not anything in the whole world which ought not to
give way to God&#8217;s command: we shall then gather courage and confidence,
nor will anything be able to call us away from our duty and a right course,
though the whole world were fighting against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry against her; for ascended
has their wickedness before my presence.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">Cry,
he says, against her: it was an unpleasant undertaking to cry out against her
immediately at the beginning. We indeed know that men take pride in their power:
and as there was then but one monarchy in the world, the seat of which was at
Nineveh, a teacher could hardly expect to obtain a patient hearing, though he
excelled in gracefulness of manner, and had acquired reputation, and brought an
agreeable message. But Jonah was a foreigner, one unknown, and destitute of
authority; and still more, he was immediately to denounce destruction on the
Ninevites, to cry aloud, to reprove, to make a vehement proclamation, to
threaten. How difficult was all this? We hence see how hard a command it was
when God charged his Prophet to cry against Nineveh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For their wickedness has ascended
to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this clause God strengthens his
servant Jonah; as though he said, &#8220;Thou wilt not, as an individual, have
to contend with them, but I constitute thee as my herald, to summon them to my
tribunal.&#8221; And no doubt it must have served much to animate Jonah, that he
had not to deal with the Ninevites as an individual, but as the messenger of
God: and it might also have had an influence on their minds, to know, that
though no mortal inflicted punishment for their crimes, they yet could not
escape the vengeance of God. This then is the reason why the Lord here declares
that he would be the judge of Nineveh. And at the same time he reminds us, that
though the Ninevites felicitated themselves, and also gained the plaudits of the
whole world on account of their power, yet all this was of no moment, because
their wickedness and iniquity had ascended into heaven. When therefore we are
reproved, there is no reason that we should turn our eyes here and there towards
men; we ought instantly to present ourselves to the scrutiny of God; nay, we
ought ourselves to take in hand that voluntary examination which God requires.
By so doing, we shall not feed our vices by foolishly deceiving ourselves, as
hypocrites do, who ever look around them to the right hand and to the left, and
never raise up their thoughts to heaven. Let us go on &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah now relates how he sought hiding-places, that
he might withdraw himself from the service of God; not that he deceived himself
with such a gross notion, as that he would be no longer under the power of God,
after having passed over the sea; but he intended to shun, as it were, the light
of the present life, by proceeding to a foreign country. He was, no doubt, not
only in a disturbed state of mind, when he formed such a purpose, but was
utterly confused.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, why Jonah thus avoided the command
of God. The Jews, indulging in frigid trifles in divine things, say that he
feared lest, when he came to Nineveh, he should be deprived of the prophetic
spirit, as though he were not in the same danger by passing over the sea: this
is very frivolous and puerile. And further, they blend things of no weight, when
reasons sufficiently important present themselves to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was first a new and unusual thing for Prophets to
be drawn away from the chosen people, and sent to heathen nations. When Peter
was sent to Cornelius,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:17,) though he had been instructed as to the future call of the Gentiles, he
yet doubted, he hesitated until he was driven as it were forcibly by a vision.
What then must have come to the mind of Jonah? If only on account of one man the
mind of Peter was disquieted, so as to think it an illusion, when he was sent a
teacher to Cornelius, what must Jonah have thought, when he was sent to a city
so populous? Hence novelty, doubtless, must have violently shaken the courage of
the holy Prophet, and induced him to retake himself elsewhere, as one destitute
of understanding. Again, doubt might have had an influence on him: for how could
he have hoped that a people, who were notorious for their licentiousness, would
be converted? He had indeed before an experience of the hardness of the chosen
people. He had been faithfully engaged in his office, he had omitted nothing to
confirm the worship of God and true religion among the people of Israel: but he
had effected but little; and yet the Jews had been called from the womb. What
then could he hope, when the Lord removed him to Nineveh? for unbridled
licentiousness ruled there; there was also there extreme blindness, they had no
knowledge of divine worship; in a word, they were sunk in extreme darkness, and
the devil in every way reigned there. Doubt then must have broken down the
spirit of Jonah, so that he disobeyed the command of God. Still further, the
weakness of the flesh must have hindered him from following his legitimate call:
&#8220;What then? even this, &#8212; I must go to the chief city of that
monarchy, which at this day treads under its feet the whole earth; I must go
there, a man obscure and despised; and then I must proclaim a message that will
excite the greatest hatred, and instantly kindle the minds of men into rage; and
what must I say to the Ninevites? &#8216;Ye are wicked men, God can no longer
endure your impiety; there is, therefore, a dreadful vengeance near at
hand.&#8217; How shall I be received?&#8221; Jonah then, being still surrounded
by the infirmities of the flesh, must have given way to fear, which dislodged
the love of obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And I have no doubt, in my own mind, but that Jonah
discussed these things within himself, for he was not a log of wood. And
doubtless it was not to no purpose, as I have already said, that he mentions
that the city was great. God indeed sought to remove what might prove an
hindrance, but Jonah, on the other hand, reasoned thus, &#8212; &#8220;I see
that I am to have a fierce contest; nay, that such a number of people will fall
on me, enough to overwhelm me a hundred times, as the Lord has not in vain
foretold me that the city is great.&#8221; And though he might have had some
hope, if they had been chastised, that they would give God his due honor; yet he
confesses, that this hindrance came to his mind, which prevented him to proceed
in the course of his calling. Hence doubt, as well as the fear of the flesh made
Jonah to stumble, and novelty also, as I have already said, must have perplexed
him; so that he preferred to go down, as it were, to the grave, than to
undertake an office which apparently had no reason in its favor. For why were
the Prophets sent, except to effect something by their labor, and to bring forth
some fruit? but of this Jonah had no hope. Some authority was also allowed the
Prophets, at least they were allowed the liberty of teaching; but Jonah thought
that all entrance was closed up against him: and still more, Jonah thought that
he was opposing the covenant of the Lord, who had chosen one people only; and he
also thought that he was, as it were, fixed to his own land, when he was
appointed a Teacher in his own country; he therefore could not remove elsewhere
without feeling a great repugnance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I hence think, that Jonah disobeyed the command of
God, partly because the weakness of the flesh was an hindrance, partly because
of the novelty of the message, and partly because he despaired of fruit, or of
success to his teaching.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he doubtless grievously transgressed: for the
first rule, as to all our actions, is to follow the call of God. Though one may
excel in heroic virtues, yet all his virtues are mere fumes, which shine before
the eyes of men, except the object be to obey God. The call of God then, as I
have said, holds the first place as to the conduct of men; and unless we lay
this foundation, we do like him who would build a house in the air. Disordered
then will be the whole course of our life, except God presides over and guides
us, and raises up over us, as it were, his own banners. As then Jonah subverted
the first and the only firm foundation of a right conduct, what could have
remained for him? There is then no reason for us to extenuate his fault, for he
could not have sinned more grievously than by forsaking God, in having refused
to obey his call: it was, as it were to shake off the yoke; and this he
confesses himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They therefore very childishly write who wish to be
his apologists, since he twice condemns himself &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jonah rose up to flee from the
presence of Jehovah &#8212; to go unto Tarshish from the presence of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Why does he the second time repeat,
from the presence of Jehovah? He meant, no doubt, to express here more
distinctly his fault: and the repetition is indeed very emphatical: and it also
proves clearly that it was not a slight offense, when Jonah retook himself
elsewhere when he was sent to Nineveh. He could not indeed have departed from
the Lord, for God fills heaven and earth; and, as I have said already, he was
not fascinated by so gross an error as to think, that when he became a fugitive,
he was beyond the reach of God&#8217;s hand. What then is to flee from the face
of Jehovah, except it be that which he here confesses, that he fled from the
presence of God, as though he wished, like runaway servants, to reject the
government of God? Since then Jonah was carried away by this violent temptation,
there is no reason why we should now try, by some vain and frivolous pretenses,
to excuse his sin. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the word <i>Tharsis,</i> or Tharsisa,
I doubt not but that it means Cilicia. There are those who think that it is the
city Tarsus; but they are mistaken, for it is the name of a country. They are
also mistaken who translate it, Sea; for Jonah intended not only to go to sea,
but also to pass over into Cilicia, which is opposite to the Syrian Sea. But the
Jews called that the Sea of Tarshish, as it appears from many passages, because
there was very frequent sailing to that place. As then that transmarine country
was more known to them than any other, and as they carried there their
merchandise, and in their turn purchased their goods, they called that the Sea
of Tarshish, as it is well known, as being near it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah then intended to flee into Cilicia, when the
Lord would have sent him to Nineveh. It is said that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rose up to
flee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and then, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went down to
Joppa,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>found there a
ship,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which was passing over to Tarshish, that
he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>paid the
fare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that he <i>went down</i> into the
ship,<i> to go with</i> them into Cilicia:   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> now by
all those expressions Jonah intimates that he was wholly fixed in his purpose,
and that it was necessary that he should have been brought back by a strong
hand; for he was touched by no repentance during his journey. Many things may
indeed come to our minds when the call of God appears to us too burdensome.
There is none of us, when service is to be performed to God, who does not roll
this and that in his mind: &#8220;What will be the issue? how wilt thou reach
the place where thou expectest to be? See what dangers await thee.&#8221; For
Satan always comes forth, whenever we resolve to obey God; but we are to
struggle in this case, and then repel what we see to be contrary to our calling.
But Jonah shows that he was obstinately fixed in his purpose of fleeing: for he
not only intended to go into Tarshish, but he actually went down to the city
Joppa, which was nigh to Judea; and, therefore some think that Tarshish was
Africa; but this is strained. Others divine it to be Thunetus or Carthage, as
though indeed these cities were built at that time; but men are very bold in
dreaming. But what need of giving a new meaning to this word against the most
common usage of Scriptures when it is evident enough that Tarshish is
Cilicia?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when Jonah went down to Joppa, it was evident
that he intended immediately to migrate from the land of Judah, and to pass over
the sea: but by saying that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>paid the
fare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"> into the ship, that he might <i>go,</i>
&#8212; by this gradual progress, he sets before us, as I have said, more fully
his own perverseness; so that he admits that he not only resolutely purposed to
reject the call of God, but that he also confirmed himself in it: and though
there were many things to be done, which might have sometimes forced him to
stand still, he yet constantly followed where his perverse and blind impulse led
him. There is no doubts then, but that Jonah, in these distinct words sets
himself forth as a fugitive, not only by one act, but by many
acts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as to his flight, we must bear in mind what I
have before said &#8212; that all flee away from the presence of God, who do not
willingly obey his commandments; not that they can depart farther from him, but
they seek, as far as they can, to confine God within narrow limits, and to
exempt themselves from being subject to his power. No one indeed openly
confesses this; yet the fact itself shows, that no one withdraws himself from
obedience to God&#8217;s commands without seeking to diminish and, as it were,
to take from him his power, so that he may no longer rule. Whosoever, then, do
not willingly subject themselves to God, it is the same as though they would
turn their backs on him and reject his authority that they may no more be under
his power and dominion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is deserving of notice, that as Jonah represents
himself as guilty before the whole world, so he intended by his example to show
how great and detestable a sin it is, not to submit to the commands of God, and
not to undertake whatever he enjoins, but to evade his authority. That he might
then enhance the atrocity of his sin, he shows by his own example that we cannot
rebel against God, without seeking, under some pretense or another to thrust him
from his throne, and, at the same time, to confine him within certain limits
that he may not include heaven and earth within his empire.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah declares here how he had been, as it were, by
force brought back by the Lord, when he tried to flee away from his presence. He
then says that a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tempest
arose</i> <i>in the sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> but he at the
same time tells us, that this tempest did not arise by chance, as ungodly men
are wont to say, who ascribe everything that happens to fortune. God, he says,
<i>sent a strong wind on the sea.</i> Some give this renderings God raised up,
deriving the verb from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lfn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuthel;</i> but others derive it more correctly from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tul</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, and we
shall presently meet with the same word in the fifth verse. Now as to what took
place, he says that there was so great a tempest, that the ship was not far from
being broken. When he says, &#8216;The ship thought to be broken   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
expression corresponds with the idiom of our language, <i>la navire cuidoit
perir.</i> But some take the ship for the passengers or the sailors; but this is
strained; and we know that our common language agrees in many of its phrases
with the Hebrew.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah then meant, that a tempest arose, not by
chance, but by the certain purpose of God, so that being overtaken on the sea,
he acknowledged that he had been deceived when he thought that he could flee
away from God&#8217;s presence by passing over the sea. Though indeed the
Prophet speaks here only of one tempest, we may yet hence generally gather, that
no storms, nor any changes in the air, which produce rain or stir up tempests on
the sea, happen by chance, but that heaven and earth are so regulated by a
Divine power, that nothing takes place without being foreseen and decreed. But
if any one objects, and says that it does not harmonize with reason, that, for
the fault of one man, so many suffered shipwreck, or were tossed here and there
by the storm: the ready answer to this is, &#8212; that though God had a regard
only, in a special manner, to the case of Jonah, yet there were hidden reasons
why he night justly involve others in the same danger. It is probable that many
were then sailing; it was not one ship only that was on that sea, since there
were so many harbors and so many islands. But though the Lord may involve many
men in the same punishment, when he especially intends to pursue only one man,
yet there is never wanting a reason why he might not call before his tribunal
any one of us, even such as appear the most innocent. And the Lord works
wonderfully, while ruling over men. It would be therefore preposterous to
measure his operations by our wisdom; for God can so punish one man, as to
humble some at the same time, and to chastise others for their various sins, and
also to try their patience. Thus then is the mouth of ungodly men stopped, that
they may not clamor against God, when he so executes his judgments as not to
comport with the judgment of our flesh. But this point I shall presently discuss
more at large: there are indeed everywhere in Scripture, instances in which God
inflicted punishment on a whole people, when yet one man only had sinned. But
when some murmur and plead that they are innocent, there is ever to be found a
reason why God cannot be viewed as dealing cruelly with them; nay, were he
pleased, he might justly treat them with much greater severity: in a word,
though God may appear to deal severely with men, he yet really spares them, and
treats them with indulgence. Let us now proceed &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This narrative, in which Jonah relates in order so
many circumstances, is not without its use; for, as we shall presently see, he
intended to set forth his own insensibility, and to lay it before us as painted
before our eyes: and the comparison, which is implied in the circumstances,
greatly illustrates the supine and almost brutal security of
Jonah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
mariners</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were
afraid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and then, that each
<i>cried,</i> that is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to his
god</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and that they <i>cast out into the sea the
lading of the ship.</i> As then they were all so concerned, was it not marvelous
that Jonah, on whose account the sea was stormy, was asleep? Others were busy,
they ran here and there in the ship, and spoiled themselves of their goods, that
they might reach the shore in safety: they indeed chose to strip themselves of
all they had rather than to perish; they also cried to their gods. Jonah cared
for nothing, nay, he lay asleep: but whence came such a carelessness as this,
except that he was not only become torpid, but that he seemed also to have been
deprived of all reason and common feeling? There is no doubt then but that
Jonah, in order to show this to have been the case, has here enumerated so many
circumstances.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mariners were
afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We indeed know that sailors are not
usually frightened by small or common storms; for they are a hardy race of men,
and they are the less afraid, because they daily see various commotions in the
air. When, therefore, he says that the sailors were afraid, we hence gather that
it was not a moderate tempest, for such does not thus terrify men accustomed by
long expert once to all sorts of storms: they, then, who had been previously
hardened, were disquieted with fear. He afterwards adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they cried, each of them to his
god.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Jonah certainly ought not to have slept so
soundly, but that he might rouse himself at almost any moment, for he carried in
his heart his own executioner, as he knew that he was a fugitive: for we have
said before, that it was not a slight offense for Jonah to withdraw himself from
the presence of God; he despised his call, and, as far as he could, cast off the
yoke, so as not to obey God. Seeing, then, that Jonah was ill at ease with
himself, ought he not to have trembled, even while asleep? But while others
cried to their false gods, he either despised, or at least neglected the true
God, to whom he knew he was disobedient, and against whom he rebelled. This is
the point of the comparison, or of the antithesis. But we at the same time see,
how in dangers men are constrained to call on God. Though, indeed, there is a
certain impression by nature on the hearts of men as to God, so that every one,
willing or unwilling, is conscious that there is some Supreme Being; we yet by
our wickedness smother this light, which ought to shine within us. We indeed
gladly cast away all cares and anxieties; for we wish to live at ease, and
tranquillity is the chief good of men. Hence it comes, that all desire to live
without fear and without care; and hence we all naturally seek quietness. Yet
this quietness generates contempt. Hence then it is, that hardly any religion
appears in the world, when God leaves us in an undisturbed condition. Fear
constrains us, however unwilling, to come to God. False indeed is what is said,
that fear is the cause of religion, and that it was the first reason why men
thought that there were gods: this notion is indeed wholly inconsistent with
common sense and experience. But religion, which has become nearly extinct, or
at least covered over in the hearts of men, is stirred up by dangers. Of this
Jonah gives a remarkable instance, when he says that the sailors
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cried, each of them to his
god</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We know how barbarous is this race
of men; they are disposed to shake off every sense of religion; they indeed
drive away every fear, and deride God himself as long as they may. Hence that
they cried to God, it was no doubt what necessity forced them to do. And here we
may learn, how useful it is for us to be disquieted by fear; for while we are
safe, torpidity, as it is well known, soon creeps over us. Since, then, hardly
any one of himself comes to God, we have need of goads; and God sharply pricks
us, when he brings any danger, so as to constrain us to tremble. But in this
way, as I have already said, he stimulates us; for we see that all would go
astray, and even perish in their thoughtlessness, were he not to draw them back,
even against their own will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jonah does not simply say, that each cried to
God, but he adds, <i>to his own god. </i>As, then, this passage teaches, that
men are constrained by necessity to seek God, we also, on the other hand, it
shows, that men go astray in seeking God, except they are directed by celestial
truth, and also by the Spirit of God. There is then some right desire in men,
but it goes astray; for none will keep the right way except the Lord directs
them, as it has been said, both by his word and his Spirit. Both these
particulars we learn from the words of the Prophet: The sailors <i>feared;</i>
men hardy and almost iron-hearted, who, like the Cyclops, despised God, &#8212;
these, he says, were <i>afraid;</i> and they also cried to God; but they did not
cry by the guidance of faith; hence it was, that every one cried to his own
god.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we read this, let it first come to our minds
that there is no hope until God constrains us, as it were, by force; but we
ought to anticipate extreme necessity by seeking him willingly. For what did it
avail the sailors and other passengers, to call once on God? It is indeed
probable that, shortly after, they relapsed into their former ungodly
indifference; after having been freed from their danger, they probably despised
God, and all religion was regarded by them with contempt. And so it commonly
happens as to ungodly men, who never obey God except when they are constrained.
Let therefore every one of us offer himself willingly to God, even now when we
are in no danger, and enjoy full quietness. For if we think, that any pretext
for thoughtlessness, or for error, or for ignorance, will serve as an excuse, we
are greatly deceived; for no excuse can be admitted, since experience teaches
us, that there is naturally implanted in all some knowledge of God, and that
these truths are engraven on our hearts, that God governs our life, &#8212; that
he alone can remove us by death, &#8212; that it is his peculiar office to aid
and help us. For how was it that these sailors cried? Had they any new teacher
who preached to them about religion, and who regularly taught them that God was
the deliverer of mankind? By no means: but these truths, as I have said, had
been by nature impressed on their hearts. While the sea was tranquil, none of
them called on their god; but danger roused them from their drowsiness. But it
is hence sufficiently evident, that whatever excuses they may pretend, who
ascribe not to God his glory, they are all frivolous; for there is no need of
any law, there is no need of any Scripture, in short, there is no need of any
teaching, to enable men to know, that this life is in the hand of God, that
deliverance is to be sought from him alone, and that nothing, as we have said,
ought to be looked for from any other quarter: for invocation proves that men
have this conviction respecting God; and invocation comes from nothing else but
from some hidden instinct, and indeed from the guidance and teaching of nature,
(<i>duce ac magistra natura</i>) This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us also learn from this passage, that when
God is sought by us, we ought not to trust to our own understanding; for we
shall in that case immediately go astray. God then must be supplicated to guide
us by his word, otherwise every one will fall off into his own superstitions; as
we here see, that each cried to his own god. The Prophet also reminds us that
multiplicity of gods is no modern invention; for mankind, since the fall of
Adam, have ever been prone to falsehood and vanity. We know how much corruption
must occupy our minds, when every one invents for himself hideous and monstrous
things. Since it is so, there is no wonder that superstitions have ever
prevailed in the world; for the wit of man is the workshop of all errors.
(<i>quia ingenium hominis officina est omnium errorum</i>) And hence also we may
learn what I have lately touched upon, &#8212; that nothing is worse for us than
to follow the impulses of our flesh; for every one of himself advances in the
way of error, even without being pushed on by another; and at the same time, as
is commonly the case, men draw on one another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds, that the <i>wares were cast out,</i>
that is, the lading of the ship; and we know that this is the last resource in
shipwrecks; for men, to save their lives, will deprive themselves willingly of
all their goods. We hence see how precious is life to man; for he will not
hesitate to strip himself of all he has, that he may not lose his life. We
indeed shun want, and many seek death because extreme poverty is intolerable to
them; but when they come to some great danger, men ever prefer their life to all
their possessions; for what are the good things of this world, but certain
additions to our life? But Jonah tells us for another purpose that the ship was
lightened, even for this, &#8212; that we may know that the tempest was no
ordinary commotion, but that the sailors, apprehensive of approaching death,
adopted this as the last resource.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another clause follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jonah had gone down into the
sides</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
or the side, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
ship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Jonah no doubt sought a retreat before
the storm arose. As soon then as they sailed from the harbor, Jonah withdrew to
some remote corner, that he might sleep there. But this was no excusable
insensibility on his part, as he knew that he was a fugitive from the presence
of God: he ought then to have been agitated by unceasing terrors; nay, he ought
to have been to himself the taxer (<i>exactor</i>) of anxiety. But it often so
happens, that when any one has sought hiding-places, he brings on himself a
stupor almost brutal; he thinks of nothing, he cares for nothing, he is anxious
for nothing. Such then was the insensibility which possessed the soul of Jonah,
when he went down to some recess in the ship, that he might there indulge
himself in sleep. Since it thus happened to the holy Prophet, who of us ought
not to fear for himself? Let us hence learn to remind ourselves often of
God&#8217;s tribunal; and when our minds are seized with torpor, let us learn to
stimulate and examine ourselves, lest God&#8217;s judgment overwhelm us while
asleep. For what prevented ruin from wholly swallowing up Jonah, except the
mercy of God, who pitied his servant, and watched for his safety even while he
was asleep? Had not the Lord then exercised such care over Jonah, he must have
perished.    </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe10</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the Lord often cares for his people
when they care not for themselves, and that he watches while they are asleep:
but this ought not to serve to nourish our self-indulgence; for every one of us
is already more indulgent to himself than he ought to be: but, on the contrary,
this example of Jonah, whom we see to have been so near destruction, ought to
excite and urge us, that when any of us has gone astray from his calling he may
not lie secure in that state, but, on the contrary, run back immediately to God.
And if God be not able to draw us back to himself without some violent means,
let us at least follow in this respect the example of Jonah, which we shall in
its own place notice. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah relates here how he was reproved by the pilot
or master of the ship   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,
inasmuch as he alone slept, while all the rest were in anxiety and fear.
&#8220;What meanest thou, fast sleeper?&#8221; The pilot no doubt upbraids Jonah
for his sleepiness, and reproves him for being almost void of all thought and
reflection. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What meanest thou,

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says; when thou sees all the rest smitten with alarm, how canst thou sleep?
Is not this unnatural? <i>Rise,</i> then, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>call on thy
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that where there is no rule of faith a liberty
is commonly taken, so that every one goes astray here and there. Whence was it,
that the pilot said to Jonah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Call on thy
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and that he did not confine him to any
certain rule? Because it had been customary in all ages for men to be satisfied
with some general apprehension of God; and then every one according to his own
fancy formed a god for himself: nor could it have been otherwise, as I have
said, while men were not restrained by any sacred bond. All agree as to this
truth, that there is some God, and also that no dead idol can do anything, but
that the world is governed by the providence and power of God, and further, that
safety is to be sought from him. All this, has been received by the common
consent of all; but when we come to particulars, then every one is in the dark;
how God is to be sought they know not. Hence every one takes his own liberty:
&#8220;For the sake of appeasing God I will then try this; this shall be my mode
of securing his favor; the Lord will regard this service acceptable; in this way
shall all my iniquity be expiated, that I may obtain favor with God.&#8221; Thus
each invents for themselves some tortuous way to come to God; and then every one
forms a god peculiar to himself. There can therefore be no stability nor
consistency in men, unless they are joined together by some bond, even by some
certain rule of religion, so that they may not vacillate, and not be in doubt as
to what is right to be done, but be assured and certainly persuaded, that there
is but one true God, and know what sort of God he is, and then understand the
way by which he is to be sought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then learn from this passage, that there is an
awful license taken in fictitious religions, and that all who are carried away
by their fancy are involved in a labyrinth, so that men do nothing but weary and
torment themselves in vain, when they seek God without understanding the right
way. They indeed run with all their might, but they go farther and farther from
God. But that they, at the same time, form in their minds an idea of some God,
and that they agree on this great principle, is sufficiently evident from the
second clause of this verse, <i>If so be that God will be Propitious to us.
</i>Here the pilot confines not his discourse to the God of Jonah, but speaks
simply of a God; for though the world by their differences divide God, and Jonah
worshipped a God different from the rest, and, in short, there was almost an
endless number of gods among the passengers, yet the pilot says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If so be that
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.: now then he acknowledges some
Supreme God, though each of them had his own god. We hence see that what I have
said is most true, &#8212; that this general truth has ever been received with
the consent of all, &#8212; that the world is preserved by the providence of
God, and hence that the life and safety of men are in his hand. But as they are
very far removed from God, and not only creep slowly, but are also more inclined
to turn to the earth than to look up to heaven, and are uncertain and ever
change, so they seek gods which are nigh to them, and when they find none, they
hesitate not to invent them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have elsewhere seen that the Holy Spirit uses this
form of speaking, <i>If so be,</i> when no doubt, but difficulty alone is
intended. It is however probable, that the pilot in this case was perplexed and
doubtful, as it is usual with ungodly men, and that he could determine nothing
certain as to any help from God; and as his mind was thus doubtful, he says,
that every means of relief were to be tried. And here, as in a mirror, we may
see how miserable is the condition of all those who call not on God in pure
faith: they indeed cry to God, for the impulse of nature thus leads them; but
they know not whether they will obtain any thing by their cries: they repeat
their prayers; but they know not whether they pass off into air or really come
to God. The pilot owns, that his mind was thus doubtful, <i>If so be</i> that
God will be <i>propitious to us, call thou also on thy God.</i> Had he been so
surely convinced, as to call on the true God, he would have certainly found it
to have been no doubtful relief. However, that nothing might be left untried, he
exhorted Jonah, that if he had a God, to call upon him. We hence see, that there
are strange windings, when we do not understand the right way. Men would rather
run here and there, a hundred times, through earth and heaven, than come to God,
except where his word shines. How so? because when they make the attempt, an
insane impulse drives them in different ways; and thus they are led here and
there: &#8220;It may be, that this may be useful to me; as that way has not
succeeded, I will try another.&#8221; God then thus punishes all the
unbelieving, who obey not his word; for to the right way they do not keep: He
indeed shows how great a madness it is, when men give loose reins to their
imaginations, and do not submit to celestial truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words, interpreters translate them in
different ways. Some say, &#8220;If so be that God will think of us;&#8221;
others &#8220;If so be that God will favor us.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">T&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oshit,</i> is properly to shine; but when put as here in the conjugation
Hithpael, it means to render one&#8217;s self clear or bright: and it is a
metaphor very common in Scriptures that the face of God is cloudy or dark, when
he is not propitious to us; and again, God is said to make bright his face and
to appear serene to us, when he really shows himself kind and gracious to us. As
then this mode of speaking altogether suits this place, I wonder that some seek
extraneous interpretations.   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, <i>Lest we perish.</i> Here the
pilot clearly owns, that he thought the life of man to be in the power of God;
for he concluded, that they must perish unless the Lord brought aid. Imprinted
then in the minds of all is this notion or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prolhyiv</font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, preconception, that when God is angry or adverse, we are miserable, and
that near destruction impends over us; and another conviction is found to be in
the hearts of men, &#8212; that as soon as the Lord looks on us, his favor and
goodwill brings to us immediate safety. The Holy Spirit does not speak here, but
a heathen, and we know too how great is the impiety of sailors, and yet he
declares this by the impulse of nature, and there is here no feigning; for God,
as I have already said, extorts by necessity a confession from the unbelieving,
which they would gladly avoid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now what excuse can we have, if we think our safety
to be in our own hands, if we depend not wholly on God, and if we neglect him in
prosperity, as though we could be safe without his help? These words then,
spoken by the sailor, ought to be weighed by us, &#8216;If so be that
God&#8217;s face may appear bright to us, and that we perish not.

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah did not without reason mention this, &#8212;
that the passengers consulted together about casting lots; for we hence learn,
that it was no ordinary tempest: it appeared then to be a token of God&#8217;s
wrath. For, if strong wind arose, it would not have been so strange, for such
had been often the case; and if a tempest followed, it would not have been a
thing unusual. It must then have been something more dreadful, as it filled
men&#8217;s minds with alarms so that they were conscious that God was present
as an avenger: and we know, that it is not common with ungodly men to recognize
the vengeance of Gods except in extreme dangers; but when God executes
punishment on sins in an unusual manner, then men begin to acknowledge
God&#8217;s vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This very thing, Jonah now bears witness to,<i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lots.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Was it not an accustomed thing for them to cast lots whenever a tempest arose?
By no means. They had recourse, no doubt, to this expedient, because they knew,
that God had not raised up that tempest without some very great and very serious
cause. This is one thing: but I cannot now pursue the subjects, I must therefore
defer it until tomorrow.</font><br></div>

here disquieted in the midst of so many tossings, we may yet learn with tranquil
minds to recumb on thy grace and promise, by which thou testifiest that thou
wilt be ever near us, and not wait until by a strong hand thou drawest us to
thyself, but that we may be, on the contrary, ever attentive to thy providence:
may we know that our life not only depends on a thread, but also vanishes like
the smoke, unless thou protectest it, so that we may recumb wholly on thy power;
and may we also, while in a cheerful and quiet state, so call on thee, that
relying on thy protection we may live in safety, and at the same time be
careful, lest torpor, which draws away our minds and thoughts from meditating on
the divine life, should creep over us, but may we, on the contrary, so earnestly
seek thee, morning and evening, and at all times, that we may through life
advance towards the mark thou hast set before us, until we at length reach that
heavenly kingdom, which Christ thy Son has obtained for us by his own blood.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
SEVENTY-FOURTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said in yesterday&#8217;s lecture, that it was a
proof of extreme fear, that the sailors and the rest cast lots; for this is not
usually done, except men see themselves to be destitute of judgment and
counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must at the same time be observed, that
through error they cast lots: for they did not know, that if God intended to
punish each of them, they were worthy even of heavier punishment. They would not
indeed have thrown the blame on one man, if each had well considered what he
deserved before God. When a calamity happens, it is the duty of every one to
examine himself and his whole life before God: then every one, from the first to
the last, must confess that he bears a just judgment. But when all demand
together who is guilty before God, they thus exonerate themselves, as though
they were innocent. And it is an evil that prevails at this day in the world,
that every one is disposed to cast the blame on others and all would have
themselves to be innocent before God; not that they can clear themselves of
every fault, but they extenuate their sins, as though God could not justly
pursue them with so much severity. As for instance, when any one perceives that
he had in various ways done wrong, he will indeed confess in words that he is a
sinner; but were any person to enumerate and bring forward each of his sins he
would say, &#8220;This is a light offense, that is a venal sin; and the Lord
deals not with us with so much strict justice, that he means to bring on us
instantly extreme punishment.&#8221; When there is a slight offense, it is
immediately referred to by every one. Thus acted the sailors, of whom Jonah now
speaks. Had any one asked, whether they were wholly without fault, every one, no
doubt, would have confessed that he was a sinner before God; but yet they cast
lots as though one only was exposed to God&#8217;s judgment. How so? because
they did not think that their own sins deserved so heavy a punishment. How much
soever they might have offended, &#8212; and this they really felt and were
convinced of, &#8212; they yet did not make so much of their sins as to think
that they deserved any such judgment. This then is the reason why they come to
the lot; it was, because every one seemed to himself to be blameless when he
came to examine himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, then, shows what is even well known by
common experience, &#8212; that men, though they know themselves to be guilty
before God, yet extenuate their sins and promise themselves pardon, as though
they could make an agreement with God, that he should not treat them with strict
justice, but deal with them indulgently. Hence, then, is the hope of impunity,
because we make light offenses of the most grievous sins. Thus we find under the
Papacy, that various modes are devised, by which they absolve themselves before
God and wipe away their stains: the sprinkling of holy water cleanses almost all
sins; except a man be either an adulterer, or a murderer, or a sorcerer, or ten
times perjured, he hardly thinks himself to be guilty of any crime. Then the
expiations which they use, avail, as they think, to obliterate all iniquities.
Whence is this error? Even because they consider God to be like themselves, and
think not their sins to be so great abominations before God. But this is no new
thing; for we see what happened in the time of Jonah; and from profane histories
also we may learn, that this error possessed everywhere the minds of all. They
had then daily expiations, as the Papists have their masses, their pilgrimages,
their sprinklings of holy water, and similar playthings (<i>nugas &#8212;
</i>trifles, fopperies): but as under the Papacy there are reserved cases, so
also in former times, when any one had killed a father or mother, when any one
had committed incest, he stood in need of some extraordinary expiation; and if
there was any one of great renown on the earth, they applied to him, that he
might find out some new kind of expiation. An example of this error is set
before us here, when they said,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let us cast
lots.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For except they thought that one only was
guilty, and not and every one would have publicly confessed his sins, and would
then have acknowledged that such was the mass of them as to be enough to fill
heaven and earth; but this they did not. One man must have been the offender;
but no one came forward with such a confession: hence they cast
lots.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may now be inquired, whether this mode of seeking
out the truth was lawful; as they knew not through whose fault the tempest
arose, was it right to have recourse to lots? Some have been too superstitious
in condemning lots; for they have plainly said, that all lots are wicked. Hence
has come the name, lot-drawers; (<i>sortilegi</i>) and they have thought that
lot-drawers differ nothing from magicians and enchanters. This has proceeded
from ignorance, for we know that the casting of lots has been sometimes allowed.
And Solomon certainly speaks, as of a common rule, when he says of lots being
cast into the bosom, and of the issue being from Jehovah
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;201633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
16:33.) Solomon speaks not there of the arts of magic but says that when lots
are cast, the event is not by chance but by God&#8217;s providence. And when
Matthias was chosen in the place of Judas, it was done by lot,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
1:26.) Did the Apostles use this mode presumptuously? No, the Holy Spirit
presided over this election. There is then no doubt but that God approved of
that casting of lots. So also Joshua had recourse to the lot when the cause of
God&#8217;s displeasure was unknown, though it was evident that God was angry
with the people. Joshua, being perplexed by what was unknown, did cast lots; and
so Achan was discovered and his sacrilege. That lot no one will dare condemn.
Then what I have said is clear enough, that those have been too superstitious
who have condemned all casting of lots without exception. But we must yet
remember that lots are not to be used indiscriminately. It is a part of the
civil law, that when a common inheritance is divided, it is allowed to cast
lots: as it belongs not to this or that person to choose, each must take the
part which the lot determines. So again it is lawful to cast lot in great
undertakings, when men are anywhere sent: and when there is a division of labor,
to prevent jealousy when one wishes to choose a certain part for himself, the
lot will remove all contentions. A lot of this kind is allowed both by the word
of God, and by civil laws. But when any one adopts the lot without any reason,
he is no doubt superstitious, and differs not much from the magician or the
enchanter. As for instance, when one intends to go a journey, or to take
anything in hand, if he throws into his hat a white and a black lot, and says,
&#8220;I will see whether my going out today will be prosperous;&#8221; now this
is of the devil; for Satan by such arts deludes wretched men. If then any one
makes use of the lot without any just reason, he is, as I have said without
excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to the other lots, such as we have now
noticed, they ought not to be viewed as precedents. For though Joshua used the
lot to bring to light the cause for which God was angry with his people, it is
not yet right for us to imitate what he did; for Joshua was no doubt led by some
peculiar influence to adopt this measure. So also as to Saul, when he cast lots,
and his son Jonathan was discovered as the one who had tasted honey, it was an
especial example. The same thing must be also said of the lot mentioned here;
for as the sailors were trembling, and knew not the cause why the tempest arose,
and the fear of shipwreck seized them, they had recourse to the lot. Were we
continually to imitate such examples, such a liberty would not certainly be
pleasing, to God, nor consistent with his word. We must therefore bear in mind,
that there were some peculiar influences, whenever God&#8217;s servants used the
lot in doubtful and extreme cases   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. This
then is shortly the answer to the question &#8212; Was it lawful for the sailors
to cast lots, that they might find out the person on account of whom they were
in so much danger? I now proceed to what follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">After the lot fell on Jonah, they doubted not but
that he was the guilty person, any more than if he had been a hundred times
proved to be so: for why did they cast lots, except that they were persuaded
that all doubt could thus be removed, and that what was hid could thus be
brought to the light? As then this persuasion was fixed in their minds, that the
truth was elicited, and was in a manner drawn out of darkness by the lot, they
now inquire of Jonah what he had done: for they took this as allowed, that they
had to endure the tempest on his account, and also, that he, by some detestable
crime, had merited such a vengeance at Gods hand. We hence see that they cast
lots, because they fully believed that they could not otherwise find out the
crime on account of which they suffered, and also, that lots were directed by
the hidden purpose of God: for how could a certain judgment be found by lot,
except God directed it according to his own purpose, and overruled what seemed
to be especially fortuitous? These principles then were held as certain in a
manner by men who were heathens, &#8212; that God can draw out the truth, and
bring it to the light, &#8212; and also, that he presides over lots, however
fortuitous they may be thought to be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This was the reason why they now asked what Jonah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had done.</i> <i>Tell
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>why has this evil happened to us,
what is thy work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> etc. By work here I do
not mean what is wrong, but a kind of life, or, as they say, a manner of living.
They then asked how Jonah had hitherto employed himself, and what sort of life
he followed. For it afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tell us, whence comest thou, what
is thy country, and from what people art thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino">
They made inquiries, no doubt, on each particular in due order; but Jonah here
briefly records the questions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to his answer,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He said to them, I am an Hebrew;
and I fear Jehovah the God of heaven, Who has created the sea and the dry
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Here Jonah seemed as yet to evade, yea, to disown his crime, for he professed
himself to be the worshipper of the true God. Who would not have said, but that
he wished here to escape by a subterfuge, as he set up his own piety to cover
the crime before-mentioned? But all things are not here in the first verse
related; for shortly after, it follows, that the sailors knew of Jonah&#8217;s
flight; and that he had himself told them, that he had disobeyed God&#8217;s
call and command. There is then no doubt but that Jonah honestly confessed his
own sin, though he does not say so. But we know, that it is a mode of speaking
common among the Hebrews to add in the last place what had been first said; and
grammarians say, that it is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[steron
proteron</font><font face="Palatino">, (last first,) when anything is left out
in its proper place and then added as an explanation. When therefore Jonah says
that he was <i>an Hebrew,</i> and worshipper of the true God, &#8212; this
tended to aggravate his fault or crime rather than to excuse it: for had he said
only, that he was conscious of having done wrong in disobeying God, his crime
would not have appeared so atrocious; but when he begins by sayings that known
to him was the true God, the framer of heaven and earth, the God of Israel, who
had made himself known by a law given and published, &#8212; when Jonah made
this introduction, he thereby removed from himself all pretenses as to ignorance
and misconception. He had been educated in the law, and had, from childhood,
been taught who the true God was. He could not then have fallen through
ignorance; and further, he did not, as the others, worship fictitious gods; he
was an Israelite. As then he had been brought up in true religion, his sin was
the more atrocious, inasmuch as he had fallen away from God, having despised his
command, and, as it were, shaken off the yoke, and had become a
fugitive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the reason why Jonah called
himself here an Hebrew, and testified that he was the worshipper of the true
God. First, by saying that he was an Hebrew, he distinguished the God of Abraham
from the idols of the Gentiles: for the religion of the chosen people was well
known in all places, though disapproved by universal consent; at the same time,
the Cilicians and other Asiatics, and also the Grecians, and the Syrians in
another quarter, &#8212; all these knew what the Israelites gloried in, &#8212;
that the true God had appeared to their father Abraham, and then made with him a
gratuitous covenant, and also had given the law by Moses; &#8212; all this was
sufficiently known by report. Hence Jonah says now, that he was an Hebrew, as
though he had said, that he had no concern with any fictitious god, but with the
God of Abraham, who had formerly appeared to the holy Fathers, and who had also
given a perpetual testimony of his will by Moses. We see then how emphatically
he declared, that he was an Hebrew: secondly, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I fear Jehovah the God of
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word fear is meant worship: for
it is not to be taken here as often in other places, that is, in its strict
meaning; but fear is to be understood for worship: &#8220;I am not given&#8221;,
he says, &#8220;to various superstitions, but I have been taught in true
religion; God has made himself known to me from my childhood: I therefore do not
worship any idol, as almost all other people, who invent gods for themselves;
but I worship God, the creator of heaven and earth.&#8221; He calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, who dwells alone as God
in heaven. While the others thought heaven to be filled with a great number of
gods, Jonah here sets up against them the one true God, as though he said,
&#8220;Invent according to your own fancy innumerable gods, there is yet but
one, who possesses the highest authority in heaven; for it is he who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made the sea and the dry
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then apprehend what Jonah meant by these
words: he shows here that it was no wonder that God pursued him with so much
severity; for he had not committed a slight offense, but a fatal sin. We now see
how much Jonah had profited since the Lord had begun severely to deal with him:
for inasmuch as he was asleep yea, and insensible in his sin, he would have
never repented had it not been for this violent remedy. But when the Lord roused
him by his severity, he then not only confessed that he was guilty, or owned his
guilt in a formal manner, (<i>defunctorie </i>&#8212; as ridding one&#8217;s
self of a business, carelessly;) but also willingly testified, as we see, before
men who were heathens, that he was the guilty man, who had forsaken the true
God, in whose worship he had been well instructed. This was the fruit of true
penitence, and it was also the fruit of the chastisement which God had inflicted
on him. If then we wish God to approve of our repentance, let us not seek
evasions, as for the most part is the case; nor let us extenuate our sins, but
by a free confession testify before the whole world what we have
deserved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows, that the men feared with great fear,
and said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why hast thou done
this? </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe19</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
for they knew treat he had fled from the presence of Jehovah, for he had told
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And this is not unimportant
&#8212; that <i>the sailors feared with great fear: </i>for Jonah means that
they were not only moved by what he said, but also terrified, so that they gave
to the true God his glory. We indeed know that superstitious men almost trifle
with their own idols. They often entertain, it is true, strange fears, but
afterwards they flatter themselves, and in a manner cajole their own hearts, so
that they can pleasantly and sweetly smile at their own fancies. But Jonah, by
saying here that they <i>feared with great fear,</i> means that they were so
smitten, that they really perceived that the God of Israel was a righteous
judge, and that he was not such as other nations fancied him to be, but that he
was capable of affording dreadful examples whenever he intended to execute his
vengeance. We hence see what Jonah means, when he speaks of great fear. At the
same time, two things ought to be noticed, &#8212; that they feared, because it
was easy for them to conclude from the Prophet&#8217;s words, that the God of
Israel was the only creator of heaven and earth, &#8212; and then, that it was a
great fear, which, as I have said, must be considered as serious dread, since
the fear which the unbelieving have soon vanishes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But with regard to the reproof which the sailors and
other passengers gave to Jonah, the Lord returned to him this as a reward which
he had deserved. He had fled from the presence of God; he had thus, as we have
said taken away from God his supreme power: for what becomes of God&#8217;s
authority when any one of us rejects his commands and flees away from his
presence? Since Jonah then sought to shun God, he was now placed before men.
There were present heathens, and even barbarians, who rebuked him for his sin,
who were his censors and judges. And the same thing we see happening often. For
they who do not willingly obey God and his word, afterwards abandon themselves
to many flagrant sins, and their baseness becomes evident to all. As, then, they
cannot bear God to be their Master and Teacher, they are constrained to bear
innumerable censors; for they are branded by the reproaches of the vulgar, they
are pointed at every where by the finger, at length they are conducted to the
gallows, and the executioner becomes their chief teacher. The case was similar,
as we see, with Jonah: the pilot had before reproved his torpor, when he said,
Do thou also call on thy God; what meanest thou, O sleeper? thou liest down here
like a log of wood, and yet thou sees us perplexed and in extreme danger. As,
then, the pilot first so sharply inveighed against Jonah, and then all reproved
him with one mouth, we certainly find that he was made subject to the
condemnation of all, because he tried to deprive God of his supreme power. If at
any time the same thing should happen to us, if God should subject us to the
reproaches of men when we seek to avoid his judgment, let us not wonder. But as
Jonah here calmly answers, and raises no clamor, and shows no bitterness, so let
every one of us, in the true spirit of meekness, acknowledge our own sins; when
charged with them, were even children our condemners, or were even the most
contemptible of the people to rise up against us, let us patiently bear all
this; and let us know that these kinds of censors befall us through the
providence of God. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The sailors asked counsel of Jonah; and hence it
appears that they were touched with so much fear as not to dare to do any thing
to him. We hence see how much they had improved almost in an instant, since they
spared an Israelite, because they acknowledged that among that people the true
God was worshipped, the supreme King of heaven and earth: for, without a doubt,
it was this fear that restrained them from throwing Jonah immediately into the
sea. For since it was certain that through his fault God was displeased with
them all, why was it that they did not save themselves by such an expiation?
That they then delayed in so great a danger, and dared not to lay hold instantly
on Jonah, was an evident proof that they were restrained, as I have said, by the
fear of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They therefore inquire what was to be done,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What shall we do to thee,
that the sea may be still to us?</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the sea was
going</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. By going Jonah means, that
the sea was turbulent: for the sea is said to rest when it is calm, but when it
is turbulent, then it is going, and has various movements and tossings. <i>The
sea,</i> then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was going and very
tempestuous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
hence see that God was not satisfied with the disgrace of Jonah, but he purposed
to punish his offense still more. It was necessary that Jonah should be led to
the punishment which he deserved, though afterwards, he was miraculously
delivered from death, as we shall see in its proper place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah then answers,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take me, and throw me into the
sea, and it will be still to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be
asked whether Jonah ought to have of his own accord offered himself to die; for
it seemed to be an evidence of desperation. He might, indeed, have surrendered
himself to their will; but here he did, as it were, stimulate them,
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Throw me into the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino">,&#8221; he says; &#8220;for ye cannot
otherwise pacify God than by punishing me.&#8221; He seemed like a man in
despair, when he would thus advance to death of his own accord. But Jonah no
doubt knew that he was doomed to punishment by God. It is uncertain whether he
then entertained a hope of deliverance, that is, whether he confidently relied
at this time on the grace of God. But, however it may have been, we may yet
conclude, that he gave himself up to death, because he knew and was fully
persuaded that he was in a manner summoned by the evident voice of God. And thus
there is no doubt but that he patiently submitted to the judgment which the Lord
had allotted to him. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and throw me into the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sea will be to you
still</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here Jonah not only declares that
God would be pacified by his death, because the lot had fallen upon him, but he
also acknowledges that his death would suffice as an expiation, so that the
tempest would subside: and then the reason follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that on my account is this great
tempest come upon you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When he says that
he knew this, he could not refer to the lot, for that knowledge was common to
them all. But Jonah speaks here by the prophetic spirit: and he no doubt
confirms what I have before referred to, &#8212; that the God of Israel was the
supreme and only King of heaven and earth. This certainty of knowledge, then, of
which Jonah speaks, must be referred to his own consciences and to the teaching
of that religion in which he had been instructed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And now we may learn from these words a most useful
instruction: Jonah does not here expostulate with God, nor contumeliously
complain that God punished him too severely, but he willingly bears his charged
guilt and his punishment, as he did before when he said, &#8220;I am the
worshipper of the true God.&#8221; How could he confess the true God, whose
great displeasure he was then experiencing? But Jonah, we see, was so subdued,
that he failed not to ascribe to God his just honor; though death was before his
eyes, though God&#8217;s wrath was burning, we yet see, that he gave to God, as
we have said, the honor due to him. So the same thing is repeated in this place,
<i>Behold,</i> he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I know
that on my account has this great tempest
happened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He who takes to himself all
the blame, does not certainly murmur against God. It is then a true confession
of repentance, when we acknowledge God, and willingly testify before men that he
is just, though, according to the judgment of our flesh, he may deal violently
with us. When however we give to him the praise due to his justice, we then
really show our penitence; for unless God&#8217;s wrath brings us down to this
humble state of mind, we shall be always full of bitterness; and, however silent
we may be for a time, our heart will be still perverse and rebellious. This
humility, then, always follows repentance, &#8212; the sinner prostrates himself
before God, and willingly admits his own sin, and tries not to escape by
subterfuges.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it was no wonder that Jonah thus humbled himself;
for we see that the sailors did the same: when they said that lots were to be
cast, they added at the same time, &#8220;Come ye and let us cast lots, that we
may know why this evil has happened to us.&#8221; They did not accuse God, but
constituted him the Judge; and thus they acknowledged that he inflicted a just
punishment. And yet every one thought himself to have been innocent; for however
conscience might have bitten them, still no one considered himself to have been
guilty of so great a wickedness as to subject him to God&#8217;s vengeance.
Though, then, the sailors thought themselves exempt from any great sin, they yet
did not contend with God, but allowed him to be their Judge. Since then they,
who were so barbarous, confined themselves within these bounds of modesty, it
was no wonder that Jonah, especially when he was roused and began to feel his
guilt, and was also powerfully restrained by God&#8217;s hand, &#8212; it was no
wonder that he now confessed that he was guilty before God, and that he justly
suffered a punishment so heavy and severe. We ought then to take special notice
of this, &#8212; that he knew that on his account the storm happened or that the
sea was so tempestuous against them all. The rest we defer until
tomorrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God that as thou urgest
us daily to repentance and each of us is also stung with the consciousness of
his own sins, &#8212; 0 grant, that we may not grow stupid in our vices, nor
deceive ourselves with empty flatteries, but that each of us may, on the
contrary carefully examine his own life and then with one mouth and heart
confess that we are all guilty not only of light offenses, but of such as
deserve eternal death, and that no other relief remains for us but thine
infinite mercy and that we may so seek to become partakers of that grace which
has been once offered to us by thy Son, and is daily offered to us by his
Gospel, that, relying on him as our Mediator, we may not cease to entertain hope

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse shows that the sailors and the rest were
more inclined to mercy, when they saw that the holy Prophet was willing to
undergo the punishment which he had deserved. When therefore, he confessed that
he was guilty, and refused not to be punished, they became anxious to spare his
life, though they were heathens, and also for the most part barbarians: and as
each of them could not but be frightened with his immediate danger, the wonder
is increased, that they had such regard for the life of one who alone was in
fault, and who had now freely confessed this. But the Lord so turned their
hearts, that they now saw more clearly how grievous a sin it was to flee away
from the call of God, and not to yield obedience, as we have before observed, to
his command. Many think that this is a light offense, and readily indulge
themselves in it: but it is not in the power of men to weigh sins; the balance
is deceitful when men estimate their sins according to their own judgment. Let
us then learn to ascribe to God his own honor, &#8212; that he alone is Judge,
and is far above us, and can alone determine how grievous or how slight any sin
is. But common sense, except when men willfully deceive themselves by vain
flatteries, clearly teaches this, &#8212; that it is no light offense when we
evade the command of God; for, as we have stated, men do thus take away from God
his supreme authority; and what is left to God, when he governs not the
creatures whom he has formed, and whom he sustains by his power? The Lord, then,
designed to show here, that his displeasure could not be otherwise pacified than
by drowning Jonah in the sea; though, as we shall presently see, he had
something greater in view. But, in the meantime, this is worthy of being
observed, &#8212; that the Lord intended to make Jonah an example, that all may
now know that he is not to be trifled with, but that he ought to be obeyed as
soon as he commands any thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word which the Prophet uses has been variously
explained by interpreters.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rtj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chetar,</i> is properly, to dig; so that some think it to be a metaphorical
expression, as rowers seem to dig the sea; and this sense is not unsuitable.
Others carry the metaphor still higher, &#8212; that the sailors searched out or
sought means by which they might drive the ship to land. But the other metaphor,
as being less remote, is more to be approved. The Latins call it to toil,
(<i>moliri</i>) when the rowers not only apply gently their oars, but when they
make a greater effort. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sailors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>toiled to bring back the
ship</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
But for what purpose? To spare the life of the man who had already confessed
that he was guilty before God, and that the storm, which threatened them all
with a shipwreck, had arisen through his fault: but he says that they could not,
for the sea was tempestuous, as we have already seen in our yesterday&#8217;s
lecture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the second verse.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
cried</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to Jehovah and said, We
beseech</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah, let us not perish,
we pray, on account of the life of this man, and give
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, lay not,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>innocent blood upon
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet now expresses more fully why the sailors toiled so much to return to
port, or to reach some shore, &#8212; they were already persuaded that Jonah was
a worshipper of the true God, and not only this, but that he was a Prophet,
inasmuch as he had told them, as we have seen, that he had fled from the
presence of God, because he feared to execute the command which we have noticed.
It was therefore pious (<i>reverentia</i>) fear that restrained the sailors,
knowing, as they did, that Jonah was the servant of the true God. They, at the
same time, saw, that Jonah was already standing for his sin before God&#8217;s
tribunal, and that punishment was demanded. This they saw; but yet they wished
to preserve his life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this place shows, that there is by nature
implanted in all an abhorrence of cruelty; for however brutal and sanguinary
many men may be, they yet cannot divest themselves of this feeling, &#8212; that
the effusion of human blood is hateful. Many, at the same time, harden
themselves; but they apply a searing iron: they cannot shake off horror, nay,
they feel that they are detested by God and by men, when they thus shed innocent
blood. Hence it was that the sailors, who in other respects hardly retained a
drop of humanity, fled as suppliants to God, when the case was about the death
of man; and they said, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhy
hna</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ane Ieve</i>, &#8216;We beseech
Jehovah:&#8217; and the expression is repeated; which shows that the sailors
earnestly prayed that the Lord would not impute this as a sin to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that though these men had never known
the doctrine of the law, they were yet so taught by nature that they knew that
the blood of man is dear and precious in the sight of God. And as to us, we
ought not only to imitate these sailors, but to go far beyond them: for not only
ought the law of nature to prevail among us, but also the law of God; for we
hear what God had formerly pronounced with his own mouth,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Whosoever sheddeth
man&#8217;s blood, shed shall his blood be,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
9:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we know also the reason why God undertakes to
protect the life of men, and that is, because they have been created in his
image. Whosoever then uses violence against the life of man, destroys, as far as
he can the image of the eternal God. Since it is so, ought not violence and
cruelty to be regarded by us with double horror? We ought also to learn another
thing from this doctrine: God proves by this remarkable testimony what paternal
feeling he manifests towards us by taking our life under his own guardianship
and protection; and he even proves that we are really the objects of his care,
inasmuch as he will execute punishment and vengeance when any one unjustly
injures us. We then see that this doctrine on the one side restrains us, that we
may not attempt anything against the lives of our brethren; and, on the other
side, it assures us of the paternal love of God, so that being allured by his
kindness we may learn to deliver up ourselves wholly to his
protection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to the last clause of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou, Jehovah, hast done as
it has pleased thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The sailors clearly prove
here that they did not willingly shed innocent blood. How then can these two
things agree, &#8212; that the blood was innocent, and that they were blameless?
They adopted this excuse, &#8212; that they obeyed God&#8217;s decree, that they
did nothing rashly or according to their own inclinations, but followed what the
Lord had prescribed: though, indeed, God had not spoken, yet what he required
was really evident; for as God demanded an expiation by the death of Jonah, so
he designed to continue the tempest until he was thrown into the deep. These
things the sailors now put forward. But we must notice, that they did not cast
the blame on God, as blasphemers are wont to do, who, while they seek to exempt
themselves from blame, find fault with God, or at least put him in their own
place: &#8220;Why then,&#8221; they say, &#8220;does he sit as a judge to
condemn us for that of which he is himself the author, since he has so
decreed?&#8221; At this day there are many fanatics who thus speak, who
obliterate all the difference between good and evil, as if lust were to them the
law. They at the same time make a covert of God&#8217;s providence. Jonah wished
not that such a thing should be thought of the sailors; but as they well
understood that God governed the world justly, though his counsels be secret and
cannot be comprehended by us, &#8212; as, then, they were thus convinced, they
thus strengthened themselves; and though they gave to God the praise due to his
justice, they at the same time trembled lest they should be guilty of innocent
blood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how reverently these men spoke of
God, and that so much religious fear possessed them, that they did not rob God
of his praise, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> they said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hast done as it has pleased
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Do they here accuse God of tyranny, as though he confounded all things without
any cause or reason? By no means. They took this principle as granted, &#8212;
that the will of God is right and just, yea, that whatever God has decreed is
beyond doubt just. Being then thus persuaded, they took the will of God as the
rule for acting rightly: &#8220;As thou, Jehovah, hast done as it seemed good to
thee, so we are blameless.&#8221; But at the same time it is proper also to add,
that the sailors do not vainly talk here of the secret providence of God in
order to impute murder to him, as ungodly men and profane cavilers do at this
day: but as the Lord made known his purpose to them, they show that the storm
and the tempest could not be otherwise calmed and quieted than by drowning
Jonah: they therefore took this knowledge of God&#8217;s purpose as a certain
rule to follow. At the same time they fled, as I have said, to God, and
supplicated his mercy, lest in a matter so perplexed and difficult he should
involve them in the same punishment, as they were constrained to shed innocent
blood. We now then apprehend the meaning of this passage. Now it follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah shows here that the tempest arose through his
fault; for the issue proved this with certainty. The sailors had not only cast
lots, but after Jonah was thrown into the sea the storm calmed, and the sea
became still, &#8212; this sudden change sufficiently proved that Jonah was the
only cause why they were so nearly shipwrecked. For if the sea had not calmed
immediately, but after some interval of time, it might have been ascribed to
chance: but as the sea instantly rested, it could not be otherwise said than
that Jonah was condemned by the judgment of God. He was indeed cast into the sea
by the hands of men; but God so presided, that nothing could be ascribed to men,
but that they executed the judgment which the Lord had openly demanded and
required from them. This, then, is the import of this verse. He now adds &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah now declares what fruit followed; and first, he
says, that the sailors feared the true God. He uses here the proper name of God,
Jehovah; for, as we have already seen, they were addicted to their own
superstitions, as each of them cried to his own god: but it was a false notion;
for they went astray after their own superstitions. The Prophet now points out
the difference, &#8212; that they began to fear the true God. At the same time
it may have been, that they afterwards relapsed into their own errors; yet it
ought not to be overlooked that the Lord constrained them to entertain such a
fear. The Hebrews, as it has been already said, sometimes take fear in a general
sense, as meaning worship. It is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;121701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 17:1, of the new inhabitants of the land of Canaan, who had been removed
from Persia, that they &#8220;feared God,&#8221; that is, that they imitated the
legal rite in sacrifices while worshipping God. But there is an addition in this
place, which shows that the meaning is more restricted, for it is said to have
been a <i>great fear.</i> Then Jonah means that the sailors and the passengers
were not only touched with the fear of God, but that they also had the
impression that the God of Israel was the supreme King of heaven and earth, that
he held all things under his hand and government. This fear no doubt led them to
true knowledge so as to know that they were previously deluded, and that
whatever the world had invented was mere delusion, and that the gods devised by
the fancies of men were nothing else but mere idols. We now then perceive what
Jonah means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must here say somewhat more at large of the
fear of God. When the Scripture speaks of the fear of God, it sometimes means
the outward worship, and sometimes true piety. When it designates the outward
worship, it is no great thing; for hypocrites usually perform their ceremonies,
and thus testify that they worship God: but yet, as they obey not God with
sincerity of heart, nor bring faith and repentance, they do nothing but trifle.
But the fear of God is often taken for true piety; and then it is called the
beginning or the chief point of wisdom, or even wisdom itself, as it is in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;182902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
29:28. The fear of God, then, or that pious regard (<i>reventia</i>) by which
the faithful willingly submit themselves to God, is the chief part of
wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it also often happens that men are touched by
servile fear, so as to have a desire to satisfy God, while, at the same time,
they have even a wish to draw him down from his throne. This servile fear is
full of perverseness; for they, at the same time, champ the bridle, as they
cannot exempt themselves from his power and authority. Such was this fear of
which Jonah speaks; for all those whom he mentions were not suddenly so changed
as to devote themselves to the true God: they had not indeed made such a
progress as this; it was not such real and thorough conversion of the soul as
changed them into new men. How, then, is it said that they feared? even because
the Lord extorted from them a confession at the time: it may have been that some
of them afterwards made a greater progress; but I speak now generally of the
whole. Because then it is said that they feared God, we are not hence to
conclude that they really repented, so as to become wholly devoted to the God of
Israel. But yet they were constrained to know and to confess that the God of
Israel was the only and the true God. How so? because that dreadful judgment
filled them with terror, so that they perceived that he alone was God who had
heaven and earth under his command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how that fear is to be viewed, of
which Jonah speaks. If they afterwards made no farther progress, it only served
to condemn them, that these sailors, having perceived by a sure evidence who the
only true God was, mingled with the worship of him their wicked and ungodly
superstitions, as many do even in our day. The Papists hold this truth in common
with us, &#8212; that there is one true God, the framer of heaven and earth,
yea, they come still nearer, and say that the only-begotten Son of God is our
Redeemer; but yet we see how they contaminate the whole worship of God, and turn
his truth to a lie; for they blend the worship of God with that of idols, so
that there is nothing pure among them. But this main truth is however of great
service, when the Lord stretches forth his hand to miserable men; for if there
was no conviction of this under the Papacy that the word of God is to be
believed, and that Christ the Son of God is the King and Head of the Church, we
must have had to employ against them a long circuitous argument; but now an
access to them is easy: when we bring against them the Law, and the Prophets,
and the Gospel, they are restrained by some measure of reverence, and dare not
to reject the authority of the Supreme God. We then see, that this fear is in
itself of no great value, if men remain fixed in their own mire; but when it is
the Lords purpose afterwards to call them, this fear opens for them the door to
true godliness. So it may have been, as I have said, that some of these sailors
and passengers had afterwards made better progress. But this fear of itself
could have done nothing more than to convict them, so that no excuse could avail
them before God&#8217;s tribunal; for a proof had been given them, by which they
might know that there was no other God than He who was then worshipped by the
chosen people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrificed a sacrifice to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
were accustomed before to offer sacrifices to their idols; but now they
testified that they worshipped the God of Israel; for this is what sacrifices
signify. But it must at the same time be observed that they thereby expressed
this confession, that God confirmed the truth of his word. When, therefore, they
perceived that this whole affair was ordered by the will of God, they were
constrained to bear witness that he was the true God: this was the end and
design of sacrifices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be inquired, whether that sacrifice
pleased God. It is certain that whenever men bring forward their own devices,
whatever is otherwise worthy of approbation in what they do, it cannot but be
corrupted and vitiated by such a mixture; for God, as it is well known, allows
of no associate. And we must remember that which is said in Ezekiel, &#8216;Go
ye, sacrifice to the devil, and not to me!&#8217; God there repudiates all the
sacrifices which were wont to be offered by the people of Israel, because
superstitions were blended with them. God then shows that such a mixture is so
disapproved by him, that he chooses rather that the superstitious should wholly
give themselves up to the devils than that his holy name should be thus
profaned. Hence this sacrifice of itself was not lawful, nor could it have
pleased God; but it was, so to speak, by accident and extrinsically that this
sacrifice pleased God, &#8212; because he designed thus to make known his glory.
Though, then, he repudiated the sailors themselves, yet it was his will that
this act should bear a testimony to his glory: as, for instance, a deed is often
vicious with regard to men, and yet in an accidental way it tends to set forth
the glory of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this ought to be carefully borne in mind: there
is at this day a dispute, yea a fierce contest, about good works: and the
Sophists ever deceive themselves by false reasoning;
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paralogismw~</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; sophistry) for they suppose that works morally good are either
preparatory to the obtaining of grace, or meritorious towards attaining eternal
life. When they speak of works morally good, they refer only to the outward
deeds; they regard not the fountain or motive, nor even the end. When the heart
of man is impure, unquestionably the work which thence flows is also ever
impure, and is an abomination before God. When the end also is wrong, when it is
not man&#8217;s purpose to worship God in sincerity of heart, the deed, however
splendid it may appear, is filth in the presence of God. Hence the Sophists are
greatly deceived, and are very childish, when they say, that works morally good
please God, and are preparatory to grace and meritorious of salvation. But can
this be, that a work does not please God, and yet avails to set forth his glory?
I answer, that these two things are perfectly consistent, and are in no way so
contrary that they cannot be easily reconciled. For God by accident, as I have
said, accommodates to his own glory what is in itself vicious; I say, in itself,
that is, with respect to men. Thus even under the Papacy the Christian name
serves to the glory of God, for there ever remains some remnant. And how has it
happened, that at this time the light of the Gospel has shone forth, and that
true religion has been restored at least in many places? Even because the Lord
has never suffered true religion to be extinguished, though it has been
corrupted: for baptism under the Papacy, the very name of Christ as well as of
the Church, and the very form of religion &#8212; all these have become wholly
useless; but they have accidentally, as I have said, been of great service.
When, therefore, we regard the priests (<i>sacrificos &#8212; </i>the
sacrificers) as well as the people, we find nothing but a perverted worship of
God; they presumptuously and indiscriminately add their own superstitions and
devices to the word of God, and there is nothing pure among them. Since then
they thus blend together heaven and earth, they do nothing but provoke
God&#8217;s wrath against themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why Jonah says that the
sailors and passengers offered sacrifices. We must, at the same time, remember
what I have lately said, that sacrifice was, as it were, a symbol of Divine
worship: for even from the beginning this notion prevailed among all, that
sacrifices were to be offered to none but to God; and heathens in all ages had
no other opinion of sacrifices, but that they thus manifested their piety
towards their gods. Since then sacrifices have been from the beginning offered
to God alone, it follows, that they at this day are wholly inexcusable who join
associates to God, and offer their sacrifices to mortals or to angels. How can
this be borne in Christians, since heathens have ever confessed that they
regarded those as gods to whom they were wont to offer their sacrifices? Now
then, since God declares that the chief sacrifice to him is invocations as we
read in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
1:1, the whole of religion under the Papacy must be perverted, as they pray not
only to God but even to creatures: for they hesitate not to flee to Peter or to
Paul, yea, to their own saints, real and fictitious, in the same manner as to
the only true God. Inasmuch, then, as they rob God of this chief right, we see
that they tread under foot the whole of religion by this sacrilege. Since, then,
heathen men testified that they worshipped Jehovah, the God of Israel, by their
external sacrifice, let us learn at this day not to transfer the rightful honor
of God to creatures; but let this honor of being alone prayed to, be wholly and
entirely reserved for him; for this, as we have said is the chief and the most
valuable sacrifice which he demands and approves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jonah also adds, that the sailors
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vowed vows to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is a part of thanksgiving; for
we know that the object, not only of the holy fathers, but also of the
superstitious, in making vows, has ever been this &#8212; to bind themselves to
God, and also to express their gratitude, and to make it evident, that they owed
to him both their life and every favor bestowed on them. This then has in all
ages been the reason for making, vows. When, therefore the sailors vowed a vow
to God, they renounced their own idols. They cried before to their gods; but now
they understand that they had cried in vain, and without any benefit, as they
had to no purpose uttered their cries in the air. Now then they made their vows
to the only true God; for they knew that their lives were in his
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here we may easily learn how foolishly the
Sophists of our day heap together all passages of Scripture which make any
mention of vows; for they think that we are to be overwhelmed by that term
alone, when we condemn their false vows. But no one of us has ever denied or
does deny, that it is lawful to vows provided it be done according to what the
Law and the Gospel prescribes. What we hold is, &#8212; that men are not
thoughtlessly to obtrude on God what comes uppermost, but that they are to vow
what he approves, and also, that they regard a right and just end in vowing,
even to testify their gratitude to God. But in common vows which are made, there
are the grossest errors, as also in the whole of the Papal worship; for they vow
this and that to God indiscriminately, and regard not what the Lord requires or
approves: one, on certain days, abstains from meat; another combs not his head:
and a third trots away on some pilgrimage. All these things, we know, are
rejected by God. And further, when they vow nothing but what God approves, it is
yet done for a wrong purpose: for they seek in this way to bind God to
themselves, and the diabolical conceit of merits ever possesses their minds.
And, lastly, they consider not what they can do; they vow perpetual celibacy
when at the same time incontinence burns them; and thus we see that, like the
giants, they fight with God himself; and, in the meantime, they allow themselves
an unbridled liberty as to whatever they vow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know, that whenever the Scripture speaks
of vows, we are to take for granted these two principles, &#8212; that vows as
they appertain to the worship of God, ought not to be taken without any
discretion, according to men&#8217;s fancy, but ought to be regulated and guided
by God&#8217;s rule, so that men may bring nothing to God, except what they know
to be approved by his word, &#8212; and then, that they are to keep in view the
right end, even to show by this symbol their gratitude to God, to testify that
they are preserved by his kindness, as was the case with these sailors, who made
a vow because they thought that none but God was their deliverer; and so they
testified, that when they came safe to shore, they would make it known that the
God of Israel had showed mercy to them. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet here briefly relates ought to be
carefully weighed by us. It is easily passed over, when we read in a few words
that Jonah was swallowed up by a fish, and that he was there three days and
three nights: but though Jonah neither amplified or illustrated in a rhetorical
manner what is overlooked by us, nor adopted any display of words, but spoke of
the event as though it were an ordinary thing, we yet see what the event itself
really was: Jonah was cast into the sea. He had been previously not only a
worshipper of the true God, but also a Prophet, and had no doubt faithfully
discharged his office; for God would not have resolved to send him to Nineveh,
had he not conferred on him suitable gifts; and he knew him to be qualified for
undertaking a burden so great and so important. As Jonah then had faithfully
endeavored to serve God, and to devote himself to him through the whole of his
past life, now that he is cast into the sea as one unworthy of the common light,
that he is cut off from the society of men, and that he seems unworthy of
undergoing a common or an ordinary punishment, but is exiled, as it were, from
the world, so as to be deprived of light and air, as parricides, to whom
formerly, as it is well-known, this punishment was allotted &#8212; as then
Jonah saw that he was thus dealt with, what must have been the state of his
mind?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now that he tells us that he was three whole days in
the inside of the fish, it is certain that the Lord had so awakened him that he
must have endured continual uneasiness. He was asleep before he was swallowed by
the fish; but the Lord drew him, as it were, by force to his tribunal, and he
must have suffered a continual execution. He must have every moment entertained
such thoughts as these, &#8220;Why does he now thus deal with thee? God does not
indeed slay thee at once, but intends to expose thee to innumerable
deaths.&#8221; We see what Job says, that when he died he would be at rest and
free from all evils,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;181406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
14:6.) Jonah no doubt continually boiled with grief, because he knew that God
was opposed to and displeased with him: he doubtless said to himself,
&#8220;Thou hast to do, not with men, but with God himself, who now pursues
thee, because thou hast become a fugitive from his presence.&#8221; As Jonah
then must have necessarily thus thought within himself of God&#8217;s wrath, his
case must have been harder than hundred deaths, as it had been with Job and with
many others, who made it their chief petition that they might die. Now as he was
not slain but languished in continual torments, it is certain that no one of us
can comprehend, much less convey in words what must have come into the mind of
Jonah during these three days. But I cannot now discuss what remains; I must
therefore defer it to the next lecture.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou
settest before us this day thy holy Prophet as an awful example of thy wrath
against all who are rebellious and disobedient to thee, &#8212; O grant, that we
may learn so to subject all our thoughts and affections to thy word, that we may
not reject any thing that pleases thee, but so learn both to live and to die to
thee, that we may ever regard thy will, and undertake nothing but what thou hast
testified is approved by thee, so that we may fight under thy banners, and
through life obey thy word, until at length we reach that blessed rest which has
been obtained for us by the blood of thy only begotten Son, and is laid up for
us in heaven through the hope of his Gospel. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
EIGHTY-SIXTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In yesterday&#8217;s lecture we began to explain the
last verse of the first chapter, in which Jonah said, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a fish was prepared by the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We stated that it could not have
been otherwise but that Jonah, when he was in the inside of the fish, must have
felt the most grievous agonies, as though he had been doomed to perpetual death,
as long as he was deprived of the enjoyment of God&#8217;s favor: and this fact
will be further explained when his song comes under our
consideration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now there is a question to be considered and that
is whether God created a fish to receive Jonah. The expression, that God<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared a
fish</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> seems
indeed to mean this; for if the fish had already been swimming in the sea, the
Prophet might have adopted another mode of speaking and said, that the Lord
caused the fish to meet him or that God had sent a fish; for so the Scripture
usually speaks: but a fish is said to have been prepared. This doubt may be thus
removed, &#8212; that though God may not have created the fish, he had yet
prepared him for this purpose; for we know that it was not according to the
course of nature that the fish swallowed Jonah, and also, that he was preserved
uninjured in his inside for three days and three nights. I therefore refer what
is said here, that a <i>fish was prepared,</i> to the preservation of Jonah: for
it is certain that there are some fishes which can swallow men whole and entire.
And William Rondelet, who has written a book on the fishes of the sea, concludes
that in all probability it must have been the <i>Lamia.</i> He himself saw that
fish, and he says that it has a belly so capacious and, mouth so wide, that it
can easily swallow up a man; and he says that a man in armor has sometimes been
found in the inside of the Lamia. Therefore, as I have said, either a whale, or
a Lamia, or a fish unknown to us, may be able to swallow up a man whole and
entire; but he who is thus devoured cannot live in the inside of a fish. Hence
Jonah, that he might mark it out as a miracle, says that the fish was prepared
by the Lord; for he was received into the inside of the fish as though it were
into an hospital; and though he had no rest there, yet he was as safe as to his
body, as though he were walking on land. Since then the Lord, contrary to the
order of nature, preserved there his Prophet, it is no wonder that he says that
the<i> fish was prepared by the Lord. </i>I come now to the second
chapter.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Jonah says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayed from the bowels of the
fish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he shows first with what courage
of mind he was endued. He had then put on a new heart; for when he was at
liberty he thought that he could in a manner escape from God, he became a
fugitive from the Lord: but now while inclosed within narrow bounds, he begins
to pray, and of his own accord sets himself in God&#8217;s
presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a change worthy of being noticed: and hence
we may learn how much it profits us to be drawn back often as it were by cords,
or to be held tied up with fetters because when we are free we go astray here
and there beyond all limits. Jonah, when he was at liberty, became, as we have
seen, wanton; but now finding himself restrained by the mighty hand of God, he
receives a new mind, and prays from the bowels of the fish   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. But
how was it that he directed his petitions then to God, by whose hand he saw that
he was so heavily pressed? For God most rigidly handled him; Jonah was in a
manner doomed to eternal ruin; the bowels of the fish, as we shall hereafter
see, were indeed to him as it were hell or the grave. But in this state of
despair Jonah even gathered courage, and was able to retake himself directly to
God. It was a wonderful and almost incredible example of faith. Let us then
learn to weigh well what is here said; for when the Lord heavily afflicts us, it
is then a legitimate and seasonable time for prayer. But we know that the
greater part despond, and do not usually offer their prayers freely to God,
except their minds be in a calm state; and yet God then especially invites us to
himself when we are reduced to extremities. Let this, then, which Jonah declares
of himself, come to our minds, &#8212; that he cried to God from hell itself:
and, at the same time, he assures us that his prayer proceeded from true faith;
for he does not simply say that he prayed to <i>Jehovah,</i> but he adds that he
was <i>his God</i>; and he speaks with a serious and deeply-reflective mind.
Though Jonah then was not only like one dead, but also on the confines of
perdition, he yet believed that God would be merciful if he fled to him. We
hence see that Jonah prayed not at random, as hypocrites are wont to take
God&#8217;s name in their mouths when they are in distress, but he prayed in
earnest; for he was persuaded that God would be propitious to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must remember that his prayer was not composed
in the words which are here related; but Jonah, while in the bowels of the fish,
dwelt on these thoughts in his mind. Hence he relates in this song how he
thought and felt; and we shall see that he was then in a state of distraction,
as our minds must necessarily be tossed here and there by temptations. For the
servants of God do not gain the victory without great struggle. We must fight,
and indeed strenuously, that we may conquer. Jonah then in this song shows that
he was agitated with great trouble and hard contests: yet this conviction was
firmly fixed in his heart, &#8212; that God was to be sought, and would not be
sought in vain, as he is ever ready to bring help to his people whenever they
cry to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I cried, when I had
trouble, to Jehovah, and he answered me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Jonah
no doubt relates now, after having come forth from the bowels of the fish, what
had happened to him, and he gives thanks to the Lord.   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
verse then contains two parts, &#8212; that Jonah in his trouble fled to God,
&#8212; and the latter part contains thanksgiving for having been miraculously
delivered beyond what flesh could have thought.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
cried,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in my distress, to Jehovah; I
cried out from the bowels of hell, thou hast heard my voice.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">Jonah, as we shall hereafter see, directed his
prayers to God not without great struggle; he contended with many difficulties;
but however great the impediments in his way, he still persevered and ceased not
from praying. He now tells us that he had not prayed in vain; and, that he might
amplify the grace of God, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the bowels of the
grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He mentioned <i>distress</i>
(<i>angustiam &#8212; </i>straitness) in the first clause; but here he more
clearly expresses how remarkable and extraordinary had been the kindness of God,
that he came forth safe from the bowels of the fish, which were like the bowels
of the grave.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwa&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shaul</i>, derived from corruption, is called the grave by the Hebrews, and
the Latin translator has almost everywhere rendered it hell, (<i>infernum;</i>)
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwa&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shaul,</i> is also sometimes taken for hell, that is, the state of the
reprobate, because they know that they are condemned by God: it is, however,
taken more frequently for the grave; and I am disposed to retain this sense,
&#8212; that the fish was like the grave. But he means that he was so shut up in
the grave, that there was no escape open to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What are the bowels of the grave? Even the inside or
the recess of the grave itself. When Jonah was in this state, he says, that he
was heard by the Lord. It may be proper to repeat again what I have already
slightly touched, &#8212; that Jonah was not so oppressed, though under the
heaviest trial, but that his petitions came forth to God. He prayed as it were
from hell, and not simply prayed, for he, at the same time, sets forth his
vehemence and ardor by saying, that he cried and cried aloud. Distress, no
doubt, extorted from Jonah these urgent entreaties. However this might have
been, he did not howl, as the unbelieving are wont to do, who feel their own
evils and bitterly complain; and yet they pour forth vain howlings. Jonah here
shows himself to be different from them by saying, that he cried and cried aloud
to God. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse are set forth his difficulties: for
Jonah, for the sake of amplifying, refers to his condition. It was a great thing
that he cried to God from the bowels of the fish; but it was far more difficult
for him to raise up his mind in prayer, when he knew or thought God to be angry
with him: for had he been thrown into extreme evils, he might yet call upon God;
but as it came to his mind that all the evil he suffered was inflicted by God,
because he tried to shun his call, how was it possible for him to penetrate into
heaven when such an obstacle stood in his way? We hence see the design of these
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou hadst cast me
into the gulf, into the heart of the sea; the flood surrounded me, all thy
billows and waves passed over me.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Jonah shows here what dreadful temptations
presented themselves to him while he was endeavoring to offer up prayers. It
came first to his mind that God was his most inveterate enemy. For Jonah did not
then think of the sailors and the rest who had cast him into the sea; but his
mind was fixed on God: this is the reason why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">THOU, <i>Lord, hadst cast me into
the deep, into the heart of the sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">THY<i> billows,</i> THY
<i>waves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He does
not here regard the nature of the sea; but he bestows, as I have already said,
all his thoughts on God, and acknowledges that he had to do with him; as though
he said, &#8220;Thou Lord, in pursuing me, drivest me away; but to thee do I
come: thou showest by dreadful proofs that thou art offended with me, but yet I
seek thee; so far is it that these terrors drive me to a distance from thee,
that now, being subdued as it were by thy goads, I come willingly to thee; for
nowhere else is there for me any hope of deliverance.&#8221; We now then see how
much avails the contrast, when Jonah sets the terrible punishment which he
endured in opposition to his prayer. Let us now proceed &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">In the first clause of this verse Jonah confirms
again what I have said, &#8212; that when he sought to pray, not only the door
was closed against him, but there were mountains, as it were, intervening, so
that he could not breathe a prayer to God: for he did not so much think of the
state in which he was; nay, but he chiefly considered his own case, how he had
provoked the wrath of God. Hence he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">, <i>I have said, I am cast away
from the sight of thine eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some give this
frigid exposition, that he had been only expelled from his own country, that he
might not behold the temple. But I have no doubt but that Jonah tells us here
that he suffered extreme agonies, as though every hope of pardon had been cut
off from him: &#8220;What! shall I yet hope that God will be propitious? It is
not to be hoped.&#8221; This then is the casting away of which he speaks: for it
is said that God casts us away, when he allows us no access to him. Hence Jonah
thought that he was wholly alienated from God. Were any to object and say, that
then his faith must have been extinct; the obvious answer is, &#8212; that in
the struggle of faith there are internal conflicts; one thought is suggested,
and then another of an opposite character meets it; there would indeed be no
trial of our faith, except there were such internal conflicts; for when, with
appeased minds, we can feel assured that God is propitious to us, what is the
trial of faith? But when the flesh tells us that God is opposed to us, and that
there is no more hope of pardon, faith at length sets up its shield, and repels
this onset of temptation, and entertains hope of pardon: whenever God for a time
appears implacable, then faith indeed is tried. Such then was the condition of
Jonah; for, according to the judgment of the flesh, he thought that he was
utterly cast away by God, so that he came to him in vain. Jonah, then, having
not yet put off flesh and blood, could not immediately lay hold on the grace of
God, but difficulties met him in his course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The latter clause is differently explained by
interpreters. Some take it negatively, &#8220;I shall no more look towards the
temple of thy holiness:&#8221; but the words admit not of this explanation.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ak, </i>means in Hebrew, truly, nevertheless; and it means also, certainly;
and sometimes it is taken dubitatively, perhaps. The greater part of expounders
render the clause thus, &#8220;But I shall see the temple of thy
holiness;&#8221; as though Jonah here reproved his own distrust, which he had
just expressed, as the case is with the faithful, who immediately check
themselves, when they are tempted to entertain any doubt: &#8220;What! dost thou
then cast away hope, when yet God will be reconciled to thee if thou wilt come
to him?&#8221; Hence interpreters think that it is a sort of correction, as
though Jonah here changed his mind, and retracted what he had previously taken
up, as a false principle derived from the judgment of the flesh. He had said
then that he had been cast away from the presence of the Lord; but now,
according to these expositors, he repels that temptation, But I shall see thy
holy temple; though I seem now to be rejected by thee, thou wilt at last receive
me into favor. We may, however, explain this clause, consistently with the
former, in this way, At least, or, <i>but, I would again see,</i> etc., as an
expression of a wish. The future then may be taken for the optative mood, as we
know that the Hebrews are wont thus to use the future tense, either when they
pray or express a wish. This meaning then best agrees with the passage, that
Jonah as yet doubtingly prays, At least, or, but, I would again, O Lord, see the
temple of thy holiness. But since the former explanation which I have mentioned
is probable, I do not contend for this. However this may be, we find that Jonah
did not wholly despair, though the judgment of the flesh would drive him to
despair; for he immediately turned his address to God. For they who murmur
against God, on the contrary, speak in the third person, turning themselves, as
it were, away from him: but Jonah here sets God before his
eyes,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I have been cast
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the sight of thine
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not remonstrate here with
God, but shows that he was seeking God still, though he thought that he was cast
far away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would at least see again the
temple of thy holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And by speaking of the
temple, he no doubt set the temple before him as an encouragement to his faith.
As then he had been cast away, he gathers everything that might avail to raise
up and confirm his hope. He had indeed been circumcised, he had been a
worshipper of God from his childhood, he had been educated in the Law, he had
exercised himself in offering sacrifices: under the name of temple he now
includes briefly all these things. We hence see that he thus encouraged himself
to entertain good hope in his extreme necessity. And this is a useful
admonition; for when every access to God seems closed up against us, nothing is
more useful than to recall to mind, that he has adopted us from our very
infancy, that he has also testified his favor by many tokens, especially that he
has called us by his Gospel into a fellowship with his only-begotten Son, who is
life and salvation; and then, that he has confirmed his favor both by Baptism
and the Supper. When, therefore, these things come to our minds, we may be able
by faith to break through all impediments. Let us go on &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here in many words Jonah relates how many things had
happened to him, which were calculated to overwhelm his mind with terror and to
drive him far from God, and to take away every desire for prayer. But we must
ever bear in mind what we have already stated, &#8212; that he had to do with
God: and this ought to be well considered by us. The case was the same with
David, when he says in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
39:9, &#8216;Thou hast yet done it;&#8217; for, after having complained of his
enemies, he turned his mind to God: &#8220;What then do I? what do I gain by
these complaints? for men alone do not vex me; thou, God, he says, hast done
this.&#8221; So it was with Jonah; he ever set before him the wrath of God, for
he knew that such a calamity had not happened to him but on account of his
sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he was by waters
beset,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and then, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>surrounded by the
deep;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but at length he adds, that God <i>made
his life to ascend, </i>etc. All these circumstances tend to show that Jonah
could not have raised up his mind to God except through an extraordinary
miracle, as his life was in so many ways oppressed. When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he was beset with waters even to
the soul,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I understand it to have been to the
peril of his life; for other explanations seem frigid and strained. And the
Hebrews says that to be pressed to the soul, is to be in danger of one&#8217;s
life; as the Latins, meaning the same thing, say that the heart, or the inside,
or the bowels, are wounded. So also in this place the same thing is meant,
&#8216;The waters beset me even to the soul,&#8217; and then, &#8216;the abyss
surrounds me.&#8217; Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;ws</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>suph</i>, sedge; others sea-weed; others bulrush: but the sense amounts to
the same thing. No doubt
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;ws</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>suph,</i> is a species of sedge; and some think that the Red Sea was thus
called, because it is full of sedges or bulrushes. They think also that
bulrushes are thus called, because they soon putrefy. But what Jonah means is
certain and that is, that weed enveloped his head, or that weed grew around his
head: but to refer this to the head of the fish, as some do, is improper: Jonah
speaks metaphorically when he says that he was entangled in the sedge, inasmuch
as there is no hope when any one is rolled in the sedge at the bottom of the
sea. How, indeed, can he escape from drowning who is thus held, as it were, tied
up? It is then to be understood metaphorically; for Jonah meant that he was so
sunk that he could not swim, except through the ineffable power of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to the same sense he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I descended to the roots of the
mountains.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But he speaks of promontories, which
were nigh the sea; as though he had said, that he was not cast into the midst of
the sea, but that he had so sunk as to be fixed in the deep under the roots of
mountains. All these things have the same designs which was to show that no
deliverance could be hoped for, except God stretched forth his hand from heaven,
and indeed in a manner new and incredible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the earth with its bars was
around him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means by this kind of speaking,
that he was so shut up, as if the whole earth had been like a door. We know what
sort of bars are those of the earth, when we ascribe bars to it: for when any
door is fastened with bolts, we know how small a portion it is. But when we
suppose the earth itself to be like a door, what kind of things must the bolts
be? It is the same thing then as though Jonah had said, that he was so hindered
from the vital light, as if the earth had been set against him to prevent his
coming forth to behold the sun: the earth, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was set against me, and that for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards comes to thanksgiving,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou Jehovah, my God, hast
made my life to ascend from the grave.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Jonah,
after having given a long description, for the purpose of showing that he was
not once put to death, but that he had been overwhelmed with many and various
deaths, now adds his gratitude to the Lord for having delivered him,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> hast made my life to
ascend from the grave, O Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again
confirms what I have once said, &#8212; that he did not pour forth empty
prayers, but that he prayed with an earnest feeling, and in faith: for he would
not have called him his God, except he was persuaded of his paternal love, so as
to be able to expect from him a certain salvation. <i>Thou,</i> then,
<i>Jehovah, my God,</i> he says; he does not say, Thou hast delivered me, but,
Thou hast brought forth my life from the grave. Then Jonah, brought to life
again, testifies here that he was not only delivered by God&#8217;s aid from the
greatest danger, but that he had, by a certain kind of resurrection, been raised
from the dead. This is the meaning of this mode of speaking, when he says that
his life had been brought forth from the grave, or from corruption itself. It
follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jonah comprehends in one verse what he had
previously said, &#8212; that he had been distressed with the heaviest troubles,
but that he had not yet been so cast down in his mind, as that he had no
prospect of God&#8217;s favor to encourage him to pray. He indeed first
confesses that he had suffered some kind of fainting, and that he had been
harassed by anxious and perplexing thoughts, so as not to be able by his own
efforts to disengage himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;f[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>otheph</i>, it means in Hebrew to hide, to cover; but in Niphal and Hithpael
(in which conjugation it is found here) it signifies to fail: but its former
meaning might still be suitably retained here; then it would be, &#8216;My soul
hid or rolled up itself,&#8217; as it is in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:1, &#8216;The prayer of the afflicted, when he rolled up himself in his
distress.&#8217; They who render it, he multiplied prayers, have no reason to
support them. I therefore doubt not but that Jonah here means, either that he
had been overcome by a swoon, or that he had been so perplexed as not to be able
without a violent struggle to raise up his mind to God. However it may have
been, he intended by this word to express the anxiety of his mind. While then we
are tossed about by divers thoughts, and remain, as it were, bound up in a
hopeless condition, then our soul may be said to roll or to fold up itself
within us. When therefore the soul rolls up itself, all the thoughts of man in
perplexity recoil on himself. We may indeed seek to disburden ourselves while we
toss about various purposes, but whatever we strive to turn away from us, soon
comes back on our own head; thus our soul recoils upon us. We now perceive what
Jonah meant by this clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When
my soul infolded itself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or failed
within me, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I remembered, he says,
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We hence learn that Jonah became not a
conqueror without the greatest difficulties, not until his soul, as we have
said, had fainted: this is one thing. Then we learn, also, that he was not so
oppressed with distresses but that he at length sought God by prayer. Jonah
therefore retained this truth, that God was to be sought, however severely and
sharply he treated him for a time; for the remembering, of which he speaks,
proceeded from faith. The ungodly also remember Jehovah, but they dread him, for
they look on him as a judge; and whenever a mention is made of God, they expect
nothing but destruction: but Jonah applied the remembrance of God to another
purpose, even as a solace to ease his cares and his anxieties.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it immediately follows, <i>that his prayer had
penetrated unto God,</i> or entered before him. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We then
see that Jonah so remembered his God, that by faith he knew that he would be
propitious to him; and hence was his disposition to pray. But by saying that his
prayer entered into his temple, he no doubt alludes to a custom under the law;
for the Jews were wont to turn themselves towards the temple whenever they
prayed: nor was this a superstitious ceremony; for we know that they were
instructed in the doctrine which invited them to the sanctuary and the ark of
the covenant. Since then this was the custom under the law, Jonah says that his
prayer entered into the temple of God; for that was a visible symbol, through
which the Jews might understand that God was near to them; not that they by a
false imagination bound God to external signs, but because they knew that these
helps Had not in vain been given to them. So then Jonah not only remembered his
God, but called also to mind the signs and symbols in which he had exercised his
faith, as we have just said through the whole course of his life; for they who
view him as referring to heaven, depart wholly from what the Prophet meant. We
indeed know that the temple sometimes means heaven; but this sense suits not
this place. Then Jonah meant that though he was far away from the temple, God
was yet near to him; for he had not ceased to pray to that God who had revealed
himself by the law which he gave, and who had expressed his will to be
worshipped at Jerusalem, and also had been pleased to appoint the ark as the
symbol of his presence, that the Jews might, with an assured faith, call upon
him, and that they might not doubt but that he dwelt in the midst of them,
inasmuch as he had there his visible habitation.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
once given us such an evidence of thy infinite power in thy servant Jonah, whose

and to call on thee, &#8212; O grant, that in the trials by which we must be
daily exercised, we may raise upwards our minds to thee, and never cease to
think that thou art near us; and that when the signs of thy wrath appear, and
when our sins thrust themselves before our eyes, to drive us to despair, may we
still constantly struggle, and never surrender the hope of thy mercy, until
having finished all our contests, we may at length freely and fully give thanks
to thee, and praise thy infinite goodness, such as we daily experience that

from life and salvation, and that nothing is retained by them, for they
willfully cast aside whatever good that can be hoped and desired. Some elicit a
contrary meaning, that the superstitious, when they return to a sound mind,
relinquish their own reproach; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesad,</i> sometimes means reproach. They then think that the way of true
penitence is here described, &#8212; that when God restores men from their
straying to the right way, he gives them at the same time a sound mind, so that
they rid themselves from all their vices. This is indeed true, but it is too
strained a meaning. Others confine this to the sailors who vowed sacrifices to
God; as though Jonah had said, that they would soon relapse to their own
follies, and bid adieu to God, who in his mercy had delivered them from
shipwreck; so they explain their mercy to be God; but this is also too forced an
explanation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I doubt not, therefore, but that Jonah here sets his
own religion in opposition to his false intentions of men; for it immediately
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I with the voice of
praise will sacrifice to thee.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">Jonah, then,
having before confessed that he would be thankful to God, now pours contempt on
all those inventions which men foolishly contrive for themselves, and through
which they withdraw themselves from the only true God, and from the sincere
worship of him. For he calls all those devices, by which men deceive
themselves<i>, the vanities of falsehood;</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for it is certain that they are mere fallacies which men invent for
themselves without the authority of God&#8217;s Word; for truth is one and
simple, which God has revealed to us in his world. Whosoever then turns aside
the least, either on this or on that side, seeks, as it were designedly, some
imposture or another, by which he ruins himself. <i>They</i> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who follow such
vanities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, says Jonah,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forsake their own
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is
they reject all happiness: for no aid and no help can be expected from any other
quarter than from the only true God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage deserves a careful notice; for we
hence learn what value to attach to all superstitions, to all those opinions of
men, when they attempt to set up religion according to their own will: for Jonah
calls them lying or fallacious vanities. There is then but one true religion,
the religion which God has taught us in his word. We must also notice, that men
in vain weary themselves when they follow their own inventions; for the more
strenuously they run, the farther they recede from the right way, as Augustine
has well observed. But Jonah here adopts a higher principle, &#8212; that God
alone possesses in himself all fullness of blessings: whosoever then truly and
sincerely seeks God, will find in him whatever can be wished for salvation. But
God is not to be sought but by obedience and faith: whosoever then dare to give
themselves loose reins, so as to follow this or that without the warrant of
God&#8217;s word, recede from God, and, at the same time, deprive themselves of
all good things. The superstitious do indeed think that they gain much when they
toil in their own inventions; but we see what the Holy Spirit declares by the
mouth of Jonah. The Lord says the same by Jeremiah</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They have forsaken
me, the fountain of living water, and cisterns have they digged for
themselves,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
2:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There the Lord complains of his chosen people, who
had gone astray after wicked superstitions. Hence, when men wander beyond the
word of God, they in a manner renounce God, or say adieu to him; and thus they
deprive themselves of all good things; for without God there is no salvation and
no help to be found.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah therefore rightly adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I, with the voice of praise,
will sacrifice to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he
said While men as it were banish themselves from God, by giving themselves up to
errors, I will sacrifice to thee and to thee alone, O Lord. And this ought to be
observed by us; for as our minds are prone to falsehood and vanity, any new
superstition will easily lay hold so us, except we be restrained by this bond,
except we be fully persuaded, &#8212; that true salvation dwells in God alone,
and every aid and help that can be expected by us: but when this conviction is
really and thoroughly fixed in our hearts, then true religion cannot be easily
lost by us: though Satan should on every side spread his allurements, we shall
yet continue in the true and right worship of God. And the more carefully it
behaves us to consider this passage, because Jonah no doubt meant here to
strengthen himself in the right path of religion; for he knew that like all
mortals he was prone to what was false; he therefore encouraged himself to
persevere: and this he does, when he declares that whatever superstition men
devise, is a deprivation of the chief good, even of life and salvation. It will
hence follow, that we shall abominate every error when we are fully persuaded
that we forsake the true God whenever we obey not his word, and that we at the
same time cast away salvation, and every thing good that can be desired. Then
Jonah says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must be noticed here farther, that the worship of
God especially consists in praises, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
1:1: for there God shows that he regards as nothing all sacrifices, except they
answer this end &#8212; to set forth the praise of his name. It was indeed his
will that sacrifices should be offered to him under the law; but it was for the
end just stated: for God cares not for calves and oxen, for goats and lambs; but
his will was that he should be acknowledged as the Giver of all blessings. Hence
he says there, &#8216;Sacrifice to me the sacrifice of praise.&#8217; So also
Jonah now says, I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise, and he might have
said with still more simplicity, &#8220;Lord, I ascribe to thee my preserved
life.&#8221; But if this was the case under the shadows of the law, how much
more ought we to attend to this, that is, &#8212; to strive to worship God, not
in a gross manner, but spiritually, and to testify that our life proceeds from
him, that it is in his hand, that we owe all things to him, and, in a word, that
he is the Source and Author of salvation, and not only of salvation, but also of
wisdom, of righteousness, of power?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he afterwards mentions his vows, <i>I will
pay,</i> he says, <i>my vows.</i> We have stated elsewhere in what light we are
to consider vows. The holy Fathers did not vow to God, as the Papists of this
day are wont to do, who seek to pacify God by their frivolous practices; one
abstains for a certain time from meat, another puts on sackcloth, another
undertakes a pilgrimage, and another obtrudes on God some new ceremony. There
was nothing of this kind in the vows of the holy Fathers; but a vow was the mere
act of thanksgiving, or a testimony of gratitude: and so Jonah joins his vows
here with the sacrifice of praise. We hence learn that they were not two
different things; but he repeats the same thing twice. Jonah, then, had declared
his vow to God for no other purpose but to testify his
gratitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence he adds, <i>To Jehovah is,</i> or belongs,
<i>salvation;</i> that is, to save is the prerogative of God alone; Jehovah is
here in the dative case, for prefixed to it is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed</i>. It is then to Jehovah that salvation belongs; the work of saving
appertains to no other but to the Supreme God. Since it is so, we see how absurd
and insane men are, when they transfer praises to another, as every one does who
invents an idol for himself. As, then, there is but the one true God who saves,
it behaves us to ascribe to him alone all our praises, that we may not deprive
him of his right. This is the import of the whole. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The deliverance of Jonah is here in few words
described; but how attentively ought we to consider the event? It was an
incredible miracle, that Jonah should have continued alive and safe in the
bowels of the fish for three days. For how was it that he was not a thousand
times smothered or drowned by waters? We know that fish continually draw in
water: Jonah could not certainly respire while in the fish; and the life of man
without breathing can hardly continue for a minute. Jonah, then, must have been
preserved beyond the power of nature. Then how could it have been that the fish
should cast forth Jonah on the shore, except God by his unsearchable power had
drawn the fish there? Again, who could have supernaturally opened its bowels and
its mouth? His coming forth, then, was in every way miraculous, yea, it was
attended with many miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jonah, that he might the more extol the infinite
power of God, adopted the word said. Hence we learn that nothing is hard to God,
for he could by a nod only effect so great a thing as surpasses all our
conceptions. If Jonah had said that he was delivered by God&#8217;s kindness and
favor, it would have been much less emphatical, than when he adopts a word which
expresses a command, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah
spake</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or said,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
fish.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this deliverance of Jonah is an image of the
resurrection, this is an extraordinary passage, and worthy of being especially
noticed; for the Holy Spirit carries our minds to that power by which the world
was formed and is still wonderfully preserved. That we may then, without
hesitation and doubt, be convinced of the restoration which God promises to us,
let us remember that the world was by him created out of nothing by his word and
bidding, and is still thus sustained. But if this general truth is not
sufficient, let this history of Jonah come to our minds, &#8212; that God
commanded a fish to cast forth Jonah: for how was it that Jonah escaped safe and
was delivered? Even because it so pleased God, because the Lord commanded; and
this word at this day retains the same efficacy. By that power then, by which he
works all things, we also shall one day be raised up from the dead. Now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">There is here set before us a remarkable proof of
God&#8217;s grace, &#8212; that he was pleased to bestow on Jonah his former
dignity and honor. He was indeed unworthy of the common light, but God not only
restored him to life, but favored him again with the office and honor of a
prophet. This, as I have said, Jonah obtained through the wonderful and singular
favor of God. As he had previously fled, and by disobedience deprived himself in
a manner of all God&#8217;s favor, the recovery of his prophetic office was
certainly not obtained through his own merit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must, in the first place, be observed, that this
phrase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of Jehovah came
the second time,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> ought to be noticed; for the
word of God comes to men in different ways. God indeed addresses each of us
individually; but he spoke to his Prophets in a special manner; for he designed
them to be witnesses and heralds of his will. Hence, whenever God sets a man in
some peculiar office, his word is said to come to him: as the word of God is
addressed to magistrates because they are commanded to exercise the power
committed to them; so also the word of God ever came to the Prophets, because it
was not lawful for them to thrust in themselves without being
called.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The command now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, go to Nineveh, to that
great city, and preach there the preaching which I command
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God
again repeats what we have observed at the be ginning, &#8212; that Nineveh was
a great city, that Jonah might provide himself with an invincible courage of
mind, and come there well prepared: for it often happens, that many boldly
undertake an office, but soon fail, because difficulties had not been
sufficiently foreseen by them. Hence, when men find more hardships than they
thought of at the beginning, they nearly faint, at least they despond. The Lord,
therefore, expressly foretold Jonah how difficult would be his employment; as
though he said, &#8220;I send thee, a man unknown, and of no rank, and a
stranger, to denounce ruin on men, not a few in number, but on a vast multitude,
and to carry on a contest with the noblest city, and so populous, that it may
seem to be a region of itself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why this character of the city
was added; it was, that Jonah might gird up himself for the contest, that he
might not afterwards fail in the middle of his course. This fear indeed
frightened him at the beginning, so that he shunned the call of God; but he is
not now moved in any degree by the greatness of the city, but resolutely follows
where the Lord leads. We hence see, that faith, when once it gains the
ascendancy in our hearts, surmounts all obstacles and despises all the greatness
of the world; for it is immediately added &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah, by saying that he went to Nineveh according to
God&#8217;s command, proves in the first place, as I have said, how great was
the power and energy of his faith; for though Jonah had considered the greatness
and pride of the city, he seems to have forgotten that he was an obscure man,
alone, and unarmed; but he had laid hold on weapons capable of destroying all
the power of the world, for he knew that he was sent from above. His conviction
was, that God was on his side; and he knew that God had called him. Hence then
it was, that with a high and intrepid mind he looked down on all the splendor of
the city Nineveh. Hence John does not without reason say, that the victory, by
which we overcome the world, proceeds from faith,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:4.) Jonah also proves, at the same time, how much he had improved under
God&#8217;s scourges. He had been severely chastised; but we know that most of
the unbelieving grow hardened under the rod, and vomit forth their rage against
God; Jonah, on the contrary, shows here that chastisement had been useful to him
for he was subdued and led to obey God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
went,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the command of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, nothing else did he
regard but to render obedience to God, and to suffer himself to be wholly ruled
by him. We hence learn how well God provides for us and for our salvation, when
he corrects our perverseness; though sharp may be our chastisements, yet as this
benefit follows we know that nothing is better for us than to be humbled under
God&#8217;s hand, as David says in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
119:1. This change then, <i>he went,</i> is to us a remarkable example; and this
is what the Lord has ever in view whenever he roughly handles us; for he cannot
otherwise subdue either the haughtiness or the rebellion, or the slowness and
indolence of our flesh. We must now also take notice how Jonah attained so much
strength; it was, because he had found by experience in the bowels of the fish,
that even amidst thousand deaths there is enough in God&#8217;s protection to
secure our safety. As then he had by experience known that the issues of death
are at the will and in the hand of God, he is not now touched with fear so as to
shun God&#8217;s command, even were the whole world to rise up against him.
Hence the more any one has found the kindness of God, the more courageously he
ought to proceed in the discharge of his office, and confidently to commit to
God his life and his safety, and resolutely to surmount all the perils of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that Nineveh was a great
city</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even a journey of three days.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some toil much in untying a knot, which at last
is no knot at all; for it seems to them strange that one city should be in
compass about thirty leagues according to our measure. When they conceive this
as being impossible, then they invent some means to avoid the difficulty,
&#8212; that no one could visit the whole city so as to go through all the
alleys, all the streets, and all the public places, except in three days; nay,
they add, that this is not to be understood as though one ran or quickly passed
through the city, but as though he walked leisurely and made a stay in public
places: but these are mere puerilities. And if we believe profane writers,
Nineveh must have been a great city, as Jonah declares here: for they say that
its area was about four hundred <i>stadia;</i> and we know what space four
hundred <i>stadia</i> include. A<i> stadium</i> is one hundred and twenty-five
paces; hence eight <i>stadia </i>make a mile. Now if any one will count he will
find that there are twelve miles in a hundred <i>stadia;</i> there will then be
in four hundred <i>stadia</i> forty-eight miles. This account well agrees with
the testimony of Jonah. And then Diodorus and Herodotus say that there were 1500
towers around the city. Since it was so, it could not certainly be a smaller
city than what it is represented here by Jonah. Though these things may seem to
exceed what is commonly believed, writers have not yet reported them without
some foundation: for however false are found to be many things in Diodorus and
Herodotus, yet as to Babylon and Nineveh they could not have dared to say what
was untrue; for the first was then standing and known to many; and the ruins of
the other were still existing, though it had been for some time destroyed. We
shall farther see about the end of the book that this city was large, and so
populous, that there were there 120,000 children. If any one receives not this
testimony, let him feed on the lies of the devil. But since there were so many
children there, what else can we say but that the circumference of the city was
very great?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this seems inconsistent with what immediately
follows; for Jonah says, that when he entered the city, he performed a journey
in the city for one day and preached. The answer is this, &#8212; that as soon
as he entered the city, and began to proclaim the command of God, some
conversions immediately followed: so Jonah does not mean that he went through
the city in one day. He then in the first day converted a part of the city; he
afterwards continued to exhort each one to repentance: thus the conversion of
the whole city followed; but not in the second or the third day, as it may be
easily gathered. Let us now proceed to what remains &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah here relates what had briefly been said before,
&#8212; that he went to Nineveh according to the command of God. He shows then
how faithfully he executed the duty enjoined on him, and thus obeyed the word of
God. Hence Jonah came and began to enter the city and to preach on the first
day. This promptness proves clearly how tractable Jonah had become, and how much
he endeavored to obey God in discharging his office: for had there been still a
timidity in his heart, he would have inspected the city, as careful and timid
men are wont to do, who inquire what is the condition of the place, what are the
dispositions of the people, and which is the easiest access to them, and what is
the best way, and where is the least danger. If Jonah then had been still
entangled by carnal thoughts he would have waited two or three days, and then
have began to exercise his office as a Prophet. This he did not, but entered the
city and I cried. We now then see how prompt he was in his obedience, who had
before attempted to pass over the sea: he now takes hardly a moment to breathe,
but he begins at the very entrance to testify that he had come in obedience to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see with what emphasis these words ought to
be read. The narrative is indeed very simple; Jonah uses here no rhetorical
ornaments, nor does he set forth his entrance with any fine display of words.
<i>Jonah,</i> he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entered
into the city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He who is not well versed
in Scripture might say that this is frigid: but when we weigh the circumstances,
we see that this simple way of speaking possesses more force and power than all
the displays of orators.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He entered then the city
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a day&#8217;s journey, and cried
and said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. By saying that he cried,
he again proves the courage of his soul; for he did not creep in privately, as
men are wont to do, advancing cautiously when dangers are apprehended. He says
that he cried: then this freedom shows that Jonah was divested of all fear, and
endued with such boldness of spirit, that he raised himself up above all the
hindrances of the world. And we ought, in the meantime, to remember how disliked
must have been his message: for he did not gently lead the Ninevites to God, but
threatened them with destruction, and seemed to have given them no hope of
pardon. Jonah might have thought that his voice, as one says, would have to
return to his own throat, &#8220;Can I denounce ruin on this populous city,
without being instantly crushed? Will not the first man that meets me stone me
to death?&#8221; Thus might Jonah have thought within himself. No fear was,
however, able to prevent him from doing his duty as a faithful servant, for he
had been evidently strengthened by the Lord. But it will be better to join the
following verse &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">One thing, escaped me in the third verse: Jonah said
that Nineveh was a city <i>great to God</i>. This form of speech is common in
Scripture: for the Hebrews call that Divine, whatever it be, that is superior or
excellent: so they say, the cedars of God, the mountains of God, the fields of
God, when they are superior in height or in any other respect. Hence a city is
called the city of God, when it is beyond others renowned. I wished briefly to
allude to this subject, because some, with too much refinement and even
puerility says that it was called the city of God, because it was the object of
God&#8217;s care, and in which he intended to exhibit a remarkable instance of
conversion. But, as I have said, this is to be taken as the usual mode of
speaking in similar cases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to the text: Jonah says, that the
citizens of Nineveh <i>believed God </i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. We
hence gather that the preaching of Jonah was not so concise but that he
introduced his discourse by declaring that he was God&#8217;s Prophet, and that
he did not proclaim these commands without authority; and we also gather that
Jonah so denounced ruin, that at the same time he showed God to be the avenger
of sins that he reproved the Ninevites, and, as it were, summoned them to
God&#8217;s tribunal, making known to them their guilt; for had he spoken only
of punishment, it could not certainly have been otherwise, but that the
Ninevites must have rebelled furiously against God; but by showing to them their
guilt, he led them to acknowledge that the threatened punishment was just, and
thus he prepared them for humility and penitence. Both these things may be
collected from this expression of Jonah, that the Ninevites believed God; for
were they not persuaded that the command came from heaven, what was their faith?
Let us then know, that Jonah had so spoken of his vocation, that the Ninevites
felt assured that he was a celestial herald: hence was their faith: and further,
the Ninevites would never have so believed as to put on sackcloth, had they not
been reminded of their sins. There is, therefore, no doubt but that Jonah, while
crying against Nineveh, at the same time made known how wickedly the men lived,
and how grievous were their offenses against God. Hence then it was that they
put on sackcloth, and suppliantly fled to God&#8217;s mercy: they understood
that they were deservedly summoned to judgment on account of their wicked
lives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, how came the Ninevites to
believe God, as no hope of salvation was given them? for there can be no faith
without an acquaintance with the paternal kindness of God; whosoever regards God
as angry with him must necessarily despair. Since then Jonah gave them no
knowledge of God&#8217;s mercy, he must have greatly terrified the Ninevites,
and not have called them to faith. The answer is, that the expression is to be
taken as including a part for the whole; for there is no perfect faith when men,
being called to repentance, do suppliantly humble themselves before God; but yet
it is a part of faith; for the Apostle says, in Hebrew 11:7, that Noah through
faith feared; he deduces the fear which Noah entertained on account of the
oracular word he received, from faith, showing thereby that it was faith in
part, and pointing out the source from which it proceeded. At the same time, the
mind of the holy Patriarch must have been moved by other things besides
threatening, when he built an ark for himself, as the means of safety. We may
thus, by taking a part for the whole, explain this, place, &#8212; that the
Ninevites believed God; for as they knew that God required the deserved
punishment, they submitted to him, and, at the same time, solicited pardon: but
the Ninevites, no doubt, derived from the words of Jonah something more than
mere terror: for had they only apprehended this &#8212; that they were guilty
before God, and were justly summoned to punishment, they would have been
confounded and stunned with dread, and could never have been encouraged to seek
forgiveness. Inasmuch then as they suppliantly prostrated themselves before God,
they must certainly have conceived some hope of grace. They were not, therefore,
so touched with penitence and the fear of God, but that they had some knowledge
of divine grace: thus they believed God; for though they were aware that they
were most worthy of death, they yet despaired not, but retook themselves to
prayer. Since then we see that the Ninevites sought this, remedy, we must feel
assured that they derived more advantage from the preaching of Jonah than the
mere knowledge that they were guilty before God: this ought certainly to be
understood. But we shall speak more on the subject in our next
lecture.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as there is so
much timidity in us, that none of us is prepared to follow where thou mayest
call us, we may be so instructed by the example of thy servant Jonah, as to obey
thee in every thing, and that though Satan and the world may oppose us with all
their terrors, we may yet be strengthened by a reliance on thy power and
protection, which thou hast promised to us, and may go on in the course of our
vocation, and never turn aside, but thus contend against all the hindrances of
this world, until we reach that celestial kingdom, where we shall enjoy thee and
Christ thy only begotten Son, who is our strength and our salvation: and may thy
Spirit quicken us, and strengthen all our faculties, that we may obey thee, and
that at length thy name may be glorified in us, and that we may finally become
partakers of that glory to which thou invites us through Christ our Lord.
Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain whether Jonah had preached for some
days in the city before it was known to the king. This is indeed the common
opinion; for interpreters so expound the verse, which says that word was brought
to the king, as though the king himself knew, that the whole city was in
commotion through the preaching of Jonah: but the words admit of a different
sense, that is that the preaching of Jonah immediately reached the king; and I
am disposed to take this view, as Jonah seems here to explain how the Ninevites
were led to put on sackcloth. He had before spoken briefly on the subject, but
he now explains what took place more fully; and we know that it was commonly the
manner of the Hebrews &#8212; to relate the chief points in few words, and then
to add an explanation. As then Jonah had said in the last verse that the
Ninevites had put on sackcloth, and proclaimed a fast, so he now seems to
express more distinctly how this happened, that is, through the royal edict. And
it is by no means probable that a fast was proclaimed in the royal city by the
mere consent of the people, as the king and his counselors were there present.
Inasmuch then as it appears more reasonable that the edict respecting the fast
had proceeded from the king, I am therefore inclined so to connect the two
verses, as that the first briefly mentions the fruit which followed the
preaching of Jonah, and that the second is added as an explanation, for it gives
a fuller account of what took place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah then now says, that a fast was proclaimed by
the Ninevites, for the king and his council had so appointed: and I regard the
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gyw</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>uigo,</i> as being in the pluperfect tense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When word had come to the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
Jonah now states the reason why the Ninevites proclaimed a fast; it was because
the king had been apprised of the preaching of Jonah, and had called together
his counselors. It was then a public edict, and not any movement among the
people, capriciously made, as it sometimes happens. He says, that it was an
edict published by the authority of the king and his council, or his nobles. At
the same time, some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[f</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thom</i>, as meaning reason or approbation.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[f</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thom,</i> means to taste, and Jonah afterwards uses the verb in this sense;
but it is to be taken here in a metaphorical sense for counsel; And I think this
meaning is more suitable to this passage. I come now to the
subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is worthy of being noticed, that the king of so
splendid a city   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, nay,
at that time the greatest monarch, should have rendered himself so submissive to
the exhortation of Jonah: for we see how proud kings are; as they think
themselves exempt from the common lot of men, so they carry themselves above all
laws. Hence it comes, that they will have all things to be lawful for them; and
while they give loose reins to their lusts they cannot bear to be admonished,
even by their equals. But Jonah was a stranger and of a humble condition: that
he therefore so touched the heart of the king, must be ascribed to the hidden
power of God, which he puts forth through his word whenever he pleases. God does
not indeed work alike by the preaching of his word, he does not always keep to
the same course; but, when he pleases, he so efficaciously touches the hearts of
men, that the success of his word exceeds all expectation, as in the memorable
example presented to us here. Who could have said that a heathen king, who had
ever lived according to his own will, who had no feeling as to true and genuine
religion, would have been thus in an instant subdued? For he put aside his royal
dress, laid himself in the dust, and clothed himself in sackcloth. We hence see
that God not only spoke by the mouth of Jonah, but added power to his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also bear in mind what Christ says, that the
men of Nineveh would rise up in judgment against that generation, as they had
repented at the preaching of Jonah; and &#8220;Behold,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a
greater than Jonah is here,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401241&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
12:41.) Christ, at this day, proclaims the voice of his Gospel; for though he is
not here in a visible form among us, he yet speaks by his ministers. If we
despise his doctrine, how can our obstinacy and hardness be excused, since the
Ninevites, who had no knowledge of the true doctrine of religion, who were
imbued with no religious principles, were so suddenly converted by the preaching
of Jonah? And that their repentance was sincere we may conclude from this
circumstance &#8212; that the preaching of Jonah was severe, for he denounced
destruction on a most powerful city; this might have instantly inflamed the
king&#8217;s mind with rage and fury; and that he was calmly humbled, was
certainly a proof of no common change. We have then here a remarkable instance
of penitence, &#8212; that the king should have so forgotten himself and his
dignity, as to throw aside his splendid dress, to put on sackcloth, and to lie
down on ashes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to fasting and sackcloth, it is very true, as
we have observed in our remarks on Joel, that repentance consists not in these
external things: for God cares not for outward rites, and all those things which
are resplendent in the sight of men are worthless before him; what indeed he
requires, is sincerity of heart. Hence what Jonah here says of fasting, and
other outward performances, ought to be referred to their legitimate end,
&#8212; that the Ninevites intended thus to show that they were justly summoned
as guilty before God&#8217;s tribunal, and also, that they humbly deprecated the
wrath of their judge. Fasting then and sackcloth were only an external
profession of repentance. Were any one to fast all his life, and to put on
sackcloth, and to scatter dust on himself, and not to connect with all this a
sincerity of heart, he would do nothing but mock God.   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
these outward performances are, in themselves, of small or of no value, except
when preceded by an interior feeling of heart, and men be on this account led to
manifest such outward evidences. Whenever then Scripture mentions fasting, and
ashes, and sackcloth, we must bear in mind that these things are set before us
as the outward signs of repentance which when not genuine do nothing else but
provoke the wrath of God; but when true, they are approved of God on account of
the end in view, and not that they avail, of themselves, to pacify his wrath, or
to expiate sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If now any one asks whether penitence is always to be
accompanied with fasting, ashes, and sackcloth, the answer is at hand, &#8212;
that the faithful ought through their whole life to repent: for except everyone
of us continually strives to renounce himself and his former life, he has not
yet learned what it is to serve God; for we must ever contend with the flesh.
But though there is a continual exercise of repentance, yet fasting is not
required of us always. It then follows that fasting is a public and solemn
testimony of repentance, when there appears to be some extraordinary evidence of
God&#8217;s wrath. Thus have we seen that the Jews were by Joel called to lie in
ashes, and to put on sackcloth because God had come forth, as it were, armed
against them; and all the Prophets had declared that destruction was nigh the
people. In the same manner the Ninevites, when terrified by this dreadful edict,
put on sackcloth proclaimed a fasts because this was usually done in
extremities. We now then perceive why the king, having himself put on sackcloth,
enjoined on the whole people both fasting and other tokens of
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it seems strange, and even ridiculous, that the
king should bid animals, as well as men, to make a confession of repentance; for
penitence is a change in man, when he returns to God after having been alienated
from him: this cannot comport with the character of brute animals. Then the king
of Nineveh acted foolishly and contrary to all reason in connecting animals with
men when he spoke of repentance. But, in answer to this, we must bear in mind
what I have before said &#8212; that destruction had been denounced, not only on
men, but also on the whole city, even on the buildings: for as God created the
whole world for the sake of men, so also his wrath, when excited against men,
includes the beasts, and trees, and every thing in heaven and on earth. But the
question is not yet solved; for though God may punish animals on account of
men&#8217;s sins, yet neither oxen nor sheep can pacify the wrath of God. To
this I answer &#8212; that this was done for the sake of men: for it would have
been ridiculous in the king to prohibit food and drink to animals, except he had
a regard to men themselves. But his object was to set before the Ninevites, as
in a mirror or picture, what they deserved. The same was done under the law;
for, whenever they slew victims, they were reminded of their own sins; for it
ought to have come to their minds, that the sheep or any other animal sacrificed
was innocent, and that it stood at the altar in his stead who had sinned. They
therefore saw in the ox, or the lamb, or the goat, a striking emblem of their
own condemnation. So also the Ninevites, when they constrained the oxen, the
assess and other animals, to fast, were reminded of what grievous and severe
punishment they were worthy: inasmuch as innocent animals suffered punishment
together with them. We hence see that no expiation was sought for by the king,
when he enjoined a fast on brute animals, but that, on the contrary, men were
roused by such means seriously to acknowledge the wrath of God, and to entertain
greater fear, that they might be more truly humbled before him, and be
displeased with themselves, and be thus more disposed and better prepared and
moulded to seek pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see that this must be considered as
intended to terrify the consciences of men, that they, who had long flattered
themselves, might by such a remedy be roused from their insensibility. The same
was the intention of different washings under the law, the cleansing of garments
and of vessels; it was, that the people might know that every thing they touched
was polluted by their filth. And this ought to be especially observed; for the
Papists, wedded as they are to external rites, lay hold on anything said in
Scripture about fasting, and ashes, and sackcloth, and think that the whole of
religion consists in these outward observances: but bodily exercise, as Paul
says, profiteth but littler
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8.) Therefore this rule ought ever to be our guide &#8212; that
fasting and such things are in themselves of no value, but must be estimated
only by the end in view. So then, when the animals were constrained by the
Ninevites to suffer want, the men themselves, being reminded of their guilt,
learned what it was to dread God&#8217;s wrath; and on this account it was that
fasting was approved by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one objects and says that nothing ought
to be done in the worship of God beyond what his word warrants, the answer is
&#8212; that the king of Nineveh had not appointed any kind of expiation,
neither did he intend that they should thus worship God, but regarded only the
end which I have mentioned; and that end fully harmonizes with the word of God
and his command. Hence the king of Nineveh attempted nothing that was
inconsistent with the word of God, since he had in every thing this in view
&#8212; that he and his people might go humbly before God&#8217;s tribunal, and
with real penitential feelings solicit his forgiveness. This then is an answer
sufficiently plain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore Jonah afterwards subjoins,   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
the king commanded both the people and the beasts to put on sackcloth, let us
know, that if any one now were to take this as an example, he would be nothing
else but a mountebank; for this reason ought ever to be remembered, &#8212; that
the king sought aids by which he might lead himself and his people to true
repentance. But the disposition of man is prone to imitate what is evil: for we
are all very like apes; we ought therefore always to consider by what spirit
those were actuated whom we wish to imitate, lest we should be contented with
the outward form and neglect the main things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they cried
mightily</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This must be confined to men; for
it could not have been applied to brute animals. Men then, as well as the
beasts, abstained from meat and drink, and they cried to God. This crying could
not have proceeded except from fear and a religious feeling: hence, as I have
said, this cannot be applied indiscriminately to the beasts as well as to men.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it
deserves to be noticed, that the king of Nineveh commanded the people to cry
mightily to God; for we hence learn that they were really frightened, inasmuch
as he speaks not here of ordinary crying, but he adds mightily, as when we say,
with all our power, or as we say in French, A <i>force,</i> or, <i>fort et
ferme.</i> Jonah then expresses something uncommon and extraordinary, when he
tells us that it was contained in the king&#8217;s edict, that men should cry
mightily to God; for it was the same as though he said, &#8220;Let all men now
awake and shake off their indifference; for every one of us have hitherto
greatly indulged ourselves in our vices: it is now time that fear should possess
our minds, and also constrain us to deprecate the wrath of God.&#8221; And it is
also worthy of being observed, that the king proposes no other remedy, but that
the people should have recourse to prayer. It might indeed have been, that Jonah
exhorted the Ninevites to resort to this duty of religion, etc. We may, however,
undeniably conclude that it is a feeling implanted in us by nature, that when we
are pressed by adversities, we implore the favor of God. This then is the only
remedy in afflictions and distresses, to pray to God. But when we, taught by the
Law and by the Gospel, use not this remedy, whenever God warns us and exhorts us
to repentance, what shadow of excuse can we have, since heathens, even those who
understood not a syllable of true religion, yet prayed to God, and the king
himself commanded this with the consent of his nobles? Hence this edict of the
king ought to fill us with more shame than if one adduced the same doctrine only
from the word of God: for though the authority of that king is not the same with
that of God, yet when that miserable and blind prince acknowledged through the
dictates of nature, that God is to be pacified by prayer, what excuse, as I have
said, can remain for us?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jonah shows more clearly afterwards, that it was
no feigned repentance when the Ninevites put on sackcloth, and abstained also
from meat and drink; for it follows in the kings edict,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let every one turn from his
own wicked ways and from the plunder which is in their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the heathen king shows for
what purpose and with what design he had given orders respecting fasting and
other things; it was done that the Ninevites might thus more effectually
stimulate themselves to fear God; for he here exhorts them to turn from their
evil way. By &#8220;way&#8221; the Scripture usually means the whole course or
manner of man&#8217;s life; it was as though he said, &#8220;Let every one of
you change his disposition and his conduct; let us all become new
creatures.&#8221; And this is true penitence, the conversion of man to God; and
this the heathen king meant. The more shameful then is their dullness who seek
to pacify God by frivolous devices, as the Papists do; for while they obtrude on
God trifles, I know not what, they think that these are so many expiations, and
they tenaciously contend for them. They need no other judge than this heathen
king, who shows that true penitence is wholly different, that it then only takes
place when men become changed in mind and heart, and wholly turn to a better
course of life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let every one then turn, he says,
from his evil way, and from the plunder</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which is in their
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> One kind of evil is here subjoined, a
part being stated for the whole, for plunders were not the only things which
stood in need of amendment among the Ninevites, as it is probable that they were
polluted by other vices and corruptions. In a city so large, drunkenness
probably prevailed, as well as luxury, and pride, and ambition, and also lusts.
It cannot indeed be doubted, but that Nineveh was filled with innumerable vices:
but the king, by mentioning a part for the whole, points out here the principal
vice, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let every one
turn from his evil way, and from his rapacity.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
It was the same as though he had said that the principal virtue is equity or
justice, that is, when men deal with one another without doing any hurt or
injury: and well would it be were this doctrine to prevail at this day among all
those who falsely assume the Christian name. For the Papists, though they
accumulate expiations, pass by charity; and in the whole course of life equity
has hardly any place. Let them then learn, from the mouth of a heathen king,
what God principally requires from men, and approves of in their life, even to
abstain from plunder and from the doing of any injury. We now then perceive why
rapacity was especially mentioned. But we must bear in mind that the king, as
yet a novice, and hardly in a slight degree imbued with the elements of
religion, through hearing what Jonah preached, gave orders to his people
according to the measure of his faith and knowledge: but if he made such
progress in so short a time, what excuse can we pretend, whose ears have been
stunned by continual preaching for twenty or thirty years, if we yet come short
of the novitiate of this king? These circumstances ought then to be carefully
observed by us. Let us now proceed &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The mind and design of the king are here more
distinctly stated, &#8212; that he thus endeavored to reconcile himself and the
people to God. Some give a rendering somewhat different, &#8220;He who knows
will turn and be led by penitence,&#8221; etc.; they read not interrogatively;
but this rendering cannot stand. There is in the meaning of the Prophet nothing
ambiguous, for he introduces the king here as expressing a doubt,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who knows whether God will be
reconciled to us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We hence see that the king
was not overwhelmed with despair for he still thought of a remedy; and this is
the purport of the verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this may seem contrary to the nature of faith;
and then if it be opposed to faith, it follows that it must be inconsistent with
repentance; for faith and repentance are connected together, as we have observed
in other places; as no one can willingly submit to God, except he has previously
known his goodness, and entertained a hope of salvation; for he who is touched
only with fear avoids God&#8217;s presence; and then despair prevails, and
perverseness follows. How then was it that the king of Nineveh had seriously and
undissemblingly repented, while yet he spoke doubtfully of the favor of God? To
this I answer, that it was a measure of doubt, which was yet connected with
faith, even that which does not directly reject the promise of God, but has
other hindrances: as for instance, when any ones cast down with fear, afterwards
receives courage from the hope of pardon and salvation set before him, he is not
yet immediately freed from all fear; for as long as he looks on his sins, and is
entangled by various thoughts, he vacillates, he fluctuates. There is,
therefore, no doubt but that the king of Nineveh entertained hope of
deliverance; but at the same time his mind was perplexed, both on account of the
sermon of Jonah and on account of the consciousness of his own sins: there were
then two obstacles, which deprived the king&#8217;s mind of certainty, or at
least prevented him from apprehending immediately the mercy of God, and from
perceiving with a calm mind that God would be gracious to him. The first
obstacle was the awful message, &#8212; that Nineveh would be destroyed in forty
days. For though Jonah, as we have said, might have added something more, yet
the denunciation was distinct and express, and tended to cast down the minds of
all. The king then had to struggle, in order to overcome this obstacle, and to
resist this declaration of Jonah as far as it was found to be without any
comfort. And then the king, while considering his own sins, could not but
vacillate for some time. But yet we see that he strove to emerge, though he had
these obstacles before his eyes, for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who knows whether God will turn
from the fury of his wrath, and repent?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We
hence see that the king was in a hard struggle; for though Jonah seemed to have
closed the door and to shut out the king from any hope of deliverance, and
though his own conscience held him fast bound, he yet perseveres and encourages
himself; in short, he aspires to the hope of pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it must be further noticed, that this form of
expression expresses a difficulty rather than a mistrust. The king then here
asks, as it were doubtingly, Who knows whether God will turn? for it was a
difficult thing to be believed, that God, after a long forbearance, would spare
the wicked city. Hence the king expresses it as a difficulty; and such an
interrogation was no proof of the absence of faith. A similar expression is
found in Joel, &#8220;Who knows,&#8221; etc.? We then stated several things in
explaining that passage: but it is enough here briefly to state, that the king
here does not betray a mistrust, but sets forth a difficulty. And it was an
evidence of humility that he acknowledged himself and his people to be sunk as
it were, in the lowest hell, and yet ceased not to entertain some hope: for it
is a strong proof of hope, when we still entertain it, though this be contrary
to the whole order of nature, and wholly inconsistent with human reason. We now
then see the meaning of the words. Of the repentance of God we shall speak
hereafter, either to-morrow or the day after.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest we
perish,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says. We see how a heathen king
thought of redeeming himself from destruction&#8217; it was by having God
pacified. As soon then as any danger threatens us, let us bear this in mind,
that no deliverance can be found except the Lord receives us into favor; such
was the conviction of the king of Nineveh, for he concluded that all things
would be well as soon as God should be propitious. We hence see how much this
new and untrained disciple had improved; for he understood that men cannot
escape miseries until God be pacified towards them, and that when men return
into favor with him, though they ought to have perished a hundred times before,
they yet shall be delivered and made safe; for the grace or the favor of God is
the fountain of life and salvation, and of all blessings. It afterwards follows

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah now says, that the Ninevites obtained pardon
through their repentance: and this is an example worthy of being observed; for
we hence learn for what purpose God daily urges us to repentance, and that is,
because he desires to be reconciled to us, and that we should be reconciled to
him. The reason then why so many reproofs and threatening resound in our ears,
whenever we come to hear the word of God, is this, &#8212; that as God seeks to
recover us from destruction he speaks sharply to us: in short, whatever the
Scripture contains on repentance and the judgment of God ought to be wholly
applied for this purpose &#8212; to induce us to return into favor with him; for
he is ready to be reconciled, and is ever prepared to embrace those who without
dissimulation turn to him. We then understand by this example that God has no
other object in view, whenever he sharply constrains us, than that he may be
reconciled to us, provided only we be our own judges, and thus anticipate his
wrath by genuine sorrow of heart, provided we solicit the pardon of our guilt
and sin, and loathe ourselves, and confess that we are worthy of
perdition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jonah seems to ascribe their deliverance to their
repentance, and also to their works: for he says that the Ninevites obtained
pardon, because God looked on their works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must first see what works he means, that no one
may snatch at a single word, as hypocrites are wont to do; and this, as we have
said, is very commonly the case under the Papacy.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God had respect to their
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; what works? not sackcloth, not
ashes, not fasting; for Jonah does not now mention these; but he had respect to
their works &#8212; because they turned from their evil way. We hence see that
God was not pacified by outward rites only, by the external profession of
repentance, but that he rather looked on the true and important change which had
taken place in the Ninevites, for they had become renewed. These then were their
works, even the fruits of repentance. And such a change of life could not have
taken place, had not the Ninevites been really moved by a sense of God&#8217;s
wrath. The fear of God then had preceded; and this fear could not have been
without faith. We hence see that he chiefly speaks here not of external works,
but of the renovation of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if any one objects and says that still this view
does not prevent us from thinking that good works reconcile us to God, and that
they thus procure our salvation: to this I answer &#8212; that the question here
is not about the procuring cause of forgiveness. It is certain that God was
freely pacified towards the Ninevites, as he freely restores his favor daily to
us. Jonah then did not mean that satisfactions availed before God, as though the
Ninevites made compensations for their former sins. The words mean no such
thing; but he shows it as a fact which followed, that God was pacified, because
the Ninevites repented. But we are to learn from other parts of Scripture how
God becomes gracious to us, and how we obtain pardon with him, and whether this
comes to us for our merits and repentance or whether God himself forgives us
freely. Since the whole Scripture testifies that pardon is gratuitously given
us, and that God cannot be otherwise propitious to us than by not imputing sins,
there is no need, with regard to the present passage, anxiously to inquire why
God looked on the works of the Ninevites, so as not to destroy them: for this is
said merely as a consequence. Jonah then does not here point out the cause, but
only declares that God was pacified towards the Ninevites, as soon as they
repented. But we shall speak more on this subject.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we are
loaded with so many vices, and so many sins, yea, and scandalous crimes break
out daily among us, &#8212; O grant, that we may not be hardened against so many
exhortations, by which thou invites us to thyself, but that being made contrite
in spirit, whenever thou denounces on us thy wrath, we may be really humbled,
and so place ourselves before thy tribunal, that we may, by a true confession
and genuine fear, anticipate the judgment which would otherwise have been
prepared for us; and that in the meantime relying on Christ our Mediator, we may
entertain such a hope of pardon as may raise us up to thee, and not doubt but
that thou art ready to embrace us, when we shall be moved by a true and real
feeling of fear and penitence, since it is a proof of thy favor, when thou art
pleased to anticipate us, and by thy Spirit testifies that thou art a Father to
us; and, in a word, may we be so cast down in ourselves, as to raise up our hope
even to heaven, through Jesus Christ one Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
SEVENTY-NINTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We stated yesterday how God remitted to the Ninevites
the punishment which he had threatened by the mouth of Jonah, and that the
remission both of the punishment and of the guilt was gratuitous. For whenever
God sets forth pardon to sinners, the condition of repentance is at the same
time added: it does not yet follow that repentance is the procuring cause of
obtaining pardon; for God offers it freely, nor is he otherwise induced than by
his own mere bounty. But as he would not have men to abuse his indulgence and
forbearance, he lays down this condition, &#8212; that they must repent of their
former life and change for the better. So then he regards the works of those who
testify that they hate sin, and who, with a sincere and real desire, flee to His
mercy; and no man from the heart desires God to be propitious to him, but he who
loathes himself on account of his sin. This is the reason why Isaiah also says,
that God would be merciful to the remnants of his people, even because every one
would turn away from his iniquity. God does not certainly mean by these words
that repentance, as already stated, is the cause of our salvation; but he
requires a change for the better, for no one will really seek grace, except he
loathes himself on account of his sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to what Jonah adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God was led to
repent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it is a mode of speaking that
ought to be sufficiently known to us. Strictly speaking, no repentance can
belong to God: and it ought not to be ascribed to his secret and hidden counsel.
God then is in himself ever the same, and consistent with himself; but he is
said to repent, when a regard is had to the comprehension of men: for as we
conceive God to be angry, whenever he summons us to his tribunal, and shows to
us our sins; so also we conceive him to be placable, when he offers the hope of
pardon. But it is according to our perceptions that there is any change, when
God forgets his wrath, as though he had put on a new character. As then we
cannot otherwise be terrified, that we may be humbled before God and repent,
except he sets forth before us his wrath, the Scripture accommodates itself to
the grossness of our understanding. But, on the other hand, we cannot
confidently call on God, unless we feel assured that he is placable. We hence
see that some kind of change appears to us, whenever God either threatens or
gives hope of pardon and reconciliation: and to this must be referred this mode
of speaking which Jonah adopts, when he says that God repented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that there is a twofold view of God,
&#8212; as he sets himself forth in his word, &#8212; and as he is as to his
hidden counsel. With regard to his secret counsel, I have already said that God
is always like himself, and is subject to none of our feelings: but with regard
to the teaching of his word, it is accommodated to our capacities. God is now
angry with us, and then, as though he were pacified, he offers pardon, and is
propitious to us. Such is the repentance of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then remember that it proceeds from his word,
that God is said to repent; for the Ninevites could form no other opinion but
that it was God&#8217;s decree that they were to be destroyed, &#8212; how so?
because he had so testified by his word. But when they rose up to an assurance
of deliverance, they then found that a change had taken place, that is,
according to the knowledge of their own faith: and the feelings both of fear and
of joy proceeded from the word: for when God denounced his wrath, it was
necessary for the wretched men to be terrified; but when he invited them to a
state of safety by proposing reconciliation to them, he then put on a new
character; and thus they ascribed a new feeling to God. This is the meaning. Let
us now proceed &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jerome commends this grief of Jonah, and compares it
to the holy zeal of Paul when he wished himself to be an anathema for his
brethren,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:3:) for he denies that he grieved because God had showed mercy to so
illustrious a city; but because the conversion of the Gentiles was a certain
presage of the destruction of the chosen people. As then Jonah perceived as in a
mirror the near ruin of Israel, he on this account grieved, if we believe
Jerome: but this notion is extremely frivolous; for, immediately after, God
reproved Jonah. What then will the foolish and puerile apology of Jerome avail
the Prophet, since God has declared that he acted perversely in grieving? Nay,
the dullness of Jerome is thus become evident; (thus indeed do I speak of a man,
who, though learned and laborious, has yet deprived himself of that praise,
which otherwise he might have justly earned.) His wayward disposition everywhere
betrayed itself; and he is evidently disproved in this very context, where Jonah
shows clearly that the cause of his grief was another, even this, &#8212; that
he was unwilling to be deemed a false or a lying prophet: hence was his great
grief and his bitterness. And this we see, had God not expressed his mind, was
unjust and inconsistent with every reason.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may then conclude that Jonah was influenced by
false zeal when he could not with resignation bear that the city of Nineveh
should have been delivered from destruction: and he also himself amplifies the
greatness of his sin. He might have said, in one word, that it displeased Jonah;
but not satisfied with this simple form, he adds, that he felt great displeasure
or grief; and he afterwards adds, that he was very angry. Though the beginning
may not have been wrong, yet excess was sinful. But he confesses that there was
excess, and want of moderation in his grief: since then he accuses himself in
plain words what good is it, by false and invented pretenses, to cover what we
clearly see cannot be excused? But that it may be more evident why the
deliverance of the city of Nineveh displeased Jonah, let us go on with the

<div><font face="Palatino">It seems by no means befitting that Jonah should have
said here that he prayed; for prayer ought to be calm; but he confesses that his
mind was in a state of excitement. As then anger was burning within the Prophet,
how could he come before God and utter a suitable prayer? And further, what is
the end of praying, but to confess that whatever good is to be obtained resides
in God, and is to be sought humbly from him? But Jonah here, on the contrary,
expostulates and clamors against God; for he seems in a manner to be contending
that he had a just reason for his flight, and also that God ought not to have
pardoned the Ninevites. He then accuses God, that he might free himself from
every blame. But all this is foreign and remote from what is required in prayer.
How then must we understand this passage, in which he says that he prayed? My
answer is &#8212; that the faithful often in a disturbed state of mind approach
God with a desire to pray, and that their prayers are not wholly rejected,
though they are not altogether approved and accepted. And hence also it appears
more evident how the works of the godly are regarded by God, though they are
sprinkled with many stains. Whenever the Papists read that any work has pleased
God, they imagine that all was perfection and cleanness: but there is no work
which is not infected with some pollution, unless it be purified by a free
pardon. This I say is evident to us in this prayer, which was not so rejected by
God, as though it retained not the character of prayer: and yet it is certain
that Jonah was by no means rightly influenced when he prayed so clamorously,
finding fault, as it were, with God, and retaining still some portion of his own
obstinacy; for he boasted of his flight. But this flight, as we have stated, was
a proof of manifest rebellion, since, by shaking off the yoke, he despised the
call of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must therefore acknowledge that there was some
piety in this prayer of Jonah, as well as many faults. It was an act of piety
that he addressed his complaints to God. For though hypocrites may pray to God,
they yet are wholly averse to him, and freely give vent to their bitterness
against God: but Jonah, while he here complains, and observes no moderation, but
is carried away by a blind and perverse impulse, is yet prepared to submit to
God, as we shall hereafter see. This is the reason why he says that he prayed:
for he would not have been ashamed to confess any grievous sin of which he might
have been conscious. He did not then extenuate his fault by using the word
prayer as hypocrites are wont to do, who ever set up some pretenses or veils
when they seek to cover their own baseness: such was not the object of Jonah.
When therefore he says that he prayed, he declares generally that he did not so
speak against God, but that he still retained some seed of piety and obedience
in his heart. <i>Jonah</i> then <i>prayed.</i> Hence it follows, as I have
before stated, that many of the prayers of the saints are sinful, (<i>vitiosas
&#8212; </i>faulty) which, when tried by the right rule, deserve to be rejected.
But the Lord, according to his own mercy, pardons their defects so that these
confused and turbulent prayers yet retain their title and
honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I pray thee, Jehovah is not this
what I said?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here Jonah openly declares why he
bore so ill the deliverance of Nineveh from destruction, because he was thus
found to have been false and lying. But it may seem strange that the Prophet had
more regard for his own reputation than for the glory of God; for in this
especially shines forth the glory of God, that he is reconcilable as soon as men
return to the right way, and that he offers himself to them as a father. Ought
then Jonah to have preferred his own honor to the glory of God? I answer,
&#8212; that the Prophet was not so devoted to himself, but that a concern for
the glory of God held the first place in his soul; this is certain. For he
connected, and justly so, his own ministry with the glory of God; as it
proceeded from his authority. When Jonah entered Nineveh, he cried not as a
private man, but avowed that he was sent by God. Now if the preaching of Jonah
is found to be false, reproach will recoil on the author of his call, even on
God. Jonah then no doubt could not bear that the name of God should be exposed
to the reproaches of the Gentiles, as though he had spoken dissemblingly, now
opening hell, then heaven: and there is nothing so contrary to the glory of God
as such a dissimulation. We hence see why Jonah was seized with so much grief;
he did not regard himself; but as he saw that an occasion would be given to
ungodly blasphemers, if God changed his purpose, or if he did not appear
consistent with his word, he felt much grieved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But however specious this reason may be, we yet learn
of how much avail are good intentions with God. Whatever good intention can be
imagined, it was certainly a good intention in Jonah, worthy of some praise,
that he preferred dying a hundred times rather than to hear these reproachful
blasphemies &#8212; that the word of God was a mere sport, that his threatening
were no better than fables, that God made this and that pretense, and
transformed himself into various characters. This was certainly the very best
intention, if it be estimated by our judgment. But we shall presently see that
it was condemned by the mouth of God himself. Let us hence learn not to arrogate
to ourselves judgment in matters which exceed our capacities, but to subject our
minds to God, and to seek of him the spirit of wisdom. For whence was it that
Jonah so fretted against God, except that he burned with a desire for his glory?
But his zeal was inconsiderate, for he would be himself the judge and
arbitrator, while, on the contrary, he ought to have subjected himself
altogether to God. And the same rule ought to be observed also by us. When we
see many things happening through a Divine interposition, that is, through the
secret providence of God, and things which expose his name to the blasphemies of
the ungodly, we ought indeed to feel grief; but in the meantime let us ask of
the Lord to turn at length these shameful reproaches to his own glory; and let
us by no means raise an uproar, as many do, who immediately begin to contend
with God, when things are otherwise ordered than what they wish or think to be
useful. Let us learn by the example of Jonah not to measure God&#8217;s
judgments by our own wisdom, but to wait until he turns darkness into light. And
at the same time let us learn to obey his commands, to follow his call without
any disputing: though heaven and earth oppose us, though many things occur which
may tend to avert us from the right course, let us yet continue in this
resolution, &#8212; that nothing is better for us than to obey God, and to go on
in the way which he points out to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by saying that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hastened to go to
Tarshish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he does not altogether excuse
his flight; but he now more clearly explains, that he did not shun trouble or
labor, that he did not run away from a contest or danger, but that he only
avoided his call, because he felt a concern for the glory of God. The import,
then, of Jonah&#8217;s words is, &#8212; that he makes God here, as it were, his
witness and judge, that he did not withdraw himself from obedience to God
through fear of danger, or through idleness, or through a rebellious spirit, or
through any other evil motive, but only because he was unwilling that his holy
name should be profaned, and would not of his own accord be the minister of that
preaching, which would be the occasion of opening the mouth of ungodly and
profane men, and of making them to laugh at God himself. Since then I cannot
hope, he says, for any other issue to my preaching than to make the Gentiles to
deride God, yea, and to revile his holy name, as though he were false and
deceitful, I chose rather to flee to Tarshish. Then Jonah does not here
altogether clear himself; for otherwise that chastisement, by which he ought to
have been thoroughly subdued, must have failed in its effect. He had been lately
restored from the deep, and shall we say that he now so extols himself against
God, that he wishes to appear wholly free from every blame? This certainly would
be very strange: but, as I have said, he declares to God, that he fled at the
beginning for no other reason, but because he did not expect any good fruit from
his preaching, but, on the contrary, feared what now seemed to take place,
&#8212; that God&#8217;s name would be ridiculed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For he immediately
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> For I know that thou art a
God full of grace, and merciful, slow to wrath,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">etc. It is a wonder that Jonah withdrew from
his lawful call; for he knew that God was merciful, and there is no stronger
stimulant than this to stir us on, when God is pleased to use our labor: and we
know that no one can with alacrity render service to God except he be allured by
his paternal kindness. Hence no one will be a willing Prophet or Teacher, except
he is persuaded that God is merciful. Jonah then seems here to reason very
absurdly when he says, that he withdrew himself from his office, because he knew
that God was merciful. But how did he know this? By the law of God; for the
passage is taken from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
33:1, where is described that remarkable and memorable vision, in which God
offered to Moses a view of himself: and there was then exhibited to the holy
Prophet, as it were, a living representation of God, and there is no passage in
the law which expresses God&#8217;s nature more to the life; for God was then
pleased to make himself known in a familiar way to his servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then Jonah had been instructed in the doctrine of
the law, how could he discharge the office of a Prophet among his own people?
And why did not this knowledge discourage his mind, when he was called to the
office of a Teacher? It is then certain that this ought to be confined to the
sort of preaching, such as we have before explained. Jonah would not have shrunk
from God&#8217;s command, had he been sent to the Ninevites to teach what he had
been ordered to do among the chosen people. Had then a message been committed to
Jonah, to set forth a gracious and merciful God to the Ninevites, he would not
have hesitated a moment to offer his service. But as this express threatening,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nineveh shall be
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, was given him in charge, he became
confounded, and sought at length to flee away rather than to execute such a
command. Why so? Because he thus reasoned with himself, &#8220;I am to denounce
a near ruin on the Ninevites; why does God command me to do this, except to
invite these wretched men to repentance? Now if they repent, will not God be
instantly ready to forgive them? He would otherwise deny his own nature: God
cannot be unlike himself, he cannot put off that disposition of which he has
once testified to Moses. Since God, then, is reconcilable, if the Ninevites will
return to the right way and flee to him, he will instantly embrace them: thus I
shall be found to be false in my preaching.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive how this passage of Jonah is to
be understood, when he says that he fled beyond the sea, at least that he
attempted to do so, because he knew that God was gracious; for he would not have
deprived God of his service, had not this contrariety disturbed and discouraged
his mind, &#8220;What! I shall go there as God&#8217;s ambassador, in a short
time I shall be discovered to be a liar: will not this reproach be cast on the
name of God himself? It is therefore better for me to be silent, than that God,
the founder of my call, should be ridiculed.&#8221; We see that Jonah had a
distinct regard to that sort of preaching which we have already referred to. And
it hence appears that Jonah gave to the Ninevites more than he thought; for he
supposed that he was sent by God, only that the Ninevites might know that they
were to be destroyed: but he brought deliverance to them; and this indeed he
partly suspected or knew before; for he retained this truth &#8212; that God
cannot divest himself of his mercy, for he remains ever the same. But when he
went forth to execute the duty enjoined on him he certainly had nothing to
expect but the entire ruin of the city Nineveh. God in the meantime employed his
ministry for a better end and purpose. There is indeed no doubt but that he
exhorted the Ninevites to repentance; but his own heart was as it were closed
up, so that he could not allow them the mercy of God. We hence see that Jonah
was seized with perplexities, so that he could not offer deliverance to the
Ninevites, and it was yet offered them by God through his
instrumentality.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand how God often works by his
servants; for he leads them as the blind by his own hand where they think not.
Thus, when he stirs up any one of us, we are sometimes
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ojligo&gt;pi&gt;stoi</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; very weak in faith; we think that our labor will be useless and without
any fruit, or at least attended with small success. But the Lord will let us see
what we could not have expected. Such was the case with Jonah; for when he came
to Nineveh, he had no other object but to testify respecting the destruction of
the city; but the Lord was pleased to make him the minister of salvation. God
then honored with remarkable success the teaching of Jonah, while he was
unworthy of so great an honor; for, as we have already said, he closed up in a
manner every access to the blessing of God. We now then apprehend the meaning of
this passage, in which Jonah says that he fled from the call of God, because he
knew that God was ready to be gracious and merciful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the great things which are said of God.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wnj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chenun, </i>properly means a disposition to show favor, as though it was said
that God is gratuitously benevolent; we express the same in our language by the
terms, <i>benin, gratieux, debonnaire.</i> God then assumes to himself this
character; and then he says,<i> merciful;</i> and he adds this that we may know
that he is always ready to receive us, if indeed we come to him as to the
fountain of goodness and mercy. But the words which follow express more clearly
his mercy, and show how God is merciful, &#8212; even because he is abundant in
compassion and slow to wrath. God then is inclined to kindness; and though men
on whom he looks are unworthy, he is yet merciful; and this he expresses by the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wjr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rechum</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is at the same time necessary to add these two
sentences that he is <i>abundant</i> in compassion and slow to wrath, &#8212;
why so? For we ever seek in ourselves some cause for God&#8217;s favor; when we
desire God to be kind to us, we inquire in ourselves why he ought to favor us:
and when we find nothing, all the faith we before had respecting God&#8217;s
grace at once vanishes. The Lord therefore does here recall us to himself, and
testifies that he is kind and merciful, inasmuch as he is abundant in
compassion; as though he said, &#8220;I have in myself a sufficient reason, why
I should be accessible to you, and why I should receive you and show you
favor.&#8221; Hence the goodness of God alone ought to be regarded by us, when
we desire his mercy, and when we have need of pardon. It is as though he had
said, that he is not influenced by any regard for our worthiness, and that it is
not for merits that he is disposed to mercy when we have sinned, and that he
receives us into favor; but that he does all this because his goodness is
infinite and inexhaustible. And it is also added, that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>slow to
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This slowness to wrath proves
that God provides for the salvation of mankind, even when he is provoked by
their sins. Though miserable men provoke God daily against themselves, he yet
continues to have a regard for their salvation. He is therefore slow to wrath,
which means, that the Lord does not immediately execute such punishment as they
deserve who thus provoke him. We now then see what is the import of these
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to this &#8212; that Jonah thrust
himself from his office, because he knew that God was slow to wrath, and
merciful, and full of grace: he even had recourse to this reasoning,
&#8220;Either God will change his nature, or spare the Ninevites if they repent:
and it may be that they will repent; and then my preaching will be found to be
false; for God will not deny himself, but will afford an example of his goodness
and mercy in forgiving this people.&#8221; We may again remark, that we act
perversely, when we follow without discrimination our own zeal: it is indeed a
blind fervor which then hurries us on. Though then a thousand inconsistencies
meet us when God commands any thing, our eyes ought to be closed to them, and we
ought ever to follow the course of our calling; for he will so regulate all
events, that all things shall redound to his glory. It is not for us in such a
case to be over-wise; but the best way is, to leave in God&#8217;s hand the
issue of things. It becomes us indeed to fear and to feel concerned; but our
anxiety ought, at the same time, to be in submission to God, so that it is
enough for us to pray. This is the import of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to what he says that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repents of the
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> we have already explained this: it
means, that though God has already raised his hand, he will yet withdraw it, as
soon as he sees any repentance in men; for evil here is to be taken for
punishment. The Lord then, though he might justly inflict extreme punishment on
men, yet suspends his judgment, and when they come to him in true penitence he
is instantly pacified. This is God&#8217;s repentance; he is said to repent when
he freely forgives whatever punishment or evil men have deserved whenever they
loathe themselves.

<div><font face="Palatino">We here see how angry Jonah was in his zeal: for this
prayer cannot certainly be ascribed to his faith, as some think, who say that
Jonah took a flight as it were in his soul to heaven, when he made this prayer,
as though he dreaded not death, but having been divested of all fear, being free
and disengaged, he presented himself to God. I do not think that the mind of
Jonah was so heroic. There is indeed no doubt, as I have already said, but that
he still retained some seed of piety; and this, I said, is sufficiently proved
by the word prayer; for if Jonah had burst out in the strain of one in despair,
it would not have been a prayer. Since then he prayed by thus speaking, it
follows that it was not the cry of despair, but of too much displeasure, which
Jonah did not restrain. In short, this prayer proceeded from a pious and holy
zeal; but Jonah sinned as to its measure or excess; for he had in a manner
forgotten himself, when </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
preferred death to
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take me
away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He was first not free from blame in
hastily wishing to die; for it is not in our power to quit this world; but we
ought with submissive minds to continue in it as long as God keeps us in the
station in which we are placed. whosoever, then, hastens to death with so great
an ardor no doubt offends God. Paul knew that death was desirable in his case,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:22;) but when he understood that his labor would be useful to the Church, he
was contented with his lot, and preferred the will of God to his own will; and
thus he was prepared both to live and to die, as it seemed good to God. It was
otherwise with Jonah, &#8220;Now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;take away my
life.&#8221; This was one fault; but the other was, &#8212; that he wished to
die, because God spared the Ninevites. Though he was touched with some grief, he
ought not yet to have gone so far as this, or rather to rush on, so as to desire
death on account of the weariness of his life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence learn to what extremes men are carried,
when once they give loose reins to inconsiderate zeal. The holy Prophet Jonah,
who had been lately tamed and subdued by so heavy a chastisements is now seized
and carried away by a desire to die, &#8212; and why? because he thought that it
was hard that he denounced destruction on the Ninevites, and that still their
city remained safe. This example ought to check us, that we express not too
boldly our opinion respecting the doings of God, but, on the contrary, hold our
thoughts captive, lest any presumption of this kind be manifested by us; for
there is none of us who does not condemn Jonah, as also he condemned himself;
for he does not here narrate his own praise, but means to show how foolishly he
had judged of God&#8217;s work. Jonah then confesses his own folly; and
therefore his experience is to us an evidence that there is nothing more
preposterous than for us to settle this or that according to our own wisdom,
since this is alone true wisdom, to submit ourselves wholly to the will of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now if any one raises a question here, &#8212;
whether it is lawful to desire death; the answer may be briefly this, &#8212;
that death is not to be desired on account of the weariness of life; this is one
thing: and by the weariness of life I understand that state of mind, when either
poverty, or want, or disgrace, or any such thing, renders life hateful to us:
but if any, through weariness on account of his sins and hatred to them, regrets
his delay on earth, and can adopt the language of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Miserable am I,
who will free me from the body of this death!&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
7:24,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; he entertains a holy and pious wish,
provided the submission, to which I have referred, be added so that this feeling
may not break forth in opposition to the will of God; but that he who has such a
desire may still suffer himself to be detained by his hand as long as he
pleases. And further, when any one wishes to die, because he fears for himself
as to the future, or dreads to undergo any evil, he also struggles against God;
and such was the fault of Jonah; for he says that death was better to him than
life, &#8212; and why? because the Lord had spared the Ninevites. We hence see
how he was blinded, yea, carried away by a mad impulse to desire
death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn so to love this life as to be
prepared to lay it down whenever the Lord pleases: let us also learn to desire
death, but so as to live to the Lord, and to proceed in the race set before use
until he himself lead us to its end. Now follows the reproof of God &#8212;

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt but that God by thus reproving
Jonah condemns his intemperate warmth. But since God alone is a fit judge of
man&#8217;s conduct, there is no reason for us to boast that we are influenced
by good intentions; for there is nothing more fallacious than our own balances.
When therefore we weigh facts, deeds, and thoughts by our own judgment, we
deceive ourselves. Were any disposed rhetorically to defend the conduct of
Jonah, he might certainly muster up many specious pretenses; and were any one
inclined to adduce excuses for Jonah, he might be made to appear to us
altogether innocent: but though the whole world absolved him, what would it
avail, since he was condemned by the mouth of God himself, who alone, as I have
already stated, is the judge? We ought then to feel assured, that Jonah had done
foolishly, even if no reason was apparent to us; for the authority of the
Supreme Judge ought to be more than sufficient.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now God expressly condemns his wrath. Had Jonah
modestly expostulated, and unburdened his griefs into the bosom of God, it would
have been excusable; though his ardor would not have been free from blame, it
might yet have been borne with. But now, when he is angry, it is past endurance;
for wrath, as one says, is but short madness; and then it blinds the perceptions
of men, it disturbs all the faculties of the soul. God then does not here in a
slight manner condemn Jonah, but he shows how grievously he had fallen by
allowing himself to become thus angry. We must at the same time remember, that
Jonah had sinned not only by giving way to anger; he might have sinned, as we
have said, without being angry. But God by this circumstance &#8212; that he
thus became turbulent, enhances his sin. And it is certainly a most unseemly
thing, when a mean creature rises up against God, and in a boisterous spirit
contends with him: this is monstrous; and Jonah was in this state of
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see why an express mention is made of his
anger, &#8212; God thus intended to bring conviction home to Jonah, that he
might no more seek evasions. Had he simply said, &#8220;Why! how is it that thou
dost not leave to me the supreme right of judging? If such is my will, why dost
not thou submissively acknowledge that what I do is rightly done? Is it thy
privilege to be so wise, as to dictate laws to me, or to correct my
decisions?&#8221; &#8212; had the Lord thus spoken, there might have remained
still some excuse; Jonah might have said, &#8220;Lord, I cannot restrain my
grief, when I see thy name so profaned by unseemly reproaches; can I witness
this with a calm mind?&#8221; He might thus have still sought some coverings for
his grief; but when the Lord brought forward his anger, he must have been
necessarily silenced; for what could be found to excuse Jonah, when he thus
perversely rebelled, as I have said, against God, his Judge and Maker? We now
then understand why God expressly declares that Jonah did not do well in being
thus angry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I wonder how it came into Jerome&#8217;s mind to
say that Jonah is not here reproved by the Lord, but that something of an
indifferent kind is mentioned. He was indeed a person who was by nature a
sophister, (cavillator &#8212; a caviler;) and thus he wantonly trifled with the
work of falsifying Scripture; he made no conscience of perverting passages of
holy writ. As, for instance, when he writes about marriage, he says that they do
not ill who marry, and yet that they do not well. What a sophistry is this, and
how vapid! So also on this place, &#8220;God,&#8221; he says, &#8220;does not
condemn Jonah, neither did he intend to reprove his sin; but, on the contrary,
Jonah brings before us here the person of Christ, who sought death that the
whole world might be saved; for when alive he could not do good to his own
nation, he could not save his own kindred; he therefore preferred to devote
himself and his life for the redemption of the world.&#8221; These are mere
puerilities; and thus the whole meaning of this passage, as we clearly see, is
distorted. But the question is more emphatical than if God had simply said,
&#8220;Thou hast sinned by being thus angry;&#8221; for an affirmative sentence
has not so much force as that which is in the form of a
question.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then not only declares as a Judge that Jonah had
not done well, but he also draws from him his own confession, as though he said,
&#8220;Though thou art a judge in thine own cause, thou can&#8217;t not yet make
a cover for thy passion, for thou art beyond measure angry.&#8221; For when he
says
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>la</i>k, with, or, <i>in thyself, </i>he reminds Jonah to examine his own
heart, as though he said, &#8220;Look on thyself as in a mirror: thou wilt see
what a boisterous sea is thy soul, being seized as thou art by so mad a
rage.&#8221; We now then perceive not only the plain sense of the passage, but
also the emphasis, which is contained in the questions which Jerome has turned
to a meaning wholly contrary. I will not proceed farther;

intimate that it was then known by the event itself, that God had spared the
city from destruction; for in the last lecture it was said, that God had
repented of the evil he had declared and had not done it. It hence appears that
Jonah had not gone out of the city until the forty days had passed. But there
comes again another question, what need had he to sit near the city, for it was
evident enough that the purpose of God had changed, or at least that the
sentence Jonah had pronounced was changed? he ought not then to have seated
himself near the city as though he was doubtful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I am inclined to adopt the conjecture, that Jonah
went out after the fortieth day, for the words seem to countenance it. With
regard to the question, why he yet doubted the event, when time seemed to have
proved it, the answer may be readily given: though indeed the forty days had
passed, yet Jonah stood as it were perplexed, because he could not as yet feel
assured that what he had before proclaimed according to God&#8217;s command
would be without its effect. I therefore doubt not but that Jonah was held
perplexed by this thought, &#8220;Thou hast declared nothing rashly; how can it
then be, that what God wished to be proclaimed by his own command and in his own
name, should be now in vain, with no corresponding effect?&#8221; Since then
Jonah had respect to God&#8217;s command, he could not immediately extricate
himself from his doubts. This then was the cause why he sat waiting: it was,
because he thought that though God&#8217;s vengeance was suspended, his
preaching would not yet be in vain, but that the ruin of the city was at hand.
This therefore was the reason why he still waited after the prefixed time, as
though the event was still doubtful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now that this may be more evident, let us bear in
mind that the purpose of God was hidden, so that Jonah understood not all the
parts of his vocation. God, then, when he threatened ruin to the Ninevites,
designed to speak conditionally: for what could have been the benefit of the
word, unless this condition was added, &#8212; that the Ninevites, if they
repented, should be saved? There would otherwise have been no need of a Prophet;
the Lord might have executed the judgment which the Ninevites deserved, had he
not intended to regard their salvation. If any one objects by saying that a
preacher was sent to render them inexcusable, &#8212; this would have been
unusual; for God had executed all his other judgments without any previous
denunciation, I mean, with regard to heathen nations: it was the peculiar
privilege of the Church that the Prophets ever denounced the punishments which
were at hand; but to other nations God made it known that he was their Judge,
though he did not send Prophets to warn them. There was then included a
condition, with regard to God&#8217;s purpose, when he commanded the Ninevites
to be terrified by so express a declaration. But Jonah was, so to speak, too
literal a teacher; for he did not include what he ought to have done, &#8212;
that there was room for repentance, and that the city would be saved, if the
Ninevites repented of their wickedness. Since then Jonah had learned only one
half of his office, it is no wonder that his mind was still in doubt, and could
not feel assured as to the issue; for he had nothing but the event, God had not
yet made known to him what he would do. Let us now proceed &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Before I proceed to treat on the contents of these
verses, I will say a few things on the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyqyq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kikiun</i>; for there were formerly some disputes respecting this word. Some
render it, a gourd; (<i>eucurbitam</i>) others think it to have been a cucumber.
Free conjectures are commonly made respecting obscure and unknown things.
However, the first rendering has been the received one: and Augustine says, that
a tumult arose in some church, when the Bishop rend the new interpretation of
Jerome, who said that it was the ivy. Those men were certainly thoughtless and
foolish who were so offended for a matter so trifling; for they ought to have
more carefully inquired which version was the best and most correct. And
Augustine did not act so very wisely in this affair; for superstition so
possessed him, that he was unwilling that the received version of the Old
Testament should be changed. He indeed willingly allowed Jerome to translate the
New Testament from the Greek original; but he would not have the Old Testament
to be touched; for he entertained a suspicion of the Jews, &#8212; that as they
were the most inveterate enemies of the faith, they would have tried to falsify
the Law and the Prophets. As then Augustine had this suspicion, he preferred
retaining the common version. And Jerome relates that he was traduced at Rome,
because he had rendered it ivy instead of gourd; but he answered Augustine in a
very severe and almost an angry manner; and he inveighed in high displeasure
against some Cornelius and another by the name of Asinius Polio, who had accused
him at Rome as one guilty of sacrilege, because he had changed this word. I
cannot allege in excuse, that they peevishly rejected what was probable. But as
to the thing itself, I would rather retain in this place the word gourd, or
cucumber, than to cause any disturbance by a thing of no moment. Jerome himself
confesses, that it was not ivy; for he says, that it was a kind of a shrub, and
that it grows everywhere in Syria; he says that it was a shrub supported by its
own stem, which is not the case with ivy; for the ivy, except it cleaves to a
wall or to a tree, creeps on the ground. It could not then have been the ivy;
and he ought not to have so translated it. He excuses himself and says, that if
he had put down the Hebrew word, many would have dreamt it to have been a beast
or a serpent. He therefore wished to put down something that was known. But he
might also have caused many doubts: &#8220;Why! ivy is said to have ascended
over the head of Jonah, and to have afforded him a shade; how could this have
been?&#8221; Now I wonder why Jerome says in one place that the shrub was called
in his time Cicion in the Syrian language; and he says in another place in his
Commentaries, that it was called in the same language Elkeroa; which we see to
be wholly different from the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyqyq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kikiun</i>. Now when he answered Augustine I doubt not but that he
dissembled; for he knew that Augustine did not understand Hebrew: he therefore
trifled with him as with a child, because he was ignorant. It seems to have been
a new gloss, I know not what, invented at the time for his own convenience: I
doubt not but that he at the moment formed the word, as there is some affinity
between
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyqyq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kikiun,</i> and cicion. However it may have been, whether it was a gourd or a
shrub, it is not necessary to dispute much how it could have grown so soon into
so great a size. Jerome says, that it was a shrub with many leaves, and that it
grew to the size of a vine. Be it so; but this shrub grows not in one day, nor
in two, nor in three days.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must have therefore been something extraordinary.
Neither the ivy, nor the gourd, nor any shrub, nor any tree, could have grown so
quickly as to afford a cover to the head of Jonah: nor did this shrub alone give
shelter to Jonah&#8217;s head; for it is more probable, that it was derived also
from the booth which he had made for himself. Jonah then not only sheltered
himself under the shrub, but had the booth as an additional cover, when he was
not sufficiently defended from the heat of the sun. Hence God added this shrub
to the shade afforded by the booth: for in those regions, as we know, the sun is
very hot; and further, it was, as we shall see, an extraordinary
heat.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I wished to say thus much of the word ivy; and I have
spoken more than I intended; but as there have been contentions formerly on the
subject, I wished to notice what may be satisfactory even to curious readers. I
come now to what is contained in this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jonah tells us that a gourds or a cucumber, or an
ivy, was prepared by the Lord. There is no doubt but that this shrub grew in a
manner unusual, that it might be a cover to the booth of Jonah. So I view the
passage. But God, we know, approaches nature, whenever he does anything beyond
what nature is: this is not indeed always the case; but we generally find that
God so works, as that he exceeds the course of nature, and yet from nature he
does not wholly depart. For when in the desert he intended to collect together a
great quantity of quails, that he might give meat to the people, he raised wind
from the east,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
11:31.) How often the winds blew without bringing such an abundance of birds? It
was therefore a miracle: but yet God did not wholly cast aside the assistance of
nature; hence he made use of the wind; and yet the wind could not of itself
bring these birds. So also in this place, God had chosen, I have no doubt, a
herb, which soon ascended to a great height, and yet far surpassed the usual
course of nature. In this sense, then, it is that God is said to have prepared
the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyqyq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kikiun,</i>   
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fe49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and to
have made it to ascend over Jonah&#8217;s head, that it might be for a shade to
his head and free him from his distress.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is said afterwards that a worm was prepared.
We see here also, that what seemed to happen by chance was yet directed by the
hidden providence of God. Should any one say, that what is here narrated does
not commonly happen, but what once happened; to this I answer, &#8212; that
though God then designed to exhibit a wonderful example, worthy of being
remembered, it is yet ever true that the gnawing even of worms are directed by
the counsel of God, so that neither a herb nor a tree withers independently of
his purpose. The same truth is declared by Christ when he says, that without the
Father&#8217;s appointment the sparrows fall not on the ground,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:29.) Thus much as to the worm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that when the sun arose the day
following, a wind was prepared.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We here learn
the same thing, &#8212; that winds do not of themselves rise, or by chance, but
are stirred up by a Divine power. There may indeed be found causes in nature why
now the air is tranquil, and then it is disturbed by winds; but God&#8217;s
purpose regulates all these intermediate causes; so that this is ever true
&#8212; that nature is not some blind impulse, but a law settled by the will of
God. God then ever regulates by his own counsel and hand whatever happens. The
only difference is, that his works which flow in the usual course have the name
of nature; and they are miracles and retain not the name of nature, when God
changes their wonted course; but yet they all proceed from God as their author.
Therefore with regard to this wind, we must understand that it was not usual or
common; and yet that winds are daily no less stirred up by God&#8217;s
providence than this wind of which Jonah speaks. But God wrought then, so to
speak, beyond the usual course of nature, though he daily preserves the regular
order of nature itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see why this whole narrative has been set
down. Jonah confesses that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoiced with great
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> when he was sheltered from the
extreme heat of the sun: but when the shrub withered, he was touched with so
much grief that he wished to die. There is nothing superfluous here; for Jonah
shows, with regard to his joy and his grief, how tender he was and how
susceptible of both. Jonah here confesses his own sensibility, first by saying
that he greatly rejoiced, and then by saying that he was so much grieved for the
withered shrub, that through weariness of life he instantly desired death. There
is then here an ingenuous confession of weakness; for Jonah in a very simple
manner has mentioned both his joy and his grief. But he has distinctly expressed
the vehemence of both feelings, that we might know that he was led away by his
strong emotions, so that in the least things he was either inflamed with anger,
or elated with joy beyond any bounds. This then was the case with him in his
grief as well as in his joy. But he does not say that he prayed as before; but
he adopts the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shal</i>, which signifies to desire or wish. <i>He desired, </i>it is
said,<i> for his soul that he might die.</i> It is hence probable that Jonah was
so overwhelmed with grief that he did not lift up his heart to God; and yet we
see that he was not neglected by God: for it immediately follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">We see here that God had concealed himself for a
time, but did not yet forsake his servant. He often looks on us from behind;
that is, though we think that he has forgotten us, he yet observes how we go on,
that he may in due time afford help: and hence it is that he recovers and raises
up the falling, before we perceive that he is near. This was his manner with
Jonah, when he began to address him: for, as we have said, grief had so
oppressed the mind of the holy Prophets that it could no longer be raised up to
God. Hence he desired to die; and still God did not forsake him. This was no
common example of the invaluable mercy of God, with which he favors his own
people, even when they precipitate themselves into ruin: such was the case with
Jonah, who rushed headlong into a state of despair, and cared not for any
remedy. God then did not wait until he was sought, but anticipated miserable
Jonah, who was now seeking destruction to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doest thou well that thou art
thus angry for the gourd?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As though he had
said, that he was too violently disturbed for a matter so trifling. And we must
ever bear that in mind, of which we spoke more fully yesterday, &#8212; that God
did not merely reprove his servant, because he did not patiently bear the
withering of the gourd &#8212; what then? but because he became angry; for in
anger there is ever an excess. Since then Jonah was thus grieved beyond measure,
and without any restraint, it was justly condemned by God as a fault. I will now
not repeat what I said yesterday respecting the enhancing of the crime, inasmuch
as Jonah not only murmured on account of the withering of the shrub, but also
disregarded himself, and boiled over with displeasure beyond all due
limits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the answer of Jonah confirms
this,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I do
well</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in being angry even to
death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We here see how obstinately the holy
Prophet repelled the admonition of God, by which he ought to have been restored
to a right mind. He was not ignorant that God spoke. Why then was he not smitten
with shame? Why was he not moved by the authority of the speaker, so as
immediately to repress the fierceness of his mind? But thus it commonly happens,
when the minds of men are once blinded by some wrong feeling; though the Lord
may thunder and fulminate from heaven, they will not hear, at least they will
not cease violently to resist, as Jonah does here. Since then we find such an
example of perverseness in this holy man, how much more ought every one of us to
fear? Let us hence learn to repress in time our feelings, and instantly at the
beginning to bridle them, lest if they should burst forth to a greater extent,
we become at last altogether obstinate. I do well, he says, in being angry even
to death. God charged his servant Jonah with the vice of anger; Jonah now
indulges himself in his own madness, so that he says that desperation is not a
vice: I do not sin, he says, though I am despairing; though I abandon myself to
death as with mad fury, I do not yet sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Who could have thought that the holy Prophet could
have been brought into this state of mind? But let us be reminded, as I have
already said, by this remarkable example, how furious and unreasonable are the
passions of our flesh. There is, therefore, nothing better than to restrain
them, before they gather more strength than they ought; for when any one feeds
his vices, this obstinacy and hardness always follow. But to be angry, or to be
in a fume even to death, is to feel such a weariness of life, as to give
ourselves up of our own accord to death. It was not indeed the design of Jonah
to lay violent hands on himself; but though he abstained from violence, he yet,
as to the purpose of his mind, procured death to himself; for he submitted not
to God, but was carried away by a blind impulse, so that he wished to throw away
his life. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God explains the design he had in suddenly
raising up the gourd, and then in causing it to perish or wither through the
gnawing of a worm; it was to teach Jonah that misconduct towards the Ninevites
was very inhuman. Though we find that the holy Prophet had become a prey to
dreadful feelings, yet God, by this exhibition, does in a manner remind him of
his folly; for, under the representation of a gourd, he shows how unkindly he
desired the destruction of so populous a city as Nineveh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet this comparison may appear ill suited for the
purpose. Jonah felt sorry for the gourd, but he only regarded himself: hence he
was displeased, because the relief with which he was pleased was taken away from
him. As then this inconvenience had driven Jonah to anger, the similitude may
not seem appropriate when God thus reasons, Thou wouldest spare the gourd,
should I not spare this great city? Nay, but he was not concerned for the gourd
itself: if all the gourds of the world withered, he would not have been touched
with any grief; but as he felt the greatest danger being scorched by the extreme
heat of the sun, it was on this account that he was angry. To this I answer,
&#8212; that though Jonah consulted his own advantage, yet this similitude is
most suitable: for God preserves men for the purpose for which he has designed
them. Jonah grieved for the withering of the gourd, because he was deprived of
its shade: and God does not create men in vain; it is then no wonder that he
wishes them to be saved. We hence see that Jonah was not unsuitably taught by
this representation, how inhumanely he conducted himself towards the Ninevites.
He was certainly but one individual; since then he made such an account of
himself and the gourd only, how was it that he cast aside all care for so great
and so populous a city? Ought not this to have come to his mind, that it was no
wonder that God, the Creator and Father, had a care for so many thousands of
men? Though indeed the Ninevites were alienated from God, yet as they were men,
God, as he is the Father of the whole human race, acknowledged them as his own,
at least to such an extent as to give them the common light of day, and other
blessings of earthly life. We now then understand the import of this comparison:
&#8220;Thou wouldest spare,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the gourd, and should I not
spare this great city?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears how frivolous is the gloss of
Jerome, &#8212; that Jonah was not angry on account of the deliverance of the
city, but because he saw that his own nation would, through its means, be
destroyed: for God repeats again that Jonah&#8217;s feeling was quite different,
&#8212; that he bore with indignity the deliverance of the city from ruin. And
less to be endured it is still, that Jerome excuses Jonah by saying that he
nobly and courageously answered God, that he had not sinned in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being angry even to
death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That man dared, without any shame or
discernment, to invent a pretense that he might excuse so disgraceful an
obstinacy. But it is enough for us to understand the real meaning of the
Prophet. Here then he shows, according to God&#8217;s representation, that his
cruelty was justly condemned for having anxiously desired the destruction of a
populous city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to notice all the parts of the
similitudes when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
wouldest have spared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. There is an
emphasis in the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ate,</i> for God compares himself with Jonah; &#8220;Who art thou? Doubtless
a mortal man is not so inclined to mercy as I am. But thou takest to thyself
this right &#8212; to desire to spare the gourd, even thou who art made of clay.
Now this gourd is not thy work,

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was the daughter of a
night, and in one night it perished;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it was an
evanescent shrub or herb. If then thou regardest the nature of the gourd, if
thou regardest thyself, and joinest together all the other circumstances, thou
wilt find no reason for thy hot displeasure. But should not I, who am God, in
whose hand are all things, whose prerogative and whose constant practice it is
mercifully to bear with men &#8212; should not I spare them, though they were
worthy of destruction? and should not I spare a great city? The matter here is
not concerning a little plant, but a large number of people. And, in the last
place, it is a city,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in which
there are a hundred and twenty thousand men who know not how to distinguish
between their right hand and the left.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how emphatical are all the parts of
this comparison. And though God&#8217;s design was to reprove the foolish and
sinful grief of Jonah, we may yet further collect a general instruction by
reasoning in this manner, &#8220;We feel for one another, and so nature inclines
us, and yet we are wicked and cruel. If then men are inclined to mercy through
some hidden impulse of nature, what may not be hoped from the inconceivable
goodness of God, who is the Creator of the whole world, and the Father of us
all? and will not he, who is the fountain of all goodness and mercy spare
us?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the number, Jonah mentions here twelve
times ten thousand men, and that is as we have said, one hundred and twenty
thousand. God shows here how paternally he cares for mankind. Every one of us is
cherished by him with singular care: but yet he records here a large number,
that it might be more manifest that he so much regards mankind that he will not
inconsiderately fulminate against any one nation. And what he adds, that they
could not distinguish between the right hand and the left, is to be referred, I
have no doubt, to their age; and this opinion has been almost universally
received. Some one, however has expressed a fear lest the city should be made
too large by allowing such a number of men: he has, therefore, promiscuously
included the old, as well as those of middle age and infants. He says that these
could not distinguish between the right hand and the left, because they had not
been taught in the school of God, nor understood the difference between right
and wrong; for the unbelieving, as we know, went astray in their errors. But
this view is too strained; and besides, there is no reason for this comment; for
that city, we know, was not only like some great cities, many of which are at
this day in Europe, but it surpassed most of the principal cities at this day.
We know that in Paris there are more than four hundred thousand souls: the same
is the case with other cities. I therefore reject this comment, as though Jonah
was here speaking of all the Ninevites. But God, on the contrary, intended to
show, that though there was the justest reason for destroying entirely the whole
city, there were yet other reasons which justified the suspension of so dreadful
a vengeance; for many infants were there who had not, by their own
transgressions, deserved such a destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then shows here to Jonah that he had been carried
away by his own merciless zeal. Though his zeal, as it has been said, arose from
a good principle, yet Jonah was influenced by a feeling far too vehement. This
God proved, by sparing so many infants hitherto innocent. And to infants he adds
the brute animals. Oxen were certainly superior to shrubs. If Jonah justly
grieved for one withering shrub, it was far more deplorable and cruel for so
many innocent animals to perish. We hence see how apposite are all the parts of
this similitude, to make Jonah to loathe his folly, and to be ashamed of it; for
he had attempted to frustrate the secret purpose of God, and in a manner to
overrule it by his own will, so that the Ninevites might not be spared, who yet
labored by true repentance to anticipate the divine judgment.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CALVIN&#8217;S PREFACE TO
MICAH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Among the Minor Prophets, Micah comes next, who is
commonly called Micaiah. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But he
was the second, as they say, of this name; for the first was the Micaiah who had
a contest with the wicked king Ahab; and he then exercised his Prophetic office.
But the second was in the same age with Isaiah, perhaps a little later: at least
Isaiah had been performing his office some years before Micah had been called.
It appears then that he was added to Isaiah, that he might confirm his doctrine;
for that holy man had to do with ungodly men, with men of a hardened neck, yea,
and so wicked, that they were wholly irreclaimable. That their doctrine
therefore might be more entitled to credit, it pleased God that Isaiah and Micah
should deliver their message at the same time, as it were, with one mouth, and
avow their consent, that all the disobedient might be proved
guilty.</font><br></div>

this Book suggest what is useful for our instruction.

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This inscription, in the first place, shows the time
in which Micah lived, and during which God employed his labors. And this
deserves to be noticed: for at this day his sermons would be useless, or at
least frigid, except his time were known to us, and we be thereby enabled to
compare what is alike and what is different in the men of his age, and in those
of our own: for when we understand that Micah condemned this or that vice, as we
may also learn from the other Prophets and from sacred history, we are able to
apply more easily to ourselves what he then said, inasmuch as we can view our
own life as it were in a mirror. This is the reason why the Prophets are wont to
mention the time in which they executed their office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how long Micah followed the course of his
vocation we cannot with certainty determine. It is, however, probable that he
discharged his office as a Prophet for thirty years: it may be that he exceeded
forty years; for he names here three kings, the first of whom, that is Jotham,
reigned sixteen years; and he was followed by Ahab, who also reigned as many
years. If then Micah was called at the beginning of the first reign, he must
have prophesied for thirty-two years, the time of the two kings. Then the reign
of Hezekiah followed, which continued to the twenty-ninth year: and it may be,
that the Prophet served God to the death, or even beyond the death, of Hezekiah.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We hence
see that the number of his years cannot with certainty be known; though it be
sufficiently evident that he taught not for a few years, but that he so
discharged his office, that for thirty years he was not wearied, but constantly
persevered in executing the command of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that he was contemporary with Isaiah: but
as Isaiah began his office under Uzziah, we conclude that he was older. Why then
was Micah joined to him? That the Lord might thus break down the stubbornness of
the people. It was indeed enough that one man was sent by God to bear witness to
the truth; but it pleased God that a testimony should be borne by the mouth of
two, and that holy Isaiah should be assisted by this friend and, as it were, his
colleague. And we shall hereafter find that they adopted the very same words;
but there was no emulation between them, so that one accused the other of theft,
when he repeated what had been said. Nothing was more gratifying to each of them
than to receive a testimony from his colleague; and what was committed to them
by God they declared not only in the same sense and meaning, but also in the
same words, and, as it were, with one mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of the expression, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word was sent to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> we have elsewhere reminded you,
that it ought not to be understood of private teaching, as when the word of God
is addressed to individuals; but the word was given to Micah, that he might be
God&#8217;s ambassador to us. It means then that he came furnished with
commands, as one sustaining the person of God himself; for he brought nothing of
his own, but what the Lord commanded him to proclaim. But as I have elsewhere
enlarged on this subject, I now only touch on it briefly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This vision, he says, was given him against two
cities
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
certain that the Prophet was specifically sent to the Jews; and Maresah, from
which he arose, as it appears from the inscription, was in the tribe of Judah:
for Morasthite was an appellative, derived from the place Maresah. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it
may be asked, why does he say that visions had been given him against Samaria?
We have said elsewhere, that though Hosea was specifically and in a peculiar
manner destined for the kingdom of Israel, he yet by the way mingled sometimes
those things which referred to the tribe or kingdom of Judah: and such was also
the case with our Prophet; he had a regard chiefly to his own kindred, for he
knew that he was appointed for them; but, at the same time, he overlooked not
wholly the other part of the people; for the kingdom of Israel was not so
divided from the tribe of Judah that no connection remained: for God was
unwilling that his covenant should be abolished by their defection from the
kingdom of David. We hence see, that though Micah spent chiefly his labors in
behalf of the Jews, he yet did not overlook or entirely neglect the
Israelites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the title must be restricted to one part of the
book; for threatenings only form the discourse here. But we shall find that
promises, full of joy, are also introduced. The inscription then does not
include all the contents of the book; but as his purpose was to begin with
threatenings, and to terrify the Jews by setting before them the punishment that
was at hand, this inscription was designedly given. There is, at the same time,
no doubt but that the Prophet was ill received by the Jews on this account; for
they deemed it a great indignity, and by no means to be endured, to be tied up
in the same bundle with the Israelites; for Samaria was an abomination to the
kingdom of Judah; and yet the Prophet here makes no difference between Samaria
and Jerusalem. This was then an exasperating sentence: but we see how boldly the
Prophet performs the office committed to him; for he regarded not what would be
agreeable to men, nor endeavored to draw them by smooth things: though his
message was disliked, he yet proclaimed it, for he was so commanded, nor could
he shake off the yoke of his vocation. Let us now proceed

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here rises into an elevated style, being
not content with a simple and calm manner of speaking. We hence may learn, that
having previously tried the disposition of the people, he knew the stubbornness
of almost all classes: for except he was persuaded that the people would be
rebellious and obstinate, he would certainly have used some mildness, or have at
least endeavored to lead them of their own accord rather than to drive them thus
violently. There is then no doubt but that the obstinacy of the people and their
wickedness were already fully known to him, even before he began to address one
word to them. But this difficulty did not prevent him from obeying God&#8217;s
command. He found it necessary in the meantime to add vehemence to his teaching;
for he saw that he addressed the deaf, yea, stupid men, who were destitute of
every sense of religion, and who had hardened themselves against God, and had
not only fallen away through want of thought, but had also become immersed in
their sins, and were wickedly and abominably obstinate in them. Since then the
Prophet saw this, he makes here a bold beginning, and addresses not only his own
nation, for whom he was appointed a Teacher; but he speaks to the whole
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For what purpose does he say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, all ye
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
not certainly his object to proclaim indiscriminately to all the truth of God
for the same end: but he summons here all nations as witnesses or judges, that
the Jews might understand that their impiety would be made evident to all,
except they repented, and that there was no reason for them to hope that they
could conceal their baseness, for God would expose their hidden crimes as it
were on an open stage. We hence see how emphatical are the words, when the
Prophet calls on all nations and would have them to be witnesses of the judgment
which God had resolved to bring on his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let also the earth give ear
and its fullness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We may take the earth,
by metonymy, for its inhabitants; but as it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and its
fullness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the Prophet, I doubt not, meant here
to address the very earth itself, though it be without reason. He means that so
dreadful would be the judgment of God, as to shake created things which are void
of sense; and thus he more severely upbraids the Jews with their stupor, that
they heedlessly neglected the word of God, which yet would shake all the
elements by its power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then immediately turns his discourse to the Jews:
after having erected God&#8217;s tribunal and summoned all the nations, that
they might form as it were a circle of a solemn company, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There will be for me the Lord
Jehovah against you for a witness &#8212; the Lord from the temple of his
holiness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By saying that God would be as a
witness for him, he not only affirms that he was sent by God, but being as it
were inflamed with zeal, he appeals here to God, and desires him to be present,
that the wickedness and obstinacy of the people might not be unpunished; as
though he said, &#8220;Let God, whose minister I am, be with me, and punish your
impiety; let him prove that he is the author of this doctrine, which I declare
from his mouth and by his command; let him not suffer you to escape unpunished,
if ye do not repent.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet, when
he says that God would be for him a witness; as though he had said, that there
was no room here to trifle; for if the Jews thought to elude God&#8217;s
judgment they greatly deceived themselves; inasmuch as when he has given a
command to his servants to treat with his people, he is at the same time present
as a judge, and will not suffer his word to be rejected without immediately
undertaking his own cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is this addition superfluous,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord from the temple of his
holiness:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for we know how thoughtlessly the
Jews were wont to boast that God dwelt in the midst of them. And this
presumption so blinded them that they despised all the Prophets; for they
thought it unlawful that any thing should be said to their disgrace, because
they were the holy people of God, his holy heritage and chosen nation. Inasmuch
then as the Lord had adopted them, they falsely boasted of his favors. Since
then the Prophet knew that the people insolently gloried in those privileges,
with which they had been honored by God, he now declares that God would be the
avenger of impiety from his temple; as though he said, Ye boast that God is
bound to you, and that he has so bound up his faith to you as to render his name
to you a sport: he indeed dwells in his temple; but from thence he will manifest
himself as an avenger, as he sees that you are perverse in your wickedness. We
hence see that the Prophet beats down that foolish arrogance, by which the Jews
were inflated; yea, he turns back on their own heads what they were wont
boastingly to bring forward. After having made this introduction, to awaken
slumbering men with as much vehemence as he could, he subjoins

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues the same subject; and he dwells
especially on this &#8212; that God would be a witness against his people from
his sanctuary. He therefore confirms this, when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God would come from his
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some interpreters do at the same
time take this view &#8212; that the temple would hereafter be deprived of
God&#8217;s presence, and would hence become profane, according to what Ezekiel
declares. For as the Jews imagined that God was connected with them as long as
the temple stood, and this false imagination proved to them an allurement, as it
were, to sin, as on this account they took to themselves greater liberty,
&#8212; this was the reason why the Prophet Ezekiel declares that God was no
longer in the temple; and the Lord had shown to him by a vision that he had left
his temple, so that he would no longer dwell there. Some, as I have said, give a
similar explanation of this passage; but this sense does not seem to suit the
context. I therefore take another view of this sentence &#8212; that God would
go forth from his place. But yet it is doubted what place the Prophet refers to:
for many take it to be heaven, and this seems probable, for immediately after he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Descend shall God, and he
will tread on the high places of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This descent seems indeed to
point out a higher place: but as the temple, we know, was situated on a high and
elevated spot, on mount Zion, there is nothing inconsistent in saying that God
descended from his temple to chastise the whole of Judea as it deserved. Then
the going forth of God is by no means ambiguous in its meaning, for he means
that God would at length go forth, as it were, in a visible form. With regard
then to the place, I am inclined to refer it to the temple; and this clause, I
have no doubt, has proceeded from the last verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why is going forth here ascribed to God? Because
the Jews had abused the forbearance of God in worshipping him with vain
ceremonies in the temple; and at the same time they thought that they had
escaped from his hand. As long then as God spared them, they thought that he
was, as it were, bound to them, because he dwelt among them. Besides, as the
legal and shadowy worship prevailed among them, they imagined that God rested in
their temple. But now the Prophet says, &#8220;He will go forth: ye have wished
hitherto to confine God to the tabernacle, and ye have attempted to pacify him
with your frivolous puerilities: but ye shall know that his hand and his power
extend much farther: he shall therefore come and show what that majesty is which
has been hitherto a derision to you.&#8221; For when hypocrites set to sale
their ceremonies to God, do they not openly trifle with him, as though he were a
child? and do they not thus rob him of his power and authority? Such was the
senselessness of that people. The Prophet therefore does not say without reason
that God would go forth, that he might prove to the Jews that they were deluded
by their own vain imaginations, when they thus took away from God what
necessarily belonged to him, and confined him to a corner in Judea and fixed him
there, as though he rested and dwelt there like a dead idol.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The particle, <i>Behold,</i> is emphatical: for the
Prophet intended here to shake off from the Jews their torpidity, inasmuch as
nothing was more difficult to them than to be persuaded and to believe that
punishment was nigh at hand, when they flattered themselves that God was
propitious to them. Hence that they might no longer cherish this willfulness, he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, come shall the
Lord, forth shall he go from his place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Isaiah has a passage like this in an address to the people, Isaiah 26; but the
object of it is different; for Isaiah intended to threaten the enemies of the
Church and heathen nations: but here Micah denounces war on the chosen people,
and shows that God thus dwelt in his temple, that the Jews might perceive that
his hand was opposed to them, as they had so shamefully despised him, and, by
their false imaginations reduced, as it were, to nothing his
power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall tread, he says, on the
high places of the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the high places of
the earth I do not understand superstitious places, but those well fortified. We
know that fortresses were then fixed, for the most part, on elevated situations.
The Prophet then intimates, that there would be no place into which God&#8217;s
vengeance would not penetrate, however well fortified it might be: &#8220;No
enclosures,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall hinder God from penetrating into the
inmost parts of your fortresses; he shall tread on the high places of the
earth.&#8221; At the same time, I doubt not but that he alludes, by this kind of
metaphor, to the chief men, who thought themselves exempted from the common lot
of mankind; for they excelled so much in power, riches, and authority, that they
would not be classed with the common people. The Prophet then intimates, that
those, who were become proud through a notion of their own superiority would not
be exempt from punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he afterwards adds, that this going forth of God
would be terrible, <i>Melt,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the mountains under
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It hence appears, that the Prophet
did not speak in the last verse of the departure of God, as though he was going
to forsake his own temple, but that he, on the contrary, described his going
forth from the temple, that he might ascend his tribunal and execute punishment
on the whole people, and thus, in reality, prove that he would be a judge,
because he had been very daringly despised. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Melt shall the mountains under
him, the valleys shall be rent, or cleave, as wax before the fire, as waters
rolling into a lower place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophets do not often describe God in a manner so awful; but this representation
is to be referred to the circumstance of this passage, for he sets forth God
here as the judge of the people: it was therefore necessary that he should be
exhibited as furnished and armed with powers that he might stake such vengeance
on the Jews as they deserved. And other similar passages we shall hereafter meet
with, and like to those which we found in Hosea. God then is said to melt the
mountains, and he is said to strike the valleys with such terror that they
cleave under him; in short, he is said so to terrify all elements, that the very
mountains, however stony they may be, melt like wax or like waters which flow,
&#8212; because he could not otherwise produce a real impression on a people so
obstinate, and who, as it has been said, so flattered themselves even in their
vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may further easily learn what application to make
of this truth in our day. We find the Papists boasting of the title Church, and,
in a manner, with vain confidence, binding God to themselves, because they have
baptism, though they have adulterated it with their superstitions; and then,
they think that they have Christ, because they still retain the name of a
Church. Had the Lord promised that his dwelling would be at Rome, we yet see how
foolish and frivolous would be such boasting: for though the temple was at
Jerusalem, yet the Lord went forth thence to punish the sins of the people, yea,
even of the chosen people. We further know, that it is folly to bind God now to
one place, for it is his will that his name should be celebrated without any
difference through the whole world. Wheresoever, then, the voice of the Gospel
sounds, God would have us to know that he is present there. What the Papists
then proudly boast of &#8212; that Christ is joined to them &#8212; will turn
out to their own condemnation; &#8212; why so? Because the Lord will prove that
he is the avenger of so impious and shameful a profanation, as they not only
presumptuously lay claim to his name, but also tear it in pieces, and
contaminate it with their sacrilegious abominations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, since God is said to melt the mountains with
his presence, let us hence learn to rouse up all our feelings whenever God comes
forth not that we may flee to a distance from him, but that we may reverently
receive his word, so that he may afterwards appear to us a kind and reconciled
Father. For when we become humble, and the pride and height of our flesh is
subdued, he then immediately receives us, as it were, into his gentle bosom, and
gives us an easy access to him, yea, he invites us to himself with all possible
kindness. That the Lord then may thus kindly receive us, let us learn to fear as
soon as he utters his voice: but let not this fear make us to flee away but only
humble us, so that we may render true obedience to the word of the Lord. It
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet teaches, in this verse, that God is not
angry for nothing; though when he appears rigid, men expostulate with him, and
clamor as though he were cruel. That men may, therefore, acknowledge that God is
a just judge, and that he never exceeds moderation in punishments, the Prophet
here distinctly states that there was a just cause, why God denounced so
dreadful a judgment on his chosen people, &#8212; even because not only a part
of the people, but the whole body had, through their impiety, fallen away; for
by the house of Jacob, and by the house of Israel, he means that impiety had
everywhere prevailed, so that no part was untainted. The meaning then is,
&#8212; that the contagion of sin had spread through all Israel, that no portion
of the country was free from iniquity, that no corner of the land could bring an
excuse for its defection; the Lord therefore shows that he would be the judge of
them all, and would spare neither small nor great.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s object in
this verse: As he had before taught how dreadful would be God&#8217;s vengeance
against all the ungodly, so now he mentions their crimes, that they might not
complain that they were unjustly treated, or that God employed too much
severity. The Prophet then testifies that the punishment, then near at hand,
would be just.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is the wickedness of
Jacob?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, no doubt, indirectly
reproves here the hypocrisy which ruled dominant among the people. For he asks
not for his own satisfaction or in his own person; but, on the contrary, he
relates, by way of imitation,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mimhtikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8212; <i>imitatively</i>) what he knew to be ever on their lips, &#8220;Oh!
what sort of thing is this sin? Why! thou assumest here a false principle,
&#8212; that we are wicked men, ungodly and perfidious: thou does us a grievous
wrong.&#8221; Inasmuch, then, as hypocrites thought themselves pure, having
wiped, as it were, their mouths, whenever they eluded reproofs by their
sophistries, the Prophet borrows a question, as it were, from their own lips,
&#8220;Of what kind is this wickedness? Of what sort is that
transgression?&#8221; As though he said, &#8220;I know what ye are wont to do,
when any one of the Prophets severely reproves you; ye instantly contend with
him, and are ready with your objections: but what do you gain? If you wish to
know what your wickedness is, it is Samaria; and where your high places are,
they are at Jerusalem.&#8221; It is the same as if he had said, &#8220;I do not
here contend with the common people, but I attack the first men: my contest then
is with the princes themselves, who surpass others in dignity, and are,
therefore, unwilling to be touched.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it sometimes happens that the common people
become degenerated, while some integrity remains among the higher orders: but
the Prophet shows that the diseases among the people belonged to the principal
men; and hence he names the two chief cities, Jerusalem and Samaria, as he had
said before, in the first verse, that he proclaimed predictions against these:
and yet it is certain, that the punishment was to be in common to the whole
people. But as they thought that Jerusalem and Samaria would be safe, though the
whole country were destroyed, the Prophet threatens them by name: for, relying
first on their strength, they thought themselves unassailable; and then, the
eyes of nearly all, we know, were dazzled with empty splendor, powers and
dignity: thus the ungodly wholly forget that they are men, and what they owe to
God, when elevated in the world. So great an arrogance could not be subdued,
except by sharp and severe words, such as the Prophet, as we see, here employs.
He then says, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wickedness
of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
the fountain of all iniquities was the royal city, which yet ought to have ruled
the whole land with wisdom and justice: but what any more remains, when kings
and their counselors tread under foot all regard for what is just and right, and
having cast away every shame, rise up in rebellion against God and men? When
therefore kings thus fall from their dignity, an awful ruin must
follow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Prophet says that the
wickedness of Israel was Samaria, that thence arose all iniquities. But we must
at the same time bear in mind, that the Prophet speaks not here of gross crimes;
but, on the contrary, he directs his reproof against ungodly and perverted forms
of worship; and this appears more evident from the second clause, in which he
mentions transgressions in connection with the high places. We hence see, that
all sins in general are not here reproved, but their vicious modes of worship,
by which religion had been polluted among the Jews as well as the Israelites.
But it might seem very unjust, that the Prophet should charge with sin those
forms of worship in which the Jews laboriously exercised themselves with the
object of pacifying God. But we see how God regards as nothing whatever men
blend with his worship out of their own heads. And this is our principal contest
at this day with the Papists; we call their perverted and spurious modes of
worship abominations: they think that what is heavenly is to be blended with
what is earthly. We diligently labor, they say, for this end &#8212; that God
may be worshipped. True; but, at the same time, ye profane his worship by your
inventions; and it is therefore an abomination. We now then see how foolish and
frivolous are those delusions, when men follow their own wisdom in the duty of
worshipping God: for the Prophet here, in the name of God, fulminates, as it
were, from heaven against all superstitions, and shows that no sin is more
detestable, than that preposterous caprice with which idolaters are inflamed,
when they observe such forms of worship as they have themselves
invented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now with regard to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>high
places</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> we must notice, that there was a
great difference between the Jews and the Israelites at that time as to
idolatry. The Israelites had so fallen, that they were altogether degenerated;
nothing could be seen among them that had an affinity to the true and legitimate
worship of God: but the Jews had retained some form of religion, they had not
thus abandoned themselves; but yet they had a mixture of superstitions; such as
one would find, were he to compare the gross Popery of this day with that middle
course which those men invent, who seem to themselves to be very wise, fearing,
forsooth, as they do, the offenses of the world; and hence they form for us a
mixture, I know not what, from the superstitions of the Papacy and from the
Reformation, as they call it. Something like this was the mixture at Jerusalem.
We however see, that the Prophet pronounces the same sentence against the Jews
and the Israelites and that is, that God will allow nothing that proceeds from
the inventions of men to be joined to his word. Since then God allows no such
mixtures, the Prophet here says that there was no less sin on the high places of
Judea, than there was in those filthy abominations which were then dominant
among the people of Israel. But the remainder we must defer until
to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Though Micah intended especially to devote his
services to the Jews, as we have said yesterday, he yet, in the first place,
passes judgment on Samaria; for it was his purpose afterwards to speak more
fully against Jerusalem and the whole of Judea. And this state of the case ought
to be borne in mind; for the Prophet does not begin with the Israelites, because
he directs his discourse peculiarly to them; but his purpose was briefly to
reprove them, and then to address more especially his own people, for it was for
this purpose that he was called. Now, as he threatens destruction to Samaria and
the whole kingdom of Israel on account of their corrupted forms of worship, we
may hence learn how displeasing to God is superstition, and that he regards
nothing so much as the true worship of his name. There is no reason here for men
to advance this position &#8212; that they do not designedly sin; for God shows
how he is to be worshipped by us. Whenever, then, we deviate in any thing from
the rule which he has prescribed, we manifest, in that particular, our rebellion
and obstinacy. Hence the superstitious ever act like fools with regard to God,
for they will not submit to his word, so as to be thereby alone made
wise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set Samaria as an heap of
the field,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, such shall be the ruins
that they shall differ nothing from the heaps of the fields: for husband men, we
know, when they find stones in their fields, throw them into some corner, that
they may not be in the way of the slough. Like such heaps then, as are seen in
the fields, Samaria would be, according to what God declared. He then says, that
the place would be empty, so that <i>vines</i> would be <i>planted </i>there;
and, in the third place, that its <i>stones </i>would be <i>scattered
</i>through the <i>valley;</i> as when one casts stones where there is a wide
plain, they run and roll far and wide; so would be the scattering of Samaria
according to what the Prophet says, it was to be like the rolling of stones in a
wide field. He adds, in the fourth place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will uncover her
foundations,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, I will entirely demolish
it, so that a stone, as Christ says, may not remain on a stone,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:2.) We now perceive the import of the words; and we also perceive that the
reason why the Prophet denounces on Samaria so severe a judgment was, because it
had corrupted the legitimate worship of God with its own inventions; for it had
devised, as we well know, many idols, so that the whole authority of the law had
been abolished among the Israelites. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on with the same subject, and says,
that the ruin of Samaria was at hand, so that its idols would be broken, and
also, that its wealth would be destroyed which she had gathered by illegitimate
means, and which she thought to be the reward of her idolatry. But God mentions
idols here expressly by his Prophet, in order to confirm what we noticed
yesterday &#8212; that the cause of vengeance was, because Samaria had abandoned
itself to ungodly forms of worship, and had departed from the Law. That the
Israelites might then understand the cause for which God would so severely
punish them, the Prophet here makes express mention of their graven images and
idols. God is not indeed angry with stones and wood; but he observes the abuse
and the perversion of them, when men pollute themselves by wickedly worshipping
such things. This is the reason why God says here that the graven images of
Samaria would be broken in pieces, and that its idols would be
destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the <i>wages,</i> the Prophet no doubt
designed to stamp with disgrace all the wealth of Samaria.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;nta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>atanen,</i> is properly a gift or a present. But as he twice repeats it, and
says, that what Samaria possessed was the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reward of an
harlot</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and then, that it would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return to the
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of an
harlot,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he, in the first place, I have no
doubt, upbraids the Israelites, because they, after the manner of harlots and
strumpets, had heaped together their great riches: and this was done by
Jeroboam, who constructed a new form of worship, in order to secure his own
kingdom. The Israelites then began to flourish; and we also know how wealthy
that kingdom became, and how proud they were on account of their riches. As,
then, the Israelites despised the kingdom of Judah, and thought themselves in
every way happy, and as they ascribed all this, as we have seen in Hosea, to
their superstitions, Micah speaks here according to their view of things, when
he says, Idolatry has been gainful to you, this splendor dazzles your eyes; but
your rewards I have already doomed to the burning: they shall then be burnt, and
thus perish. Hosea also, as we have seen, made use of the same comparison,
&#8212; that the children of Israel felicitated themselves in their impiety,
like a harlot, who, while she gains many presents from those who admire her
beauty, seems not conscious of her turpitude and baseness: such were the
Israelites. The Prophets therefore does not say, without reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, your rewards, by burning,
shall perish,</i> </font><font face="Palatino">or, be consumed with fire. Why
so? Because ye have gathered them, he says, from the reward of an harlot, and
all this shall return to the reward of an harlot.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This last clause ought to be restricted to the gifts
or wealth of Samaria; for it cannot properly be applied to idols or graven
images. The import of the whole then is that God would be the avenger of
idolatry with regard to the city of Samaria and the whole kingdom of Israel.
Besides, as the Israelites boasted that their ungodly forms of worship turned
out to their happiness and prosperity, God declares that the whole of this
success would be evanescent, like that of the harlot, who amasses great wealth,
which soon vanishes away: and we see that thus it commonly
happens.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some explain the passage thus, &#8212; that the
gifts, with which the Israelites adorned their temples, would return to be the
reward of an harlot, that is, would he transferred to Chaldea, and that the
Babylonians would, in their turn, adorn with them their idols. But this view is
not suitable to the place; for the Prophet does not say that what Samaria had
gathered would be a prey or a spoil to enemies but that it would perish by fire.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
speaks therefore, proverbially when he says that the produce, from the reward of
an harlot, would return to be the reward of an harlot, that is, that it would
become nothing; for the Lord sets a curse on such riches as strumpets gain by
their baseness, while they prostitute themselves. Since, then, the whole of such
wealth is under the curse of God, it must necessarily soon pass away like smoke:
and this, in my view, is the real meaning of the Prophet. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here assumes the character of a mourner,
that he might more deeply impress the Israelites; for we have seen that they
were almost insensible in their torpidity. It was therefore necessary that they
should be brought to view the scene itself, that, seeing their destruction
before their eyes they might be touched both with grief and fear. Lamentations
of this kind are everywhere to be met with in the Prophets, and they ought to be
carefully noticed; for we hence gather how great was the torpor of men, inasmuch
as it was necessary to awaken them, by this form of speech, in order to convince
them that they had to do with God: they would have otherwise continued to
flatter themselves with delusions. Though indeed the Prophet here addresses the
Israelites, we ought yet to apply this to ourselves; for we are not much unlike
the ancient people: for however God may terrify us with dreadful threatening, we
still remain quiet in our filth. It is therefore needful that we should be
severely treated, for we are almost void of feeling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophets sometimes assumed mourning, and
sometimes they were touched with real grief: for when they spoke of aliens and
also of the enemies of the Church, they introduce these lamentations. When a
mention is made of Babylon or of Egypt, they sometimes say, <i>Behold, I will
mourn, and my bowels shall be as a timbrel</i>. The Prophets did not then really
grieve; but, as I have said, they transferred to themselves the sorrows of
others, and ever with this object, that they might persuade men that God&#8217;s
threatenings were not vain, and that God did not trifle with men when he
declared that he was angry with them. But when the discourse was respecting the
Church and the faithful, then the Prophets did not put on grief. The
representation here is then to be taken in such a way as that we may understand
that the Prophet was in real mourning, when he saw that a dreadful ruin was
impending over the whole kingdom of Israel. For though they had perfidiously
departed from the Law, they were yet a part of the holy race, they were the
children of Abraham, whom God had received into favor. The Prophet, therefore,
could not refrain from mourning unfeignedly for them. And the Prophet does here
these two things, &#8212; he shows the fraternal love which he entertained for
the children of Israel, as they were his kindred, and a part of the chosen
people, &#8212; and he also discharges his own duty; for this lamentation was,
as it were, the mirror in which he sets before them the vengeance of God towards
men so extremely torpid. He therefore exhibits to them this representation, that
they might perceive that God was by no means trifling with men, when he thus
denounced punishment on the wicked and such as were apostates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, he speaks not of a common lamentation, but
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will wail and

not like that of men, but like the wailing of dragons: I will mourn, he says, as
the ostriches are wont to do. In short, the Prophet by these forms of speech
intimates, that the coming evil would by no means be of an ordinary kind: for if
he adopted the usual manner of men, he could not have set forth the dreadfulness
of God&#8217;s vengeance that was impending.</font><br></div>

says first, to Judah, speaking of the land; and then he confines it to the
cities; for when the gates are closed up against enemies, they are forced to
stop. But the Prophet says, that the cities would be no hindrance to the enemies
to approach the very gates and even the chief city of Judah, that is, Jerusalem;
and this, we know, was fulfilled. It is the same then as though he said that the
whole kingdom of Israel would be so laid waste, that their enemies would not he
content with victory, but would proceed farther and besiege the holy city: and
this Sennacherib did. For after having subverted the kingdom of Israel, as
though it was not enough to draw the ten tribes into exile, he resolved to take
possession of the kingdom of Judah; and Jerusalem, as Isaiah says, was left as a
tent. We hence see that the threatening of the Prophet Micah were not in vain.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems here to be inconsistent with
himself: for he first describes the calamity that was to be evident to all; but
now he commands silence, lest the report should reach the enemies. But there is
here nothing contradictory; for the evil itself could not be hid, since the
whole kingdom of Israel would be desolated, the cities demolished or burnt, the
whole country spoiled and laid waste, and then the enemies would enter the
borders of Judah: and when Jerusalem should have been nearly taken how could it
have been concealed? No, this could not have been. There is no wonder then that
the Prophet had referred here to a solemn mourning. But he now speaks of the
feeling of those who were desirous of hiding their own disgrace, especially from
their enemies and aliens: for it is an indignity which greatly vexes us, when
enemies taunt us, and upbraid us in our misfortunes; when no hope remains, we at
least wish to perish in secret, so that no reproach and disgrace should
accompany our death; for dishonor is often harder to be borne, and wounds us
more grievously, than any other evil. The Prophet then means that the Israelites
would not only be miserable, but would also be subject to the reproaches and
taunts of their enemies. We indeed know that the Philistine were inveterate in
their hatred to the people of God; and we know that they ever took occasion to
upbraid them with their evils and calamities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the meaning of the Prophet, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In Gath declare it not, by
weeping weep not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said,
&#8220;Though extreme evils shall come upon you, yet seek to perish in silence;
for you will find that your enemies will gape for the opportunity to cut you
with their taunts, when they shall see you thus miserable. He then forbids the
people&#8217;s calamities to be told in Gath; for the Philistine usually desired
nothing more than the opportunity to torment the people of God with
reproaches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the house of Aphrah, in
dust roll thyself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is here an
alliteration which cannot be conveyed in Latin: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrp[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ophre,</i> means dusty, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rp[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>opher,</i> is dust. That city attained its name from its situation, because
the country where it was, was full of dust; as if a city were called Lutosa,
muddy or full of clay; and indeed many think that Lutetia (Paris) had hence
derived its name. And he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Roll thyself in dust, in the
house full of dust;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though he had said that
the name would be now most suitable, for the ruin of the city would constrain
all neighboring cities to be in mourning to cast themselves in the dust; So
great would be the extremity of their evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must ever bear in mind the object of the
Prophet: for he here rouses the Israelites as it were with the sharpest goads,
who entertained no just idea of the dreadfulness of God&#8217;s vengeance, but
were ever deaf to all threatening. The Prophet then shows that the execution of
this vengeance which he denounced was ready at hand; and he himself not only
mourned, but called others also to mourning. He speaks of the whole country, as
we shall see by what follows. I shall quickly run over the whole of this
chapter; for there is no need of long explanation, as you will
find.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here addresses the cities which were on
the borders of the kingdom of Israel, and through which the enemy would pass in
entering the kingdom of Judah. He therefore bids the inhabitants of the city
Saphir to pass over, and says, that the city would be ashamed or in a shameful
manner naked. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryp&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,

the Lord will discover thy shame, so that thy nakedness shall be a shame to all,
and the greatest disgrace to thyself.&#8221; There is a correspondence in the
words, though not an alliteration. Hence the Prophet says, that though the city
was called splendid, it would yet be deformed, so that no one would deign to
look on it, at least without feeling shame. There is the same correspondence in
the word Zaanan; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[x</font><font face="Palatino">,

Beth-Aezel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, he will remain
quiet at home: this he will do contrary to what will be natural; for whence is
the name of the city? even from removing, for it was a place of much traffic.
But he will remain, he says, at home: though he may see his neighbors dragged
into exile, he will not dare to move from his place.</font><br></div>

<i>omad,</i> means to stand; nor is there a doubt but that when the Prophet
says, He will take from you his standing, he speaks of the standing or station
of the enemy: but interpreters however vary here. Some understand, that when the
enemy had continued long in the land, they would not depart before they
possessed the supreme power; as though he said, &#8220;Ye will think that your
enemy can be wearied out with delay and tediousness, when not able soon to
conquer your cities: this, he says, will not be the case; for he will resolutely
persevere, and his expectation will not disappoint him; for he will receive the
reward of his station, that is, of his delay.&#8221; But some say, He will
receive his station from you. They explain the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jql</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lakech,</i> metaphorically, as meaning to receive instruction from hand to
hand; as though the Prophet had said, Some, that is, your neighbors, will learn
their own position from you. What does this mean? Zaanan will not go forth on
account of the mourning of its neighboring city Aezel: others will afterwards
follow this example. How so? For Zaanan will be, as it were, the teacher to
other cities; as it will not dare to show any sign of grief for its neighbors,
being not able to succor them; so also, when it shall be taken in its turn into
exile, that is, its citizens and inhabitants, its neighbors will remain quiet,
as though the condition of the miserable city was no object of their care. They
shall then learn from you their standing; that is, Ye will remain quiet and
still, when your neighbors will be destroyed; the same thing will afterwards
happen to you. But as this bears but little on the main subjects we may take
either of these views.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet joins here another city even Maroth, and

would be in sorrow for a lost good. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chul,</i> means to grieve; and it has this sense here; for the Marothites,
that is, the inhabitants of that city, would have to grieve for losing their
property and their former happy condition. But as the verb means also to expect,
some approve of a different exposition, that is, &#8212; that the inhabitants of
the city Maroth would in vain depend on an empty and fallacious expectation, for
they were doomed to utter destruction. In vain then will the inhabitant of
Maroth expect or entertain hope; for<i>

the chief city, and its siege was raised through the intervention of an angel,
when a dreadful slaughter, as sacred history records, took place; yet the city
Maroth was not then able to escape vengeance. We now see the reason why this
circumstance was added. Some give a harsher explanation, &#8212; that the
citizens of Maroth were to be debilitated, or, as it were, demented. As this
metaphor is too strained, I embrace the other, &#8212; that the citizens of

the people of Israel. That the Jews then, as well as the Israelites might know,
that they had to do, not with men only, but also with God, the celestial Judge,
the Prophet distinctly expresses that all this would proceed from Jehovah. He

<div><font face="Palatino">By bidding the citizens of Lachish to tie their

&#8220;of flight, and of the quickest flight.&#8221; The word

<div><font face="Palatino">And he then subjoins that that city had been the
beginning of sin to the Jews; for though he names here the daughter of Zion, he

collect from the next clauses, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were found the transgressions

no doubt, the first who had embraced the corruptions of Jeroboam, and had thus
departed from the pure worship of God. When, therefore, contagion had entered
that city, it crept, by degrees, into neighboring places, until at length, as we
find, the whole kingdom of Judah had become corrupt: and this is what the
Prophet repeats more fully in other places. It was not then without reason that
he denounces desolation here on the citizens of Lachish; for they had been the
authors of sin to their own kindred. However alienated the ten tribes had become
from pure faith and pure worship, the kingdom of Judah remained still upright,
until Lachish opened the door to ungodly superstitions; and then its
superstitions spread through the whole of Judea. She therefore suffered the
punishment which she deserved, when she was drawn away into distant exile, or,
at least, when she could not otherwise escape from danger, than by fleeing into
some fear country, and that very swiftly.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet alludes to another thing, &#8212;
that they would attempt to pacify their enemies with gifts, and would try to
redeem themselves and their neighbors. But the Prophet expressly mentions this,
that the event might teach them that nothing happens without a design; for it
ought to work a greater conviction in blind and obstinate men, when they see
that they really find that to be true which had been long before predicted.
This, then, is the reason why the Prophet enumerates here various particulars;
it was, that the hand of God might be more evident and conspicuous when he would
begin, in an especial manner, to fulfill all the things which he now in words
foretells,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>

<i>Aczib</i>, for a lie,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bzkal</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>laaczeb</i>; that is Thou wilt send gifts to the sons of a lie, for a lie.
The city had obtained its name from its fallacies or guiles. And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a lie to the kings of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> because it profited the children
of Israel nothing to pacify them with gifts or to attempt to draw them to their
side, as they hired the services of one another. So then he says, that they
would be for a lie to the kings of Israel, for they would gain nothing by having
many auxiliaries. Some take the words actively, &#8212; that the kings of Israel
had first deceived the citizens of Achzib: but this view is less probable; I am
therefore disposed to adopt the other, &#8212; that though the citizens of
Lachish tried to conciliate their neighbors with a great sum of money,
especially the people of Achzib, this would be yet to no purpose; for it would
be a lie to the people of Israel: or, it may be, that the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning is this, &#8212; that the citizens of Achzib had already wished to bring
aid, but in vain to the kings of Israel; for Lachish was one of the first cities
which the Assyrians conquered; but it was within the kingdom of Judah, or on its
borders. It is then probable that the kings of Israel had recourse to the aid of
this people, and were not assisted. Now, as the citizens of Lachish also
endeavored to extricate themselves from the hand of their enemies by such aid,
the prophet derides such a folly, inasmuch as they did not become wise by
experience, having seen with their own eyes, that such an help had been useless
and deceptive to the kings of Israel: they ought then to have tried some other
means rather than to expose themselves to the same deceptions.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here threatens his own birth place, as he
had done other cities; for, as we have stated, he sprung from this city. He does
not now spare his own kindred: for as God is no respecter of persons, so also
God&#8217;s servants ought, as with closed eyes, to deal impartially with all,
so as not to be turned here and there either by favor or by hatred, but to
follows without any change, whatever the Lord commands them. We see that Micah
was endued with this spirit, for he reproved his own kindred, as he had hitherto
reproved others.</font><br></div>

tribe of Judah, as it is well known. But some would have &#8220;enemy&#8221; to

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwbk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cabud,</i> in the genitive case: The enemy of the glory of Israel shall come
to Adullam; but this is strained. Others understand the passage thus that the
glory of Israel would come to disgrace; for Adullam, we know, was a cave. Since
then it an obscure place, the Prophet here, as they think, declares that the
whole glory of Israel would be covered with dishonor, because the dignity and
wealth, in which they gloried would lose their pristine fixate, so that they
would differ nothing from an ignoble cave. If any approve of this meaning, I
will not oppose them. Yet others think that the Prophet speaks ironically and
that the Assyrian is thus called because the whole glory and dignity of Israel
would by him be taken away. But there is no need of confining this to enemies;
we may then take a simpler view, and yet regard the expression as ironical,
&#8212; that the glory, that is, the disgrace or the devastation of Israel,
would come to Adullam. But what if we read it, in apposition, He shall come to
Adullam, the glory of Israel? For Adullam was not obscure, as those interpreters
imagine, whom I have mentioned, but it is named among the most celebrated cities
after the return and restoration of the people. When, therefore, the whole
country was laid waste, this city, with a few others, remained, as we read in
the Nehemiah 11. It might then be, that the Prophet called Adullam the glory of
Israel; for it was situated in a safe place, and the inhabitants thought that
they were fortified by a strong defense, and thus were not open to the violence
of enemies. This meaning also may be probable; but still, as the glory of Israel
may be taken ironically for calamity or reproach if any one approves more of
this interpretation, it may be followed. I am, however, inclined to another,
&#8212; that the Prophet say, that the enemy would come to Adullam, which was
the glory of Israel, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because
that city was as it were in the recesses of Judea, so that an access to it by
enemies was difficult. It may be also that some may think, that the recollection
of its ancient history is here revived; for David concealed himself in its cave,
and had it as his fortress. The place no doubt had, from that time, attained
some fame; then this celebrity, as I have said, may be alluded to, when Adullam
is said to be the glory of Israel. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

shows here that they had very long abused the patience of God, while they each
immersed themselves in their delicacies. Now, he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet does not here speak only against the
Israelites, as some think, who have incorrectly confined this part of his
teaching to the ten tribes; but he, on the contrary, (in discharging his office,
addresses also the Jews. He refers not here to idolatry, as in the last chapter;
but inveighs against sins condemned in the second table. As then the Jews had
not only polluted the worship of God, but also gave loose reins to many
iniquities, so that they dealt wrongfully with their neighbors, and there was
among them no attention to justice and equity, so the prophet inveighs here as
we shall see, against avarice, robberies, and cruelty: and his discourse is full
of vehemence; for there was no doubt such licentiousness then prevailing among
the people, that there was need of severe and sharp reproofs. It is at the same
time easy to perceive that his discourse is mainly directed against the chief
men, who exercised authority, and turned it to wrong purposes.</font><br></div>

life the character and manners of those who were given to gain, and were intent
only on raising themselves. He says, that in their beds they were meditating on
iniquity, and devising wickedness. Doubtless the time of night has been given to
men entirely for rest; but they ought also to use this kindness of God for the
purpose of restraining themselves from what is wicked: for he who refreshes his
strength by nightly rest, ought to think within himself, that it is an
unbecoming thing and even monstrous, that he should in the meantime devise
frauds, and guiles, and iniquities. For why does the Lord intend that we should
rest, except that all evil things should rest also? Hence the Prophet shows
here, by implication, that those who are intent on devising frauds, while they
ought to rest, subvert as it were the course of nature; for they have no regard
for that rest, which has been granted to men for this end, &#8212; that they may
not trouble and annoy one another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards shows how great was their desire to do
mischief, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When it shines in the
morning, he says, they execute it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He
might have said only, They do in the daytime what they contrive in the night:
but he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that
they were so heated by avarice, that they rested not a moment; as soon as it
shone, they were immediately ready to perpetrate the frauds they had thought of
in the night. We now then apprehend the import of the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now subjoins,

is their hand: but this does not suit the passage. Others have explained it
thus, For strength is in their hand: and almost all those well-skilled in Hebrew
agree in this explanation. Those who had power, they think, are here pointed out
by the Prophet, &#8212; that as they had strength, they dared to do whatever
they pleased. But the Hebrew phrase is not translated by them; and I greatly
wonder that they have mistaken in a thing so clear: for it is not, There is
power in their hand; but their hand is to power. The same mode of speaking is
found in Proverbs 3, and there also many interpreters are wrong; for Solomon
there forbids us to withhold from our neighbor his right, When thine hand, he
says, is for power; some say, When there is power to help the miserable. But
Solomon means no such thing; for he on the contrary means this, When thine hand
is ready to execute any evil, abstain. So also the Lord says in Deuteronomy
28,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;When the enemy

dead.&#8221; I come now to the present passage, Their hand is for power: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
Prophet means, that they dared to try what they could, and that therefore their
hand was always ready; whenever there was hope of lucre or gains the hand was
immediately prepared. How so? Because they were restrained neither by the fear
of God nor by any regard for justice; but their hand was for power, that is,
what they could, they dared to do. We now then see what the Prophet means as far
as I can judge. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Micah confirms here what is contained in the former
verse; for he sets forth the alacrity with which the avaricious were led to
commit plunder; nay, how unbridled was their cupidity to do evil. As soon as
they have coveted any thing, he says, they take it by force. And hence we
gather, that the Prophet, in the last verse, connected wicked counsels with the
attempt of effecting them; as though he had said, that they indeed carefully
contrived their frauds, but that as they were skillful in their contrivances, so
they were not less bold and daring in executing then.</font><br></div>

we may see, as in a mirror, an example of what is here said. But it behaves us
carefully to consider how greatly displeasing to God are frauds and plunders, so
that each of us may keep himself from doing any wrong, and be so ruled by a
desire of what is right, that every one of us may act in good faith towards his
neighbors, seek nothing that is unjust, and bridle his own desires: and whenever
Satan attempts to allure us, let what is here taught be to us as a bridle to
restrain us. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

is here a striking contrast between God and the Jews, between their wicked
intentions and the intentions of God, which in themselves were not evil, and yet
would bring evil on them. God, he says, thus speaks, Behold, I am purposing; as
though he said, &#8220;While ye are thus busying yourselves on your beds, while
ye are revolving many designs while ye are contriving many artifices, ye think
me to be asleep, ye think that I am all the while meditating nothing; nay, I
have my thoughts too, and those different from yours; for while ye are awake to
devise wickedness I am awake to contrive judgment.&#8221; We now then perceive
the import of these words: it is God that declares that he meditates evil, and
it is not the Prophet that speaks to these avaricious and rapacious men; and the
evil is that of punishment, inasmuch as it is the peculiar office of God to
repay to all what they deserve, and to render to each the measure of evil they
have brought on others.</font><br></div>

promise to themselves impunity, and lay hold on subterfuges, whenever God
threatens them, the Prophet here affirms, that though they sought every escape,
they would yet be held bound by God&#8217;s hand, so that they could not by any
means shake off the burden designed for them. And this was a reward most fully
deserved by those who had withdrawn their necks when God called them to
obedience. They then who refuse to obey God, when he requires from them a
voluntary service, will at length be drawn by force, not to undergo the yoke,
but the burden which will altogether overwhelm them. Whosoever then will not
willingly submit to God&#8217;s yoke, must at length undergo the great and
dreadful burden prepared for the unnamable.</font><br></div>

what I have referred to, &#8212; that they were so elated with pride, that they
despised all threatening and all instruction: and this presumption became the
cause of perverseness; for were it not that a notion of security deceived men,
they would presently bend, when God threatens them. This then is the reason why
the Prophet joins this sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall no more walk in your
height</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, your haughtiness shall
then surely be made to succumb;<i>

those who retain a stir and unbending neck towards God, when he would lay on
them his yoke, shall at length be made by force to yield, however rebellious
they may be. How so? For they shall be broken down, inasmuch as they will not be
corrected. The Prophet then adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

applied to them. The Assyrian then has taken away
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the portion of my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How has he made to
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or has taken away, or removed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> (literally, to <i>me,</i>)<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
restore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8212; though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shibeb,</i> may be from the root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shub</i>, it yet means the same, &#8212; <i>How </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has he taken away from us to
restore our fields he divides,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is,
which he has divided; for the relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher,</i> is understood and there is also a change of time. Now as the
discourse, as I have said, is in broken sentences, there are various
interpretations. I however think that the Prophet simply means this &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How as to restoring has he taken
away our fields, which he hath divided</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?
</i>that is, How far off are we from restitution? for every hope is far removed,
since the Lord himself has divided among strangers our land and possession; or
since the enemies have divided it among themselves; for it is usual after
victory, for every one to seize on his own portion. Whether then this be
understood of the Assyrians, or rather be referred to God, the meaning of the
Prophet seems clearly to be this, &#8212; that the Jews were not only expelled
from their country but that every hope of return was also taken away, since the
enemies had parted among themselves their inheritance, so that they who had been
driven out, now in vain thought of a restitution. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I
read this in the present time; for the Prophet introduces here the Jews as
uttering this lamentation, &#8212; &#8220;It is now all over with us, and there
is no remedy for this evil; for not only are we stripped of all our property and
ejected from our country, but what has been taken away by our enemies cannot be
restored to us, inasmuch as they have already parted our possessions among
themselves, and every one occupies his own portion and his own place, as though
it were his own inheritance. We have therefore to do, not only with the
Assyrians in general, but also with every individual; for what every one now
occupies and possesses he will defend, as his rightful and hereditary
possession.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some conjecture from this verse, that the discourse
belongs rather to the Israelites, who were banished without any hope of return;
but no necessity constrains us to explain this of the Israelites; for the
Prophet does not declare here what God would do, but what would be the calamity
when considered in itself. We have indeed said already in many places, that the
Prophets, while threatening, speak only of calamities, desolations, deaths, and
destructions, but that they afterwards add promises for consolation. But their
teaching is discriminative: when the Prophets intend to terrify hypocrites and
perverse men, they set forth the wrath of God only, and leave no hope; but when
they would inspire with hope those who are by this means humbled, they draw
forth comfort to them even from the goodness of God. What is here said then may
fitly and really be applied to the Jews. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet concludes his discourse respecting
God&#8217;s design to cleanse Judea from its perverse and wicked inhabitants,
that it might no longer be the inheritance of one people. For the land, we know,
had been given to the posterity of Abraham, on the condition, that it was to be
held by them as an heritage: and we also know, that a line was determined by lot
whenever the year of Jubilee returned, that every one might regain his own
possession. The Prophet now testifies that this advantage would be taken away
from the Jews, and that they would hereafter possess the land by no hereditary
right; for God, who had given it, would now take it away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall not then be one to cast
a line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And
he seems here to touch the Jews, by calling them the assembly of Jehovah. He
indeed adopted them, they were the people of God: but he intimates that they
were repudiated, because they had rendered themselves unworthy of his favor. He
therefore, by calling them ironically
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the assembly of
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denies that they rightly retained this

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the conciseness of the expressions has made
interpreters to differ in their views. Some read thus, <i>Distill ye not,
&#8212; they will distill;</i> that is, the Jews speak against the prophets, and
with threats forbid them, as with authority, to address them. The Hebrew word,
distill, means the same as to speak; though at the same time it is applied more
commonly to weighty addresses than to such as are common and ordinary. If any
understands<i>, they will distill,</i> or speak, of the Jews, then the Prophet
points out their arrogance in daring to contend with God&#8217;s prophets, and
in trying to silence and force them to submission. We indeed find that ungodly
men act thus, when they wish to take away the liberty of teaching from
God&#8217;s prophets; for they resist as though they themselves were doubly and
treble prophets. So also in this place, <i>Distill ye not,</i> that is, the Jews
say, Let not the servants of God prophesy. But some think that a relative is
understood, <i>Distill ye not</i> for them who distill; as though he had said,
that ungodly men would not bear God&#8217;s prophets and thus would prevent and
restrain them, as much as they could, from speaking. Others make this
distinction, <i>Distill ye not, &#8212; they shall distill;</i> as though the
Jews said the first, and God the second. Distill ye not, &#8212; this was the
voice of the ungodly and rebellious people, who would cast away from them and
reject every instruction: but God on the other side opposed them and said,
<i>Nay, they shall distill; </i>ye forbid, but it is not in your power; I have
sent them: though ye may rage and glamour a hundred times, it is my will that
they should proceed in their course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how various are the explanations: and
even in the other part of the verse there is no more agreement between
interpreters: <i>They shall not distill;</i> respecting this clause, it is
sufficiently evident, that God here intimates that there would be now an end to
all prophecies. How so? Because he would not render his servants a sport, and
subject them to reproach. This is the true meaning: and yet some take another
view, as though the Prophet continued his sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not
distill</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> lest the people should receive
reproaches; for the ungodly think, that if they close the mouths of the
prophets, all things would be lawful to them, and that their crimes would be
hid, in short, that their vices would not be called to an account; as though
their wickedness was not in itself sufficiently reproachful, were God to send no
prophets, and no reproof given. No doubt, profane men are so stupid as to think
themselves free from every reproach, when God is silent, and when they put away
from themselves every instruction. Hence some think, that this passage is to be
understood in this sense. But I consider the meaning to be that which I have
stated; for he had before said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Distill ye not who
distill;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, Ye prophets, be no longer
troublesome to us; why do you stem our ears? We can no longer bear your
boldness; be then silent. Thus he expressly introduced the Jews as speaking with
authority, as though it was in their power to restrain the prophets from doing
their duty. Now follows, as I think, the answer of God<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not
distill,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that he may not get reproaches: Since
I see that my doctrine is intolerable to you, since I find a loathing so great
and so shameful, I will take away my prophets from you: I will therefore rest,
and be hereafter silent. &#8212; Why? &#8220;Because I effect nothing; nay, I
subject my prophets to reproaches; for they lose their labor in speaking, they
pour forth words which produce no fruit; for ye are altogether irreclaimable.
Nay, as they are reproachfully treated by you, their condition is worse than if
they were covered with all the disgrace of having been criminal. Since then I
subject my prophets to reproach I will not allow them to be thus mocked by you.
They shall therefore give over, they shall prophesy no longer. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Lord could not have threatened the Jews with
any thing worse or more dreadful than with this immunity, &#8212; that they
should no more hear anything which might disturb them: for it is an extreme
curse, when God gives us loose reins, and suffers us, with unbridled liberty, to
rush as it were headlong into evils, as though he had delivered us up to Satan
to be his slaves. Since it is so, let us be assured that it is an awful
threatening, when he says<i>, They shall not distill,</i> lest they should
hereafter become objects of reproach.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now reproves the Israelites with greater
severity, because they attempted to impose a law on God and on his prophets and
would not endure the free course of instruction. He told us in the last verse,
that the Israelites were inflated with so much presumption, that they wished to
make terms with God: &#8220;Let him not prophesy&#8221; they said, as though it
were in the power of man to rule God: and the Prophet now repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is the Spirit of Jehovah
straitened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> as though he said, Ye see
the intent of your presumption, and how far it proceeds; for ye wish to subject
God&#8217;s Spirit to yourselves and to your own pleasure. The prophets
doubtless did not speak of themselves, but by the bidding and command of God.
Since then the prophets were the organs of the Holy Spirit, whosoever attempted
to silence them, usurped to himself an authority over God himself, and in a
manner tried to make captive his Spirit: for what power can belong to the
Spirit, except he be at liberty to reprove the vices of men, and condemn
whatever is opposed to God&#8217;s justice? When this is taken away, there is no
more any jurisdiction left to the Holy Spirit. We now then see what the Prophet
means in this place: he shows how mad a presumption it was in the Israelites to
attempt to impose silence on the prophets, as though they had a right to rule
the Spirit of God, and to force him to submission.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is the Spirit of Jehovah
straitened?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And this mode of speaking ought to
be noticed, for it possesses no ordinary emphasis; inasmuch as the Prophets by
this reproof; recalls the attention of these perverse men to the author of his
teaching; as though he had said, that the wrong was not done to men, that war
was not carried on with them, when instruction is prohibited, but that God is
robbed of his own rights and that his liberty is taken away, so that he is not
allowed to execute his judgment in the world by the power of his
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And farther, the Prophet here ironically reproves the
Israelites, when he says<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O thou who art called the
house of Jacob, is the Spirit of Jehovah reduced to
straits?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For if heathens, who have never
known the teaching of religion, and to whom no heavenly mysteries have been
revealed, had said, that they would have nothing to do with the prophets, it
would have been much more endurable; for what wonder would it be for ignorant
men to repudiate all instruction? But it was monstrous for the Israelites, who
gloried in the name of God, to dare to rise up so rebelliously against the
prophets: they always boasted of their own race, as though they surpassed all
the rest of the world, and were a holy nations separated from all others. Hence
the Prophet says, &#8220;Ye wish to be called the house of Jacob; what is your
excellency and dignity, except that you have been chosen by God to be his
peculiar people? If then you have been habituated to the teaching of God, what
fury and madness it is, that you cannot bear his prophets, but wish to close
their mouths?&#8221; We now then see the point of this irony, when the Prophet
says that they were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called the
house of Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He seems at the same
time to intimate, in an indirect way, that they were a spurious race. As they
were called by other prophets, Amorites and Sodomites: even so in this place the
Prophet says, &#8220;Ye are indeed the house of Jacob, but it is only as to the
name.&#8221; They were in reality so degenerated, that they falsely pretended
the name of the holy patriarch; yea, they falsely and mendaciously boasted of
their descent from holy men, though they were nothing else but as it were rotten
members. Inasmuch then as they had so departed from the religion of Abraham and
of other fathers, the Prophet says, &#8220;Thou art indeed called what thou art
not.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are these his
works?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he brings the Israelites to the
proof, as though he said, How comes it, that the prophets are so troublesome and
grievous to you, except that they sharply reprove you, and denounce on you the
judgment of God? But God is in a manner forced, except he was to change his
nature, to treat you thus sharply and severely. Ye boast that you are his
people, but how do you live? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are
these his works?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, do you lead a life,
and form your conduct according to the law laid down by him? But as your life
does not in any degree correspond with what God requires, it is no wonder that
the prophets handle you so roughly. For God remains the same, ever like himself;
but ye are perfidious, and have wholly repudiated the covenant he has made with
you. Then this asperity, of which ye are wont to complain, ought not to be
deemed unjust to you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are not my words good to him who
walks uprightly?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet more
distinctly shows, why he had before asked, Whether their works were those of the
Lord; for he compares their life with the doctrine, which on account of its
severity displeased them; they said that the words of the prophets were too
rigid. God here answers, that his words were gentle and kind, and therefore
pleasant, that is, to the pious and good; and that hence the fault was in them,
when he treated them less kindly than they wished. The import of the whole then
is, that the word of God, as it brings life and salvation to man, is in its own
nature gracious, and cannot be either bitter, or hard, or grievous to the pious
and the good, for God unfolds in it the riches of his goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that God here repudiates the impious
calumny that was cast on his word; as though he had said, that the complaints
which prevailed among the people were false; for they transferred the blame of
their own wickedness to the word of God. They said that God was too severe: but
God here declares that he was gentle and kind, and that the character of his
word was the same, provided men were tractable, and did not, through their
perverseness, extort from him anything else than what he of himself wished. And
the same thing David means in Psalm 18, when he says that God is perverse with
the perverse: for in that passage he intimates, that he had experienced the
greatest goodness from God, inasmuch as he had rendered himself docile and
obedient to him. On the contrary, he says, God is perverse with the perverse;
that is, when he sees men obstinately resisting and hardening their necks, he
then puts on as it were a new character, and deals perversely with them, that
is, severely, as their stubbornness deserves; as for a hard knot, according to a
common proverb, a hard wedge is necessary. We now then perceive the meaning of
this passage, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s
words are good to those who walk uprightly;</i></font><font face="Palatino">
that is they breathe the sweetest odour, and bring nothing else but true and
real joy: for when can there be complete happiness, except when God embraces us
in the bosom of his love? But the testimony respecting this love is brought to
us by his word. The fault then is in us, and ought to be imputed to us, if the
word of God is not delightful to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some expound this whole passage differently, as
though the Prophet relates here what was usually at that time the boast of the
Israelites. They hence think that it is a narrative in which he represents their
sentiments; (<i>narrationem esse mimiticam;</i>) as though the Prophet
introduced here the ungodly and the rebellious animating one another in their
contempt of God&#8217;s word, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
thou who art called the house of Jacob, is the Spirit of Jehovah
straitened?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hypocrites, we know, are so blind
and intoxicated by a false confidence, that they hesitate not heedlessly to
abuse all the favors of God. As then God had conferred a great excellency on his
people, they thus emboldened one another, &#8212; &#8220;Are we not the children
and posterity of Abraham? What will it avail us to be a holy and chosen race,
and the peculiar people of God, and a royal priesthood, if we are to be thus
unkindly treated? We find that these prophets shamefully reprove us: where is
our dignity, except we show that we have more privileges than other
nations?&#8221; These interpreters therefore think the meaning to be this,
&#8212; that they make a show of their own privileges, that they might with more
liberty reject every instruction, and shake off every yoke. And when it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is the Spirit of God
diminished?</i> </font><font face="Palatino">these interpreters regard this as
meaning, that they were satisfied with the solemn promise of God, and that as
they were a holy race, they now superciliously despised all the prophets,
&#8212; &#8220;Is the Spirit of God dead, who was formerly the interpreter of
the everlasting covenant, which God made with us? Has he not testified that we
should be to him a holy and elect people? Why then do ye now attempt to reduce
to nothing this sacred declaration of the Holy Spirit, which is
inviolable?&#8221; It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are these his
works?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Ye talk of nothing but of threats
and destruction; ye denounce on us numberless calamities: but God is beneficent
and kind in his nature, patient and merciful; and ye represent him to us as a
tyrant; but this view is wholly inconsistent with the nature of God.&#8221; And,
in the last place, God subjoins, as these interpreters think, an exception,
&#8212; &#8220;All these are indeed true, if faithfulness exists among you, and
the authority of my word continues;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for my words are
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> but not to all without any
difference: be upright and sincere, and ye shall find me dealing kindly, gently,
tenderly, and pleasantly with you: then my rigor will cease, which now through
my word so much offends and exasperates you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This meaning may in some measure be admitted; but as
it is hard to be understood, we ought to retain the former, it being more easy
and flowing. There is nothing strained in the view, that the Prophet derides the
foolish arrogance of the people, who thought that they were sheltered by this
privilege, that they were the holy seed of Abraham. The Prophet answers that
this titular superiority did not deprive God of his right, and prevent him to
exercise his power by the Spirit.
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O thou then who art called
the house of Jacob; </i></font><font face="Palatino">but only as far as the
title goes: the Spirit of God is not reduced to straits. But if thou boastest
thyself to be the peculiar people of God, are these thy works the works of God?
Does thy life correspond with what he requires? There is no wonder then that God
chastises you so severely by his word, for there is not in you the spirit of
docility, which allows the exercise of his kindness.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff29</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though the Prophet here upbraids the ancient
people with ingratitude, yet this truth is especially useful to us, which God
declares, when he says that his word is good and sweet to all the godly. Let us
then learn to become submissive to God, and then he will convey to us by his
word nothing but sweetness, nothing but delights; we shall then find nothing
more desirable than to be fed by this spiritual food; and it will ever be a real
joy to us, whenever the Lord will open his mouth to teach us. But when at any
time the word of the Lord goads and wounds, and thus exasperates us, let us know
that it is through our own fault. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As the words of the Prophet are concise, they contain
some obscurity. Hence interpreters differ. First, as to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lymta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>atmul,</i> some think it to be one word, others divide it into
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>at</i> and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mul,</i> which means, over against, opposite; and they regard it of the same
import with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwmm</font><font face="Palatino">,
which immediately follows. But as the repetition would be frigid, the Prophet no
doubt intended that it should be taken here in its proper sense, and its meaning
is yesterday. But this time is not strictly taken by the Hebrews, for they take
yesterday as meaning the past time, even when many years have elapsed. I have
therefore rendered it <i>formerly</i>, which suits this place. There is also
another difference as to the sense of the text, for some think that this
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwmta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>atmul</i>, is to be joined to the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mwq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kumum;</i> but it is rather to be connected with the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ym[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>omi,</i> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people
formerly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is another diversity,
that is, as to the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bywa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>avib</i>, for some apply it to God, and others to the people; that they rose
up or stood one against another. For this verb is explained in two ways: some
view it as a verb neuter, They stand against the enemy; and others render it,
They rise up against the enemy; and this second meaning is most approved, and
harmonizes best with the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will now refer to what I consider to be the real
meaning. The Prophet, in the first place, says, that the people were formerly
under the power and government of God, but that now they were become wholly
alienated from him.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Formerly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as though God now renounced all
friendship with them. &#8220;I have hitherto owned you as my people, but
hereafter I shall have nothing to do with you, for the whole authority of my
word is by you entirely abolished; ye have violated your faith: in short, as you
have destroyed my covenant, ye have ceased to be my people; for whatever favor I
have conferred on you, you have deprived yourselves of it by your wickedness;
and though I have adopted you, yet your wickedness now strips you of this
privilege.&#8221; This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have risen up as against an
enemy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I consider a note of likeness to be here
understood. The Prophet says simply,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against an enemy have they risen
up;</i> </font><font face="Palatino">but I regard the meaning to be, that they
had risen up as against an enemy; that is that they had made God, their best
father, their enemy, inasmuch as they had by their crimes provoked his
displeasure. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He then
confirms this truth by saying, that they practiced robberies among themselves.
We indeed know that hypocrites ever hide themselves under their religious rites,
and spread them forth as their shield whenever they are reproved. Hence the
Prophet says, that they were not to be deemed the people of God for spending
their labors on sacrifices, for they were at the same time robbers, and
plundered innocent men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The garment of
comeliness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says, or, the garment and the
cloak, (about such words I do not labor much,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they take away from those who
pass by securely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that is from all who are peaceable. For when there is a suspicion of war, or
when a traveler does any mischief, he rightly deserves to be punished. But the
Prophet says here, that they were robbed, who passed by securely as though they
were in a safe country. &#8220;When travelers fear nothing, ye strip them of
their garments, as though they were returning from war: as they are wont, when
war is over, to seize on spoils wherever found, and no one can keep his own; so
now, during peace, ye take to yourselves the same liberty, as though all things
were exposed to plunder, and ye were in a hostile country, lately the scene of
warfare.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet. He
first intimates that the people were now rejected by God, for they had rendered
themselves, by their most abandoned life, wholly unworthy of his benefits; and
at the same time he reproves their ingratitude that having been the people of
God, they choose to make war with him rather than to observe the covenant which
he had made for their safety; for it was a most shameful wickedness in them,
since they had been chosen from the whole world to be a peculiar people, to
prefer going to war with God rather than to live quietly under his protection.
And that they did rise up against God he proves, for they gave themselves up to
robberies; they plundered, even during times of peace, which circumstance
greatly aggravated their wickedness. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the Prophet checks the foolish confidence
of the people. The land of Canaan, we know, had been honored by God with the
distinction of being a rest; yea God called it, not only the rest of the people,
but also his own rest,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;I have sworn in my

<div><font face="Palatino">The land of Canaan then was a sort of rest, hidden
under the wings of God; for the Lord had assigned it as an inheritance to his
chosen people. As God then dwelt in that land, and had also given it to the
children of Abraham, that they might rest there in safety, and as this was also
one of the blessings contained in the Law, hypocrites said, pursuing their usual
course of falsely and groundlessly claiming to themselves the favors of God,
that they could not be thence expelled, and that those Prophets were falsifiers
who dared to change any thing in God&#8217;s covenant. This is the reason why
the Prophet now says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, depart; this is not your
rest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;False confidence,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;deceives you, as ye think that ye are inseparably fixed in your
habitation. God indeed has made such a promise, but this condition was added,
&#8212; If ye will stand faithful to his covenant. Now ye are become
covenant-breakers: ye think that he is fast bound to you; all the cords are
loosened; for as ye have perfidiously departed from the Law of God, there is now
no reason for you to think that he is under any obligation to you. There is then
no ground for you to boast of being a holy people; you have indeed the name, but
the reality has ceased to be: therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arise and
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> but to sit still securely and
proudly will avail you nothing, for God will now drive you afar off: and I now
declare to you that you must arise and depart, for ye cannot rest in this land
against the will of God: and God will now thrust you out of it.&#8221; We now
perceive the real meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>

again he vindicates God from their calumny and ungodly murmurings. We indeed
know how difficult it was to bring down that people, who were steeped in so
great a perverseness. And we find that the Prophet had a hard contest with the
hypocrites, for the multitude had ever this language in their mouths, &#8212;
What! is it of no moment that God has favored us with so many and so remarkable
promises? Is our adoption nothing but a mockery? Has he in vain given us this
land by an hereditary right? Since then hypocrites thus brought forward their
privileges in opposition to God, and yet abused them, it was necessary to
convince them to the contrary, and this is what the Prophet does here, &#8212;
&#8220;Ye call,&#8221; he says, &#8220;this land your rest, but how do you rest
in it? God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath, for he dwells among you to
sanctify you: but ye live disorderly, and carry on war with God himself: have
not your pollutions obliterated that holy rest, which has been enjoined on you
by God? Ye then see that this change has happened through your fault, that is,
that God has ceased to call this land, as he was wont formerly to do, your and
his own rest. <i>It is not</i> then <i>your rest;</i> he will therefore
<i>scatter</i> you <i>with violent</i> or strong <i>scattering:</i> Ye in vain
promise to yourselves rest in this land, since ye carry on war with God, and
cease not to provoke his wrath against you.&#8221; It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet points out here another vice by which the
people were infected &#8212; that they wished to be soothed with flatteries: for
all the ungodly think that they are in a manner exempt from God&#8217;s
judgment, when they hear no reproof; yea they think themselves happy, when they
get flatterers, who are indulgent to their vices. This is now the disease which
the Prophet discovers as prevailing among the people. Jerome sought out a
meaning quite different here, as in the former verses; but I will not stop to
refute him, for it is enough to give the real meaning of the Prophet. But as
before he rendered women, princes, and thus perverted entirely the meaning, so
he says here, I would I were a vain Prophet, that is, walking in vanity, and
mendacious; as though Micah said &#8220;I wish I were false in denouncing on you
the calamities of which I speak; for I would rather announce to you something
joyful and favorable: but I cannot do this, for the Lord commands what is
different.&#8221; But there is nothing of this kind in the words of the Prophet.
Let us then return to the text.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a man walks in the spirit, and
deceitfully lies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> etc.
Almost all interpreters agree in this, &#8212; that to walk in the spirit, is to
announce any thing proudly and presumptuously; and they take spirit for wind or
for deceits. But I doubt not, but that to walk in the spirit was then a common
mode of speaking, to set forth the exercise of the prophetic office. When
therefore any one was a Prophet, or one who discharged that office, or sustained
the character of a teacher, he professed himself to have been sent from above.
The Prophets were indeed formerly called the men of the spirit, and for this
reason, because they adduced nothing from themselves or from their own heads;
but only delivered faithfully, as from hand to hand, what they had received from
God. To walk in the spirit then means, in my view, the same thing as to profess
the office of a teacher. When therefore any one professed the office of a
teacher, what was he to do? &#8220;If I,&#8221; says Micah, &#8220;being endued
with the Spirit, and called to teach, wished to ingratiate myself with you, and
preached that there would be an abundant increase of wine and strong drink, all
would applaud me; for if any one promises these things, he becomes
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prophet of this
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Micah intimates that the Israelites
rejected all sound doctrine, for they sought nothing but flatteries, and wished
to be cherished in their vices; yea, they desired to be deceived by false
adulation to their own ruin. It hence appears that they were not the people they
wished to be deemed, that is, the people of God: for the first condition in
God&#8217;s covenant was, &#8212; that he should rule among his people. Inasmuch
then as these men would not endure to be governed by Divine power, and wished to
have full and unbridled liberty, it was the same as though they had banished God
far from them. Hence, by this proof, the Prophet shows that they had wholly
departed from God, and had no intercourse with him. If there be then any man
walking in the spirit, let him, he says, keep far from the truth; for he will
not otherwise be borne by this people. &#8212; How so? Because they will not
have honest and faithful teachers. What is then to be done? Let flatterers come,
and promise them plenty of wine and strong drink, and they will be their best
teachers, and be received with great applause: in short, the suitable teachers
of that people were the ungodly; the people could no longer bear the true
Prophets; their desire was to have flatterers who were indulgent to all their
corruptions.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The exposition of this passage is twofold. The
greater part of interpreters incline to this view, &#8212; that God here
promises some alleviation to the Israelites, after having sharply reproved them,
and threatened them with utter ruin. They therefore apply this passage to the
kingdom of Christ, as though God gave hope of a future restoration. But when I
narrowly weigh every thing, I am, on the contrary, forced to regard these two
verses as a commination, that is, that the Prophet here denounces God&#8217;s
future vengeance on the people. As, however, the former opinion is almost
universally received, I will briefly mention what has been adduced in its favor,
and then I shall return to state the other meaning, which I
prefer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is suitable to the kingdom of Christ to say, that
a people who had been dispersed should be gathered under one head. We indeed
know how miserable a dispersion there is in the world without him, and that
whenever the Prophets speak of the renovation of the Church, they commonly make
use of this form of expression, that is, that the Lord will gather the dispersed
and unite them together under one head. If then the passage be referred to the
kingdom of Christ, it is altogether proper to say, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by gathering will gather the
whole of Jacob.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But a restriction is afterwards
added, that no one may extend this restoration to the whole race of Abraham, or
to all those who, according to the flesh, derived their descent from Abraham as
their father: hence the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sharit,</i> is laid down. Then the whole of Jacob is not that multitude,
which, according to the flesh, traced their origin from the holy Patriarchs, but
only their residue. It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set them together as the
sheep of Bozrah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, I will make
them to increase into a large, yea, into an immense number; for they shall make
a tumult, that is, a great noise will be made by them, as though the place could
not contain so large a number. And they explain the next verse thus, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A breaker shall go before
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, there shall be those who,
with a hand, strong and armed, will make a way open for them; inasmuch as Christ
says that the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:12) they then mean that the people will have courageous leaders, whom nothing
will stop from breaking through, and that they will also lead the whole people
with them. They shall therefore go forth through the gate, and their king shall
pass through. This also well agrees with the kingdom of Christ. For whenever God
declares that he will be propitious to his Church, he at the same time adds,
that he will give a king to his people; for their safety had been placed in that
kingdom, which had been erected by the authority and command of God himself. It
is therefore a common thing, and what occurs everywhere in the Prophets, that
God would give a king from the seed of David to his people, when it would be his
will to favor them with complete happiness. Thus they understand that a king
shall pass on before them, which is the office of a leader, to show them the
way. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah shall be at
their head;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, God himself will show
himself to be the chief king of his people, and will ever defend by his help and
grace those whom he adopts as his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I have already said that I more approve of
another. exposition: for I see not how the Prophet could pass so suddenly into a
different strain. He had said in the last verse that the people could endure no
admonitions, for they only desired flatteries and adulation. He now joins what I
have lately referred to respecting the near judgment of God, and proceeds, as we
shall see, in the same strain to the end of the third chapter: but we know that
the chapters were not divided by the Prophets themselves. We have therefore a
discourse continued by the Prophet to the third chapter; not that he spoke all
these things in one day; but he wished to collect together what he had said of
the vices of the people; and this will be more evident as we proceed. I will now
come to the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gathering, I will gather thee, the
whole of Jacob; collecting, I will collect the remnant of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God has two modes of gathering; for he
sometimes gathers his people from dispersion, which is a singular proof of his
favor and love. But he is said also to gather, when he assembles them together
to devote and give them up to destruction, as we say in French, <i>Trousser;</i>
and this verb is taken elsewhere in the same sense, and we have already met with
an instance in Hosea. So, in the present passage, God declares that there would
be a gathering of the people, &#8212; for what purpose? Not that being united
together they might enjoy the blessings of God, but that they might be
destroyed. As then the people had united together in all kinds of wickedness, so
God now declares, that they should be gathered together, that the one and the
same destruction might be to them all. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant of
Israel;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though he said, &#8220;Whatever
shall remain from slaughters in wars and from all other calamities, such as
famine and pestilence, this I will collect, that it may be wholly
destroyed.&#8221; He mentions the remnant, because the Israelites had been worn
out by many evils, before the Lord stretched forth his hand at last to destroy
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set them together as
the sheep of Bozrah;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, I will cast them
into one heap. Bozrah was a city or a country of Idumea; and it was a very
fruitful place, and had the richest pastures: hence Isaiah 34, in denouncing
vengeance on the Idumeans, alludes at the same time to their pastures, and says,
&#8220;God will choose for himself fat lambs and whatever is well fed, and will
also collect fatness, for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah.&#8221; So also, in
this place, the Prophet says, that the Jews, when collected together as it were
into a bundle, shall be like the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sheep of
Bozrah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And he further adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the sheep in the middle of the
sheepfolds,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> though some render it, leading:
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>daber,</i> sometimes means to lead; but I see no reason why it should be
drawn so far from its meaning in this connection. I take it as signifying a
sheepfold, because sheep are there collected together. Some interpreters
consider that a siege is referred to here, that is, that God would confine the
whole people within cities, that they might not be open to the incursions of
enemies; but I extend the meaning much wider, namely, that God would gather the
people, in order at last to disperse them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gather
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as I have already said,<i> Je vous
trousserai; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the sheep of
Bozrah in the middle of the sheep fold; and there shall be a noise on account of
their number</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;Though ye
now glory in your number, this will avail you nothing; for I shall be able to
reduce you all to strait, so that you may, as ye deserve, perish
together.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend shall a breaker before
them;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, they shall be led in confusion;
and the gate shall also be broken, that they may go forth together; for the
passage would not be large enough, were they, as is usually done, to go forth in
regular order; but the gates of cities shall be broken, that they may pass
through in great numbers and in confusion. By these words the Prophet intimates,
that all would be quickly taken away into exile.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall go forth, he says
through the gate, and their king shall pass on before if
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet means here, that the
king would be made captive; and this was the saddest spectacle: for some hope
remained, when the dregs of the people had been led into Chaldea; but when the
king himself was led away a captive, and cast into prison, and his eyes pulled
out, and his children slain, it was the greatest of misery. They were wont to
take pride in their king, for they thought that their kingdom could not but
continue perpetually, since God had so promised. But God might for a time
overturn that kingdom, that he might afterwards raise it anew, according to what
has been done by Christ, and according to what had been also predicted by the
Prophets. &#8220;Crosswise, crosswise, crosswise, (<i>transversa</i>) let the
crown be, until its lawful possessor comes.&#8221; We then see that this, which
the Prophet mentions respecting their king, has been added for the sake of
amplifying.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah shall be at the head of
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, He will be nigh them, to
oppress and wholly to overwhelm them. Some consider something to be understood,
and of this kind, that Jehovah was wont formerly to rule over them, but that now
he would cease to do so: but this is too strained; and the meaning which I have
stated seems sufficiently clear, and that is, &#8212; that God himself would be
the doer, when they should be driven into exile, and that he would add courage
to tyrants and their attendants, in pursuing the accursed people, in order to
urge on more and more and aggravate their calamities and thus to show that their
destruction vault happen through his righteous judgment. We now then understand
the real meaning of the Prophet.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in this chapter assails and severely
reproves the chief men as well as the teachers; for both were given to avarice
and cruelty, to plunder, and, in short, to all other vices. And he begins with
the magistrates, who exercised authority among the people; and briefly relates
the words in which he inveighed against them. We have said elsewhere, that the
Prophets did not record all that they had spoken, but only touched shortly on
the heads or chief points: and this was done by Micah, that we might know what
he did for forty or more years, in which he executed his office. He could have
related, no doubt, in half-an-hour, all that exists of his writings: but from
this small book, however small it is, we may learn what was the Prophet&#8217;s
manner of teaching, and on what things he chiefly dwelt. I will now return to
his words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the chief men of the kingdom had been
reproved by him. It is probable, that these words were addressed to the Jews;
for though at the beginning he includes the Israelites, we yet know that he was
given as a teacher to the Jews, and not to the kingdom of Israel. It was as it
were accidental, that he sometimes introduces the ten tribes together with the
Jews. This address then was made, as I think, to the king as well as to his
counselors and other judges, who then ruled over the people of
Judah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear this, I
pray,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says. Such a preface betokens
carelessness in the judges; for why does he demand a hearing from them, except
that they had become so torpid in their vices, that they would attend to
nothing? Inasmuch then as so brutal a stupor had seized on them, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear now ye chiefs, or heads, of
Jacob, and ye rulers</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the house of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But why does he still speak of
the house of Israel? Because that name was especially known and celebrated,
whenever a mention was made of the posterity of Abraham: and the other Prophets,
even while speaking of the kingdom of Judah, often make use of this title,
&#8220;ye who are called by the name of Israel;&#8221; and they did this, on
account of the dignity of the holy Patriarch; and the meaning of the word itself
was no ordinary testimonial of excellency as to his whole race. And this is what
is frequently done by Isaiah. But the name of Israel is not put here, as
elsewhere, as a title of distinction: on the contrary, the Prophet here
amplifies their sin, because they were so corrupt, though they were the chief
men among the chosen race, being those whom God had honored with so much
dignity, as to set them over his Church and elect people. It was then an
ingratitude, not to be endured to abuse that high and sacred authority, which
had been conferred on them by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Does it not belong to you, he says,
to know judgment?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he intimates that
rectitude ought to have a place among the chief men, in a manner more especial
than among the common people; for it behaves them to excel others in the
knowledge of what is just and right: for though the difference between good and
evil be engraven on the hearts of all, yet they, who hold supremacy among the
people, and excel in power, are as it were the eyes of the community; as the
eyes direct the whole body, so also they, who are placed in any situation of
honor, are thus made eminent, that they may show the right way to others. Hence
by the word, to <i>know,</i> the Prophet intimates that they wickedly subverted
the whole order of nature, for they were blind, while they ought to have been
the luminaries of the whole people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it not for you, he says, to
know judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and equity? But why was this
said, especially to the chief men? Because they, though they of themselves knew
what was right, having the law engraven within ought yet as leaders to have
possessed superior knowledge, so as to outshine others. It is therefore your
duty to know judgment. We hence learn that it is not enough for princes and
magistrates to be well disposed and upright; but it is required of them to know
judgment and wisdom that they may discern matters above the common people. But
if they are not thus endued with the gift of understanding and wisdom let them
ask of the Lord. We indeed know, that without the Spirit of God, the acutest men
are wholly unfit to rule; nor is it in vain, that the free Spirit of God is set
forth, as holding the supreme power in the world; for we are thus reminded, that
even they who are endued with the chief gifts are wholly incapable of governing
except the Spirit of God be with them. This passage then shows that an upright
mind is not a sufficient qualification in princes; they must also excel in
wisdom, that they may be, as we have already said, as the eyes are to the body.
In this sense it is that Micah now says that it belonged to the leaders of the
people to know judgment and justice. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff37</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they hate good, and love
evil, and pull off the skin</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from my people, the flesh
from their bones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they leave
nothing, he says, sound and safe, their rapacity being so furious. The Prophet
conveys first a general reproof, &#8212; that they not only perverted justice,
but were also given to wickedness and hated good. He means then that they were
openly wicked and ungodly, and also that they with a fixed purpose carried on
war against every thing just and right. We hence learn how great and how
abominable was the corruption of the people, when they were still the peculiar
possession and heritage of God. Inasmuch then as the state of this ancient
people had become so degenerated, let us learn to walk in solicitude and fear,
while the Lord governs us by pious magistrates and faithful pastors: for what
happened to the Jews might soon happen to us, so that wolves might bear rule
over us, as indeed experience has proved even in this our city. The Prophet
afterwards adds the kinds of cruelty which prevailed; of which he speaks in
hyperbolical terms, though no doubt he sets before our eyes the state of things
as it was. He compares the judges to wolves or to lions, or to other savage
beasts. He says not that they sought the property of the people, or pillaged
their houses; but he says that they devoured their flesh even to the very bones;
he says that they pulled off their skin: and this he confirms in the next
verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They devour, he says, the flesh of
my people, and their skin they strip off from them, and their bones they break
in pieces and make small, as that which into the pot is thrown, and which is in
the midst of the caldron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
when any one throws meat into the pot, he does not take the whole ox, but cuts
it into pieces, and having broken it, he then fills with these pieces his pot or
his caldron. The Prophet then enhances the cruelty of the princes; they were not
content with one kind of oppression, but exercised every species of barbarous
cruelty towards the people, and were in every respect like bears, or wolves, or
lions, or some other savage beasts, and that they were also like gluttons. We
now then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us what God requires mainly
from those in power, &#8212; that they abstain from doing injustice: for as they
are armed with power, so they ought to be a law to themselves. They assume
authority over others; let them then begin with themselves, and restrain
themselves from doing evil. For when a private man is disposed to do harm, he is
restrained at least by fear of the laws, and dares not to do any thing at his
pleasure; but in princes there is a greater boldness; and they are able to do
greater injustice: and this is the reason why they ought to observe more
forbearance and humanity. Hence levity and paternal kindness especially become
princes and those in power. But the Prophet here condemns the princes of his age
for what deserved the highest reprehension; and their chief crime was cruelty or
inhumanity, inasmuch as they spared not their own subjects.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the Prophet in no degree flattered
the great, though they took great pride in their own dignity. But when he saw
that they wickedly and basely abused the power committed to them, he boldly
resisted them, and exercised the full boldness of the Spirit. He therefore not
only calls them robbers or plunderers of the people; but he says, that they were
cruel wild beasts; he says, that they devoured the flesh, tore and pulled it in
pieces, and made it small; and he says all this, that he might convey an idea of
the various kinds of cruelty which they practiced. Now follow threatenings

<div><font face="Palatino">Micah now denounces judgment on the chief men, such
as they deserved. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall cry then to Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The adverb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">za</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>az,</i> is often put indefinitely in Hebrew, and has the force of a
demonstrative, and may be taken as pointing out a thing,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">deiktikwv</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; demonstratively,)<i> then,</i> or there, as though the Prophet pointed
out by his finger things which could be seen, though they were far away from the
sight of men. But in this place, the Prophet seems rather to pursue the subject
to which I have already referred: for he had before stated that God would take
vengeance on that people. This adverb of time then is connected with the other
combinations, which have been already explained. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If,
however, any one prefer a different meaning, namely that the Prophet meant here
to hold them in suspense, as to the nearness of God&#8217;s vengeance, I do not
oppose him, for this sense is not unsuitable. However this may be, the Prophet
here testifies that the crimes of the chief men would not go unpunished, though
they did not think themselves to be subject either to laws or to punishment. As
then the princes and magistrates regarded themselves as exempt, by some
imaginary privilege, from the lot of other people, the Prophet declares here
expressly, that a distress was nigh at hand, which would extort a cry from them:
for by the word, cry, he means the miseries which were nigh at hand. <i>They
shall</i> then <i>cry</i> in their distress. I have now explained the design of
the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed see how at this day those who are in high
stations swell with arrogance; for as they abound in wealth, and as honor is as
it were an elevated degree, so that being propped up by the shoulders of others
they seem eminent, and as they are also feared by the rest of the people, they
are on these accounts led to think that no adversity can happen to them. But the
Prophet says, that such would be their distress, that it would draw a cry from
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
but Jehovah </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will not
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they shall be miserable
and without any remedy. Jehovah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will not answer them, but will
hide from them his face, as they have done
perversely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, God will not hear
their complaints; for he will return on their own heads all the injuries with
which he now sees his own people to be afflicted. And thus God will show that he
was not asleep, while they were with so much effrontery practicing all kinds of
wrong.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may however be asked here, how it is that God
rejects the prayers and entreaties of those who cry to him? It must first be
observed, that the reprobate, though they rend the air with their cries, do not
yet direct their prayers to God; but if they address God himself, they do this
clamorously; for they expostulate with him, and contend with him, yea, they
vomit out their blasphemies, or at least they murmur and complain of their
evils. The ungodly then cry, but not to the Lord; or if they address their cries
to God, they are, as it has been said, full of glamour. Hence, except one is
guided by the Spirit of God, he cannot pray from the heart. And we know that it
is the peculiar office of the Spirit to raise up our hearts to heaven: for in
vain we pray, except we bring faith and repentance: and who is the author of
these but the Holy Spirit? It appears then that the ungodly so cry, that they
only violently contend with God: but this is not the right way of praying. It is
therefore no wonder that God rejects their clamors. The ungodly do indeed at
times pour forth a flood of prayers and call on God&#8217;s name with the mouth;
but at the same time they are, as we have said, full of perverseness, and they
never really humble themselves before God. Since then they pour forth their
prayers from a bitter and a proud heart, this is the reason why the Prophet says
now, that the Lord </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would not then
hear, but hide his face from them at that time, inasmuch as they acted
perversely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff41</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He shows here that God would not be reconciled to men
wholly irreclaimable, who could not be restored by any means to the right way.
But when any one falls [and repents] he will ever find God propitious to him, as
soon as he cries to him; but when with obstinate minds we pursue our own course,
and give no place to repentance, we close up the door of mercy against
ourselves; and so what the Prophet teaches here necessarily takes place, &#8212;
the Lord hides his face in the day of distress. And we also hear what the
Scripture says, &#8212; that judgment will be without mercy to those who are not
merciful,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
2:11.) Hence if any one be inexorable to his brethren, (as we see at this day
many tyrants to be, and we also see many in the middle class to be of the same
tyrannical and wholly sanguinary disposition,) he will at length ,whoever he may
be, meet with that judgment which Micah here denounces. The sentence then is not
to be taken in a general sense, as though he had said, that the Lord would not
be reconciled to the wicked; but he points out especially those irreclaimable
men, who had wholly hardened themselves, so that they had become, as we have
already seen, altogether inflexible. The Prophet now comes to his second
reproof.</font><br></div>

observing on the words of Micah, that the princes devoured the flesh of
God&#8217;s people; for the indignity was increased when this wrong, was done to
the people of God. Had the Assyrians, or the Ethiopians, or the Egyptians, been
pillaged by their princes, it would have been more tolerable; but when the very
people of God were thus devoured, it was, as I have said, less to be borne. So
when the people of God were deceived, and the truth was turned to a lie, it was
a sacrilege the more hateful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then was the reason why he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who deceive my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;This people is sacred to me, for I have chosen them for myself; as then
they are destroyed by frauds and deceptions, is not my majesty in a manner
dishonored &#8212; is not my authority lessened?&#8221; We now then see the
reason why the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
deceive my people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is indeed certain, that
the Jews were worthy of such deceptions; and God elsewhere declares, that
whenever he permitted false prophets to come among them, it was to try them to
see what sort of people they were, (Deuteronomy 13.) It was then their just
reward, when liberty was given to Satan to prevent sound doctrine among the
people. And no one is ever deceived, except through his own will. Though their
own simplicity seems to draw many to destruction, yet there is ever in them some
hypocrisy. But it does not extenuate the sin of false teachers, that the people
deserve such a punishment: and hence the Prophet still goes on with his reproof
and says, that they were the people of God, &#8212; in what respect? By
adoption. Though then the Jews had rendered themselves unworthy of such an
honor, yet God counts them his people, that he might punish the wickedness of
the false teachers, of which he now accuses them. It now follows, that they did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bite with their
teeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But I cannot finish
today.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou
wouldest have the image of thy justice to shine in princes, and whom thou arrest
with the sword, that they might rule in thy name, and be really thy ministers,
&#8212; O grant, that this thy blessing may openly appear among us, and that by
this evidence thou mayest testify that thou art not only propitious to us, but
hadst also a care for our safety, and watches over our welfare and well-being:
and do thou so shine by thy word, that it may never be obscured or clouded among
us through any depraved cupidity, but ever retain its own clear purity, so that
we may proceed in the right path of salvation, which thou hast discovered and
prescribed, until we be at length gathered into thy celestial kingdom, to enjoy
that eternal inheritance, which has been procured for us by the blood of thy
only-begotten Son. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
EIGHTY-SIXTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us proceed to explain that sentence of the
Prophet, in which he shows the cause why the teachers deceived the people and
turned the truth of God to a lie; and this was, because they were greedy of
gains and were wholly given to avarice. We hence see, according to the testimony
of Paul, that avarice affords a cause to all evils,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:10;) and that wherever this contagion comes, all things necessarily
fall into decay: for when avarice reigns in the hearts of men, the truth of God
especially is ever adulterated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Micah adduces two evidences of avarice, &#8212;
that they <i>cried, Peace,</i> when well fed and filled, &#8212; and that they
proclaimed war, when they were hungry. Then as to the first points he says,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wl&ccedil; warqw
&#181;hyn&ccedil;b &#181;yk&ccedil;nh</font><font face="Palatino">, that is,
&#8220;who bite with their teeth,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
cry, Peace.&#8221; But the sentence is to be so understood, that when they did
<i>bite </i>well, they announced peace with full confidence: for by the word,
bite, the Prophet means their gormandizing; for they who, under the guise of
God&#8217;s name, sought only their own advantage, were not satisfied with a
moderate support, inasmuch as they were like hungry dogs. They therefore
devoured, and gorged themselves, without any limits or moderation. This is the
reason why he says that they did bite: for he compares them either to lions or
to bears; and we know that wild beasts are not satiated with a small quantity of
food, but that they gnash as it were their teeth except they are always
pampered. So also Micah says, that the false teachers of his age were voracious
men, who demanded a large proportion of food. We see the same thing in our day
as to the monks under the Papacy, especially those who, under the name of
mendacity, devour the substance of all people. Except they are pampered, they
always murmur; nay, they are not content with murmurs, they proclaim war, as the
Prophet says here. We indeed see at the same time, that they are insatiable; for
when they come to tables well furnished, no one would say that they are men, but
beasts, for they devour every thing. We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is not voracity alone that is reprehended: he
says, that they sold their blessings. when they were well filled and had their
stomach well supplied. In the same manner the monks also are wont to pronounce
peace when they are well fed, &#8212; &#8220;O! ye do good, when ye take care of
the brethren; for they are careful of you: when ye sleep in your beds, they
watch, and their prayers make you rich; for how could the world stand, were it
not that the brethren make amends for it? As then ye are so kind to our
community, all things shall turn out well and prosperously to you, and God also
will bless you.&#8221; This then is the practice of those who for reward sell
their blessings; they cry, Peace, that is, they confidently declare that all
things shall be well, they make God propitious, provided such liberality towards
their order be ever continued.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, on the other hand, he also says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one gives not to their
mouth, they instantly sanctify war against you</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i>
but I give a different rendering, as the passage requires, &#8212; that they
reclaim war; though the word is literally to sanctify. But we have seen in Joel
2, that the word is used to designate any solemn proclamation, &#8212;
&#8220;Sanctify a fast&#8221;, that is, Proclaim a fast. So also in this place,
They sanctify war, that is, they proclaim war, when any one does not feed them,
nor satisfy their gormandizing; for they could not bear want. In short, the
Prophet shows, that these false teachers were so blinded by avarice, that they
discerned not the difference between right and wrong; but only praised those who
fed them: and, on the other hand, when they found that they and their stomach
were not cared for nor satisfied, they cursed, fulminated, and uttered nothing
but anathemas; as we see to be done at this day by the monks under the Papacy.
The Prophet now says &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God declares here to the false teachers by the mouth
of Micah, that he would inflict punishment on them, so that they should be
exposed to the reproach of all. Hence the kind of punishment of which the
Prophet speaks is &#8212; that he would strip the false teachers of all their
dignity, so that they should hereafter in vain put on an appearance, and claim
the honorable name which they had so long abused. We indeed know, when ungodly
and profane men clothe themselves with the dignified titles of being the
princes, or bishops, or prelates of the Church, how audaciously they pervert
every thing, and do so with impunity. There is then no other remedy, except God
pulls off the mask from them, and openly discovers to all their baseness. Of
this punishment Micah now speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be to you a night from
vision;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> so is the phrase literally, but the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem,</i> means often, for, or, on account of; and we can easily see that the
Prophet represents night as the reward for visions and darkness for divination.
&#8220;As then my people have been deceived by your fallacies, for your visions
and divinations have been nothing but lies and deceits, I will repay you with
the reward which you have deserved: for instead of a vision you shall have
night, and instead of divination you shall have thick darkness.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
indeed certain, that the false teachers, even when they were, as they say, in
great reputation, that is, when they retained the honor and the title of their
office, were blind and wholly destitute of all light: but the Prophet here
declares, that as their baseness did not appear to the common people, God would
cause it to be made at length fully evident. As for instance, there is nothing
at this day more stupid and senseless than the bishops of the Papacy: for when
any one draws from them any expression about religion, they instantly betray not
only their ignorance, but also their shameful stupidity. With regard to the
monks, though they be the most audacious kind of animals, (<i>audacissimum
animalium genus,</i>) yet we know how unlearned and ignorant they are. Therefore
at this time the night has not yet passed away, nor the darkness, of which Micah
speaks here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Holy Spirit teaches
here, and that is, &#8212; that God would at length strip those false teachers
of that imaginary dignity, on account of which no one dared to speak against
them, but received as an oracle whatever they uttered.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Night</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> shall be to you instead of
a vision;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8220;The whole world shall
understand that you are not what you boast yourselves to be: for I will show
that there is not in you, no, not a particle of the prophetic spirit, but that
ye are men as dark as night, and darkness shall be to you instead of divination.
Ye boast of great acuteness and great perspicuity of mind; but I will discover
your baseness, so that the very children may know that you are not endued with
the spirit.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go down shall the sun upon you,
and darkened over you shall be the day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
that is, such will be that darkness, that even at noon they will see nothing;
the sun will shine on all, but they shall grope as in the dark; so that Gods
vengeance would be made so manifest, that it might be noticed by all, from the
least to the greatest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same thing in the next verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ashamed shall be the seers
and confounded the diviners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall cover their
lip</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is they will put veils on
their mouths. In short, he means, that they would become a reproach to all, so
that they would be ashamed of themselves, and no more dare to boast with so much
confidence of their name and of the prophetic office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to this form of expression,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;p&ccedil;Al[
wf[w</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>uothu ol shephim,</i> some think that the
practice of mourners is referred to; but this interpretation is frigid. I have
therefore no doubt but that Micah intimates that the mouths of the false
teachers would be closed. There is nearly the same denunciation mentioned by
Zechariah; for speaking of the restoration of the Church, he says, &#8212; They
who before went about boasting greatly, and gloried in the name of Prophets,
shall cast away their mantle, and will no longer dare to show themselves; yea,
when they shall come abroad, they shall be as it were herdsman or private
persons, and shall say, &#8220;I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, I
am chastised by my father;&#8221; that is, they shall profess themselves
unworthy of being called prophets; but that they are scholars under discipline,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
13:5.) So also in this place, &#8220;They deceive at this day my people,&#8221;
saith the Lord; &#8220;I will reward them as they deserve; I will fill them with
disgrace and contempt. They shall not then dare hereafter to show themselves as
they have been wont to do; they shall not presume boastingly to profess
themselves to be the pillars of the Church, that the whole world may be made
subject to them; they shall not dare with tyrannical force to oppress the common
and ignorant portions of
society<i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Veil, then, shall
they their mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;I will
cause their mouth to be closed, so that they shall not dare hereafter to utter
even a word.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff47</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there will be no answer
from God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some so explain this sentence, as
though the Prophet upbraided them with their old deceits, which they boasted
were the words of God: as then they were not faithful to God, but lied to
miserable men, when they said, that they were sent from above, and brought
messages from heaven, while they only uttered their own inventions or fables,
they should on these accounts be constrained to cover their mouth. But different
is the meaning of the Prophet, and it is this, &#8212; that they were to be
deprived of any answer, so that their want of knowledge might be easily
perceived even by the most ignorant: for false teachers, though they possess
nothing certain, yet deceive the simple with disguises, and render plausible
their absurdities, that they may seem to be the interpreters of God; and they
further add great confidence: and then the stupidity of the people concedes to
them such great power, according to what is said by Jeremiah 5 where he says
that the priests received gifts and that for gifts the Prophets divined, and
that the people loved such deprivations. But Micah declares here that such
delusions would no longer be allowed, for God would dissipate them. It will then
be made evident, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>you have no
answer from God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, &#8220;All
will perceive that you are void and destitute of every celestial truth, and that
you were formerly but gross cheats, when ye passed yourselves as God&#8217;s
servants, though you had no ground for doing so.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the Prophet means. But this
punishment might have then contributed to the benefit of the people: for as it
is a cause of ruin to the world, when there is no difference made between light
and darkness; so when the baseness of those is discovered, who abuse God&#8217;s
name and adulterate his pure truth, there is then a door open to repentance.
Rightly then is this combination addressed to false prophets. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Micah, in a courageous spirit, stands up alone
against all the false teachers even when he saw that they were a large number,
and that they appealed to their number, according to their usual practice, as
their shield. Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
filled with power by the Spirit of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
confidence is what all God&#8217;s servants should possess, that they may not
succumb to the empty and vain boastings of those who subvert the whole order of
the Church. Whenever then, God permits his pure truth to be corrupted by false
teachers, and them to be popular among those high in honor, as well as the
multitude, let this striking example be remembered by us, lest we be
discouraged, lest the firmness and invincible power of the Holy Spirit be
weakened in our hearts, but that we may proceed in the course of our calling,
and learn to oppose the name of God to all the deceptions of men, if indeed we
are convinced that our service is approved by him, as being faithful. Since,
then, Micah says, that he was<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>filled with
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he no doubt stood, as it were, in
the presence of the whole people, and alone pitched his camp against the whole
multitude; for there were then false teachers going about every where, as the
devil sows always seed enough, whenever God lets loose the reins. Though then
their number was not small, yet Micah hesitated not to go forth among them: I,
he says; there is stress to be laid on the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ykna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anki,</i>&#8212; Ye despise me, being one man, and ye despise a few men; ye
may think that I alone serve the Lord; but I am a match for a thousand, yea, for
an innumerable multitude; for God is on my side, and he approves of my ministry
as it is. from him, nor do I bring any thing to you but what he has commanded:
It is then I.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further expresses a fuller confidence by using the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aulam</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I am filled with
power</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This &#8220;verily&#8221; or truly is
opposed to those lofty boastings by which the false prophets were ever wont to
attain a name and honor among the people. But Micah intimates that all that they
uttered was only evanescent: &#8220;Ye are,&#8221; he says, &#8220;wonderful
prophets; nay, ye are superior to the angels, if you are to be believed; but
show that you are so in reality; let there be some proof by which your calling
can be confirmed. There is no proof. It then follows, that ye are only men of
wind, and not really spiritual: but there is really in me what ye boast of with
your mouths.&#8221; And he says, that he was <i>filled,</i> that he might not be
thought one of the common sort: and Micah no doubt shows here, on account of the
necessity of the occasion, that he was not supplied with ordinary or usual
power; for, according as God employs the labors of his servants, so is he
present with them, and furnishes them with suitable protection. When any one is
not exercised with great difficulties in discharging his office of teaching, a
common measure of the Spirit is only necessary for the performance of his
duties; but when any one is drawn into arduous and difficult struggles, he is at
the same time especially strengthened by the Lord: and we see daily examples of
this; for many simple men, who have never been trained up in learning, have yet
been so endued by the celestial Spirit, when they came to great trials, that
they have closed the mouths of great doctors, who seemed to understand all
oracles. By such evidences God openly proves at this day, that he is the same
now as when he formerly endued his servant Micah with a power so rare and so
extraordinary. This then is the reason why he says, that he was filled with
power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the Spirit of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet casts aside
every suspicious token of arrogance; lest he should seem to claim anything as
his own, he says, that this power was conferred on him from above: and this
circumstance ought to be particularly noticed. Though Micah rightly and justly
claimed to himself the name of a teacher, he yet had nothing different from
others before the world; for all his opponents discharged the same office, and
obtained the same honor: the office was common to both parties. Micah was either
alone, or connected with Isaiah and a few others. Since then he here dares to
set up himself, we see that his call alone must be regarded; for we know how
great is the propensity of Satan to oppose the kingdom of Christ, and also how
proud and fierce are false teachers. Since then the rage of Satan is well known
and the presumption of false teachers, there is no reason why the faithful
should make much of mere naked titles: and when they, who lived at that time,
declared, as Papists do at this day, that they had no discrimination nor
judgment to know, whether of them ought to have been deemed impostors or the
ministers of God, inasmuch as Micah was alone and they were many, and also that
the others were prophets that at least they had the name and repute of being so,
&#8212; what was to be done? This was the reason why I have said that this
circumstance was worthy of special notice, &#8212; that though their vocation
was common, yet as they had acted perfidiously, and Micah alone, or with few
others, had faithfully performed what the Lord had commanded, he alone is to be
deemed a Prophet and a teacher: in short, there is no reason for false prophets
to set up against us a mere coveting, when they cannot prove that they are
endued with the Spirit of God. Whosoever then desires to be deemed a servant of
God, and a teacher in his Church, must have this seal which Micah here adduces;
he must be endued with the Spirit of God; honor then will be given to God. But
if any one brings nothing but the name, we see how vain before God it
is.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With judgment and
courage</i></font><font face="Palatino">. (<i>fortitudine</i>) By judgment, I
have no doubt, he understands discernment, as this is also the common meaning of
the word. He then adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>courage</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
These two things are especially necessary for all ministers of the word, &#8212;
that is, to excel in wisdom, to understand what is true and right, and to be
also endued with inflexible firmness, by which they may overcome both Satan and
the whole world, and never turn aside from their course, though the devil may in
all ways assail them. We hence see what these two words import. He had put
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kech,</i> first, power; but now he mentions
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwbg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gebure,</i> courage or magnanimity. By the term, power, he meant generally
all the endowments, with which all who take upon them the office of teaching
ought to be adorned. This qualification is then first required, and it is a
general one: but Micah divides this power of the prophets into two kinds, even
into wisdom or judgment, and into courage; and he did this, that they might
understand what God intended: Let them excel in doctrine; and then that they may
be confirmed, let them not yield to any gales that may blow, nor be overcome by
threats and terrors; let them not bend here and there to please the world; in a
word, let them not succumb to any corruptions: it is therefore necessary to add
courage to judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To declare to Jacob his
wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and to Israel his
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We here see that the Prophet did not hunt
for the favor of the people. Had he courted their approbation, he must have
soothed with flatteries those who sought flatteries; and were already seized
with such hatred and malignant feelings, that they had rejected Micah. He must
then have spoken softly to them, to please them; but this he did not do.
&#8220;On the one hand,&#8221; he says, &#8220;these men sell to you their
blessings and deceive you with the hope of peace; and, on the other, they
denounce war, except their voracity is satisfied; and thus it is that they
please you; for so ye wish, and ye seek such teachers as will promise you wine
and strong drink: but I am sent to you for another purpose; for the Lord has not
deposited flatteries with me, such as may be pleasant to you; but he has
deposited reproofs and threatenings. I shall therefore uncover your crimes, and
will not hesitate to condemn you before the whole world, for ye deserve to be
thus treated.&#8221; We now perceive why the Prophet says, that he was endued
with power to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>declare his
wickedness to Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
etc.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence learn how necessary it is for us to be
supported by celestial firmness, when we have to do with insincere and wicked
men; and this is almost the common and uniform lot of all God&#8217;s servants;
for all who are sent to teach the word are sent to carry on a contest. It is
therefore not enough to teach faithfully what God commands, except we also
contend: and though the wicked may violently rise up against us, we must yet put
on a brazen front, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;260308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:8, 9; nor must we yield to their fury, but preserve invincible firmness. Since
then we have a contest with the devil, with the world, and with all the wicked,
that we may faithfully execute our office, we must be furnished with this
courage of which Micah speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As I have already shown that God&#8217;s servants
ought courageously to break through all those obstacles by which Satan may
attempt either to delay or to force them backward; so also the doctrine taught
here ought to be applied to all the godly: they ought wisely to distinguish
between the faithful servants of God and impostors who falsely pretend his name.
Then no one, who desires truly and from the heart to obey God, will be deceived;
for the Lord will ever give the spirit of judgment and discrimination. And the
reason why at this day many miserable souls are led to endless ruin is, because
they either shut their eyes, or willfully dissemble, or designedly involve
themselves in such subterfuges as these, &#8212; &#8220;I cannot form any
judgment; I see on both sides learned and celebrated men, at least those who are
in some repute and esteem: some call me to the right hand, and others to the
left, where am I to retake myself? I therefore prefer to close my mouth and my
ears.&#8221; Thus many, seeking a cloak for their sloth, often manifest their
ignorance: for we see that the eyes must be opened when the Lord exercises and
tries our faith: and he suffers discords and contentions to arise in the Church
that some may choose this, and others that. Though God then relaxes the reins of
Satan, that contests and turmoils of this kind may be excited in the Church,
there is yet no excuse for us, if we follow not what the Lord prescribes; for he
will ever guide us by his Spirit, provided we foster not our own slothfulness.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet begins really to prove what he had
stated, &#8212; that he was filled with the power of the Holy Spirit: and it
was, as they say, an actual proof, when the Prophet dreaded no worldly power,
but boldly addressed the princes and provoked their rage against him,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye heads, ye
rulers of the house of Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>ye men who
are cruel, bloody, and iniquitous. We then see that the Prophet had not boasted
of what he did not without delay really confirm. But he began with saying, that
he was filled with the Spirit of God, that he might more freely address them,
and that he might check their insolence. We indeed know that the ungodly are so
led on headlong by Satan, that they hesitate not to resist God himself: but yet
the name of God is often to them a sort of a hidden chain. However much then the
wicked may rage, they yet become less ferocious when the name of God is
introduced. This is the reason why the Prophet had mentioned the Spirit of God;
it was, that there might be a freer course to his doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye heads of the house of Jacob,
ye rulers of the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is
by way of concession, as though he had said, that these were indeed splendid
titles, and that he was not so absurd as not to acknowledge what had been given
them by God, even that they were eminent, a chosen race, being the children of
Abraham. The Prophet then concedes to the princes what belonged to them, as
though he had said, that he was not a seditious man, who had no care nor
consideration for civil order. And this defense was very necessary, for nothing
is more common than for the ungodly to charge God&#8217;s servants with
sedition, whenever they use a freedom of speech as it becomes them. Hence all
who govern the state, when they hear their corruptions reproved, or their
avarice, or their cruelty, or any of their other crimes, immediately cry out,
&#8212; &#8220;What! if we suffer these things, every thing will be upset: for
when all respect is gone, what will follow but brutal outrage? for every one of
the common people will rise up against the magistrates and the judges.&#8221;
Thus then the wicked ever say, that God&#8217;s servants are seditious whenever
they boldly reprove them. This is the reason why the Prophet concedes to the
princes and judges of the people their honor; but a qualifying clause
immediately follows, &#8212; Ye are indeed the heads, ye are rulers; but yet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they hate
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i>&#8221; he does not think them
worthy of being any longer addressed. He had indeed bidden them to hear as with
authority; but having ordered them to hear, he now uncovers their wickedness,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
hate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgments and all rectitude

turn their pillages into buildings: &#8220;This, forsooth, is the splendor of my
holy city even of Zion! where I designed the ark of my covenant to be placed, as
in my only habitation, even there buildings are seen constructed by blood and by
plunder! See, he says, how wickedly these princes conduct themselves under the
cover of their dignity!&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff53</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the word of God is not bound, but
that it puts forth its power against the highest as well as the lowest; for it
is the Spirit&#8217;s office to arraign the whole world, and not a part
only.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;When the Spirit

16:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He speaks not there of the common people only, but of
the whole world, of which princes and magistrates form a prominent part. Let us
then know, that though we ought to show respect to judges, (as the Lord has
honored them with dignified titles, calling them his vicegerents and also gods,)
yet the mouths of Prophets ought not to be closed; but they ought, without
making any difference, to correct whatever is deserving of reproof, and not to
spare even the chief men themselves. This is what ought in the first place to be
observed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then when he says, that Zion
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was built by blood, and Jerusalem
by iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it is the same as though
the Prophet had said, that whatever the great men expended on their palaces had
been procured, and, as it were, scraped together from blood and plunder. The
judges could not have possibly seized on spoils on every side, without being
bloody, that is, without pillaging the poor: for the judges were for the most
part corrupted by the rich and the great; and then they destroyed the miserable
and the innocent. He then who is corrupted by money will become at the same time
a thief; and he will not only extort money, but will also shed blood. There is
then no wonder that Micah says, that Zion was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>built by
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He afterwards extends wider his
meaning and mentions <i>iniquity,</i> as he wished to cast off every excuse from
hypocrites. The expression is indeed somewhat strong, when he says, that Zion
was built by blood. They might have objected and said, that they were not so
cruel, though they could not wholly clear themselves from the charge of avarice.
&#8220;When I speak of blood,&#8221; says the Prophet, &#8220;there is no reason
that we should contend about a name; for all iniquity is blood before God: if
then your houses have been built by plunder, your cruelty is sufficiently
proved; it is as though miserable and innocent men had been slain by your own
hands.&#8221; The words,

and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here first, how gross and supine
was the hypocrisy of princes as well as of the priests and prophets: and then he
declares that they were greatly deceived in thus soothing themselves with vain
flatteries; for the Lord would punish them for their sins since he had in his
forbearance spared them, and found that they did not repent. But he does not
address here the common people or the multitude, but he attacks the chief men:
for he has previously told us, that he was endued with the spirit of courage. It
was indeed necessary for the Prophet to be prepared with invincible firmness
that he might freely and boldly declare the judgment of God, especially as he
had to do with the great and the powerful, who, as it is well known, will not
easily, or with unruffled minds, bear their crimes to be exposed; for they wish
to be privileged above the ordinary class of men. But the Prophet not only does
not spare them, but he even arraigns them alone, as though the blame of all
evils lodged only with them, as indeed the contagion had proceeded from them;
for though all orders were then corrupt, yet the cause and the beginning of all
the evils could not have been ascribed to any but to the chief men
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Princes for reward judge, priests
teach for reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff55</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
the prophets divine for money</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> as though
he had said, that the ecclesiastical as well as the civil government was subject
to all kinds of corruptions, for all things were made matters of sale. We know
that what the Holy Spirit declares elsewhere is ever true, &#8212; that by gifts
or rewards the eyes of the wise are blinded and the hearts of the just are
corrupted, (Ecclus. 20:29,) for as soon erg judges open a way for rewards, they
cannot preserve integrity, however much they may wish to do so. And the same is
the case with the priests: for if any one is given to avarice, he will
adulterate the pure truth: it cannot be, that a complete liberty in teaching
should exist, except when the pastor is exempt from all desire of gain. It is
not therefore without reason that Micah complains here, that the princes as well
as the priests were hirelings in his day; and by this he means, that no
integrity remained among them, for the one, as I have said, follows from the
other. He does not say, that the princes were either cruel or perfidious, though
he had before mentioned these crimes; but in this place he simply calls them
mercenaries. But, as I have just said, the one vice cannot be separated from the
other; for every one who is hired will pervert judgment, whether he be a teacher
or a judge. Nothing then remains pure where avarice bears rule. It was therefore
quite sufficient for the Prophet to condemn the judges and the prophets and the
priests for avarice; for it is easy hence to conclude, that teaching was exposed
to sale, and that judgments were bought, so that he who offered most money
easily gained his cause.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge for

also<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teach for
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We can learn from this place the difference between
prophets and priests. Micah ascribes here the office or the duty of teaching to
the priests and leaves divination alone to the prophets. We have said elsewhere,
that it happened through the idleness of the priests, that prophets were added
to them; for prophesying belonged to them, until being content with the altar,
they neglected the office of teaching: and the same thing, as we find, has taken
place under the Papacy. For though it be quite evident for what reason pastors
were appointed to preside over the Church, we yet see that all, who proudly call
themselves pastors, are dumb dogs. Whence is this? Because they think that they
discharge their duties, by being only attentive to ceremonies; and they have
more than enough to occupy them: for the priestly office under the Papacy is
laborious enough as to trifles and scenic performances: (<i>ritus histrionicos
&#8212; </i>stage-playing rites) but at the same time they neglect the principal
thing &#8212; to feed the Lord&#8217;s flock with the doctrine of salvation.
Thus degenerated had the priests become under the Law. What is said by Malachi
ought to have been perpetuated, &#8212; that the law should be in the mouth of
the priest, that he should be the messenger and interpreter of the God of hosts,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7;) but the priests cast from them this office: it became therefore necessary
that prophets should be raised up, and as it were beyond the usual course of
things while yet the regular course formally remained. But the priests taught in
a cold manner; and the prophets divined, that is professed that oracles
respecting future things were revealed to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This distinction is now observed by the Prophet, when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The priests teach for
reward,</i> </font><font face="Palatino">that is, they were mercenaries, and
hirelings in their office: and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets divined for
money</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It then follows, that they yet<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>leaned on
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not Jehovah in the midst of
us? Come then shall not evil upon us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet shows here, as I have said at the beginning, that these profane men
trifled with God: for though they knew that they were extremely wicked, nay,
their crimes were openly known to all; yet they were not ashamed to lay claim to
the authority of God. And it has, we know, been a common wickedness almost in
all ages, and it greatly prevails at this day, &#8212; that men are satisfied
with having only the outward evidences of being the people of God. There was
then indeed an altar erected by the command of God; there were sacrifices made
according to the rule of the Law; and there were also great and illustrious
promises respecting that kingdom. Since then the sacrifices were daily
performed, and since the kingdom still retained its outward form, they thought
that God was, in a manner, bound to them. The same is the case at this day with
the great part of men; they presumptuously and absurdly boast of the external
forms of religion. The Papists possess the name of a Church, with which they are
extremely inflated; and then there is a great show and pomp in their ceremonies.
The hypocrites also among us boast of Baptism, and the Lord&#8217;s Supper, and
the name of Reformation; while, at the same time, these are nothing but
mockeries, by which the name of God and the whole of religion are profaned, when
no real piety flourishes in the heart. This was the reason why Micah now
expostulated with the prophets and the priests, and the king&#8217;s counselors;
it was, because they falsely pretended that they were the people of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff56</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by saying; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they relied on
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he did not condemn that
confidence which really reposes on God; for, in this respect, we cannot exceed
the bounds: as God&#8217;s goodness is infinite, so we cannot trust in his word
too much, if we embrace it in true faith. But the Prophet says, that hypocrites
leaned on Jehovah, because they flattered themselves with that naked and empty
distinction, that God had adopted them as his people. Hence the word,<i>
leaning</i> or recumbing, is not to be applied to the real trust of the heart,
but, on the contrary, to the presumption of men, who pretend the name of God,
and so give way to their own will, that they shake off not only all fear of God,
but also thought and reason. When, therefore, so great and so supine
thoughtlessness occupies the minds of men, stupidity presently follows: and yet
it is not without reason that Micah employs this expression, for hypocrites
persuade themselves that all things will be well with them, as they think that
they have God propitious to them. As then they feel no anxiety while they have
the idea that God is altogether at peace with them, the Prophet declares, by way
of irony, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>relied on
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he had said, that
they made the name of God their support: but yet the Prophet speaks in words
contrary to their obvious meaning,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katacrhstikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>loquitur </i>&#8212; speaks catachrestically;) for it is certain that no one
relies on Jehovah except he is humbled in himself. It is penitence that leads us
to God; for it is when we are cast down that we recumb on him; but he who is
inflated with self-confidence flies in the air, and has nothing solid in him.
And our Prophet, as I have said, intended indirectly to condemn the false
security in which hypocrites sleep, while they think it enough that the Lord had
once testified that they would be his people; but the condition is by them
disregarded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now recites their words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not Jehovah in the midst of
us? Come will not evil upon us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
question is a proof of a haughty self-confidence; for they ask as of a thing
indubitable, and it is an emphatic mode of speaking, by which they meant to say,
that Jehovah was among them. He who simply affirms a thing, does not show so
much pride as these hypocrites when they set forth this question, &#8220;Who
shall deny that Jehovah dwells in the midst of us?&#8221; God had indeed chosen
an habitation among them for himself; but a condition was interposed, and yet
they wished that he should be, as it were, tied to the temple, though they
considered not what God required from them. They hence declared that Jehovah was
in the midst of them; nay, they treated with disdain any one who dared to say a
word to the contrary: nor is there a doubt but that they poured forth blasts of
contempt on the Prophets. For whenever any one threatened what our Prophet
immediately subjoins, such an answer as this was ever ready on their lips,
&#8212; &#8220;What! will God then desert us and deny himself? Has he in vain
commanded the temple to be built among us? Has he falsely promised that we
should be a priestly kingdom? Dost thou not make God a covenant-breaker, by
representing him as approving of the terrors of thy discourse? But he cannot
deny himself:&#8221; We hence see why the Prophet had thus spoken; it was to
show that hypocrites boasted so to speaks of their proud confidence, because
they thought that God could not be separated from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us how preposterous it is
thus to abuse the name of God. There is indeed a reason why the Lord calls us to
himself, for without him we are miserable; he also promises to be propitious to
us, though, in many respects, we are guilty before him: he yet, at the same
time, calls us to repentance. Whosoever, then, indulges himself and continues
sunk in his vices, he is greatly deceived, if he applies to himself the promises
of God; for, as it has been said, the one cannot be separated from the other. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
when God is propitious to them, they rightly conclude, that all things will be
well with them, for we know that the paternal favor of God is a fountain of all
felicity. But in this there was a vicious reasoning, &#8212; that they promised
to themselves the favor of God through a false imagination of the flesh, and not
through his word. Thus we see that there is ever in hypocrisy some imitation of
piety: but there is a sophistry (<i>paralogismus</i>) either in the principle
itself or in the argument.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows a threatening,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore, on your account, Zion
as a field shall be plowed, and Jerusalem a heap shall be, and the mount of the
house as the high places of a forest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We
here see how intolerable to God hypocrites are; for it was no ordinary proof of
a dreadful vengeance, that the Lord should expose to reproach the holy city, and
mount Zion, and his own temple. This revenge, then, being so severe, shows that
to God there is nothing less tolerable than that false confidence with which
hypocrites swell, for it brings dishonor on God himself; for they could not
boast that they were God&#8217;s people without aspersing him with many
reproaches. What then is the meaning of this, &#8220;God is in the midst of
us,&#8221; except that they thereby declared that they were the representatives
(<i>vicarios</i>) of God, that the kingdom was sacred and also the priesthood?
Since then they boasted that they did not presumptuously claim either the
priesthood or the regal power, but that they were divinely appointed, we hence
see that their profanation of God&#8217;s name was most shameful. It is then no
wonder that God was so exceedingly displeased with them: and hence the Prophet
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For you shall Zion as a
field be plowed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said,
&#8220;This is like something monstrous, that the temple should be subverted,
that the holy mount and the whole city should be entirely demolished, and that
nothing should remain but a horrible desolation, &#8212; who can believe all
this? It shall however, take place, and it shall take place on your account; you
will have to bear the blame of this so monstrous a change.&#8221; For it was as
though God had thrown heaven and earth into confusion; inasmuch as he himself
was the founder of the temple; and we know with what high encomiums the place
was honored. Since then the temple was built, as it were, by the hand of God,
how could it be otherwise, but that, when destroyed, the waste and desolate
place should be regarded as a memorable proof of vengeance? There is therefore
no doubt but that Micah intended to mark out the atrocity of their guilt, when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For you shall Zion as a
field be plowed, Jerusalem shall become a heap of
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, it shall be so
desolated, that no vestige of a city, well formed and regularly built, shall
remain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the mount of the
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc.</i> He again mentions Zion, and
not without reason: for the Jews thought that they were protected by the city
Jerusalem; the whole country rested under its shadow, because it was the holy
habitation of God. And again, the city itself depended on the temple, and it was
supposed, that it was safe under this protection, and that it could hardly be
demolished without overthrowing the throne of God himself: for as God dwelt
between the cherubim, it was regarded by the people as a fortress incapable of
being assailed. As then the holiness of the mount deceived them, it was
necessary to repeat what was then almost incredible, at least difficult of being
believed. He therefore adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
mount of the house</i> </font><font face="Palatino">shall be<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the high places of a
forest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, trees shall grow
there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why does he again declare what had been before
expressed with sufficient clearness? Because it was not only a thing difficult
to be believed, but also wholly inconsistent with reason, when what the Lord had
said was considered, and that overlooked which hypocrites ever forget. God had
indeed made a covenant with the people; but hypocrites wished to have God, as it
were, bound to them, and, at the same time, to remain themselves free, yea, to
have a full liberty to lead a wicked life. Since then the Jews were fixed in
this false opinion, &#8212; that God could not be disunited from his people, the
Prophet confirms the same truth, that the mount of the house would be as the
high places of a forest. And, by way of concession, he calls it the mount of the
house, that is, of the temple; as though he said, &#8220;Though God had chosen
to himself a habitation, in which to dwell, yet this favor shall not keep the
temple from being deserted and laid waste; for it has been profaned by your
wickedness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see at what time Micah delivered this
prophecy. This we learn from Jeremiah 26; for when Jeremiah prophesied against
the temple, he was immediately seized and cast into prison; a tumultuous council
was held, and he was well nigh being brought forth unto execution. All the
princes condemned him; and when now he had no hope of deliverance, he wished,
not so much to plead his own cause, as to denounce a threatening on them, that
they might know that they could effect no good by condemning an innocent man.
&#8220;Micah, the Morasthite,&#8221; he said, &#8220;prophesied in the days of
Hezekiah, and said thus, &#8216;Zion as a field shall be plowed, Jerusalem shall
be a heap, and the mount of the house as the high placers of a
forest.&#8217;&#8221; Did the king and the people, he said, consult together to
kill him? Nay, but the king turned, and so God repented; that is, the Lord
deferred his vengeance; for king Hezekiah humbly deprecated the punishment which
had been denounced. We now then know with certainty the time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it was strange that under such a holy king so
many and so shameful corruptions prevailed, for he no doubt tried all he could
to exercise authority over the people, and by his own example taught the judges
faithfully and uprightly to discharge their office; but he was not able, with
all his efforts, to prevent the Priests, and the Judges, and the Prophets, from
being mercenaries. We hence learn how sedulously pious magistrates ought to
labor, lest the state of the Church should degenerate; for however vigilant they
may be, they can yet hardly, even with the greatest care, keep things (as
mankind are so full of vices) from becoming very soon worse. This is one thing.
And now the circumstance of the time ought to be noticed for another purpose:
Micah hesitated not to threaten with such a judgment the temple and the city,
though he saw that the king was endued with singular virtues. He might have
thought thus with himself, &#8220;King Hezekiah labored strenuously in the
execution of his high office: now if a reproof so sharp and so severe will reach
his ears, he will either despond, or think me to be a man extremely rigid, or,
it may be, he will become exasperated against sound doctrine.&#8221; The Prophet
might have weighed these things in his mind; but, nevertheless, he followed his
true course in teaching, and there is no doubt but that his severity pleased the
king, for we know that he was oppressed with great cares and anxieties, because
he could not, by all his striving, keep within proper bounds his counselors, the
priests and the prophets. He therefore wished to have God&#8217;s servants as
his helpers. And this is what pious magistrates always desire, that their toils
may in some measure be alleviated by the aid of the ministers of the word; for
when the ministers of the word only teach in a cold manner, and are not intent
on reproving vices, the severity of the magistrates will be hated by the people.
&#8220;Why, see, the ministers say nothing, and we hence conclude that they do
not perceive so great evils; and yet the magistrates with the drawn sword
inflict new punishments daily.&#8221; When, therefore, teachers are thus silent,
a greater odium no doubt is incurred by the magistrates: it is hence, as I have
said, a desirable thing for them, that the free reproofs of teachers should be
added to the punishments and judgments of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We further see how calm and meek was the spirit of
the king, that he could bear the great severity of the Prophet:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on your
accounts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> etc.:</i> &#8220;Thou oughtest at
least to have excepted&#8221; me.&#8221; For the king was not himself guilty.
Why then did he connect him with the rest? Because the whole body was infected
with contagion, and he spoke generally; and the good king did not retort nor
even murmur, but, as we have recited from Jeremiah, he humbly deprecated the
wrath of God, as though a part of the guilt belonged to him. Now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Micah begins his address to the faithful, who
were a remnant among that people; for though the infection had nearly extended
over the whole body, there were yet a few, we know, who sincerely worshipped
God. Hence Micah, that he might not dishearten God&#8217;s children by extreme
terror, reasonably adds what we have now heard, &#8212; that though for a time
the temple would be demolished and laid waste, it would yet be only for a
season, for the Lord would be again mindful of his covenant. When, therefore,
the Prophet had hitherto spoken of God&#8217;s dreadful vengeance, he directed
his discourse to the whole people and to the princess; but now, especially, and
as it were apart, addresses the pious and sincere servants of God; as though he
said, &#8220;There is now a reason why I should speak to the few: I have
hitherto spoken of the near judgment of God on the king&#8217;s counselors, the
priests and the prophets; in short, on the whole community, because they are all
become wicked and ungodly; a contempt of God and an irreclaimable obstinacy have
pervaded the whole body. Let them therefore have what they have deserved. But
now I address the children of God by themselves, for I have something to say to
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For though the Prophet publicly proclaimed this
promise, there is yet no doubt but that he had regard only to the children of
God, for others were not capable of receiving this consolation; nay, he had
shortly before condemned the extreme security of hypocrites, inasmuch as they
leaned upon God; that is, relied on a false pretense of religion, in thinking
that they were redeemed by a lawful price when they had offered their
sacrifices. And we know that we meet with the same thing in the writings of the
Prophets, and that it is a practice common among them to add consolations to
threatening, not for the sake of the whole people, but to sustain the faithful
in their hope, who would have despaired, had not a helping hand been stretched
forth to them: for the faithful, we know, tremble, as soon as God manifests any
token of wrath; for the more any one is touched with the fear of God, the more
he dreads his judgment, and fears on account of his threatening. We hence see
how necessary it is to moderate threatenings and terrors, when prophets and
teachers have a regard to the children of God; for, as I have said, they are
without these fearful enough. Let us then know that Micah has hitherto directed
his discourse to the wicked despisers of God, who yet put on the cloak of
religion; but now he turns his address to the true and pious worshipers of God.
And he further so addresses the faithful of his age, that his doctrine
especially belongs to us now; for how has it been, that the kingdom of God has
been propagated through all parts of the earth? How has it been, that the truth
of the gospel has come to us, and that we are made partakers with the ancient
people of the same adoption, except that this prophecy has been fulfilled? Then
the calling of the Gentiles, and consequently our salvation, is included in this
prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in the extremity
of days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the top of
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The extremity of days the
Prophet no doubt calls the coming of Christ, for then it was that the Church of
God was built anew; in short, since it was Christ that introduced the renovation
of the world, his advent is rightly called a new age; and hence it is also said
to be the extremity of days: and this mode of expression very frequently occurs
in Scripture; and we know that the time of the gospel is expressly called the
last days and the last time by John,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
2:18,) as well as by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:2,) and also by Paul,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:1;) and this way of speaking they borrowed from the prophets. On this
subject some remarks were made on Joel 2. Paul gives us the reason for this mode
of speaking in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:11: &#8220;Upon whom,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the ends of the
world are come.&#8221; As Christ then brought in the completion of all things at
his coming, the Prophet rightly says that it would be the last days when God
would restore his Church by the hand of the Redeemer. At the same time, Micah no
doubt intended to intimate that the time of God&#8217;s wrath would not be
short, but designed to show that its course would be for a long
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be in the last of days;</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">that is, when the Lord shall have executed his
vengeance by demolishing the temple, by destroying the city, and by reducing the
holy place into a solitude, this dreadful devastation shall continue, not for
one year, nor for two; in a word, it will not remain only for forty or fifty
years, but the Lord will let loose the reins of his wrath, that their minds may
long languish, and that no restoration may be evident. We now then understand
the Prophet&#8217;s design as to the last days.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls the mount,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mount of the house of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in a
sense different from what he did before; for then it was, as we have stated by
way of concession; and now he sets forth the reason why God did not wish wholly
to cast aside that mount; for he commanded his temple to be built there. It is
the same, then, as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;This ought not to be ascribed
to the holiness of the mountain, as if it excelled other mountains in dignity;
but because there the temple was founded, not by the authority of men, but by a
celestial oracle, as it is sufficiently known.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
mount</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the house of Jehovah shall be
set in order on the top of the
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is it shall surpass in
height all other mountains; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
it shall be raised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above the highest summits,
and assemble</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall all
nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is certain, that by these words of
the Prophet is to be understood no visible eminence of situation: for that mount
was not increased at the coming of Christ; and they who lived in the time of the
Prophet entertained no gross idea of this kind. But he speaks here of the
eminence of dignity, &#8212; that God would give to mount Zion a distinction so
eminent, that all other mountains would yield to its honor. And how was this
done? The explanation follows in the next verse. Lest, then, any one thought
that there would be some visible change in mount Zion, that it would increase in
size, the Prophet immediately explains what he meant and says, at the end of the
verse, Come shall nations to God. It is now easy to see what its elevation was
to be, &#8212; that God designed this mount to be, as it were, a royal seat. As
under the monarchy of the king of Persia, the whole of the east, we know, was
subject to one tower of the Persian; so also, when mount Zion became the seat of
sovereign power, God designed to reign there, and there he designed that the
whole world should be subject to him; and this is the reason and the Prophet
said that it would be higher than all other mountains. Hence his meaning, in
this expression, is sufficiently evident.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There follows, however, a fuller explanation, when he
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many nations would
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He said only before that nations
would come: but as David, even in his age, made some nations tributary to
himself, the Prophet here expresses something more, &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many nations would
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as if he had said, &#8220;Though
David subjugated some people to himself, yet the borders of his kingdom were
narrow and confined, compared with the largeness of that kingdom which the Lord
will establish at the coming of his Messiah: for not a few nations but many
shall assemble to serve him, and shall say,&#8221; etc. The Prophet now shows
that it would be a spiritual kingdom. When David subdued the Moabites and the
Amorites, and others, he imposed a certain tribute to be paid annually but he
was not able to establish among them the pure and legitimate worship of God, nor
was he able to unite them in one faith. Then the Moabites and other nations,
though they paid a tribute to David, did not yet worship the true God, but
continued ever alienated from the Church. But our Prophet shows that the
kingdom, which God would set up at the coming of the Messiah, would be
spiritual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For they shall say, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff62</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us you and ascend to the

forth shall a law from Zion, and the word of Jehovah from
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Throughout this passage the
Prophet teaches us, that people are not to be constrained by an armed force, or
by the power of the sword, to submit to David&#8217;s posterity, but that they
are to be really and thoroughly reformed, so that they submit themselves to God,
unite with the body of the Church, and become one people with the children of
Abraham; for they will yield a voluntary service, and embracing the teaching of
the Law, they will renounce their own superstitions. This then is the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning. But the remainder we shall defer till
to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
EIGHTY-EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain the prophecy, in which
Micah promises the restoration of the Church. We have said that this promise
cannot be understood except of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, for it refers to the last
days. And it was also added, that the superiority and eminence of mount Zion, of
which he speaks, cannot be otherwise understood than of God&#8217;s spiritual
kingdom; for the explanation follows, when he says, that many nations would come
to be taught in the ways of the Lord. We hence see that an earthly empire is not
what is here predicted, but what exists through the word and celestial doctrine.
But each particular ought to be considered by us. We yesterday said, that in the
distinct mention made of many nations, there is to be understood a contrast; for
till that time God was only known by one people. Since God then had chosen the
race of Abraham alone, there is here pointed out a future change, when he shall
gather his Church from various nations, so as to do away with the difference
between the Gentiles and the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall say, Come, and let us
ascend to the mount of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet shows in these words that not only each one would be obedient to God,
when called, but that they would also encourage one another: and this ardor is
what is justly required in the faithful; they ought to animate and stir on one
another; for it is not enough for each of us himself to obey God, but this zeal
ought to be added, by which we may strive to produce a mutual benefit. This
concern then is what the Prophet now refers to, when he says, &#8220;Come, that
we may ascend to the mountain of the Lord.&#8221; He might have said, that
people would come, and there close his sentence; but he wished to join the two
clauses, &#8212; that they, who had before despised the God of Israel, would
come from all parts, &#8212; and also that they would become exhorters to one
another. Come then that we may ascend. But the manner of the exhortation
deserves to be noticed; for each one offers himself as a companion in the
journey. We indeed see that many are prompt enough, when others are to be
stimulated in their duty; but they at the same time lie still; their whole
fervor is consumed in sending others, and they themselves move not, no, not a
finger; so far are they from running with alacrity in company with others. The
Prophet shows here, that the faithful will be so solicitous about the salvation
of their brethren that they will strenuously run themselves, and that they will
prescribe nothing to others but what they themselves perform. Come then that we
may ascend; they say not, &#8220;Go, ascend to the mount of Jehovah;&#8221; but,
Let us go together.&#8221; It is then the right way of encouraging, when we
really show that we require nothing from our brethren but what we desire to do
ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The circumstance of time must now be noticed; for
what the Prophet says respecting the nations coming into mount Zion, as it was
to be reduced to a waste, might have appeared a fable; for what had he shortly
before predicted? That Zion would be plowed as a field, and that trees would
grow there, that it would become a wild forest. How then could it be, that many
nations would flow to it as to a most renowned place, as it was to be reduced to
a dreadful desolation? But the Prophet here extols the wonderful power of God,
&#8212; that in this wild and desert place there would at length be raised a
noble and a celebrated temple, where God would show mercy to his own people.
Hence he promises what this mount of Jehovah would be, which was for a time to
be forsaken; and that there would be, as formerly, a noble temple in the place,
where desolation had for a season existed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will teach us of his
ways.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here
the Prophet in a few words defines the legitimate worship of God: for it would
not be sufficient for the nations to come together into one place to profess the
one true God, unless true obedience followed, which rests on faith, as faith
does on the word. It ought then to be especially noticed, that the Prophet sets
here the word of God before us, in order to show that true religion is founded
on the obedience of faith, and that God cannot be truly worshipped, except when
he himself teaches his people, and prescribes to them what is necessary to be
done. Hence when the will of God is revealed to us, we then can truly worship
him. When the word is again taken away, there will indeed be some form of divine
worship; but there will be no genuine religion, such as is pleasing to God. And
hence we also learn, that there is no other way of raising up the Church of God
than by the light of the word, in which God himself, by his own voice, points
out the way of salvation. Until then the truth shines, men cannot be united
together, so as to form a true Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since it is so, it follows, that where the truth is
either corrupted or despised, there is no religion, at least such as is approved
by God. Men may indeed boast of the name with their lips: but there is no true
religion before God, except it be formed according to the rule of his word. It
hence also follows, that there is no Church, except it be obedient to the word
of God, and be guided by it: for the prophet defines here what true religion is,
and also how God collects a Church for himself.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teach us of his
ways</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And a third particular may be
added, &#8212; that God is robbed of his right and of his honor, when mortals
assume to themselves the authority to teach; for it is to God alone that this
office of teaching his people can strictly be ascribed. (<i>proprie
tribuitur.</i>) There were then priests and prophets, yet Micah here brings them
down to their proper state, and shows that the right and the office of teaching
would be in the power of the only true God. We hence see that God claims this
office for himself, that we may not be tossed to and fro, and led astray by
various teachers, but continue in simple obedience to his word, so that he alone
may be the Supreme. In short, God is not the God and Head of the Church, except
he be the chief and the only Teacher.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wheat he now says, &#8220;He will teach us of his
ways,&#8221; ought to be thus understood. He will teach us what his ways are; as
though the Prophet had said, that the perfect wisdom of men is to understand
what pleases God, and what is his will: for there is nothing farther to be
learnt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we will walk in his
paths</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this clause we are reminded, that the
truth of God is not, as they say, speculative, but full of energizing power. God
then not only speaks to the end that every one may acknowledge that to be true
which proceeds from him, but at the same time he demands obedience. Hence we
shall then only be the disciples of God, when we walk in his ways: for if we
only nod with our ears, as asses are wont to do, and assent to what God says
with our mouth and lips, it is extremely vain and absurd. It is therefore then
only that men really profit under the teaching of God, when they form their life
according to his doctrine, and be prepared with their feet to walk, and to
follow whithersoever be may call them.

<div><font face="Palatino">Micah had hitherto related only what the faithful
would do; he now himself confirms the same truth,<i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the word of Jehovah from
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here is a reason given why many
nations would come to the temple of the Lord; and that is, because a doctrine
would be then promulgated, which had been before heard only in one place. We
indeed know that the Jews came to the temple, not only to worship, but also to
be instructed in the Law of God. The Law then had at that time, as it were, its
habitation in Zion: there was the sanctuary of celestial wisdom. But what does
our Prophet say? A law shall go forth from Zion, that is, it shall be proclaimed
far and wide: the Lord will show, not only in one corner, what true religion is,
and how he seeks to be worshipped, but he will send forth his voice to the
extreme limits of the earth. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall go forth from

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;the scepter of thy
power the Lord will send forth from Zion.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In that passage the doctrine of Christ is
metaphorically called a scepter, or is compared to a royal scepter; for Christ
does not otherwise rule among us, than by the doctrine of his Gospel: and there
David declares, that this scepter would be sent far abroad by God the Father,
that Christ might have under his rule all those nations which had been
previously aliens. Such is the meaning in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A law from Zion shall go
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of Jehovah from
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is a repetition of the
same sentiment, which is often the case. Then by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ture</i>, the Prophet means no other thing than doctrine: but, by another
term, he confirms the same thing, that is that God would be heard not only at
Jerusalem and in Judea, but that he would make his word to be proclaimed
everywhere. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here describes the fruit of Divine truth,
&#8212; that God would restore all nations to such gentleness, that they would
study to cultivate fraternal peace among themselves, and that all would consult
the good of others, having laid aside every desire for doing harm. As then he
has lately showed, that the Church of God could not be otherwise formed than by
the Word, and that the legitimate worship of God cannot be set up and continued,
except where God is honored with the obedience of faith; so now he shows that
Divine truth produces this effect, &#8212; that they, who before lived in enmity
towards one another and burned with the lust of doing harm, being full of
cruelty and avarice, will now, having their disposition changed, devote
themselves wholly to acts of kindness. But, before the Prophet comes to this
subject, he says, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among many people, and will
reprove strong nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word judge, in
Hebrew, means the same as to rule or govern. It is certain that God is spoken of
here: it is then the same as though the Prophet had said that though the nations
had not hitherto obeyed God, they would now own him as king and submit to his
government. God has indeed ever governed the world by his hidden providence, as
he does still govern it: for how much soever the devil and the ungodly may rage;
nay, how ever much they may boil with unbridled fury, there is no doubt but that
God restrains and checks their madness by his hidden bridle. But the Scripture
speaks of God&#8217;s kingdom in two respects. God does indeed govern the devil
and all the wicked, but not by his word, nor by the sanctifying power of his
Spirit: it is so done, that they obey God, not willingly, but against their
will. The peculiar government of God is that of his Church only, where, by his
word and Spirit, He bends the hearts of men to obedience, so that they follow
him voluntarily and willingly, being taught inwardly and outwardly, &#8212;
inwardly by the influence of the Spirit, &#8212; outwardly by the preaching of
the word. Hence it is said in Psalm 110, &#8216;Thy willing people shall then
assemble.&#8217; This is the government that is here described by the Prophet;
God then <i>shall judge;</i> not as he judges the world, but he will, in a
peculiar manner, make them obedient to himself so that they will look for
nothing else than to be wholly devoted to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as men must first be subdued before they render
to God such obedience, the Prophet expressly adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will
reprove</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> (corripiet)</i> or convince
<i>(arguet) </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And this sentence ought to be carefully
noticed; for we hence learn, that such is our innate pride, that not one of us
can become a fit disciple to God, except we be by force subdued. Truth then
would of itself freeze amidst such corruption as we have, except the Lord proved
us guilty, except he prepared us beforehand, as it were, by violent measures. We
now then perceive the design of the Prophet in connecting reproof with the
government of God: for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jky</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ikech,</i> signifies sometimes to expostulate, to convince, and sometimes to
correct or reprove. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
short, the wickedness and perversity of our flesh are here implied; for even the
best of us would never offer themselves to God, without being first subdued, and
that by God&#8217;s powerful correction. This, then, is the beginning of the
kingdom of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strong
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"> would be reproved, he hereby eulogizes
and sets forth the character of the kingdom of which he speaks: and we hence
learn the power of truth, &#8212; that strong men, when thus reproved, shall
offer themselves, without any resistance, to be ruled by God. Correction is
indeed necessary, but God employs no external force, nor any armed power, when
he makes the Church subject to himself: and yet he collects strong nations.
Hence then is seen the power of truth: for where there is strength, there is
confidence and arrogance, and also rebellious opposition. Since then the Lord,
without any other helps, thus corrects the perverseness of men, we hence see
with what inconceivable power God works, when he gathers his own Church. It is
to be added, that there is not the least doubt, but that this is to be applied
to the person of Christ. Micah speaks of God, without mentioning Christ by name;
for he was not yet manifested in the flesh: but we know that in his person has
this been fulfilled, &#8212; that God has governed the universe, and subjected
to himself the people of the whole world. We hence conclude that Christ is true
God; for he is not only a minister to the Father, as Moses, or any one of the
Prophets; but he is the supreme King of his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before I proceed to notice the fruit, the expression,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[
qwjr</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>od rechuk,</i> &#8220;afar off&#8221; must
be observed. It may intimate a length of time as well as distance of place.
Jonathan applies it to a long continuance of time, &#8212; that God would
convince men to the end of the world. But the Prophet, I doubt not, intended to
include the most distant countries; as though he had said, that God would not be
the king of one people only, or of Judea alone, but that his kingdom would be
propagated to the extremities of the earth.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He

<div><font face="Palatino">He afterward adds, with respect to the fruit,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall beat their swords into
plowshares, and their spears into
pruninghooks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I have already briefly
explained the meaning of the Prophet: he in fact shows that when the nations
should be taught by the word of God, there would be such a change, that every
one would study to do good, and to perform the duties of love towards his
neighbors. But by speaking of swords and spears he briefly intimates, what men,
until they are made gentle by the word of the Lord, are ever intent on
iniquitous tyranny and oppression; nor can it be otherwise, while every one
follows his own nature; for there are none who are not wedded to their own
advantages, and the cupidity of men is insatiable. As then all are thus intent
on gain, while every one is blinded by self-love, what but cruelty must ever
break forth from this wicked principle? Hence then it is, that men cannot
cultivate peace with one another; for every one seeks to be the first, and draws
every thing to himself; no one will willingly give way: then dissensions arise,
and from dissensions, fightings. This is what the Prophet intimates. And then he
adds, that the fruit of the doctrine of Christ would however be such, that men,
who were before like cruel wild beasts, would become gentle and meek.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they their
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Raise,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall not a nation a sword
against a nation, and accustom themselves they shall no more to
war</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He explains here more fully what I
have before said, &#8212; that the Gospel of Christ would be to the nations, as
it were, a standard of peace: as when a banner is raised up, soldiers engage in
battle, and their fury is kindled; so Micah ascribes a directly opposite office
to the Gospel of Christ, &#8212; that it will restore those to the cultivation
of peace and concord, who before were given to acts of hostility. For when he
says, &#8216;Raise a sword shall not a nation against nation,&#8217; he
intimates, as I have already stated, that wherever Christ does not reign, men
are wolves to men, for every one is disposed to devour all others. Hence as men
are naturally impelled by so blind an impulse, the Prophet declares, that this
madness cannot be corrected, that men will not cease from wars, that they will
not abstain from hostilities, until Christ becomes their teacher: for by the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dml</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed,</i> he implies, that it is a practice which ever prevails among
mankind, that they contend with one another, that they are ever prepared to do
injuries and wrongs, except when they put off their natural disposition. But
gentleness, whence does it proceed? Even from the teaching of the
Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to be remembered; for we here
learn, that there is not growing among us the real fruit of the Gospel, unless
we exercise mutual love and benevolence, and exert ourselves in doing good.
Though the Gospel is at this day purely preached among us, when yet we consider
how little progress we make in brotherly love, we ought justly to be ashamed of
our indolence. God proclaims daily that he is reconciled to us in his Son;
Christ testifies, that he is our peace with God, that he renders him propitious
to us, for this end, that we may live as brethren together. We indeed wish to be
deemed the children of God, and we wish to enjoy the reconciliation obtained for
us by the blood of Christ; but in the meantime we tear one another, we sharpen
our teeth, our dispositions are cruel. If then we desire really to prove
ourselves to be the disciples of Christ, we must attend to this part of divine
truth, each of us must strive to do good to his neighbors. But this cannot be
done without being opposed by our flesh; for we have a strong propensity to
self-love, and are inclined to seek too much our own advantages. We must
therefore put off these inordinate and sinful affections, that brotherly
kindness may succeed in their place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are also reminded that it is not enough for any
one to refrain from doing harm, unless he be also occupied in doing good to his
brethren. The Prophet might indeed have said only They shall break their swords
and their spears; so that they shall hereafter abstain from doing any hurt to
others: this only is not what he says; but, &#8220;They shall forge,&#8221; or
beat,&#8221; their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning
hooks;&#8221; that is, when they shall abstain from all injuries they will seek
to exercise themselves in the duties of love, consistently with what Paul says,
when he exhorts those who had stolen to steal no more, but to work with their
own hands, that they might relieve others
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:28.) Except then we endeavor to relieve the necessities of our brethren, and
to offer them assistance, there will not be in us but one part of true
conversion, as the case is with many, who are not indeed inhuman, who commit no
plunder, who give no occasion for complaint, but they live to themselves, and
enjoy unprofitable leisure. This indolence the Prophet here indirectly condemns,
when he speaks of the plowshares and the pruning hooks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, a question may be here asked, &#8212; Was this
fulfilled at the coming of Christ? It seems that the Prophet does not describe
here the state of the Church for a time, but shows what would be the kingdom of
Christ to the end. But we see, that when the Gospel was at first preached, the
whole world boiled with wars more than ever; and now, though the Gospel in many
parts is clearly preached, yet discords and contentions do not cease; we also
see that rapacity, ambition, and insatiable avarice, greatly prevail; and hence
arise contentions and bloody wars. And at the same time it would have been
inconsistent in the Prophet to have thus spoken of the kingdom of Christ, had
not God really designed to perform what is here predicted. My answer to this is,
&#8212; that as the kingdom of Christ was only begun in the world, when God
commanded the Gospel to be everywhere proclaimed, and as at this day its course
is not as yet completed; so that which the Prophet says here has not hitherto
taken place; but inasmuch as the number of the faithful is small, and the
greater part despise and reject the Gospel, so it happens, that plunders and
hostilities continue in the world. How so? Because the Prophet speaks here only
of the disciples of Christ. He shows the fruit of his doctrine, that wherever it
strikes a living root, it brings forth fruit: but the doctrine of the Gospel
strikes roots hardly in one out of a hundred. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
measure also of its progress must be taken to the account; for so far as any one
embraces the doctrine of the Gospel, so far he becomes gentle and seeks to do
good to his neighbors. But as we as yet carry about us the relics of sin in our
flesh, and as our knowledge of the Gospel is not yet perfect, it is no wonder,
that not one of us has hitherto wholly laid aside the depraved and sinful
affections of his flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is also easy hence to see, how foolish is the
conceit of those, who seek to take away the use of the sword, on account of the
Gospel. The Anabaptists, we know, have been turbulent, as though all civil order
were inconsistent with the kingdom of Christ, as though the kingdom of Christ
was made up of doctrine only, and that doctrine without any influence. We might
indeed do without the sword, were we angels in this world; but the number of the
godly, as I have already said, is small; it is therefore necessary that the rest
of the people should be restrained by a strong bridle; for the children of God
are found mixed together, either with cruel monsters or with wolves and
rapacious men. Some are indeed openly rebellious, others are hypocrites. The use
of the sword will therefore continue to the end of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now understand that at the time our Prophet
delivered this discourse, Isaiah had used the very same words,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:4:) and it is probable that Micah was a disciple of Isaiah. They, however,
exercised at the same time the Prophetic office, though Isaiah was the oldest.
But Micah was not ashamed to follow Isaiah and to borrow his words; for he was
not given to self ostentation, as though he would not adduce any thing but what
was his own; but he designedly adopted the expressions of Isaiah, and related
verbally what he had said, to show that there was a perfect agreement between
him and that illustrious minister of God, that his doctrine might obtain more
credit. We hence see how great was the simplicity of our Prophet, and that he
did not regard what malevolent and perverse men might say: &#8220;What! he only
repeats the words of another.&#8221; Such a calumny he wholly disregarded; and
he thought it enough to show that he faithfully declared what God had commanded.
Though we have not the </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qyjr
d[</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>od rechuk,</i> in Isaiah, yet the meaning is
the same: in all other things they agree. It now follows&#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Micah goes on here with the same subject, &#8212;
that when the minds of men shall be disposed to acts of kindness, every one
shall enjoy God&#8217;s blessing without being disturbed. There seems indeed to
be two things here included, &#8212; that acts of hostility shall cease, &#8212;
and that real happiness cannot exist among men, except Christ rules among them
by the doctrine of his Gospel. And the same thing the prophets teach elsewhere,
that is, that every one shall live without fear; and this they do, in order to
show that men ever live in a miserable dread, except when they are safe under
the protection of God. It is the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that
the life of men is most miserable, where the doctrine of the Gospel is not had,
inasmuch as when they are disturbed by continual disquietude, every one fears
for himself, every one suffers constant terrors. There is nothing more miserable
than such a state of things, for peace is the chief good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet to
be, &#8212; that under the reign of Christ the faithful shall enjoy true and
full happiness, as they shall be exempt from trembling and fear; hence he names
the vine and the fig-tree. He might have said, &#8220;Every one shall live
securely at home;&#8221; but he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall rest under his
own fig-tree and under his own vine;</i> </font><font face="Palatino">that is,
though exposed to thieves, he shall yet fear no violence, no injury; for those
who were thieves shall observe what is just and right; those who were bloody
shall study to do good. Hence when no one closes the door of his house, yea,
when he goes out into the fields and sleeps in the open air; he will still be
safe and secure. We now then see why the Prophet mentions here the fig-tree and
the vine, rather than the dwelling-house.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there will be no one to terrify
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What the Prophet designed to express is
here more clearly specified, &#8212; that there would be no danger, and that
there would therefore be no need of hiding-places or of any defenses. Why?
Because the very fields, he says, will be free from every thing that may hurt,
as there will be none to cause fear. And the Prophet seems to allude to the
blessing promised in the Law, for Moses used nearly the very same words: and the
Prophets, we know, drew many things from the Law; for their design was to retain
the people in its doctrine, and to render it as familiar as possible to them. As
then Moses promised, among other things, this security,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Ye shall sleep,
and none shall terrify you,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;032606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Leviticus
26:6;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so the Prophet also, in speaking here of the kingdom
of Christ, shows that this blessing would be then fully
accomplished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now at last subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The mouth of Jehovah
hath</i></font><font face="Palatino"> thus<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
that he might confirm what seemed incredible: for, as I have already said, since
he had shortly before predicted the devastation of mount Zion and the ruin of
the temple, it seemed very improbable that the nations would come there to
worship God. But he declares that the mouth of God had thus spoken, that the
faithful might overcome all obstacles and struggle against despair; though they
saw the temple destroyed, the mount Zion desolated, though they saw a horrible
waste and wild beasts occupying the place of men; they were yet to continue to
entertain firm hope. &#8212; How so? Because Jehovah has made a promise and he
will fulfill it: for when mention is made of God&#8217;s mouth, his omnipotence

<div><font face="Palatino">Micah, after having spoken of the restoration of the
Church, now confirms the same truth, and shows that the faithful would have
reason enough to cleave constantly to their God, and to despise all the
superstitions of the world, and that though they may be tossed here and there by
contrary opinions, they will yet continue in true religion. This verse then is
connected with the kingdom of Christ; for until we are gathered, and Christ
shines among us and rules us by his word, there can be in us no constancy, no
firmness. But when under the auspices of Christ, we join together in one body
the Church, such then becomes the constancy of our faith, that nothing can turn
us from the right course, though new storms were at any time to arise, by which
the whole world might be shaken, and though it were to happen that the universe
should be agitated or pass away. We now understand what the Prophet
means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All nations shall walk every
one in the name of his god.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This sentence must
be thus explained, &#8212; &#8220;Though nations be divided into various sects,
and each be addicted to their own superstitions, yet we shall continue firm in
the pure worship of God and in unity of faith.&#8221; But this question occurs,
how could the Prophet say that there would be such discords in the world, when
he had shortly before spoken of the Church being gathered and united together?
for he had said, Come shall all nations, and each will say, Come, let us ascend
into the mount of Jehovah. There seems to be here some sort of inconsistency,
&#8212; that all nations would come to mount Zion, and yet that every people
would have their own gods. But the solution is not difficult: the Prophet in
this verse strengthens the faithful, until Christ should be revealed to the
world: nor is there any doubt but the Prophet intended to sustain the confidence
of the godly, who might have otherwise been overwhelmed a hundred times with
despair. When the children of Israel were driven into exile, when their
inheritance was taken away from them, when the temple had been demolished, when,
in a word, no visible religion existed, they might, as I have said, have
desponded, had not this promise come to their minds, &#8212; that God would
restore mount Zion, and gather a Church from the whole world. But there was also
need of some confirmation, and this is what the Prophet now subjoins. Hence he
says, &#8220;Since the Lord gives you hope of so glorious a restoration, you
ought to feel confidence. and, in reliance on his promise, to continue in his
true worship, how much soever the Gentiles may serve their own idols, and boast
that they have the true God. However, then, every one of the nations may take
pride in their superstitions, you ought not to fluctuate, nor turn here and
there, like reeds, which are tossed to and fro, as the wind changes; but ye
shall continue firm and steady in your course; for ye know that God is true, who
has once for all adopted you, and has promised that your salvation will be the
object of his care, even when the world shall think you to be ruined and
lost.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that what the Prophet had in view was to
raise up into confidence the minds of the godly in the midst not only of
troubles, but of utter confusion.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
walk</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, when the temple and the
city shall be demolished, and the people be led into distant exile, the ungodly
will, at the same time, triumph, every one will extol his own gods: though our
God should not then appear, there will yet be no reason why we should be
discouraged; but we ought to recomb on his word.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall then walk in the name of
our God, and that for ever and ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
that is, though it should happen that the world should a hundred times be turned
and turned over again, there shall yet be no change in our minds: for as the
truth of God is eternal, so also our faith ought to be constant and never to
vary. Now the difficulty is removed, and we see how these two things agree,
&#8212; that all nations shall come and with one consent worship God, and yet
that to each of them there would be their own gods: for the diversity of time
must be here regarded, when all nations would walk every one in the name of his
god.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff69</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wyhla &#181;&ccedil;b
&ccedil;ya</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>aish beshem Aleiu,</i> he touches,
in an indirect way, on that variety which exists among men. Though all of them
pertinaciously follow and defend their own superstitions yet each one fabricates
a goal for himself. Thus it happens, that nothing is certain, for they follow
only their own inventions. But this the Prophet meant only to touch by the way.
His main object was that which I have stated, &#8212; that though the Church of
God would be small, and should find a great multitude opposed to it, it ought
not yet to succumb. We know how violent a thing is public consent; for when the
majority conspire together, the small number, who entertain a different opinion,
are, as it were instantly swallowed up. It is not then without reason that the
Prophet exhorts the faithful here to an invincible firmness of mind, that they
might triumph over all the nations. However small, then, might be the faithful
in number, the Prophet wished them to look down, as it were from a higher place,
not only on a large multitudes but on all mankind. Though then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all nations
walk</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc.</i>: nor is the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cal</i>, all, superfluous, &#8212; though<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all nations shall
walk</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> <i>etc.</i> There was then but one
nation, the offspring of Abraham, among whom true religion existed; and it was a
dreadful devastation, when God suffered the royal city and the temple to be
pulled down, and the whole body of the people to be torn asunder, to be driven
away here and there, so that no kingdom and no kind of civil community remained.
Hence the Prophet intimates here, that though the faithful should find that in
number and dignity they were far surpassed by their enemies, they yet should not
despair. &#8220;Though then all the nations walked, every one in the name of
their god, &#8212; though every people set up their superstitions against you,
and all conspired against you together, yet stand ye firm and proceed in your
course, and this not for a short time, but for ever and ever.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
this passage shows that faith depends not on the suffrages of men, and that we
ought not to regard what any one may think, or what may be the consent of all;
for the truth of God alone ought to be deemed sufficient by us. How much soever,
then, the whole world may oppose God, our faith ought not to be changeable, but
remain firm on this strong foundation, &#8212; that God, who cannot deceive, has
spoken. This is one thing. Then, in the second place, it must be added, that
this firmness ought to be perpetual. Though then Satan may excite against us new
troubles, since we have hitherto stood firm as to our faith in God&#8217;s word,
let us proceed in the same course to the end. And the Prophet designedly added
this verse; because he saw that the people would be subject to various and
long-continued temptations. It was a long captivity: hence languor might have,
as it were, wasted away all the confidence which the people then had. And
further, after they returned from exile, we know how often and how grievously
their faith was tried, when all their neighbors inimically assailed them, and
when they were afterwards oppressed by cruel tyranny. This was the reason why
the Prophet said that the children of God are to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walk perpetually and to the end
in his name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though he gives the name of gods to the idols of the
nations he yet shows that there is a great and striking difference; for the
nations worship their own gods, which they had invented: or how did they derive
their majesty and their power, except from the false imagination of men? But the
Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We will walk in the
name of Jehovah our God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He hence shows that
the power and authority of God is not founded on any vain device of men, for he
of himself exists, and will exist, though he were denied by the whole world. And
this also confirms what I have already stated, &#8212; that the faithful ought
thus to embrace the word of God, as they know that they have not to do with men,
the credit of whom is doubtful and inconstant, but with him who is the true God,
who cannot lie, and whose truth is immutable. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues the same subject. But we must
ever remember what I have previously reminded you of, &#8212; that the trials
would be so grievous and violent that there would be need of strong and uncommon
remedies; for the faithful might have been a hundred times sunk, as it were, in
the deepest gulfs, except they had been supported by various means. This then is
the reason why the Prophet confirms so fully the truth which we have noticed
respecting the restoration of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will gather the
halting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This metaphor is not only found
here; for David sage that his own affliction was like that of halting. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[lx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsaloe,</i> means the side: hence they metaphorically call those halters who
walk only on one side: it is the same as though he had said, that they were
maimed or weak. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He then
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will assemble the
ejected, whom I have afflicted.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">In the next
verse he repeats the same, I will make the halting, he says, a remnant; that is,
I will make her who is now halting to remain alive, and her who is cast afar
off,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> a strong
nation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">halana</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff72</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>enelae,</i> in a more refined manner, and say that it means, She who is gone
before; as though the Prophet said, God will sustain the halting, and to those
who are lively he will add strength. But this exposition is too strained. We see
that the context will not admit it; for the Prophet brings forward the Church
here as afflicted by the hand of God, and nigh utter ruin: and then, on the
other hand, he intimates, that it was to be restored by God&#8217;s power, and
that it would thereby gather new strength, and flourish as before: he therefore
calls the Church as one cast far away, as in the previous verse; and the other
verse clearly shows, that the Prophet&#8217;s design was no other but to point
out the twofold state of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, in the first place, we must observe, that the
Prophet meets the trial then present, which must have otherwise depressed the
hearts of the godly. He saw that they were in a manner broken down; and then
their dispersion was as it were a symbol of final ruin. If then the faithful had
their minds continually fixed on that spectacle, they might have a hundred times
despaired. The Prophet therefore comes here seasonably to their help, and
reminds them, that though they were now halting, there was yet in God new vigor;
that though they were scattered, it was yet in God&#8217;s power to gather those
who had been driven afar off. The meaning briefly is, that though the Church
differed nothing for a time from a dead man, or at least from one that is
maimed, no despair ought to be entertained; for the Lord sometimes raises up his
people, as though he raised the dead from the grave: and this fact ought to be
carefully noticed, for as soon as the Church of God does not shine forth, we
think that it is wholly extinct and destroyed. But the Church is so preserved in
the world, that it sometimes rises again from death: in short, the preservation
of the Church, almost every day, is accompanied with many
miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to bear in mind, that the life of the
Church is not without a resurrection, nay, it is not without many resurrections,
if the expression be allowed. This we learn from the words of the Prophet, when
he says, &#8216;I will then gather the halting, and assemble the driven
away;&#8217; and then he adds, &#8216;and her whom I have with evils
afflicted.&#8217; And this has been expressly said, that the faithful may know,
that God can bring out of the grave those whom he has delivered to death. For if
the Jews had been destroyed at the pleasure of their enemies, they could not
have hoped for so certain a remedy from God: but when they acknowledged that
nothing happened to them except through the just judgment of God, they could
entertain hope of restoration. How so? Because it is what is peculiar to God to
bring forth the dead, as I have already said, from the grave; as it is also his
work to kill. We then see that what the Prophet promised, respecting the
restoration of the Church, is confirmed by this verse: I am he, says God, who
has afflicted; cannot I again restore you to life? For as your death is in my
hand, so also is your salvation. If the Assyrians or the Chaldeans had gained
the victory over you against my will, there would be some difficulty in my
purpose of gathering you; but as nothing has happened but by my command, and as
I have proved that your salvation and your destruction is in my power, there is
no reason for you to think that it is difficult for me to gather you, who have
through my judgment been dispersed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make the halting a
remnant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By remnant he understands the
surviving Church. Hence the metaphor, halting, is extended even to destruction;
as though he said, &#8220;Though the Jews for a time may differ nothing from
dead men, I will yet cause them to rise again, that they may become again a new
people.&#8221; It was difficult to believe this at the time of exile: no wonder,
then, that the Prophet here promises that a posterity would be born from a
people that were dead. For though Babylon was to them like the grave, yet God
was able to do such a thing as to bring them forth as new men, as it really
happened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the driven afar off, a strong
nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When the Jews were scattered
here and there, how was it possible that God should from this miserable
devastation form for himself a new people, and also a strong people? But the
Prophet has put the contrary clauses in opposition to one another, that the
Jews, amazed at their own evils, and astonished, might not cast away every
consolation. As then he had dispersed them, he would again gather them, and
would not only do this, but also make them a strong nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reign shall Jehovah over them on
mount Zion, henceforth and for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet no doubt promises here the new restoration of that kingdom which God
himself had erected; for the salvation of the people was grounded on this
&#8212; that the posterity of David should reign, as we shall hereafter see. And
it is a common and usual thing with the prophets to set forth the kingdom of
David, whenever they speak of the salvation of the Church. It was necessary then
that the kingdom of David should be again established, in order that the Church
might flourish and be secure. But Micah does not here name the posterity of
David, but mentions Jehovah himself, not to exclude the kingdom of David, but to
show that God would become openly the founder of that kingdom, yea, that he
himself possessed the whole power. For though God governed the ancient people by
the hand of David, by the hand of Josiah and of Hezekiah, there was yet, as it
were, a shade intervening, so that God reigned not then visibly. The Prophet
then mentions here some difference between that shadowy kingdom and the latter
new kingdom, which, at the coming of the Messiah, God would openly set up.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah himself shall then reign
over them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said,
&#8220;Hitherto indeed, when the posterity of David held the government, as God
himself created both David and his sons, and as they were anointed by his
authority and command, it could not have been thought but that the kingdom was
his, though he governed his people by the ministry and agency of men: but now
God himself will ascend the throne in a conspicuous manner, so that no one may
doubt but that he is the king of his people.&#8221; And this was really and
actually fulfilled in the person of Christ. Though Christ was indeed the true
seed of David, he was yet at the same time Jehovah, even God manifested in the
flesh. We hence see, that the Prophet here in lofty terms extols the glory of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom; as though he had said that it would not be a shadowy
kingdom as it was under the Law.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah then shall reign over
you.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on mount
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that the seat of the kingdom of
Christ has not been continued on mount Zion; but this verse must be connected
with the beginning of this chapter. The Prophet has previously said, From Zion
shall go forth a law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. If then the
interpretation of this place be asked, that is, how Jehovah showed himself the
king of his people, and erected his throne on mount Zion, the answer is, that
from thence the law went forth from that place, as from a fountain flowed the
doctrine of salvation, to replenish the whole world. As then the Gospel, which
God caused to be promulgated through the whole world, had its beginning on mount
Zion, so the Prophet says that God would reign there. But we must at the same
time observe, that through the defection and perfidy of the people it has
happened that mount Zion is now only an insignificant corner of the earth, and
not the most eminent in the world, as also the city Jerusalem, according to the
prediction of Zechariah. Mount Zion then is now different from what it was
formerly; for wherever the doctrine of the Gospel is preached, there is God
really worshipped, there sacrifices are offered; in a word, there the spiritual
temple exists. But yet the commencement of the Gospel must be taken to the
account, if we would understand the real meaning of the Prophet, that is, that
Christ, or God in the person of Christ, began to reign on mount Zion, when the
doctrine of the Gospel from thence went forth to the extremities of the world.

however, the former sense be more approved, I will not contend; that is, that
Jerusalem is here called the tower of the flock on account of its devastation,
as it was reduced as it were into a cottage. As to the main import of the
passage, there is no ambiguity; for the Prophet here strengthens the minds of
the godly: they were not to regard the length of time, nor to allow their
thoughts, to be occupied with their present calamity, but to feel assured, that
what God had promised was in his power, that he could, as it were, raise the
dead, and thus restore the kingdom of David, which had been

<div><font face="Palatino">but soon after the death of Solomon, a small portion
only was reserved for his posterity, and at length the kingdom itself and its
dignity disappeared. This is the reason that the Prophet now says, that the
former kingdom would come.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to thee,
daughter of Zion, come shall the former
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is indeed no doubt, but
that by the former kingdom he understands its most flourishing condition,
recorded in Scripture, under David and Solomon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the daughter of Jerusalem
shall come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He expressly mentions the
daughter of Jerusalem, because the kingdom of Israel had obscured the glory of
the true kingdom. Hence the Prophet testifies here that God was not unmindful of
his promise, and that he would restore to Jerusalem the dignity which it had
lost, and unite the whole people into one body, that they might be no more
divided, but that one king would rule over the whole race of Abraham. But this
was not fulfilled, we are certain, at the coming of Christ, in a manner visible
to men: we must therefore bear in mind what Micah has previously taught, &#8212;
that this kingdom is spiritual; for he did not ascribe to Christ a golden
scepter, but a doctrine, &#8220;Come, and let us ascend unto the mount of
Jehovah, and he will teach us of his ways; and then he added,&#8221; From Zion
shall go forth a law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. This, then, ought
ever to be remembered, &#8212; that God has not rendered Jerusalem glorious in
the sight of men, as it was formerly, nor has he enriched it with influence and
wealth and earthly power; but he has yet restored the sovereign authority; for
he has not only subjected to himself the ten tribes which had formerly revolted,
but also the whole world. Let us go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet blends here things in their nature wholly
contrary, &#8212; that the Jews were for a time to be cut off, &#8212; and that
afterwards they were to recover their former state. Why, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dost thou cry out with
crying?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must notice the Prophet&#8217;s
design. He did not intend to overturn what he had before stated; but as the
minds of the godly might have fainted amidst so many changes, the Prophet here
gives them support, that they might continue firm in their faith; and hence he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why dost thou cry aloud
with loud crying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> That is, &#8220;I see
that grievous troubles will arise capable of shaking even the stoutest hearts:
time will be changeable; it will often be, that the faithful will be disturbed
and degraded; but though various tumults may arise, and tempests throw all
things into confusion, yet God will redeem his people.&#8221; We now then see
what the Prophet means by saying, Why dost thou now cry? Why dost thou make an
uproar? for the verb here properly means, not only to cry out, but also to sound
the trumpet; as though he said, Why do the Jews so much torment themselves?
There is he says, no doubt, a good reason.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is there no king among
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> This was doubtless the reason why
the Jews so much harassed themselves; it was, because God had deprived them of
their kingdom and of counsel: and we know what Jeremiah has said,
&#8216;Christ,&#8217; that is, the anointed of the Lord, &#8216;by whose life we
breathe, is slain,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;250420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:20.) Since, then, the whole Church derived as it were its life from the safety
of its king, the faithful could not be otherwise than filled with amazement when
the kingdom was upset and abolished; for the hope of salvation was taken
away<i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Is
there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not a king among thee? and
have thy counselors perished?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think
that the unfaithfulness of the people is here indirectly reproved, because they
thought themselves to be destitute of the help of God and of his Christ, as
though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Have ye forgotten what God has promised to you,
that he would be your king for ever, and would send the Messiah to rule over
you? nay, has he not promised that the kingdom of David would be perpetual?
Whence then, is this fear and trembling, as though God no longer reigned in the
midst of you, and the throne of David were hopelessly overturned?&#8221; These
interpreters, in confirmation of this opinion, say, that Christ is here
distinguished by the same title as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:7; where he is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;[wy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ivots</i>, a counselor. But as in this verse, it is the Prophet&#8217;s
design to terrify, and to reprove rather than to alleviate the grievousness of
evils by consolation; it is more probable, that their own destitution is set
before the people; as though Micah said, &#8220;What cause have you for
trembling? Is it because your king and all his counselors have been taken
away?&#8221; But what immediately follows proves that this sorrow arose from a
just cause; it was because they were stripped of all those things which had been
till that time the evidences of God&#8217;s favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has pain laid hold on thee as on
one in travail? Be in pain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
groan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, I will not prevent thee to grieve and to mourn; as though he said,
&#8220;Certainly even the strongest cannot look on calamities so dreadful,
without suffering the heaviest sorrow; but though God may for a time subject his
children to the greatest tortures, and expose them to the most grievous evils,
he will yet restore them at length from their exile.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt depart, he says, from
the city, and dwell in the field: thou shalt come even to Babylon; but there
thou shalt be delivered; there shall Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thy
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The import of the whole is,
that though God would have a care for his people, as he had promised, there was
yet no cause for the faithful to flatter themselves, as though they were to be
exempt from troubles; but the Prophet, on the contrary, exhorts them to prepare
themselves to undergo calamities, as they were not only to be ejected from their
country, and to wander in strange lands like vagrants, but were to be led away
into Babylon as to their grave.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to strengthen the minds of the faithful to bear
the cross, he gives them a hope of deliverance, and says, that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there
deliver</i></font><font face="Palatino"> them, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there
redeem</i></font><font face="Palatino"> them from the hand of their enemies. He
repeats the adverb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shem</i>, there, twice, and not without cause: for the faithful might have
excluded every hope of deliverance, as though the gate of God&#8217;s power had
been closed. And this is the reason why the Prophet repeats twice<i>, there,
there;</i> even from the grave he will deliver and redeem thee: &#8220;Extend
then your hope, not only to a small measure of favor, as though God could
deliver you only from a state of some small danger, but even to death itself.
Though then ye lay, as it were, in your graves, yet doubt not but that God will
stretch forth his hand to you, for he will be your deliverer. God then in whose
power is victory, can overcome many and innumerable
deaths.&#8221;</font><br></div>

may we, on the contrary, learn to raise up our eyes and minds, and all our
thoughts, to thy great power, by which thou quickenest the dead, and raises from
nothing things which are not, so that though we may be daily exposed to ruin,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet&#8217;s object here is to give some
alleviation to the faithful lest they should succumb under their calamities;
for, as we have stated, there were most grievous evils approaching, sufficient
to overwhelm the minds of the godly. The Prophet then raises up here, with the
moat suitable comfort, those who would have otherwise fainted under their
calamities; and the sum of the whole is this, &#8212; that the faithful were not
to be confounded on finding the ungodly proudly triumphing, as they are wont to
do, when they seem to have gained their wishes. Since, then, the wicked show a
petulant spirit beyond all bounds, the Prophet exhorts the faithful to sustain
themselves by God&#8217;s promises, and not to care for such insolence. He then
subjoins a promise, &#8212; that God would assemble all the forces of their
enemies, as when one gathers many ears of corn into a bundle, that he may thrash
them on the floor. I will come now to the words of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assemble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against thee do
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or strong nations: for, by
saying, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr
&#181;ywg</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>guim rebim</i>, he intimates one of
two things, either that they were strong, or that they were large in number: as
to the subject there is no great difference. The Prophet had this in view,
&#8212; that though the Church of God may be pressed by a great multitude of
enemies, it yet ought not to be broken down in mind: for the ungodly, while they
cruelly domineer, do not understand the design of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assemble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against thee do many
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He sets the thing before them,
to heal them of terror: for when we are beyond the reach of harm, we, for the
most part, too heedlessly despise all dangers; and then, when we come to a real
struggle, we tremble, or even fall and become wholly weak. This is the reason
why the Prophet sets before the Jews their prospects, and shows that the time
was near when they were to endure a siege, as enemies would, on all sides,
surround them. Assemble then do nations, and strong or many nations: he shows
here that the Jews had no reason to despond, though their enemies would far
exceed them in number, and in forces, and in courage, for it was enough for them
to be under the protection of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who say, condemned now shall be
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;nj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chenaph, </i>means to act wickedly and perversely. It may then be literally
rendered, &#8216;profane (scelerata) shall be Zion; and on it shall our eye
look:&#8217; but this word is often taken metaphorically for condemnation. The
meaning then is, &#8216;Zion is now condemned:&#8217; and the Prophet, no doubt,
intended to intimate here, that the enemies would so triumph, as though Zion
were not under the guardianship of God; as when any one, who has rendered
himself hateful by his vices, is left and forsaken by his patrons. So, then, the
Prophet here arms the faithful against the arrogance of their enemies, that they
might not despair, when they found that they were condemned by the consent of
all men, and that this was the opinion of all, &#8212; that they were forsaken
by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Consolation follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they know not the thoughts of
Jehovah, nor understand his counsel</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for verbs
in the past tense have the meaning of the present. Here the Prophet recalls the
attention of the godly to a subject the most suitable to them: for when the
wicked rise up so cruelly against us, we are apt to think that all things are
allowed to them, and then their reproaches and slanders immediately take
possession of our minds and thoughts, so that we in a manner measure God&#8217;s
judgment by their words. Hence when the ungodly deride our faith, and boast that
we are forsaken by God, we succumb, being as it were filled with amazement: and
nothing is easier than to shake off from us faith and the memory of God&#8217;s
promises, whenever the ungodly are thus insolent. The Prophet then does not
without cause apply a remedy which ought to be carefully observed by us.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who say, condemned is
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> but they are like the blind when
judging of colors, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for they
understand not the counsel of Jehovah and his thoughts they know not.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet had in view, which
was to show, &#8212; that the faithful would be unwise and foolish, if they
formed an opinion of God&#8217;s judgment according to the boasting of the
ungodly: for Satan carries them away in a furious manner; and when the Lord
gives them liberty to do evil, they think that they shall be conquerors to the
end. As then the ungodly are thus inebriated with foolish confidence, and
despise not only men, but God himself, the Prophet here holds up and supports
the minds of the godly that they might ascend higher, and thus understand that
the design of God was not the same as what the wicked thought, who neither
belonged to nor approached God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff78</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is especially needful to know this truth. Some at
the first sight may think it frigid, &#8220;O! than, what does the Prophet mean?
he says that what these declare is not the design of Jehovah; and this we
know.&#8221; But were all to examine the subject, they would then confess with
one mouth, that nothing could have been more seasonable than this consolation.
Now we are wounded by reproaches, and this very often happens to ingenuous men;
and then, while the ungodly vomit forth their slanders, we think that God rests
indifferently in heaven; and one of their words, like a cloud, obscures the
judgment of God. As soon as any one of the wicked derides us, and laughs at our
simplicity, threatens ferociously, and spreads forth his terrors, his words, as
I have said, are like a cloud intervening between us and God. This is the reason
why the Prophet says here, that the thoughts of Jehovah are different, and that
his counsel is different: in short, the Prophet&#8217;s object is to show, that
whenever the ungodly thus proudly despise us, and also reproachfully threaten
and terrify us, we ought to raise our thoughts to heaven. &#8212; Why so?
Because the design of God is another. Their boastings then will vanish, for they
arise from nothing, and they shall come to nothing, but the purpose of God shall
stand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us now see why the Prophet spoke here of the
design and thoughts of God: for if only these two words are brought before us,
there is certainly but little solid comfort, and nothing that has much force or
power. There is then another principle to be understood, &#8212; that the
thoughts of God are known to us, who are taught in his school. The counsel of
God then is not hidden, for it is revealed to us in his Word. Consolation
therefore depends on a higher and a more recondite doctrine; that is, that the
faithful, in their miseries, ought to contemplate the counsel of God as in a
mirror. And what is this? that when he afflicts us, he holds a remedy in his
hand, and that when he throws us into the grave, he can restore us to life and
safety. When, therefore, we understand this design of God, &#8212; that he
chastens his Church with temporal evils, and that the issue will ever be most
salutary, &#8212; when this is known by us, there is then no reason why the
slanders of the ungodly should deject our minds; and when they vomit forth all
their reproaches, we ought to adhere firmly to this counsel of God. But that the
ungodly are thus proud is no matter of wonder; for if they raise their horns
against God, why should they not despise us also, who are so few in number, and
of hardly any influence, at least not equal to what they possess? The Church is
indeed contemptible in the eyes of the world; and it is no wonder if our enemies
thus deride us, and load us with ridicule and contempt, when they dare to act so
frowardly towards God. But it is enough for us to know, that they do not
understand the counsel of God. We now then see the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, and
an explanation follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou shalt assemble
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a
sheaf</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
floor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet adds this clause as
an explanation, that we may know what the counsel of God is, which he has
mentioned, and that is, that God will collect the enemies as a sheaf. What is a
sheaf? It is a small quantity of corn, it may be three hundred or a thousand
ears of corn: they are ears of corn, and carried in a man&#8217;s hand. And
then, what is to be done with the sheaf? It is to be thrashed on the floor. It
was indeed difficult to believe, that enemies, when thus collected together on
every side, would be like a sheaf. If an army assembled against us, not only ten
or twenty thousand, but a much larger number, who would think, according to the
judgment of the flesh, that they would be like a sheaf? They shall be as so many
deaths and graves: even the thought of God ought to be to us of more account
than the formidable power of men. Whenever, therefore, our enemies exceed us in
strength and number, let us learn to arise to that secret counsel of God, of
which our Prophet now speaks; and then it will be easy for us to regard a vast
multitude to be no more than a handful. And he says, that our enemies are to be
gathered to a floor, that they may be thrashed there. They assemble themselves
for another purpose; for they think that we shall be presently in their power,
that they may swallow us up; but when they thus collect themselves and their
forces, the Lord will frustrate their purpose and cause them to be thrashed by
us. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise and thrash, daughter of Zion;
for I have made thy horn
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff80</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
iron, and thy hoofs brass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet here
confirms what he had previously said: and he exhorts the daughter of Zion to
arise; for it was necessary for her to have been cast down, so as to lie
prostrate on the ground. God did not indeed restore at once his Church, but
afflicted her for a time, so that she differed nothing from a dead man. As then
a dead body lies on the ground without any feeling, so also did the Church of
God lie prostrate. This is the reason why the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, daughter of
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though God, by his voice,
roused the dead. We hence see, that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ymwq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kumi,</i> is emphatical; for the Prophet reminds us, that there is no reason
for the faithful wholly to despair, when they find themselves thus cast down,
for their restoration is in the hand and power of God, as it is the peculiar
office of God to raise the dead. And this same truth ought to be applied for our
us, whenever we are so cast down, that no strength, no vigor, remains in us. How
then can we rise again? By the power of God, who by his voice alone can restore
us to life, which seemed to be wholly extinct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thrash, for I have made thy horn
iron, and thy hoofs brass.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">A mode of thrashing,
we know, was in use among the Jews the same with that in Italy and at this day
in French Provence. We here thrash the corn with flails; but there by treading.
The Prophet speaks here of this custom, and compares the Church of God to oxen;
as though he said &#8220;The Jews shall be like oxen with iron horns and brazen
hoofs that they may lay prostrate under them the whole strength of the nations.
However much then the nations may now excel, I will subject them under the feet
of my people, as if sheaves were thrashed by them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt separate or

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the Lord of the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet specifies the
end for which God had purposed to subject the heathen nations to his chosen
people, &#8212; that he might be glorified. This is the meaning. But they have
refined too much in allegories, who have thought that this prophecy ought to be
confined to the time of Christ: for the Prophet no doubt meant to extend
consolation to the whole kingdom of Christ, from the beginning to the end.
Others, not more correctly, say, that this is to be referred to the Babylonian
captivity because then Daniel and some others thrashed the people, when heathen
kings were induced through their teaching to restore the temple, and also to
offer some worship to the God of Israel. But on this point they are both
mistaken, because they take the word thrashing in a different sense from the
Prophet; for it commonly means that heathen nations are to be subjected to the
Church of God: and this takes place, whenever God stretches forth his hand to
the faithful, and suffers not the ungodly to exercise their cruelty as they
wish; yea, when he makes them humbly to supplicate the faithful. This often
happens in the world, as it is written of Christ, &#8216;thy enemies shall lick
the earth,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
72:9.) But this prophecy shall not be fulfilled until the last coming of Christ.
We indeed begin to tread on our enemies whenever God by his power destroys them,
or at least causes them to tremble and to be cast down, as we find that they
dread whenever any change takes place; and then they blandly profess that they
desire to serve God. So at this day it has happened both in France and in Italy.
How many hypocrites, for the sake of an earthly advantage, have submitted
themselves to God? and how many such England produced when the Gospel flourished
there? All the courtiers, and others who were unwilling to incur the displeasure
of the king, professed themselves to be the very best lovers of religion.

18:44.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see what the prophet means when he speaks of
thrashing: he intimates, that the Lord would often cause that the enemies of the
Church should be bruised, though no one crushed them: but, as I have said, we
must look forward to the last day, if we wish to see the complete fulfillment of
this prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt consecrate their
wealth to Jehovah, and their substance to the Lord of the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet shows here, that the
dominion is not to be hoped for by the children of God, that they may abound in
worldly pleasures, and appropriate every thing to themselves and also abuse
their power, as ungodly men are wont to do; but that all is to be applied to the
worship and the glory of God. For what purpose, then does God design his Church
to become eminent? That he himself may alone shine forth, and that the faithful
may rightly enjoy their honor, and not become thereby proud. There is, therefore
nothing more alien to the power of the Church than pride, or cruelty, or
avarice. This, then that is said ought to be carefully observed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their wealth thou shalt
consecrate to Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He had spoken
before of power, &#8220;Thou shalt bind strong people, thou shalt thrash them,
and thou shalt tread them under thy feet;&#8221; but lest the faithful should
turn all this to a purpose the Lord had not designed, a most suitable correction
is immediately added, and that is, that this power shall not be exercised
according to the will of men, but according to the will of God: Thou shalt then
consecrate, etc.; and he uses the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem</i>, which means to make a thing an anathema or an offering;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though he said &#8220;God will raise his Church that it may rule over its
enemies; but let the faithful at the same time take heed, that they rule not
tyrannically; for God designs ever to reign alone: therefore the whole
excellency, the whole dignity, the whole power of the Church ought to be applied
for this end, &#8212; that all things may become subject to God, and every thing
among the nations may be altogether sacred to him so that the worship of God may
flourish among the conquerors, as well as among the conquered.&#8221; We now
perceive the Prophet&#8217;s object in speaking of consecrating the wealth of
the nations. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">To encourage the faithful to patience, the Prophet
again reminds them that hard and severe time was nigh; for it was needful to put
them in mind often of the approaching calamity, lest terror should wholly
discourage them. As then there was danger from despair, the Prophet often
repeats what he has already said of God&#8217;s judgment, which was then
suspending over the people of Israel. And this mode and order of teaching ought
to be observed. When the Prophets threaten us, or denounce the punishment we
have deserved, we either become torpid, or grow angry with God, and murmur: but
when they set forth any thing of comfort, we then indulge ourselves and become
too secure. It is therefore necessary to connect threatening with promises, so
that we may be always ready to endure temporal evils, and that our minds,
sustained by hope, may, at the same time, depend on the Lord, and recomb on him.
It was for this reason that the Prophet again mentions what he had already
several times stated, &#8212; that the Jews would be surrounded by a siege. How
do these two things agree, &#8212; that the enemies, assembled together, would
be like sheaves which are taken to the floor to be trodden by the feet of
animals, &#8212; and that the Jews would be besieged? I answer, that these
things harmonize, because the temporary punishment, which God would inflict on
his Church, would not prevent him to restore it again whenever it pleased him.
Lest, therefore, security should creep over the minds of the godly, the Prophet
designed often to remind them of that dreadful calamity which might have
entirely upset them, had no support been afforded them, that is, had not God
sustained them by his word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt assemble
thyself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O daughter of a
troop</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yddgth</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>etgaddi,</i> and the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwdg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gadud,</i> sound alike; as though he said, Thou shalt he collected, O
daughter of collection. The Prophet addresses Jerusalem: but we must see why he
calls her the daughter of collection. Some think that by this word is designated
the splendid and wealthy state of Jerusalem; as though the Prophet said, &#8212;
&#8220;This city has been hitherto populous, but now it shall be reduced to such
straits that none shall dare to go forth beyond its gates, for they shall on
every side be surrounded.&#8221; But the Prophet calls Jerusalem the daughter of
a troop in another sense, &#8212; because they were wont to occasion great
troubles: as thieves agree together, and meet in troops for the purpose of
committing plunder; so also the Prophet calls Jerusalem the daughter of a troop,
for its citizens were wont willfully to do great evils, and like robbers to use
violence. Thou then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt now be
collected</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, thou shalt not send
forth thy troops, but enemies shall assemble thee together by a severe siege, so
that thou shalt contract thyself like a bundle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are, then, two clauses in this verse, &#8212;
that though the Lord resolved to help his Church, he would yet straiten her for
a time, &#8212; and then the Prophet shows the reason, lest they complained that
they were too severely treated: &#8220;You have been hitherto,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;without a cause oppressive to others: the time then is come when the Lord
will return to you your recompense.&#8221; As Isaiah says</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Woe to thee,
plunderer!</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Shalt thou not also be
exposed to plunder?&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
33:1;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so also in this place, &#8212; &#8220;Ye have
assembled in troops, that ye might pillage innocent men; therefore other troops
shall now encircle you; nay, ye shall be beset by your own fear.&#8221; The verb
is in Hithpael: he says not, &#8220;Thou daughter of a troop shalt be now
encircled;&#8221; but he says &#8220;Thou shalt gather
thyself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A siege has he set against
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may refer to God; but it must be
understood only of enemies: for the Prophet immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall strive with the
rod</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. in the pleural number, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall then strike with the
rod the cheek of the judge of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means
that the Jews would be subdued by their enemies that their judges and governors
would be exposed to every kind of contumely and dishonor, for to strike on the
cheek is to offer the greatest indignity; as indeed it is the greatest contempt,
as Demosthenes says, and is so mentioned by the lawyers. We now then perceive,
that the Prophet&#8217;s object was to show, &#8212; that the Jews in vain
boasted of their kingdom and civil constitution, for the Lord would expose the
governors of that kingdom to extreme contempt. The enemies then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall strike their judges even on
the cheek.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff85</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there follows immediately a consolation: we hence
see that the Prophet, at one time, humbles the children of God: and prepares
them for enduring the cross; and then he mitigates all sorrow; yea, and makes
them to rejoice in the midst of their evils. For this purpose he adds what
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou Bethlehem Ephratah, art small,
that thou shouldest be among the thousands of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As Matthew quotes this passage
differently, some think that it ought to be read as a question, And thou,
Bethlehem Ephratah, art thou the least among the provinces of Judah? Matthew
says &#8220;Thou art by no means the least, thou excellest. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff86</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8221;
But what need there is of distorting the words of the Prophet, as it was not the
design of the Evangelist to relate the expressions of the Prophet, but only to
point out the passage. As to the words, Matthew had regards to the condition of
the town Bethlehem, such as it was at the coming of Christ. It then indeed began
to be eminent: but the Prophet represents here how ignoble and mean a place
Bethlehem then was,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>art the least among the
thousands of Judah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some, not very wisely, give
this explanation, &#8220;Thou art the least among the thousands of Judah&#8221;;
that is, &#8220;Though there might be a thousand towns in the tribe of Judah,
yet thou couldest hardly have a place among so great a number.&#8221; But this
has been said through ignorance of a prevailing custom: for the Jews, we know,
were wont to divide their districts into thousands or chiliads. As in the army
there are centurions, so also in the divisions of every nation there are
hundreds; there are also in an army tribunes, who preside over a thousand men.
Thus the Prophet calls them thousands, that is, tribunes; for the districts are
so arranged, that the town, which, with its villages, could bring forth three
thousand men, had three prefectures; and it had three tribunes, or four or five,
if it was larger. The Prophet then, in order to show that this town was small
and hardly of any account, says, Thou, Bethlehem, art hardly sufficient to be
one province. And it was a proof of its smallness that hardly a thousand men
could be made up from Bethlehem and its neighboring villages. There were not, we
know, many towns in the tribe of Judah; and yet a large army could be there
collected. Since then the town of Bethlehem was so small, that it could hardly
attain the rank of a province, it is hence no doubt evident that it was but a
mean town. We now perceive what the Prophet had in view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou,
Bethlehem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>art small among the cities of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> yet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
or go forth, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for me shall one
from thee, who is to be a Ruler in Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
calls it Bethlehem Ephratah; for they say that there was another Bethlehem in
the tribe of Zebulon, and we know that Ephratah in meaning is nearly the same
with Bethlehem; for both designate an abundance of fruit or provisions: and
there David was born.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will now proceed to the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From thee shall go forth for me
one who is to be a Ruler</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the
Prophet introduces God as the speaker,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall one
for</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> me.</i> God declares in this passage
that it was not his purpose so to destroy his people, but that he intended,
after a season, to restore them again. He therefore recalls the attention of the
faithful to himself and to his eternal counsel; as though he said, &#8212;
&#8220;I have thus for a time cast you away, that I may yet manifest my care for
you.&#8221;<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall go forth one who is to be a
Ruler in Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now there is no doubt but that
the Prophet at the sable time recalls the attention of the faithful to the
promise which had been given to David. For whence arises the hope of salvation
to the chosen people, except from the perpetuity of that kingdom? The Prophet
now says, &#8212; &#8220;There is indeed a reason, according to the perception
of the flesh, why the faithful should despond; for whence does their confidence
arise, except from the kingdom of David? and from what place is David to arise?
Even from Bethlehem; for Bethlehem has been called the city of David; and yet it
is an obscure and a small town, and can hardly be considered a common province.
Since it is so, the minds of the faithful may be depressed; but this smallness
shall be no hindrance to the Lord, that he should not bring forth from thence a
new king.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Even before the time of David Bethlehem was a small
town, and one of the most common provinces. Who could have expected that a king
would have been chosen from such a hamlet, and then, that he should come from a
hut? for David belonged to a pastoral family; his father was a shepherd, and he
was the least among his brethren. Who then could have thought that light would
have arisen from such a corner, yea, from so mean a cottage? This was done
contrary to the expectations of men. Hence the Prophet sets here before the
faithful a similar expectation for their comfort; as though he said, &#8212;
&#8220;Has not God once formed a most perfect state of things by making David a
king, so that the people became in every respect happy and blessed? And whence
did David come? It was from Bethlehem. There is then no reason why your present
miseries should over-much distress you; for God can again from the same place
bring forth a king to you, and he will do so.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bethlehem, small art
thou,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> etc.</i> The prophet doubtless
intended here that the faithful should consider of what kind was the beginning
of that most perfect state, when David was chosen king. David was a shepherd, a
man in humble life, without reputation, without influence, and even the humblest
among his brethren. Since then God had drawn light out of darkness there was no
cause for the faithful to despair of a future restoration, considering what had
been the beginning of the previous happy condition of the people. We now
understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. But the rest I cannot finish today; I
must therefore defer it till tomorrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Greet, Almighty God, that as we cease
not to provoke thy wrath against us, and as it is needful for us to be often
chastised by thy hand, that we may be humbled and learn to submit ourselves to

scourges, but ever raise up our minds to the hope of deliverance, which thou
givest to us through our Mediator; whom thou hast once for all sent into the
world, that thou mightest through him reconcile us to thyself, and through whom
also thou bringest help whenever we need it and may we at the same time learn to
rely on thy only-begotten Son, so that with courageous minds we may pass through
all the miseries of this world, and never at any time grow weary, until having
at length obtained the victory, we come to that blessed rest and enjoy the fruit
of our victory, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINETY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain the promise by which
our Prophet designed to sustain the minds of the faithful, lest they should
despair in their heavy trial. He reminds them, as it has been stated, of the
commencement of the kingdom: as David had been raised as it were from nothing,
and God has given in him an example of his wonderful grace, the Prophet reminds
the godly, that the same is now to be expected, that God will again raise up the
fallen kingdom. &#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth
then from Bethlehem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> shall one who is to be a
Ruler in Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> though it was but a
mean town. He calls him a Ruler in Israel; for he had before declared that there
would be such a dreadful judgment, that the enemy would strike with the hand the
face of the judge; and this was the same as though the Prophet had said, that no
honor would be shown to the people, for the chief himself would be beaten. He
therefore now promises a new Ruler, he promises that there would be again some
civil order to be found among the people; for a governor could not have been
struck on the check, except all authority and honor had departed. We then see
what the Prophet intended by mentioning the word, Ruler; it was to show, that
God would again cause that a new Prince would arise to govern the people. It was
therefore a remedy to their devastation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His going forth is from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or from far antiquity
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and from the days of
ages</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is from the days of eternity.
He intimates here that it would not be a sudden thing, that a prince should
arise to govern the people; for it had been already long ago determined by God.
This is the plain meaning. Some, I know, pertinaciously maintain, that the
Prophet speaks here of the eternal existence of Christ; and as for myself I
willingly own that the divinity of Christ is here proved to us; but as this will
never be allowed by the Jews, I prefer taking the words simply as they are,
&#8212; that Christ will not come forth unexpectedly from Bethlehem, as though
God had previously determined nothing respecting him.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His goings forth, then, are from
the beginning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But others bring a new
refinement, &#8212; that the Prophet uses the plural number, his goings forth,
to designate the twofold nature of Christ: but there is in this an absurdity;
for the Prophet could not properly nor wisely mention the human nature of Christ
with the divine, with reference to eternity. The Word of God, we know, was
eternal; and we know, that when the fullness of time came, as Paul says, Christ
put on our nature,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:4.) Hence the beginning of Christ as to the flesh was not so old, if his
existence be spoken of: to set them together then would have been absurd. It is
a common thing in Hebrew to use the plural for the singular number. He says
then, that the going forth of Christ is from eternity; for he will not go forth
suddenly from Bethlehem, as one who rises unexpectedly to bring help, when
things are in a hopeless state, and so rises, when nothing had been foreseen.
But the Prophet declares that the going forth of Christ would be different,
&#8212; that God had from the beginning determined to give his people an eternal
king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, we must repudiate that gloss with
which the Rabbis are pleased; for they say that the Messiah was created before
the creation of the world, and also the throne of eternity, and the Law, and
other things; but these are insipid fables. The Prophet shows simply, that even
before the world was made Christ was chief, no he is also called the Firstborn
of every creature, for by him all things were created,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:15) and the same Word of God, by whom the world was created, is to be the Head
of the Church and by him what has been lost is to be recovered. We now then
comprehend what the Prophet meant by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the goings
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are from
eternity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But I would not concede to the
Jews, that only by the perpetual appointment of God the going forth of Christ
has been from the beginning, or from all ages: but two things must be noticed by
us, &#8212; that Christ, who was manifested in the flesh that he might redeem
the Church of God, was the eternal Word, by whom the world was created, &#8212;
and then, that he ass destined by the eternal counsel of God to be the
first-born of every creature, and especially to be the Head of the Church, that
he might restore a fallen world by his grace and power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the reason why the Prophet connects
together these two things, &#8212; that there would go forth one from Bethlehem
who would rule among Israel, &#8212; and yet that his goings forth have been
from eternity: for if he had only said what I explained yesterday, an objection
might easily have been made, and this might have come into the mind of some,
&#8212; &#8220;Why dost thou say that one will come from Bethlehem who will
govern the chosen people, as though God were to contrive a new remedy on seeing
that it is all over with respect to the deliverance of his Church?&#8221; The
Prophet here anticipates this objection, and reminds us, that his goings forth
have been from eternity, that they have been already decreed, even from the
beginning; for with God there is nothing new, so that he should stand in need of
holding any unlooked for consultation; as is the case with us when any thing
happens which we in no degree apprehended; we then find it necessary to devise
some new measures. The Prophet shows that nothing of this kind can happen to
God: but all this, &#8212; that people are reduced to nothing, &#8212; and that
they are again restored by Christ, &#8212; all this is overruled by his secret
and incomprehensible providence. His goings forth then are from the beginning,
and from the days of eternity. Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here again so moderates his words, that
the Jews might understand, that they were to endure many evils before God
relieved their miseries. He wished then here to prepare the minds of the godly
to bear evils, that they might not despair in great troubles, nor be depressed
by extreme fear. He then states these two things, &#8212; that the people, as
they deserved, would be heavily afflicted, &#8212; and then that God,
notwithstanding such severe punishment, would be mindful of his covenant, so as
to gather at length some remnants and not to suffer his people to be wholly
destroyed. He therefore promises a middle course between a prosperous state and
destruction. The people, says the Prophet, shall not continue entire. &#8212;
How so? For God will cut off the kingdom and the city; and yet he will afford
relief to the miserable: When they shall think that they are given up to entire
ruin, he will stretch forth his hand to them. This is the sum of the
whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that they shall be delivered up, that
is, forsaken by God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until she
who is in travail bringeth forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
are those who apply this to the blessed virgin; as though Micah had said that
the Jews were to look forward to the time when the Virgin would bring forth
Christ: but all may easily see that this is a forced interpretation. The
Prophet, I have no doubt, in using this similitude, compares the body of the
people to a woman with child. The similitude of a woman in travail is variously
applied. The wicked, when they promise to themselves impunity, are suddenly and
violently laid hold on: thus their destruction is like the travail of a woman
with child. But the meaning of this passage is different; for the Prophet says
that the Jews would be like pregnant women, for this reason, &#8212; that though
they would have to endure the greatest sorrows, there yet would follow a joyful
and happy issue. And Christ himself employs this example for the same
purpose,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;A woman,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;has sorrow when she brings forth, but immediately rejoices when she sees
a man born into the world,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
16:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So Micah says in this place, that the chosen people
would have a happy deliverance from their miseries, for they would bring forth.
There shall indeed be the most grievous sorrows, but their issue will be joy,
that is, when they shall know that they and their salvation had been the objects
of God&#8217;s care, when they shall understand that their chastisements had
been useful to them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then she who is in travail
bringeth forth, God, he says, will forsake
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are then two clauses in this verse; &#8212; the
first is, that the Jews were for a time to be forsaken, as though they were no
longer under the power and protection of God; &#8212; the other is that God
would be always their guardian, for a bringing forth would follow their sorrows.
The following passage in Isaiah is of an opposite character;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;We have been in
sorrow, we have been in
travail,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and we brought forth
wind,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
26:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The faithful complain there that they had been
oppressed with the severest troubles, and had come to the birth, but that they
brought forth nothing but wind, that is, that they had been deceived by vain
expectation, for the issue did not prove to be what they had hoped. But the Lord
promises here by Micah something better, and that is, that the end of all their
evils would be the happy restoration of the people, as when a woman receives a
compensation for all her sorrows when she sees that a child is
born.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he confirms this sentence by another, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the children of Israel
shall return, or be converted, the residue of his
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet then intimates that it could not be otherwise but that God would not
only scatter, but tread under foot his people, so that their calamity would
threaten an unavoidable destruction. This is one thing; but in the meantime he
promises that there would be some saved. But he speaks of a remnant, as we have
observed elsewhere, lest hypocrites should think that they could escape
unpunished, while they trifled with God. The Prophet then shows that there would
come such a calamity as would nearly extinguish the people, but that some would
be preserved through God&#8217;s mercy and that beyond ordinary expectation.

<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt but that the Prophet continues here
to speak of Christ; and though the Jews shamelessly pervert the whole Scripture,
they yet cannot deny that Micah calls here the attention of all the godly to the
coming of Christ, yea, of all who hope or desire to obtain salvation. This is
certain. Let us now see what the Prophet ascribes to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall
stand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and feed in the power of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The word, stand, designates
perseverance, as though he had said, that it would not be for a short time that
God would gather by Christ the remnant of the people; that it would not be, as
it often happens, when some rays of joy shine, and then immediately vanish. The
Prophet shows here that the kingdom of Christ would be durable and permanent. It
will then proceed; for Christ will not only rule his Church for a few days, but
his kingdom will continue to stand through unbroken series of years and of ages.
We nor then understand the Prophet&#8217;s object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds in the second place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall feed in the strength of
Jehovah, in the greatness of the name of Jehovah his
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> by which words he means, that there
would be sufficient power in Christ to defend his Church. The Church, we know,
is in this world subject to various troubles, for it is never without enemies;
for Satan always finds those whom he induces, and whose fury he employs to
harass the children of God. As then the Church of God is tossed by many
tempests, it has need of a strong and invincible defender. Hence this
distinction is now ascribed by our Prophet to Christ, &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall feed in the strength of
Jehovah, and in the majesty of his God.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">As to
the word feed, it no doubt expresses what Christ is to his people, to the flock
committed to him and to his care. Christ then rules not in his Church as a
dreaded tyrant, who distresses his subjects with fear; but he is a Shepherd who
gently deals with his flock. Nothing therefore can exceed the kindness and
gentleness of Christ towards the faithful, as he performs the office of a
Shepherd: and he prefers to be adorned with this, title, rather than to be
called and deemed a kings, or to assume authority to himself. But the Prophet,
on the other hand, shows, that the power of Christ would be dreadful to the
ungodly and wicked. He shall feed, he says, &#8212; with regard to his flock,
Christ will put on a character full of gentleness; for nothing, as I have said
can imply more kindness than the word shepherd: but as we are on every side
surrounded by enemies, the Prophet adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He shall feed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the power of Jehovah and in
the majesty of the name of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that
is as much power as there is in God, so much protection will there be in Christ,
whenever it will be necessary to defend and protect the Church against her
enemies. Let us hence learn that no less safety is to be expected from Christ,
than there is of power in God. Now, since the power of God, as we confess, is
immeasurable, and since his omnipotence far surpasses and swallows up all our
conceptions, let us hence learn to extend both high and low all our hopes.
&#8212; Why so? Because we have a King sufficiently powerful, who has undertaken
to defend us, and to whose protection the Father has committed us. Since then we
have been delivered up to Christ&#8217;s care and defense, there is no cause why
we should doubt respecting our safety. He is indeed a Shepherd, and for our sake
he thus condescended and refused not so mean a name; for in a shepherd there is
no pomp nor grandeur. But though Christ, for our sake, put on the character of a
Shepherd, and disowns not the office, he is yet endued with infinite power.
&#8212; How so? Because he governs not the Church after a human manner,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but in the majesty of the name of
his God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff90A</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, that he subjects Christ to God, he refers to his
human nature. Though Christ is God manifested in the flesh, he is yet made
subject to God the Father, as our Mediator and the Head of the Church in human
nature: he is indeed the middle Person between God and us. This then is the
reason why the Prophet now says, that Christ has power, as it were, at the will
of another; not that Christ is only man, but as he appears to us in the person
of man, he is said to receive power from his Father; and this, as it has been
said, with respect to his human nature. There is yet another reason why the
Prophet has expressly added this, &#8212; that we may know that Christ, as the
protector of the Church, cannot be separated from his Father: as then God is
God, so Christ is his minister to preserve the Church. In a word, the Prophet
means that God is not to be viewed by the faithful, except through the
intervening Mediator; and he means also that the Mediator is not to be viewed,
except as one who receives supreme power from God himself and who is armed with
omnipotence to preserve his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall dwell; for he shall
now be magnified to the extremities of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He promises a secure habitation
to the faithful; for Christ shall be extolled to the utmost regions of the
world. We here see that he is promised to foreign nations: for it would have
been enough for Christ to exercise his supreme power within the borders of
Judea, had only one nation been committed to his safe keeping. But as God the
Father intended that he should be the author of salvation to all nations, we
hence learn that it was necessary that he should be extolled to the utmost
borders of the earth. But with regard to the word dwell, it is explained more
fully in the next verse, when the Prophet says&#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Micah, as I have said, confirms his former statement.
By the word <i>dwell,</i> he no doubt meant a quiet and peaceable inhabitation;
as though he had said, that the children of God would, under Christ, be safe and
secure. Now he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall
be our peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It might have been asked,
&#8220;Whence will come this secure dwelling? For the land has been very often
wasted, and the people have been at length driven to exile. How then can we now
venture to hope for what thou promises, that we shall be quiet and
secure?&#8221; Because, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall be our
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and we ought to be satisfied with
the protection of the King whom God the Father has given us. Let his shadow,
then, suffice us, and we shall be safe enough from all troubles. We now see in
what sense the Prophet calls Christ the Peace of his people or of his Church; he
so calls him because he will drive far away all hurtful things, and will be
armed with strength and invincible power to check all the ungodly, that they may
not make war on the children of God, or to prevent them in their course, should
they excite any disturbances.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We further know, that Christ is in another way our
peace; for he has reconciled us to the Father. And what would it avail us to be
safe from earthly annoyances, if we were not certain that God is reconciled to
us? Except then our minds acquiesce in the paternal benevolence of God, we must
necessarily tremble at all times, though no one were to cause us any trouble:
nay, were all men our friends, and were all to applaud us, miserable still would
be our condition, and we should toil with disquietude, except our consciences
were pacified with the sure confidence that God is our Father. Christ then can
be our peace in no other way than by reconciling God to us. But at the same time
the Prophet speaks generally, &#8212; that we shall lie safely under the shadow
of Christ, and that no evil ought to be feared, &#8212; that though Satan should
furiously assail us, and the whole worth become mad against us, we ought yet to
fear nothing, if Christ keeps and protects us under his wings. This then is the
meaning, when it is said here that Christ is our peace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Assyrian shall come into
our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces then we shall raise up against
him or on him, seven shepherds and eighty princes of the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet intimates that the Church of God would not be free from troubles, even
after the coming of Christ: for I am disposed to refer this to the intervening
time, though interpreters put another construction on the words of the Prophet.
But this meaning, is far more suitable, &#8212; that while the help which God
promised was expected and yet suspended, the Assyrians would come, who would
pass far and wide through the land of Israel. Hence he says, that though Assur
should come to our land, and break through, with such force and violence that we
could not drive him out, we shall yet set up for ourselves shepherds and princes
against him. It must at the same time be observed, that this prophecy is not to
be confined to that short time; for the Prophet speaks generally of the
preservation of the Church before as well as after the coming of Christ; as
though he said, &#8212; &#8220;I have said that the king, who shall be born to
you, and shall go forth from Bethlehem, shall be your peace; but before he shall
be revealed to the world, God will gather his Church, and there shall emerge as
from a dead body Princes as well as Shepherds, who will repel unjust violence,
nay, who will subdue the Assyrians.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what the prophet had in view: After having
honored Christ with this remarkable commendation &#8212; that he alone is
sufficient to give us a quiet life, he adds that God would be the preserver of
his Church, so as to deliver it from its enemies. But there is a circumstance
here expressed which ought to be noticed: Micah says, that when the Assyrians
shall pass through the land and tread down all the palaces, God would then
become the deliverer of his people. It might have been objected, and said,
&#8220;Why not sooner? Would it have been better to prevent this? Why! God now
looks as it were indifferently on the force of the enemies, and loosens the
reins to them, that they plunder the whole land, and break through to the very
middle of it. Why then does not God give earlier relief?&#8221; But we see the
manner in which God intends to preserve his Church: for as the faithful often
need some chastisement, God humbles them when it is expedient, and then delivers
them. This is the reason why God allowed such liberty to the Assyrians before he
supplied assistance. And we also see that this discourse is so moderated by the
Prophet, that he shows, on the one hand, that the Church would not always be
free from evils, &#8212; the Assyrians shall come, they shall tread down our
palaces, &#8212; this must be endured by God&#8217;s children, and ought in time
to prepare their minds to bear troubles; but, on the other hand, a consolation
follows; for when the Assyrians shall thus penetrate into our land, and nothing
shall be concealed or hidden from them, then the Lord will cause new shepherds
to arise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet means that the body of the people would
be for some time mutilated and, as it were, mangled; and so it was, until they
returned from Exile. For he would have said this to no purpose,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall set up for
ourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> if there had been an unbroken
succession of regular government; he could not have said in that case, After
Assur shall come into our land, we shall set up princes; but, There shall be
princes when Assur shall come. The word <i>set up</i> denotes then what I have
stated, &#8212; that the Church would be for a time without any visible head.
Christ indeed has always been the Head of the Church; but as he designed himself
to be then seen in the family of David as in an image or picture, so the Prophet
shows here, that though the faithful would have to see the head cut off and the
Church dead, and like a dead body cast aside, when torn from its head; yea, that
though the Church would be in this state dreadfully desolated, there is yet a
promise of a new resurrection. <i>We shall</i> then <i>set up,</i> or choose for
ourselves shepherds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one raises an objection and says that it was
God&#8217;s office to make shepherds for his people, &#8212; this indeed I allow
to be true: but this point has not been unwisely mentioned by the Prophet; for
he extols here the favor of God, in granting again their liberty to his people.
In this especially consists the best condition of the people, when they can
choose, by common consent, their own shepherds: for when any one by force usurps
the supreme power, it is tyranny; and when men become kings by hereditary right,
it seems not consistent with liberty. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
shall then set up for ourselves princes, says the Prophet; that is, the Lord
will not only give breathing time to his Church, and will also cause that she
may set up a fixed and a well-ordered government, and that by the common consent
of all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
the Prophet no doubt meant a great number. When he speaks of the calamities of
the Church, it is aid, &#8216;There shall not be found any to govern, but
children shall rule over you.&#8217; But the Prophet says here that there would
be many leaders to undertake the care of ruling and defending the people. The
governors of the people shall therefore be seven shepherds and eight princes;
that is, the Lord will endure many by his Spirit, that they shall be suddenly
wise men: though before they were in no repute, though they possessed nothing
worthy of great men, yet the Lord will enrich them with the spirit of power,
that they shall become fit to rule. The Prophet now adds

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet says, that the shepherds,
chosen by the Church, after it had been miserably oppressed by the tyranny of
its enemies, would have a twofold office. They shall first <i>feed;</i> that is,
nourish the Church of God; &#8212; and, secondly, they shall <i>feed;</i> that
is, destroy the land of Asshur, so that nothing may remain there whole and
entire. God will then arm these shepherds with warlike courage; for they must
fight boldly and courageously against their enemies: he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall feed on the land of
Nimrod with their swords</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Nimrod, we
know, reigned in Chaldea; and we know also that the ten tribes were led away by
Shalmanezer, and that the kingdom of Israel was thus demolished: when the
Chaldeans obtained the empire, the kingdom of Judah was also laid waste by them.
Now the import of the words is, that these shepherds would be sufficiently
strong to oppose all the enemies of the Church, whether they were the
Babylonians or the Assyrians. And he names the Assyrians and Babylonians,
because they had then a contest with the people of God; and this continued to
the coming of Christ, though it is certain that they suffered more troubles from
Antiochus than from others: but as he was one of the successors of Alexander,
the Prophet here, taking a part for the whole, means, by the Assyrians and
Chaldeans, all the enemies of the Church, whoever they might be.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Waste</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall these shepherds

swords</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>

Assyrians </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall penetrate into
our land, and tread in our borders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
Prophet again reminds the faithful, that they stood in need of patience, and
that they were to know that God had not made a vain promise. The import of the
whole is, that no deliverance was to be expected from God&#8217;s hand until the
faithful yielded their necks to his yoke, and patiently sustained the evils
which were then approaching. The Prophet then mentions the intervening time
between that state in which the Jews gloried and their deliverance. Why so?
Because they were soon after to be smitten heavily by God&#8217;s hand; but
this, as we have seen, they did not think would take place. Hence he says,
&#8212; &#8220;Since you cannot yet be made to believe that merited punishment
is nigh you, experience shall be your teacher. In the meantime, let the faithful
provide themselves with courage and, with a meek heart, patiently to submit to
God, the righteous Judge: but, at the same time, let them expect a sure
deliverance, when they shall have gone through all their evils; for when the
ripened time shall come, the Lord will look on his Church; but she must be first
afflicted.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Micah promises here two things as to the future state
of the Church, &#8212; that God shall defend it without the help and aid of men,
&#8212; and that he will supply it with strength, so that it will become
superior to all enemies. In the first place, to show that the preservation of
the Church depends on the mere favor of God, and that there is no need of any
earthly aids, he makes use of a most suitable similitude; he says, that the
people of God are like a dewy meadow. The Prophet speaks not what is strictly
correct; for what he says of the rain and dew is to be applied to the grass or
the meadow. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff94</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The residue of Jacob, he says,
shall be as dew from Jehovah, and drops of rain on the
grass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This cannot be applied according to the
design of the Prophet, except you take the dew, as I have already said, for the
dewy meadows or for the grass, which draws moisture and vigor from the rains.
The sense indeed is by no means obscure, which is, &#8212; that God will make
his people to grow like the grass, which is fed only by celestial dew, without
any culture or labor on the part of men: and this is also what the Prophet
expressly mentions; for he says, that the grass of which he speaks waits not for
men, nor grows through men&#8217;s care, but grows through the dew of
heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that we may better understand the Prophet&#8217;s
intention, I shall briefly notice the words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the residue of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He shows here that the whole
people would not he preserved; for he had before spoken of their destruction. We
hence see that this promise is to be confined to the seed, which God had
wonderfully preserved in the calamitous state of the Church, yea, even in its
almost total destruction. Then this promise belongs not to the whole body of the
people, but to a small number; and hence he uses as before, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sharit</i>, a remnant or residue.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall then be the residue
of Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, though the people shall nearly all perish, yet there shall be some
residue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Among
great</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or many<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
There is here a contrast between the remnants and great nations: and the Prophet
has not unnecessarily added the expression
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brqb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bekoreb,</i> in the midst. There are then three things to be observed here,
&#8212; that God does not promise deliverance to the whole people, but to a
residue only, &#8212; and then, that he promises this deliverance among powerful
or many nations, as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Though the Church of God
shall not excel in number, nay, so great may be the number of its enemies, as to
be sufficient to overwhelm it, yet God will cause it to grow and to propagate:
in a word, its enemies, though many in number, and strong in force and power,
shall not yet hinder the Lord, that he should not increase his Church more and
more;&#8221; &#8212; and the third particular is what the expression, <i>in the
midst, </i>intimates, and that is, that the people of God shall be besieged on
every side. When enemies come upon us only from one part, it is not so very
distressing, but when they surround us, being in front, and behind, and on both
sides, then our condition seems miserable indeed; for when they thus press on us
on all sides, they hardly allow us time to draw our breath. But the Prophet
declares, that though surrounded on all sides by enemies, yet the Church would
be safe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhy tam
lfk</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>cathel meat Ieve</i>,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a dew from
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, it shall be, as I have
said, as the grass, which is nourished and grows by means of dew from heaven,
and as grass, which flourishes, not through the culture or labor of men, but
which God himself makes to grow. He might have merely said, as the dew, but he
adds, from Jehovah, that he might make a distinction between God and man, and
show that the power of God is alone sufficient to support and sustain the
Church, though men brought no assistance. And this is expressed more clearly in
the next clause, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
drops of rain on the grass, which waits not for man, nor tarries for the sons of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We now then see that the faithful have
their attention called to God alone, that they may understand that they are to
be safe through his favor, that if all helps on earth failed, they ought not to
fear, since they can be effectually sustained by the power of God alone: for God
makes grass to grow on mountains and in meadows without the help and labor of
man; and thus he can defend his Church without any foreign aid, but by his own
hidden, and, so to speak, his own intrinsic power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows this promise, &#8212; that God will arm
his people with invincible and irresistible power, that they may be superior to
all their enemies. Hence he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the residue of Israel shall be
like a lion among the beasts of the forests and like a young lion among a flock
of sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As a strong lion then is
superior to other beasts, and as a young lion dares ferociously to attack a
flock of sheep; so he says, the people of Israel shall be; they shall be like
lions, filling their enemies with terror, yea, and plundering and scattering
them, so that no one will dare to resist them. The Prophet, by speaking thus,
does not mean, that the people of God would be cruel and sanguinary: for we know
that when the Prophets use similes of this kind, they express something not
strictly suitable; for who would be so foolish as to select every thing that
belongs to a lion, and apply it to the Church of God. Then the reason for this
similitude must be observed; it was to show, that the faithful shall be endued
with a power so superior to that of their enemies, that they shall be a terror
to them. It does not hence follow that they shall be cruel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must, at the same time, see what the Lord
promises to his Church. Though God then recommends to his children the spirit of
meekness, yet the faithful may still be a thread to their enemies; they ought,
however, to observe what is just towards them, and to keep themselves within
proper bounds. And yet Micah says, that they shall be endued with such power
that they shall drive their enemies afar off; yea, that they shall plunder and
tear them in pieces, while no one will be able to resist them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
these two things are necessary as to the preservation of the Church, that God
may make it grow; for except it be miraculously increased, it can never grow;
and then it has need of a strong and powerful defense against her enemies; for
we know that there are always wicked men who oppose the Church, yea, who apply
all their powers to destroy it: it is therefore necessary that it should be
supplied by the Lord with invincible strength, as our Prophet declares here. Let
us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what is said in the last verse, and
expresses in other words what he meant, and what we have explained, &#8212; that
though the Church must contend with many strong and violent enemies, it will not
yet fail, for the Lord will supply it with strength from heaven.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exalted, he says, shall be thy
hand, that all thine enemies may be cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He promises not that the Church
shall be in a quiet state, but victorious, and declares also that there will
never be wanting enemies. This promise, then, ought to arm us for enduring
patiently, as we cannot conquer except by fighting. As then there will be always
enemies to oppose the Church of God; yea, to attempt its ruin, the Prophet says
here, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exalted shall be thy hand
above thine enemies.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, When has this promise been
fulfilled? For we know that since the people had been led away into the
Babylonian exile, they had always been either tributaries, or kept under cruel
tyranny, or at least had been unequal to their enemies. But this principle ought
ever to be remembered, &#8212; that the faithful ought to be satisfied with
victory, &#8212; that however hard they may be pressed, and however constant may
be the contests which they have to carry on, and however wearisome, this one
thing ought still to be sufficient for them &#8212; that they shall not wholly
perish. And it appears evident, that God&#8217;s people have always been
preserved by his invincible hand, however numerous have been their opposing
enemies. We must also keep in mind what we have just heard, &#8212; that the
promise here is not made to the whole people, but to a residue only. And it
surpasses the expectation of the whole world, that even a small member could
have survived so many slaughters, by which they might have been swallowed up a
hundred times. Now then we see that it had not been without reason promised to
the faithful, that they should be made conquerors over all their enemies. But
this has not been really fulfilled, except under the conflict of the cross. It
now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">There is introduced here a most necessary admonition,
in order that the faithful may know, how they are to be preserved by the hand
and favor of God, even when they shall be stripped of all their helps, yea, even
when God shall take away all those impediments, which would otherwise close up
the way against his favor. The sum of the whole then is, &#8212; that the Church
shall not otherwise be saved by God&#8217;s kindness than by being deprived of
all her strength and defenses, and also by having her obstacles removed by God,
even those which in a manner prevented his hand from being put forth to save his
people. For the Prophet mentions here cities, then fortified places, he mentions
horses and chariots. These, we know, are not in themselves to be condemned: but
he means, that as the people foolishly placed confidence in earthly things, the
salvation of God could not otherwise come to them than by stripping them of all
vain and false confidence. This is one thing. Then, on the other hand, he
mentions groves, he mentions carved images and statues, he mentions augurs and
diviners: these were corruptions, which closed the door against the favor of
God; for a people, given to idolatry, could not call upon God nor hope in him as
the author of salvation. We now then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design. It now
remains for me to run over the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says
first</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, It shall be in that day,
saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thine
horses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here
the Prophet enumerates those things which could not in themselves be ascribed to
any thing wrong: for as God has created horses for the use of men, so also he
allows them to be for our service. Why then does the Prophet say, that the
Church could not be delivered, except horses were taken away? It was owing to an
accidental fault; for when men abound in forces, they instantly fix their hope
on them. As then such an abuse of God&#8217;s gifts had prevailed among the
people of Israel, it was necessary that horses should be taken away. God indeed
could have humbled their minds or withdrawn their confidence from their horses
and chariots: but it hence appears how deep are the roots of presumption in the
hearts of men, that they cannot be otherwise torn up, than by having the things
themselves cut off. To have horses and to have chariots is the bounty of God:
for how can we have chariots and horses and other things, except through
God&#8217;s kindness? And yet God cannot find a way by which he can do us good,
except by taking away his former gifts. Here then Micah touches the hearts of
the people much more sharply than before, when he says, that salvation cannot
proceed from the Lord, except their horses were destroyed; as though he said,
&#8212; &#8220;Ye see how great is your wickedness; God has hitherto dealt
bountifully with you, since he has enriched you, and has also given you horses.
Now as he sees that you abuse these gifts, he complains that all ways of access
to you are closed up, as ye do not receive his kindness. Inasmuch as your horses
and your chariots engross your attention, ye in a manner drive God far away from
you. That he may therefore come to you, he will open a way for himself by
removing all the obstacles and hindrances.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that though all God&#8217;s benefits
ought to raise us up to heaven, serving as kinds of vehicles, they are yet
turned, through our wickedness, to another purpose, and are made intervening
obstacles between us and God. Hereby then is our ingratitude proved; and hence
it comes, that God, when he intends to make his salvation known to us is in a
manner constrained to take away and remove from us his benefits. We now then
understand what the Prophet had in view when he mentioned horses and chariots.
For he does not threaten here, as some think, that the people would be merely
deprived of all God&#8217;s gifts that they might see in their destitution and
want only signs of a curse; by no means, but it is rather a promise, that is,
that God will turn aside all impediments by which he was for a time prevented
from bringing help to his people. This doctrine ought at the same time to avail
for bringing no ordinary comfort. It is hard and bitter to the flesh to be
brought down. Hence the people of Israel were little able at first to bear their
lot with submission, when they saw themselves stripped of God&#8217;s benefits:
but the Prophet sets before them a compensations which was capable of soothing
all their grief, &#8212; &#8220;This,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall be for your
chief good &#8212; that God will deprive you of horses and chariots; for the way
which your horses and chariots now occupy shall be cleared. While ye are
replenished with abundant forces, ye drive away God far from you, and there is
no way open for him. He will therefore prepare a way for himself; and this will
be the case when your land shall be made naked, when nothing will intervene to
prevent him from coming to you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cut off the cities of
thy land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and I will destroy all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
fortresses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This verse is to be taken in
the same sense. That the people dwelt in fortified cities, and had defenses and
fortified places, was not of itself displeasing to God. But as the people
habituated themselves to a false confidence, and as it were hardened themselves
in it, so that this evil could not be remedied without taking away those things
to which it is attached, the Prophet says
here,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will cut off the cities
of your land,</i> </font><font face="Palatino">and then, I will cut off your
defenses and fortified places. Is it that they may be plundered with impunity by
their enemies? By no means, but that the favor of God may be made glorious in
their deliverance. For they could not ascribe it to their cities that they kept
off enemies, but were constrained to acknowledge the hand of God, and to confess
him to have been their only deliverer; for they were exposed to enemies, and
there was no aid for them in the land. God then will thus render more evident
his favor, when their cities and fortified places shall be cut off. We hence
learn that the faithful at this day have no cause to murmur if they are without
great riches, and if they are not formidable for the multitude of their horses,
nor for the number and strength of their men. Why so? Because it is the
Lord&#8217;s will that we should be like sheep, that we might depend wholly on
his power, and know that we cannot be otherwise safe than under his protection.
This reason then ought to comfort us, that it may not be grievous to us, when we
find that we are in the midst of wolves, and that we have no equal strength to
contend with them; for even this destitution hardly extorts from us a real
confession that our safety is in the hand of God. We are always proud. How would
it be, were the Church at this day in a flourishing state and all enemies
subdued, were there no danger, no fear? Surely earth and heaven could not bear
the foolish self-confidence of men. There is therefore no wonder that God thus
holds us in, and that while he supports us by his grace, he deprives us of all
earthly helps and aids, that we may learn that he alone is the author of our
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This truth ought to be carefully contemplated by us.
Whenever we see that the Church of God, though not possessing any great power,
is yet diminished daily, yea, and becomes, so to speak, like a naked land,
without any defenses, it so happens, in order that the protection of God may be
alone sufficient for us, and that he may wholly tear away from our hearts all
haughtiness and pride, and dissipate all those vain confidences by which we not
only obscure the glory of God, but, as far as we can, entirely cover it over. In
short, as there is nothing better for us than to be preserved by the hand of
God, we ought to bear patiently the removal of all those impediments which close
up the way against God, and, in a manner, keep off his hand from us, when he is
ready to extend it for the purpose of delivering us. For when our minds are
inflated with foolish self-confidence, we neglect God; and thus a wall
intervenes, which prevents him to help us. Who would not wish, seeing himself in
extreme danger and help not far distant, that an intercepting wall should
immediately fall down? Thus God is near at hand, as he has promised; but there
are many walls and many obstacles, from the ruin of which, if we would be safe,
we must desire and seek, that God may find an open and free way, in order that
he may be able to afford us aid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet comes now to the second kind of
impediments. We have already said that some things become impediments, as it
were, accidentally, when, through our wickedness and misapplication, we turn
God&#8217;s benefits to an end contrary to what he has designed. If, for
instance, horses and chariots are given us, to possess them is not in itself an
evil, but becomes so through our blindness, that is, when we, blinded by earthly
possessions, think ourselves safe, and thus neglect God. But there are other
impediments, which are, in their nature, and in themselves, vicious. To these
the Prophet now leads us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cut
off,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
sorcerers,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yp&ccedil;k</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cashephim</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">ff98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some render the word jugglers, and others, augurs or diviners. We cannot know of
a certainty what kind of superstition it was, nor the other which immediately
follows:</font><sup><font color="Maroon">ff99</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the Prophet mentions here two words which mean nearly the same thing. There
is no doubt but that some, in that age, were called augurs or diviners, and
others called jugglers or astrologers who are now called fortune-tellers. But on
this subject there is no necessity of much labor; for the Prophet simply shows
here that the people could not be preserved by Gods unless they were cleansed
from these defilements. These superstitions, we know, were forbidden and
condemned by God&#8217;s Law: but the Law was not able to restrain the
wickedness of that people; for they continually turned aside to these evils. God
then here shows, that until they had purged the Church, it could not continue
safe. Now, in these words, the Prophet reminds the Jews, and also the
Israelites, for their benefit, that it was, and had been, through their own
fault, that they labored under constant miseries and were not helped by the hand
of God. &#8212; How so? Because there was no room, as God shows here, for the
exercise of his favor; for they were full of auguries and divinations, and of
other diabolical arts. &#8220;How,&#8221; he says, &#8220;can I help you, for I
have no agreement with Satan? As you are wholly given to wicked superstitions,
my favor is rejected by you.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff100</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One thing is, that the Prophet intended to humble the
people, so that every one might know that it had been through their fault, that
God had not brought them help as they wished: but there is another thing,
&#8212; God promises a cleansing, which would open a way for his favor, &#8212;
I will take away, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
the diviners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Let us then know, that it
ought to be deemed the greatest benefit when God takes away from us our
superstitions and other vices. For since a diminution, however hard and grievous
it may be at first, is useful to us, as we see, when we willfully and openly
drive away God from us; is it not a singular favor in God when he suffers us not
to be thus separated from him, but prepares a way for himself to be connected
with us, and has ever his hand extended to bring us help? Thus much as to these
two kinds of impediments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cut off thy graven
images and thy statues from the midst of thee; and thou shalt not hereafter bend
down before the works of thine hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
This verse is plain and contains nothing new: for the Prophet teaches that God
cannot become propitious to his Church, to keep and make her safe, until he
purges her from her filth, even from idolatry and other vices, by which the
worship of God was corrupted, or even entirely
subverted.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut off thy graven images and
statues</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the midst of
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We see that God anticipates us by
his gratuitous goodness, not only by forgiving us, but also by calling us back,
when wandering, into the right way. Since then we have deviated from the right
way, and God thus withdraws his hand that it might appear that he has cast us
away it is certain that we ought not only to pray him to have mercy on us, but
also to ascribe to him a higher favor, inasmuch as he takes away the very
impediments which separate us from him, and suffer him not to come nigh us. We
hence see that God is not only inclined to pardon when men repent, but that it
is his peculiar office to remove the obstacles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully noticed, that we may know
that our salvation, from the first beginning, proceeds from the mere favor of
God, &#8212; and that we may also learn, that all those things, of which the
Papists vainly talk respecting preparations, are mere figments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt not bend hereafter
before the work of thine hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God expresses
here the cause why he so much abominates idols, even because he sees that his
honor is transferred to them: this is one thing. He further arraigns the Jews as
guilty, while he makes evident their defection: for surely nothing could have
been more shameful, than to take away from God his honor and worship, and to
transfer them to dead things; and he says here by way of reproach, that they
were the work of their hands. What can be more insane, than for men to ascribe
divinity to their own inventions, or to believe that it is in the power of men
to make a god from wood or stone? This is surely monstrous in the extreme. Then
the Prophet by this form of speaking aggravates the sin of the people of Israel,
that is, when he says that they bowed the head before the work of their oven
hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away thy
groves</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The groves, we know, formed a part of
their idolatry: they are therefore mentioned here as an addition by the Prophet.
For he speaks not simply of trees, but refers to the wicked practices of the
people: for wherever there were high and lofty trees, they thought that
something divine was hid under their shade; hence their superstition. When
therefore the Prophet mentions groves, it must be understood of vicious and
false modes of worship; for they thought that those places acquired a sort of
sanctity from the trees; as they also thought that they were nearer to God when
they were on a hill. We hence see that this verse is to be connected with the
last; as though the Prophet had said, that the Church could not be in safety and
recover her pristine vigor, without being well cleansed from all the filth of
idolatry. For we indeed know that some pious kings when they took away idols did
not cut down the groves; and this exception to their praise is added, that they
worshipped God, but that the high places were suffered to stand. We see that the
Holy Spirit does not fully commend those kings who did not destroy the groves.
&#8212; Why? Because they were the materials of corruption. And further, had the
Jews been really penitent, they would have exterminated those groves by which
they had so shamefully abused and profaned the worship of God. The sum of the
whole then is, that when God shall have well cleansed his Church and wiped away
all its stains, he will then become the unfailing preserver of its safety. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff102</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins, And
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will destroy thy
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;yr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>orik,</i> may be rendered, enemies, and many so render it: but others
translate it, cities; and the word, cities, would be the most suitable, were it
not that the Prophet had previously mentioned cities. I do not therefore see
that it would be proper to render it here by this term. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;yr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>orik,</i> then, ought doubtless to be rendered, thy enemies. Let us inquire
why the prophet says, that the enemies of the Church were to be destroyed. This
sentence ought to be thus explained, (I leave the former ones, and take only
this the last,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will
demolish thy groves from the midst of thee, that I may destroy thine
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
copulative is then to be considered as a final particle; and this meaning is the
most suitable; as though the Prophet had said, as I have already often stated,
that the door was closed against God, so that he could bring no aid to his
Church, and deliver it from enemies, as long as it held to false confidence, and
was attached to the filth of idolatry, which was still worse. &#8220;That I may
then destroy thine enemies, it is necessary first that every thing in thee that
prevents or hinders my favor should be taken away and
removed.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will execute vengeance in
wrath and in fury</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He goes on with what
I have just said of enemies; &#8220;I will then execute vengeance in wrath and
in fury on the nations&#8221;. Here God mentions his wrath and his fury, that
the faithful might feel greater confidence, that though now their enemies poured
forth grievous threatening, yet this could not prevent God from aiding his
people. &#8212; How so? Because if we compare the wrath and fury of God with all
the terrors of men, doubtless the threats of men would appear as nothing but
smoke. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning in these words. And he says
in the last place, I will execute vengeance on the nations who have not heard.
Almost all interpreters join the relative,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher</i> with the preceding word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>guim,</i> &#8212; I will then take vengeance on the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nations who have not
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, who have been rebellious
against God: not to hear, as they explain, is obstinately to despise the power
of God, and not to be moved by his promises or by his threatenings. But a fitter
sense may perhaps be elicited, if we refer
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher,</i> to vengeance, &#8212; I will then execute vengeance on the nations
which they have not heard, that is, I will take vengeance on all the nations in
a manner unheard of and incredible: and by nations, he understands
indiscriminately all the enemies of the Church, as we have elsewhere
seen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet avowedly assumes that the people
were sufficiently proved guilty; and yet they resisted through a hardiness the
most obdurate, and rejected all admonitions without shame, and without any
discretion. He is therefore commanded to direct his discourse to the mountains
and to the hills; for his labor had now for a long time been useless as to men.
The meaning then is that when the Prophet had spent much labor on the people and
derived no fruit, he is at length bidden to call the mountains and the hills to
bear their testimony to God; and thus before the elements is made known and
proved the ungodliness and the obstinacy of the people. But before he relates
what had been committed to him, he makes a preface, in order to gain
attention.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye what Jehovah
says.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophets are wont, on very serious
subjects, to make such a preface as is here made by Micah: and it is indeed
sufficiently evident from the passage, that he has here no ordinary subject for
his teaching, but that, on the contrary, he rebukes their monstrous stupidity;
for he had been addressing the deaf without any advantage. As then the Prophet
was about to declare no common thing, but to be a witness of a new judgment,
&#8212; this is the reason why he bids them to be unusually attentive. Hear, he
says, what Jehovah saith. What is it? He might have added, &#8220;Jehovah has
very often spoken to you, he has tried all means to bring you to the right way;
but as ye are past recovery, vengeance alone now remains for you: he will no
more spend labor in vain on you; for he finds in you neither shame, nor
meekness, nor docility.&#8221; The Prophet might have thus spoken to them; but
he says that another thing was committed to his charge by the Lord, and that is,
to contend or to plead before the mountains. And this reproach ought to have
most acutely touched the hearts of the people: for there is here an implied
comparison between the mountains and the Jews; as though the Prophet said,
&#8212; &#8220;The mountains are void of understanding and reason, and yet the
Lord prefers to have them as witness of his cause rather than you, who exceed in
stupidity all the mountains and rocks.&#8221; We now then perceive the design of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some take mountains and hills in a metaphorical sense
for the chief men who then ruled: and this manner of speaking very frequently
occurs in Scripture: but as to the present passage, I have no doubt but that the
Prophet mentions mountains and hills without a figure; for, as I have already
said, he sets the hardness of the people in opposition to rocks, and intimates,
that there would be more attention and docility in the very mountains than what
he had hitherto found in the chosen people. And the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
at,</i> is often taken in the sense of <i>before:</i> it means also with; but in
this place I take it for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed,</i> before or near, as many instances might be cited. But that this is
the meaning of the Prophet it is easy to gather from the next verse, when he
says &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, ye mountains, the controversy
of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> how?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and ye strong foundations of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says. He speaks here no more
of hills, but summons the whole world; as though he said, &#8220;There is not
one of the elements which is not to bear witness respecting the obstinacy of
this people; for the voice of God will penetrate to the farthest roots of the
earth, it will reach the lowest depths: these men will at the same time continue
deaf.&#8221; And he says not, the Lord threatens you, or denounces judgment on
you; but Jehovah has a contention with his people. We now then see that there is
no metaphor in these words; but that the Prophet merely shows how monstrous was
the stupor of the people, who profited nothing by the celestial doctrine
delivered to them, so that the very mountains and the whole machinery of earth
and heaven, though destitute of reason, had more understanding than these men.
And it is not unusual with the Prophets, we know, to turn their discourse to
mute elements, when there remains no hope of success from men. But our Prophet
does not abruptly address mountains and hills as Isaiah does,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:2,) and as also Moses had done,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Hear, ye heavens,
what I shall say, let the earth hear the words of my mouth,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
32:1,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but he prefaces his discourse by saying, that it had
been specially commanded to him to summon the mountains and hills to God&#8217;s
judgment. By saying then, &#8220;Hear ye what Jehovah saith,&#8221; he prepares
as I have said, the Jews to hear, that they might know that something uncommon
and altogether unusual was to be announced, &#8212; that the Lord, in order more
fully to convict them of extreme impiety, intended to plead his cause before the
mountains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, then, and plead before the
mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
What sort of voice was this? They who think that the judges are here
figuratively pointed out may be easily refuted; for Micah in the next verse
mentions the substance of this pleading, namely that the Lord expostulated with
his people. We hence see that God had no contention with the mountains, but
that, on the contrary, the mountains were summoned, that they might understand
God&#8217;s pleading, not against them, but against the people. Hear then, ye
mountains, Jehovah&#8217;s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth,
that is, the very rocks. There is nothing so hard in the world, he says, that
shall not be inane to hear; for this pleading shall reach the lowest depths.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God, in the first place, offers to give a
reason, if he was accused of any thing. It seems indeed unbecoming the character
of God, that he should be thus ready as one guilty to clear himself: but this is
said by way of concession; for the Prophet could not otherwise express, that
nothing that deserved blame could be found in God. It is a personification, by
which a character; not his own, is ascribed to God. It ought not therefore to
appear inconsistent, that the Lord stands forth here, and is prepared to hear
any accusation the people might have, that he might give an answer,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people! what have I
done?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By using this kind expression, my people,
he renders double their wickedness; for God here descends from his own

as it were on the opposite side, and is prepared, if the people had anything to
say, to give answer to it, so that they might mutually discuss the question, as
it is usually done by friends. Now the more kindly and indulgently the Lord

<div><font face="Palatino">God, having testified that he had in nothing been
troublesome to the people, now states with how great and with how many benefits
he had bound them to himself. But we may prefer taking the words as explanatory
and somewhat ironical that he records his benefits in the place of trouble or
vexation; though, in my judgment, it is better to read the two clauses apart.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have brought
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the land of
Egypt,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> from that miserable bondage; and then he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have redeemed
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the
word, redeem, he expresses more clearly and more fully illustrates his kindness.
Then he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have set over
thee as leaders Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and Aaron, and
Miriam, the sister of them both. Benefits, we know, are often accompanied with
injuries; and he who obliges another destroys all his favor, when he turns
kindness as it often happens, into reproach. It is hence frequently the case,
that he who has been kind to another brings so serious an injury, that the
memory of his kindness ought not to continue. God mentions here these two
things, &#8212; that he had conferred vast benefits on the people, &#8212; and
yet that he had in nothing been burdensome to them; as though he said
&#8220;Many are those things which I can, if necessary, on my part bring
forward, by which I have more than a hundred times made thee indebted to me; now
thou canst not in thy turn bring anything against me; thou canst not say that I
have accompanied my benefits with wrongs, or that thou hast been despised,
because thou were under obligations to me, as it is often the case with men who
proudly domineer, when they think that they have made others bound to them. I
have not then thought proper to accompany my great favors with anything
troublesome or grievous to thee.&#8221; We now understand why the Prophet
expressly mentions these two things, &#8212; that God had in nothing been
vexatious to his people, &#8212; and that he had brought them up from the land
of Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That redemption was so great, that the people ought
not to have complained, had it been the will of God to lay on their shoulders
some very heavy burdens: for this answer might have been ever readily given,
&#8212; &#8220;Ye have been delivered by me; ye owe to me your life and your
safety. There is therefore no reason why any thing should be now burdensome to
you; for the bondage of Egypt must have been bitterer to you than hundred
deaths; and I redeemed you from that bondage.&#8221; But, as the Lord had
treated his redeemed people so kindly and so humanely, yea, with so much
indulgence, how great and how intolerable was their ingratitude in not
responding to his great kindness? We now more fully understand the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning in these words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have made thee to ascend, he says, from Egypt; and
then, I have redeemed thee. He goes on, as we have said, by degrees. He
afterwards adds, I have sent before thy face Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. God means
here that it had not been a momentary kindness; for he continued his favor
towards the Jews when he set over them Moses and Aaron, and Miriam, which was an
evidence of his constant care, until he had completed his work of delivering
them. For Moses was a minister of their deliverance in upholding civil order,
and Aaron as to the priesthood and spiritual discipline. With regard to Miriam,
she also performed her part towards the women; and as we find in Exodus 15, she
composed a song of thanksgiving after passing through the Red Sea: and hence
arose her base envy with regard to Moses; for being highly praised, she thought
herself equal to him in dignity. It is at the same time right to mention, that
it was an extraordinary thing, when God gave authority to a woman, as was the
case with Deborah that no one may consider this singular precedent as a common
rule. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God briefly records here what happened in the desert,
&#8212; that the people had need of some extraordinary help in addition to the
many benefits which he had conferred on them. For though the people lived safely
in the desert as to the Egyptians, though they were fed by manna and water from
the rock flowed for them, though the cloud by day protected them from the heat
of the sun, and the pillar of fire shone on them during the night, yet the
stream of God&#8217;s mercy seemed to have been stopped when Balaam came forth,
who was a Prophet, and then, as one armed with celestial weapons, fought against
the people and opposed their deliverance. Now, had God permitted Balaam to curse
the people, what could have taken place, but that they must have been deprived
of all their blessings? This is the reason why the Prophet specifically refers
to this history, &#8212; that the cursing of Balaam was miraculously turned into
a blessing, even through the secret purpose of God. Micah might indeed have
referred to all those particulars by which God could have proved the ingratitude
of the people; but he deemed it sufficient to touch on the fact of their
redemption, and also to mention by the way this extraordinary instance of
God&#8217;s kindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what Balak
devised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, how crafty was his
counsel: for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;[y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iots,</i> is to be taken here in a bad sense, and is very emphatical; as
though the Prophet had said, that there was more danger in this fraud than in
all the violence of enemies; for Balak could not have done so much harm, had he
prepared a great army against the Israelites, as by hiring a Prophet to curse
the people. For certain it is, that though Balaam was an impostor and full of
deceits, as it is probable that he was a man given to profane superstitions, he
was yet endued with the gift of prophecy. This was the case no doubt; and we
know that God has often so distributed the gifts of his Spirit, that he has
honored with the prophetic office even the ungodly and unbelieving: for it was a
special gift, distinct from the grace of regeneration. Balaam then was a
Prophet. Now when Balak saw that he was unequal in power to oppose the people,
he thought of this expedient &#8212; to get some Prophet to interpose for the
purpose of exciting the wrath of God against the people. This is the reason why
it is here said, Remember what Balak consulted against thee; that is,
&#8220;Thou were then in the greatest danger, when a Prophet came, hired for the
purpose, that he might in God&#8217;s name pronounce on thee a
curse.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, Whether Balaam could really curse
the people of Israel? The answer is easy: the question here is not what might
have been the effect, without God&#8217;s permission; but Micah here regards
only the office with which Balaam was honored and endued. As then he was
God&#8217;s Prophet, he could have cursed the people, had not God prevented him.
And no doubt Balak was wise enough to know, that the Israelites could not be
resisted by human power, and that, therefore, nothing remained for him but the
interposition of God; and as he could not bring down God from heaven, he sent
for a Prophet. God puts his own power in his word, &#8212; as God&#8217;s word
resided in Balaam, and as he was, as it were, its depositary, it was no wonder
that Balak thought that he would become the conqueror of the people of Israel,
provided they were cursed by Balaam&#8217;s mouth; for this would have been as
it were, the announcement of God&#8217;s wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And what Balaam, the son of Beor,
answered him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is here shown, on the one
hand, a danger, because Balaam was craftier than all the other enemies of the
people, for he could have done more by his artifice than if he had armed against
them the whole world: here then was the danger. But, on the other hand, we know
what he answered; and it is certain that the answer of Balaam did not proceed
from himself, but, on the contrary, from the Spirit of God. As Balaam spoke by
the secret influence of the Spirit, contrary to the wish of his own heart, God
thus proved that he was present at that very time, when the safety of the people
was endangered. Think, then, or remember, what Balaam answered; as though he
said, &#8212; &#8220;Balaam was very nigh cursing thee, for his mouth was
opened: for he had sold himself to an ungodly king, and nothing could have
pleased him more than to have poured forth many anathemas and many curses: but
he was constrained to bless your fathers. What did this mean? Did not the
wonderful favor of God shine forth in this instance?&#8221; We now perceive the
Prophet&#8217;s design, and what a large meaning there is in these
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds generally,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From Shittim even to
Gilgal.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is not connected with the last
clause; for Balaam did not follow the people from Shittim to Gilgal; but a verb
is to be understood, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff106A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Thou knowest what things happened to thee from
Shittim to Gilgal, from the beginning to the end; at the time when thou didst
enter the wilderness, thou hadst begun to provoke the wrath of God.&#8221; And
we know that even in Shittim the Israelites fell away into idolatry; and that
defection, in a manner, alienated them from God. Hence God shows here that he,
in his goodness and mercy, had contended with the ungodly ways of the people
even to Gilgal; that is, &#8220;Thou hast never ceased to provoke me.&#8221; We
indeed know that the people continually excited against themselves the
displeasure of God, and that their defections were many and various. In short,
then the Prophet shows that God had so mercifully dealt with the people, that he
had, in a most astonishing manner, overcome their wickedness by his
goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length
subjoins</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, That thou mayest know
the righteousnesses of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By
righteousnesses he means acts of kindness, as the sense of the word is in many
other passages: for the righteousness of God is often taken not only for
uprightness, but also for the faithfulness and truth which he manifests towards
his people. It betokens therefore the relation between God and his Church,
whenever the word, righteousness, is to be understood in this sense.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou mayest then know the
righteousnesses of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
that experience itself may prove to thee how faithful, how beneficent, how
merciful has God ever been towards your race. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Since
then the righteousness of God was conspicuous, the people must surely have been
mute, and had nothing for which they could justly expostulate with God: what
remained, but that their extreme impiety, fully detected before heaven and earth
and all the elements, exposed them to his judgment? It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now inquires, as in the name of the
people, what was necessary to be done: and he takes these two principles as
granted, &#8212; that the people were without any excuse, and were forced to
confess their sin, &#8212; and that God had hitherto contended with them for no
other end and with no other design, but to restore the people to the right way;
for if his purpose had only been to condemn the people for their wickedness,
there would have been no need of these questions. But the Prophet shows what has
been often stated before, &#8212; that whenever God chides his people, he opens
to them the door of hope as to their salvation, provided those who have sinned
repent. As this then must have been well known to all the Jews, the Prophet here
asks, as with their mouth, what was to be done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He thus introduces them as inquiring,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With what shall I approach
Jehovah, and bow down before the high
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff108</font></sup><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with calves of a year
old?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But at the same time there is no doubt,
but that he indirectly refers to that foolish notion, by which men for the most
part deceive themselves; for when they are proved guilty, they indeed know that
there is no remedy for them, except they reconcile themselves to God: but yet
they pretend by circuitous courses to approach God, while they desire to be ever
far away from him. This dissimulation has always prevailed in the world, and it
now prevails: they see that they whom God convicts and their own conscience
condemns, cannot rest in safety. Hence they wish to discharge their duty towards
God as a matter of necessity; but at the same time they seek some fictitious
modes of reconciliation, as though it were enough to flatter God, as though he
could be pacified like a child with some frivolous trifles. The Prophet
therefore detects this wickedness, which had ever been too prevalent among them;
as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;I see what ye are about to say; for there is
no need of contending longer; as ye have nothing to object to God, and he has
things innumerable to allege against you: ye are then more than condemned; but
yet ye will perhaps say what has been usually alleged by you and always by
hypocrites, even this, &#8212; &#8216;We wish to be reconciled to God, and we
confess our faults and seek pardon; let God in the meantime show himself ready
to be reconciled to us, while we offer to him sacrifices.&#8217;&#8221; There is
then no doubt, but that the Prophet derided this folly, which has ever prevailed
in the hearts of men: they ever think that God can be pacified by outward rites
and frivolous performances.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He has proclaimed to thee what is
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet reproves the hypocrisy by
which the Jews willfully deceived themselves, as though he said, &#8212;
&#8220;Ye indeed pretend some concern for religion when ye approach God in
prayer; but this your religion is nothing; it is nothing else than shamelessly
to dissemble; for ye sin not either through ignorance or misconception, but ye
treat God with mockery.&#8221; &#8212; How so? &#8220;Because the Law teaches
you with sufficient clearness what God requires from you; does it not plainly
enough show you what is true reconciliation? But ye close your eyes to the
teaching of the Law, and in the meantime pretend ignorance. This is extremely
childish. God has already proclaimed what is good,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even to do judgment, to love
kindness and to walk humbly with God.&#8221;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We
now perceive the design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then he says here, With what shall I appear before
God? we must bear in mind, that as soon as God condescends to enter into trial
with men, the cause is decided; for it is no doubtful contention. When men
litigate one with another, there is no cause so good but what an opposite party
can darken by sophistries. But the Prophet intimates that men lose all their
labor by evasions, when God summons them to a trial. This is one thing. He also
shows what deep roots hypocrisy has in the hearts of all, for they ever deceive
themselves and try to deceive God. How comes it that men, proved guilty, do not
immediately and in the right way retake themselves to God, but that they ever
seek windings? How is this? It is not because they have any doubt about what is
right except they willfully deceive themselves, but because they dissemble and
willfully seek the subterfuges of error. It hence appears that men perversely go
astray when ever they repent not as they ought, and bring not to God a real
integrity of heart. And hence it also appears that the whole world which
continues in its superstitions is without excuse. For if we scrutinize the
intentions of men, it will at length come to this, &#8212; that men carefully
and anxiously seek various superstitions, because they are unwilling to come
before God and to devote themselves to him, without some dissembling and
hypocrisy. Since it is so, certain it is, that all who desire to pacify God with
their own ceremonies and other trifles cannot by any pretext escape. What is
said here is at the same time strictly addressed to the Jews, who had been
instructed in the teaching of the Law: and such are the Papists of this day;
though they spread forth specious pretenses to excuse their ignorance, they may
yet be refuted by this one fact, &#8212; that God has prescribed clearly and
distinctly enough what he requires: but they wish to be ignorant of this; hence
their error is at all times wilful. We ought especially to notice this in the
words of the Prophet; but I cannot proceed farther now.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast

grace, &#8212; O grant, that we may not be deaf, either to thy command or to the
promises of thy mercy, but render ourselves in both instances submissive to thee
and so learn to devote all our faculties to thee, that we may in truth avow that
a rule of a holy and religious life has been delivered to us in thy law, and
that we may also firmly adhere to thy promises, lest through any of the
allurements of the world, or through the flatteries and crafts of Satan thou
shouldest suffer our minds to be drawn away from that love which thou hast once
manifested to us in thine only-begotten Son and in which thou daily confirmest
us by the teaching of the Gospel, until we at length shall come to the full
enjoyment of this love in that celestial inheritance, which has been purchased
for us by the blood of thy only Son. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINETY-FOURTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have seen in the last lecture that hypocrites
inquire how God is to be pacified, as though they were very solicitous about the
performance of their duty; and that in the meantime these are mere disguises;
for by circuitous windings they turn here and there, and never wish to come
directly to God. The way might have been easily known by them; but they closed
their eyes, and at the same time pretended that they had some concern for
religion. And this is also very commonly the case in our day; and common
experience, if any one opens his eyes, clearly proves this, &#8212; that the
ungodly, who deal not sincerely with God, profess a very great concern, as
though they were wholly intent on serving God, and yet turn aside here and
there, and seek many bypaths, (<i>diverticula,</i>) that they may not be
constrained to present themselves before God. We have already seen, that this
false pretense is fully exposed, inasmuch as God has enough, and more than
enough, demonstrated in his Law, what he approves and what he requires from men.
Why then do hypocrites, as still uncertain, make the inquiry? It is because they
are willfully blind at mid-day; for the doctrine of the Law ought to have been
to them as a lamp to direct their steps; but they smother this light, yea, they
do what they can wholly to extinguish it: they ask, as though perplexed, how can
we pacify God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought also to be observed, (for the Prophet
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall I give my first-born,
and the fruit of my loins, as an expiation for my
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>)</i>
that hypocrites will withhold nothing, provided they are not to devote
themselves to God. We see the same thing under the Papacy at this day; they
spare no expense, nor even the greatest toils: provided the ungodly have always
a freedom to live in sin, they will easily grant to God all other things. For
through a false conceit they make a sort of agreement with God: if they mortify
themselves, and toil in ceremonies, and if they pour forth some portion of their
money, if they sometimes deprive nature of its support, if with fastings and by
other things, they afflict themselves, they think that by these means they have
fully performed their duties. But these are frivolous trifles; for in the
meantime they consider themselves exempt from the duty of obeying God. Being yet
unwilling to be regarded as alienated from God, they, at the same time, obtrude
on him their meritorious works, to prevent his judgment, and to exempt
themselves from the necessity of doing the principal thing, that which he
especially requires &#8212; to bring a sincere heart. Thus then hypocrites wish
to divide things with God, that they may remain within such as they are; and
they spread forth outwardly many frivolous things for the purpose of pacifying
him. And this is the reason why the Prophet says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall I give my
first-born?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for hypocrites wish to
appear as though they were burning with the greatest zeal, &#8212; &#8220;Rather
than that God should remain angry with me, I would not spare the life of my
first-born; I would rather be the executioner of my own son: in short, nothing
is so valuable to me, which I would not be really to part with, that God may be
propitious to me.&#8221; This indeed is what they boast with their mouth; but at
the same time they will not offer their heart as a sacrifice to God: and as they
deal dishonestly with God, we see that all is nothing but
dissimulation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one objects, and says, &#8212; that the other
rites, of which the Prophet speaks here, had been enjoined by God&#8217;s Law,
the answer is easy; but I shall not now but briefly touch on what I have
elsewhere more largely handled: The Prophet denies, that sacrifices avail any
thing for the purpose of propitiating God. This may seem inconsistent with the
teaching of the Law, but in fact it altogether agrees with it. God indeed wished
sacrifices to be offered to him; and then this promise was always added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Iniquity shall be
atoned.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But the object must be noticed; for God
did not command sacrifices, as though they were of themselves of any worth; but
he intended to lead the ancient people by such exercises to repentance and
faith. It was therefore his design to remind the Jews that they did no good,
except they themselves became sacrifices; and it was also his will that they
should look to the only true sacrifice, by which all sins are expiated. But
hypocrites, like falsifiers of documents, abused the command of God, and
adulterated the sacrifices themselves. It was then a profane sacrilege for them
to think that God would be propitious to them, if they offered many oxen and
calves and lambs. It was the same thing as if one asked the way, and after
having known it, rested quietly and never moved a foot. God had shown the way,
by which the Jews might come to repentance and faith: and they ought to have
walked in it; but they wickedly trifled with God; for they thought that it would
be a satisfaction to his justice, if they only performed outward rites. Whenever
then the Prophets in God&#8217;s name repudiate sacrifices, the abuse, by which
God&#8217;s Law was corrupted, is ever to be considered, that is, when the Jews
brought sacrifices, only, and had no respect to the end in view, and did not
exercise themselves in repentance and faith. It is for this reason that our
Prophet declares, that all sacrifices were of no account before God, but were
vain things: they were so, when they were separated from their right
end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that God had shown by his Law what is
good; and then he adds what it
is,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to do justice, to love
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or kindness,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and to be humbled before
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is evident that, in the two first
particulars, he refers to the second table of the Law; that is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to do justice, and to love
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nor is
it a matter of wonder that the Prophet begins with the duties of love; for
though in order the worship of God precedes these duties, and ought rightly to
be so regarded, yet justice, which is to be exercised towards men, is the real
evidence of true religion. The Prophet, therefore, mentions justice and mercy,
not that God casts aside that which is principal &#8212; the worship of his
name; but he shows, by evidences or effects, what true religion is. Hypocrites
place all holiness in external rites; but God requires what is very different;
for his worship is spiritual. But as hypocrites can make a show of great zeal
and of great solicitude in the outward worship of God, the Prophets try the
conduct of men in another way, by inquiring whether they act justly and kindly
towards one another, whether they are free from all fraud and violence, whether
they observe justice and show mercy. This is the way our Prophet now follows,
when he says, that God&#8217;s Law prescribes
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what is
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and that is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to do
justice</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; to observe what is equitable
towards men, and also to perform the duties of mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds what in order is first, and that
is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to humble thyself to walk
with God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is
thus literally, &#8220;And to be humble in walking with thy God.&#8221; No
doubt, as the name of God is more excellent than any thing in the whole world,
so the worship of him ought to be regarded as of more importance than all those
duties by which we prove our love towards men. But the Prophet, as I have
already said, was not so particular in observing order; his main object was to
show how men were to prove that they seriously feared God and kept his Law: he
afterwards speaks of God&#8217;s worship. But his manner of speaking, when he
says, that men ought to be humble, that they may walk with their God, is worthy
of special notice. Condemned, then, is here all pride, and also all the
confidence of the flesh: for whosoever arrogates to himself even the least
thing, does, in a manner, contend with God as with an opposing party. The true
way then of walking with God is, when we thoroughly humble ourselves, yea, when
we bring ourselves down to nothing; for it is the very beginning of worshipping
and glorifying God when men entertain humble and low opinion of themselves. Let
us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet complains here that he and other teachers
did but little, though their cry resounded and was heard by the whole people. He
therefore says, that the <i>voice</i> of God <i>cried;</i> as though he had said
that there was no excuse for ignorance, for God had indiscriminately exhorted
them all to repentance. Now, since what was taught was common to them all, the
Prophet deplores their perverseness, for very few were attentive; and the fable
was sung, according to the proverb, to the deaf. We must then notice the word
<i>cry;</i> <i>the voice</i> of God, he says, <i>crieth.</i> God did not whisper
in the ear of one or two, but he designed his voice to be heard by all from the
least to the greatest. The Prophets then did cry loud enough, but there were no
ears to hear them.</font><br></div>

though the people are torpid, and as it were overpowered with sleep, for they
indulged themselves in their sins; yet the voice of God ought to be sufficient
to arouse them all: however sleepy they might have been, there was yet power
enough in the doctrine of the Law, which the Prophet daily proclaimed. But still
this voice, by which the whole people ought to have been awakened, was not
heard!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The man of
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says<i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hy&ccedil;wt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tushie, </i>means properly understanding, as it is clear from many other
passages; but the Prophet means that there was a very small number who were
teachable; and he calls them men of understanding. At the same time, he
indirectly reproves the sottishness of the people, though they all boasted that
they were wise, and boasted also that they were the learners of the Law. The
Prophet shows here by implication, that understanding was a rare thing among
that people; for few hearkened to the voice of God. And thus we see what his
object was; for he wished to touch the Jews to the quick, that they might
acknowledge that they were without mind and understanding, because they had
hardened themselves against God, so that his voice did not reach their hearts.
He therefore shows that they were all besides themselves; for had they any right
understanding, they would have hearkened to God speaking to them, as they were
his disciples. What indeed could have been more strange, nay more inhuman, than
for men to reject the doctrine of their salvation, and to turn aside from
hearing even God himself? Thus the madness of the people was reproved; for
though the voice of God sounded in the ears of them all, it was not yet listened
to.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If one prefers reading,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
city,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then no doubt the Prophet means, that the
voice of God was proclaimed through all the cities: for to confine it, as some
interpreters do, to Jerusalem, or to Samaria, appears frigid. We must then
understand a change of number, and take city for any large concourse of people;
as though he had said, that there was no city in which God did not cry and yet
that there were ears no where.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall see thy
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some render it, Shall fear, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though it was from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ary</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ira</i>; but it comes on the contrary from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">har</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rae</i>; and rules of grammar will not allow it to be viewed otherwise. And
the Prophet speaks in a striking manner, when he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>intelligent man seeth the name of
God.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">For whence proceeded the contempt of
wicked men, so that they disregarded the voice of God, except from this &#8212;
that his majesty had no effect on them; that is, they did not acknowledge that
they had to do with God? For if they really understood what I have said, &#8212;
that God spoke to them, his majesty would have immediately come to view, it
would have arrested all their thoughts. God then would have constrained even the
most heedless to fear him, had it not been, that they imagined the voice which
sounded in their ears was that of man. Significantly then does the Prophet say,
that it was the act of singular prudence to see the name of God, that is to
understand from whom the doctrine proceeded. For as soon as we hearken to God,
his majesty, as I have said, must so penetrate all our thoughts, as to humble us
before him, and to constrain us to do him homage. The contempt then of spiritual
doctrine, and also the perverseness of ungodly men, proceed from this, &#8212;
that they see not the name of God, that they understand not that it is his
name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye the
rod</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, and </i>him<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who proclaims it to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By rod he means threatening; as
though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Your arrogance in mocking God shall not go
unpunished, as though his voice were an empty sound: there is then no reason for
you to deceive yourselves with the hope of impunity; for God will avenge the
contempt of his word.&#8221; Now the Prophet&#8217;s design was, to denounce an
approaching vengeance on those who came not willingly to God, and received not
his word with genuine docility of mind. Whenever, then, men despise the voice of
God, as though it proceeded only from a mortal being, on such Micah denounces an
impending vengeance; for the contempt of his word is a thing intolerable to God.
This is the reason why he immediately adds, after having complained of the
contempt of his word, that vengeance was not afar off;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rod, and who declares or
testifies concerning
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This last clause ought to be especially noticed; for
the ungodly are not terrified when God declares that he will be an avenger,
because they think not that they must give an account of their life, or they
look only on mortal man, &#8220;Ah! who speaks? Is he indeed our God? Is he
armed with celestial power? Do we not see a mortal man and one like
ourselves?&#8221; We daily see that the ungodly do thus cast away every fear,
and willfully harden themselves against God&#8217;s judgments. It is not then
without reason that the Prophet bids the Jews seriously to consider <i>who
testifies</i> of the rod; as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;I indeed confess
that I am a mortal man, but remember who has sent me; for I go not forth as a
private individual, nor have I presumptuously intruded into this office; but I
am armed with God&#8217;s command; nay, God himself speaks through my mouth. If
then ye despise me, the Lord is present, who will vindicate his own commands for
he will not suffer himself to be despised in his servants though they may be
contemptible according to the flesh, he will yet have the reverence which it
deserves to be paid to his word.&#8221; We now perceive the real meaning of the
Prophet. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

be read as a question, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are there
yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
ungodly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>If this view be approved, then
we must consider the Prophet as proposing a question respecting a thing really
monstrous, &#8212; How can it be that treasures, gathered by plunder and
wickedness, still remain with you, since ye have been so often warned, and since
God daily urges you to repentance? How great is your hardness, that no fear of
God lays hold on your minds? But the meaning would not be unsuitable were we to
regard God as a Judge examining them concerning a matter unknown, Are there
still the treasures of impiety in the house of the ungodly? that is, &#8220;I
will see whether the ungodly and wicked hide their treasures:&#8221; for God
often assumes the character of earthly judges; not that any thing escapes his
knowledge, but that we may know that he is not precipitant in deciding a
question. This view, then, is by no means inappropriate, that is, that God here
assumes the character of an earthly judge, and thus speaks, &#8220;I will see
whether there are still treasures concealed by the ungodly; I will search their
houses; I will know whether they have as yet repented of their crimes.&#8221;
thus, then, may be understood the words of the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are there yet the treasures of
wickedness in the house of the ungodly?</i> </font><font face="Palatino">For
God, as I have already said, shows that he would know respecting the plunders
and the various kinds of cruelty which they had exercised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, Is there
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bare
measure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, a measure less than it
ought to be, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which is
detestable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Then
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall I
justify</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?, etc.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
verse is connected with the last, and is added as an explanation. For God having
come forth as a Judge, now shows what sort of Judge he is, even one who is not
biased by favor, who does not change his judgment, who shows no respect of
persons. But men, for the most part, greatly deceive themselves, when they
transform God according to their own will, and promise to themselves that he
will be propitious to them, provided they only make false pretensions to him.
God then here declares, that he differs widely from earthly judges, who now
incline to one side and then to another, who are changeable, and often deviate
from the right course: but, on the contrary, he says here<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall I justify wicked
balances? shall I justify weights of fraud,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or
deceitful? that is, &#8220;Shake off all those delusions by which ye are wont to
deceive yourselves; for I do not change either my nature or my purpose; but
according to the true teaching of my Law, I will punish all the wicked without
any respect of persons: wherever wickedness and iniquity are found, there
punishment will be inflicted.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand how these two verses harmonize
together. God shows that he will be a judge, and then, that he differs from men,
who often change, as it has been said, in their decisions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will mention another meaning, which will perhaps be
preferred by some. The question, after the manner of the Hebrews, may be taken
as an affirmation, as though he had said, that within a short time, (for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oud,</i> means sometimes a short time,) the treasures of iniquity would not
be found, for they would be taken away: then follows a confirmation, for frauds
and robberies by false measures and deceitful weights could not escape
God&#8217;s judgment. The meaning then would be, that as God must necessarily,
according to his own office, punish thefts, it cannot be that he will suffer
men, who cheat by false weights to continue always unpunished. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet means that the people were so given to
avarice and plunder, that all the riches they had heaped together had been got
by iniquitous robberies or by wicked gain. He now addresses the citizens of
Jerusalem: for though iniquity then prevailed through the whole of Judea, there
was yet a reason why he should distinctly accuse the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
for they must have led the way by their example, and they were also worse in
wickedness than the rest of the people: they were at least more obstinate, as
they daily heard God&#8217;s Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her rich men gather not their
wealth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> except by violence. It is indeed
certain, that the rich were not then alone guilty before God; but this evil has
too much prevailed, that the more liberty any one possesses, the more he employs
it to do wrong. Those indeed who have not the power refrain, not because they
are not inclined to do harm, but because they are as it were restrained; for
poverty is often a bridle to men. As then the rich could spread their snares, as
they had power to oppress the poor, the Prophet addresses his words to them, not
that the rest were without fault or guilt, but because iniquity was more
conspicuous in the rich, and that, because their wealthy as I have already said,
gave them more power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards extends his address to all the
inhabitants,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
all,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, they have no
sincerity, no uprightness; they are wholly given to frauds and deceits.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their tongue is false in
their mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This mode of speaking seems
apparently absurd; for where can the tongue be except in the mouth? It appears
then a sort of redundancy, when he says that their tongue was deceitful in their
mouth. But it is an emphatical mode of speaking, by which the Hebrews mean, that
men have falsehoods in readiness as soon as they open their mouth. It is then
the same as though the Prophet had said, that no pure word and free from guile
could come from them, for as soon as they opened their mouth, falsehoods
instantly came forth; their tongue was fraudulent, so that none could expect
from these men any truth or faithfulness. &#8212; How so? Because as soon as
they began to speak, they instantly discovered some guile, there was ever in
readiness some falsehood to circumvent the simple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see that not a few men were summoned
before God&#8217;s tribunal, but that all without exception were condemned; as
though the Prophet had said, that there was no more any integrity in the city,
and that corruptions prevailed everywhere, for all were intent on deceiving one
another. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God, after having declared that he would be the Judge
of the people, speaks now more clearly of their punishment. He says therefore
that he was armed with vengeance: for it often happens, when a judge, even one
who hates wickedness, is not able to punish, for he dreads the fierceness of
those whom he thinks himself unequal to restrain. Hence God intimates here, that
there will not be wanting to him a power to punish the people,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will afflict
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by
striking</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or wounding<i> thee; </i>for so some
render the words. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
sum of what is said is, &#8212; that nothing would be an obstacle to prevent God
from inflicting punishment on the people, for there would be no want of power in
his case. There is therefore no reason for men to promise themselves any escape
when God ascends his tribunal; for were they fortified by all possible means
they could not ward off the hand of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he points out what sort of punishment it would
be; and he mentions even two kinds in this verse. He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be
satisfied.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> One of God&#8217;s plagues, we know,
is famine: and so the Prophet here declares, that the people would be famished,
but not through the sterility of the fields. God indeed brings a famine in two
ways: now the land yields no fruit; the corn withers, or, being smitten with
hail, gives no fruit; and thus God by the sterility of the fields often reduces
men to want and famine: then another mode is adopted, by which he can consume
men with want, namely, when he breaks the staff of bread, when he takes away
from bread its nourishing virtues so that it can no more support men, whatever
quantity they may swallow; and this is what experience proves, if only we have
eyes to observe the judgments of God. We now see the meaning of this clause,
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt eat, and
shalt not be satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he
said, &#8220;I can indeed, whenever it pleases me, deprive you of all food; the
earth itself will become barren at my command: but that ye may more clearly
understand that your life is in my hand, a good supply of fruit shall be
produced, but it shall not satisfy you. Ye shall then perceive that bread is not
sufficient to support you; for by eating ye shall not be able to derive from
bread any nourishment.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> And thy
dejection</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be in the midst of
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, though no man from
without disturb or afflict thee yet thou shalt pine away with intestine evils.
This is the real meaning; and interpreters have not sufficiently considered what
the Prophet means, through too much negligence. But the passage ought to be
noticed: for the Prophet, after having threatened a famine, not from want, but
from the secret curse of God, now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy dejection shall be in the
midst of thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is &#8220;Though I
should rouse against thee no enemies, though evidences of my wrath should not
appear, so as to be seen at a distance, yea, though no one should disturb thee,
yet thy dejection, thy calamity, shall be in the midst of thee, as though it
were cleaving to thy bowels; for thou shalt pine away through a hidden malady,
when God shall pronounce his curse on thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now subjoins another kind of punishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt take
hold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but shalt not deliver, and
what thou shalt deliver, I will give up to the
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some read, &#8220;A woman shall
lay hold,&#8221; that is, conceive seed, &#8220;and shall not preserve
it;&#8221; and then, &#8220;though she may bring forth in due time, I will yet
give up what may be born to the sword.&#8221; But this meaning is too strained.
Others apply the words to fathers, &#8220;Thou, father, shalt lay hold;&#8221;
that is thou shalt endeavor to preserve thy children, &#8220;and thou shalt not
preserve them.&#8221; But I wonder that interpreters have thus toiled in vain in
a matter so simple and plain. For he addresses here the land, or he addresses
the city: as though he said, &#8220;The city shall take hold,&#8221; or embrace,
as every one does who wishes to preserve or keep any thing; for what we wish to
keep safe, we lay hold on it, and keep it as it were in our arms;
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and what thou shalt
preserve, I will give up to the sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i>
thou wilt try all means to preserve thyself and thy people, but thou shalt not
succeed: thou shalt then lose all thy labor, for though thou shouldest preserve
some, yet the preserved shall not escape destruction.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one prefers to refer what is said to women,
with regard to conception, as the third person of the feminine gender is used,
let him have his own opinion; for this sense may certainly be admitted, that is,
that the Lord would render the women barren, and that what they might bring
forth would be given up to the slaughter, inasmuch as the Lord would at length
destroy with the sword both the parents and their children.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds another kind of punishment, which
was to follow the calamity threatened in the last verse. He had said, that those
who escaped would at length be destroyed by the sword; he says now, that the
whole land would become a prey to enemies: and he took his words from Moses; for
it was usual with the prophets, when they wished to secure greater authority to
themselves, to quote literally the curses contained in the Law, as in the
present instance: see Deuteronomy 28 and Leviticus 26. Now it is well known,
that God denounced this punishment, with others, on the people, &#8212; that
when they sowed their fields, another would reap, &#8212; that when they
cultivated with great labor their vineyards, others would become the vintagers.
The meaning is that whatever fruit the land produced, would come into the hands
of enemies, for all things would be exposed to plunder. Now it is a very
grievous thing, when we see not only our provisions consumed by enemies, but
also the fruit of our labor; which is the same as though they were to drink our
blood: for the labor of man is often compared to blood, for labor occasions
perspiration. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Some read the words in the future tense, &#8220;And
they will observe the statutes of Omri,&#8221; etc., and gather this meaning,
&#8212; that the Prophet now foresees by the Spirit, that the people would
continue so perverse in their sins, as to exclude every hope that they could be
reformed by any punishments. The meaning then would be, &#8220;The Lord has
indeed determined to punish sharply and severely the wickedness of this people;
but they will not repent; they will nevertheless remain stupid in their
obstinacy, and go on in their superstitions, which they have learned from the
kings of Israel.&#8221; There is however another view, and one more generally
approved and that is, &#8212; that the Jews, having forsaken God, and despised
his Law, had turned aside to the superstitions of the kingdom of Israel. Hence
he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>observed were the
decrees of Omri, and every work of the house of
Ahab</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Omri was the father of Ahab, who
was made king by the election of the soldiers, when Zimri, who had slain the
king, was rejected. When Omri bought Samaria, he built there a city; and to
secure honor to it, he added a temple; and hence idolatry increased. Afterwards
his son Ahab abandoned himself to every kind of superstition. Thus matters
became continually worse. Hence the Prophet, by mentioning here king Omri and
his posterity, (included in the words, &#8220;the house of Ahab&#8221;) clearly
means, that the Jews who had purely worshipped God, at length degenerated, and
were now wholly unlike Israelites, as they had embraced all those abominations
which Omri and his son Ahab had devised. True religion as yet prevailed in the
tribe of Judah, though the kingdom of Israel was become corrupt, and filthy
superstitions had gained the ascendancy: but in course of time the Jews became
also implicated in similar superstitions. Of this sin the Prophet now accuses
them; that is, that they made themselves associates with the Israelites:<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Observed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff120</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then are the edicts of Omri, and
the whole work of the house of Ahab:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Ye walk,
he says, (the future here means a continued act, as often elsewhere,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye walk in their
counsels.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must be observed, that the Prophet here uses
respectable terms, when he says that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">teqh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chekut,</i> statutes or decrees, were observed; and when he adds, &#8220;the
counsels&#8221; of the kings of Israel: but yet this is in no way stated as an
excuse for them; for though men may not only be pleased with, but also highly
commend, their own devices, yet the Lord abominates them all. The Prophet no
doubt designedly adopted these words, in order to show that those pretenses were
frivolous and of no account, which superstitious men adduce, either to commend
or to excuse their own inventions. They ever refer to public authority, &#8212;
&#8220;This has been received by the consent of all; that has been decreed; it
is not the mistake of one or two men; but the whole Church has so determined:
and kings also thus command; it would be a great sin not to show obedience to
them.&#8221; Hence the Prophet, in order to show how puerile are such excuses,
says, &#8220;I indeed allow that your superstitions are by you honorably
distinguished, for they are approved by the edicts of your kings, and are
received by the consent of the many, and they seem not to have been
inconsiderately and unadvisedly, but prudently contrived, even by great men, who
were become skillful through long experience.&#8221; But how much soever they
might have boasted of their statutes and counsels, and however plausibly they
might have referred to prudence and power in order to disguise their idolatries,
yet all those things were of no account before God. By counsels, the Prophet no
doubt meant that false kind of wisdom which always shines forth in the
traditions of men; and by statutes, he meant the kingly
authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that it is a vain thing to color over
what is idolatrous, by alleging power on the one hand in its favor, and wisdom
on the other. &#8212; How so? Because God will not allow dishonor to be done to
him by such absurd things; but he commands us to worship him according to what
is prescribed in his Word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And now a denunciation of punishment follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I should deliver thee to
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and its inhabitants, etc.
There is a change of person; the Prophet continually addresses the land, and
under that name, the people, &#8212; that I should then deliver thee to exile,
or desolation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thine
inhabitants to hissing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a
quotation from Moses: and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hissing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he means the reproach and mockery to which men in a miserable state are
exposed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall bear the reproach of my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some take the word, people, in a
good sense, as though the Prophet had said here, that God would punish the
wrongs which the rich had done to the distressed common people; but this view,
in my judgment, is too confined. Others understand this by the reproach of
God&#8217;s people, &#8212; that nothing would be more reproachful to the Jews,
than that they had been the people of God; for it would redound to their
dishonor and disgrace, that they, who had been honored by such an honorable
name, were afterwards given up to so great miseries. But the passage may be
otherwise explained: we may understand by the people of God the Israelites; as
though the Prophet said, &#8220;Do ye not perceive how the Israelites have been
treated? Were they not a part of my people? They were descendants from the race
of Abraham as well as you; nor can you boast of a higher dignity: They were then
equal to you in the opinion of all; and yet this privilege did not hinder my
judgment, did not prevent me from visiting them as they deserved.&#8221; Such a
view harmonizes with the passage: but there is, as I think, something ironical
in the expression, &#8220;my people;&#8221; as though he said, &#8220;The
confidence, that ye have been hitherto my people, hardens you: but this false
and wicked boasting shall increase your punishment; for I will not inflict on
you an ordinary punishment, as on heathens and strangers; but I shall punish
your wickedness much more severely; for it is necessary, that your punishment
should bear proportion to my favor, which has been so shamefully and basely
despised by you.&#8221; Hence, by the reproach of God&#8217;s people, I
understand the heavier judgments, which were justly prepared for all the
ungodly, whom God had favored with such special honor, as to regard them as his
people: for the servant, who knew his master&#8217;s will, and did it not, was
on that account more severely corrected,

<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the first verse is somewhat doubtful:
some refer what the Prophet says to punishment; and others to the wickedness of
the people. The first think that the calamity, with which the Lord had visited
the sins of the people, is bewailed; as though the Prophet looked on the
disordered state of the whole land. But it may be easily gathered from the
second verse, that the Prophet speaks here of the wickedness of the people,
rather than of the punishment already inflicted. I have therefore put the two
verses together, that the full meaning may be more evident to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to me!</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">Why?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am become as
gatherings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Too free, or rather too
licentious is this version, &#8212; &#8220;I am become as one who seeks to
gather summer-fruits, and finds none;&#8221; so that being disappointed of his
hope, he burns with desire. This cannot possibly be considered as the rendering
of the Prophet&#8217;s words. There is indeed some difficulty in the
expressions: their import, however, seems to be this, &#8212; that the land,
which the Prophet undertakes here to represent and personify, was like to a
field, or a garden, or a vineyard, that was empty. He therefore says, that the
land was stripped of all its fruit, as it is after harvest and the vintage. So
by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gatherings</i></font><font face="Palatino">
we must understand the collected fruit. Some understand the gleanings which
remain, as when one leaves carelessly a few clusters on the vines: and thus,
they say, a few just men remained alive on the land. But the former comparison
harmonizes better with the rest of the passage, and that is, that the land was
now stripped of all its fruit, as it is after the harvest and the vintage.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
become</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the gatherings of
summer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, as in the summer, when
the fruit has been already gathered;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and as the clusters of the
vintage,</i> </font><font face="Palatino">that is when the vintage is over. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff122</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no cluster, he says to
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet refers here to the scarcity of
good men; yea, he says that there were no longer any righteous men living. For
though God had ever preserved some hidden seed, yet it might have been justly
declared with regard to the whole people, that they were like a field after
gathering the corn, or a vineyard after the vintage. Some residue, indeed,
remains in the field after harvest, but there are no ears of corn; and in the
vineyard some bunches remain, but they are empty; nothing remains but leaves.
Now this personification is very forcible when the Prophet comes forth as though
he represented the land itself; for he speaks in his own name and person,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe is to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for I am like
summer-gatherings!</i> </font><font face="Palatino">It was then the same thing,
as though he deplored his own nakedness and want, inasmuch as there were not
remaining any upright and righteous men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the second verse he expresses more clearly his
mind,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Perished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino">

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here now he does not personify the land.
It was indeed a forcible and an emphatic language, when he complained at the
beginning, that he groaned as though the land was ashamed of its dearth: but the
Prophet now performs the office of a teacher,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Perished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has the righteous from
the land; there is no one upright among men; all lay in wait for blood; every
one hunts his brother as with a net</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In
this verse the Prophet briefly shows, that all were full both of cruelty and
perfidy, that there was no care for justice; as though he said, In vain are good
men sought among this people; for they are all bloody, they are all fraudulent.
When he says, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all did
lay in wait for blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he no doubt
intended to set forth their cruelty, as though he had said, that they were
thirsting for blood. But when he adds, that each did lay in wait for their
brethren, he alludes to their frauds or to their perfidy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet: and
the manner he adopts is more emphatical than if God, in his own name, had
pronounced the words: for, as men were fixed, and as though drowned, in their
own carelessness, the Prophet introduces here the land as speaking, which
accuses its own children, and confesses its own guilt; yea, it anticipates
God&#8217;s judgment, and acknowledges itself to be contaminated by its own
inhabitants, so that nothing pure remained in it. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is properly addressed to the judges and
governors of the people, and also to the rich, who oppressed the miserable
common people, because they could not redeem themselves by rewards. The Prophet
therefore complains, that corruptions so much prevailed in judgments, that the
judges readily absolved the most wicked, provided they brought bribes. The sum
of what is said then is, that any thing might be done with impunity, for the
judges were venal. This is the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as interpreters differ, something shall be said
as to the import of the words.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ypk [rh
l[</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ol ero caphim,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the evil of their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to do good. Some give this
explanation, &#8220;Though they are openly wicked, yet they make pretenses, by
which they cover their wickedness:&#8221; and the sense would be this, &#8212;
that though they had cast aside every care for what was right, they yet had
become so hardened in iniquity, that they wished to be deemed good and holy men;
for in a disordered state of things the wicked always show an iron front, and
would have silence to be observed respecting their shameful deeds. Some
interpreters therefore think that the Prophet here complains, that there was now
no difference between what was honorable and base, right and wrong; for wicked
men dared so to disguise their iniquities, that they did not appear, or, that no
one ventured to say any thing against them. Do you, however, examine and
consider, whether what the Prophet says may be more fitly connected together in
this way, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may do good
for the wickedness of their hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that
is, to excuse themselves for the wickedness of their hands, they agree together;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the prince asks, the judge is
ready to receive a bribe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Thus, the rich saw
that exemption might have been got by them, for they had the price of redemption
in their hands: they indeed knew that the judges and princes could be pacified,
when they brought the price of corruption. And this is the meaning which I
approve, for it harmonizes best with the words of the Prophet. At the same time,
some give a different explanation of the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byfyhl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>laeithib,</i> that is that they acted vigorously in their wickedness: but
this exposition is frigid. I therefore embrace the one I have just stated, which
is, &#8212; that corruptions so prevailed in the administration of justice, that
coverings were ready for all crimes; for the governors and judges were lovers of
money, and were always ready to absolve the most guilty, but not without a
reward. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the wickedness then
of their works, that they may do good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>

judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judges for
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> the judges also were mercenary.
They did not sit to determine what was right and just; but as soon as they were
satisfied by bribes, they easily forgave all crimes; and thus they turned vices
into virtues; for they made no difference between white and black, but according
to the bribe received. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff125</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This view is consistent with what the Prophet
immediately subjoins, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
great,</i> </font><font face="Palatino">he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaks of the wickedness of his
soul, even he</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By the great, he does not
mean the chief men, as some incorrectly think, but he means the rich, who had
money enough to conciliate the judges. They then who could bring the price of
redemption, dared to boast openly of their wickedness: for so I render the word

then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the wickedness of his
soul does the great;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>there was then
nothing, neither fear nor shame, to restrain the rich from doing wrong. &#8212;
How so? For they knew that they had to do with mercenary judges and could easily
corrupt them. They hence dared to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak of the wickedness of their
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> they did not cloak their crimes,
as it is the case when some fear of the Law prevails, when justice is exercised:
but as no difference was made between good and evil, the most guilty boasted
openly of his wickedness. And the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">,

interpreters.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">
speaks of the wickedness of his soul; he did not wait until others accuse him of
doing wrong, but he shamelessly dared to glory in his crimes; for impunity was
certain, as he could close the mouth of the judges by bringing a bribe.

<div><font face="Palatino">And further, <i>they fold up</i> wickedness; which
means, that raging cruelty prevailed, because the governors, and those who
wished to purchase liberty to sin, conspired together; as though they made
ropes, and thus rendered firm their wickedness. For the great man, that is, the
rich and the monied, agreed with the judge, and the judge with him; and so there
was a collusion between them. It hence happened, that wickedness possessed, as
it were, a tyrannical power; for there was no remedy. We now apprehend the real
design of the Prophet, at least as far as I am able to discover. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what he had previously said,
&#8212; that the land was so full of every kind of wickedness, that they who
were deemed the best were yet thorns and briers, full of bitterness, or very
sharp to prick; as though he said, &#8220;The best among them is a thief; the
most upright among them is a robber.&#8221; We hence see, that in these words he
alludes to their accumulated sins, as though he said, &#8220;The condition of
the people cannot be worse; for iniquity has advanced to its extreme point: when
any one seeks for a good or an upright man, he only finds thorns and briers;
that is, he is instantly pricked.&#8221; But if the best were then like thorns,
what must have been the remainder? We have already seen that the judges were so
corrupt that they abandoned themselves without feeling any shame to any thing
that was base. What then could have been said of them, when the Prophet compares
here the upright and the just to thorns; yea, when he says, that they were
rougher than briers? Though it is an improper language to say, that the good and
the upright 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> among
them were like briers; for words are used contrary to their meaning, as it is
certain, that those who inhumanely pricked others were neither good nor just:
yet the meaning of the Prophet is in no way obscure, &#8212; that there was then
such license taken in wickedness, that even those who retained in some measure
the credit of being upright were yet nothing better than briers and thorns.
There is then in the words what may be deemed a concession.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The day of thy watchmen, thy
visitation comes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He here denounces the
near judgment of God, generally on the people, and especially on the rulers. But
he begins with the first ranks and says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The day of thy
watchmen;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though he said, &#8220;Ruin now
hangs over thy governors, though they by no means expect it.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Watchmen</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he calls the Prophets, who, by their flatteries, deceived the people, as well as
their rulers: and he sets the Prophets in the front, because they were the cause
of the common ruin. He does not yet exempt the body of the people from
punishment; nay, he joins together these two things, &#8212; the visitation of
the whole people, and the day of the watchmen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And justly does he direct his discourse to these
watchmen, who, being blind, blinded all the rest; and who, being perverted, led
astray the whole people. This is the reason why the Prophet now, in an especial
manner, threatens them; but, as I have already said, the people were not on this
account to be excused. There may seem indeed to have been here a fair pretense
for extenuating their guilt: the common people might have said that they had not
been warned as they ought to have been; nay, that they had been destroyed
through delusive falsehoods. And we see at this day that many make such a
pretense as this. But a defense of this kind is of no avail before God; for
though the common people are blinded, yet they go astray off their own accord,
since they lend a willing ear to impostors. And even the reason why God gave
loose reins to Satan as well as to his ministers, and why he gives, as Paul
says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:11,) power to delusion, is this, &#8212; because the greater
part of the world ever seeks to be deceived. The denunciation of the Prophet
then is this, &#8212; that as the judges and the Prophets had badly exercised
their office, they would be led to the punishment which they deserved, for they
had been, as it has been elsewhere observed, the cause of ruin to others: in the
meantime, the common people were not excusable. The vengeance of God then would
overtake them and from the least to the greatest, without any exemption.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy
visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>comes.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards speaks in the third person,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall be their
confusion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or perplexity, or they shall
be ashamed. The Prophet here alludes indirectly to the hardness of the people;
for though the Prophets daily threatened them, they yet remained all of them
secure; nay, we know that all God&#8217;s judgments were held in derision by
them. As then the faithful teachers could not have moved wicked men either with
fear or with shame, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then confusion shall come to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as though he said, &#8220;Be
hardened now as much as ye wish to be, as I see that you are stupid, yea,
senseless, and attend not to the word of the Lord; but the time of visitation
will come, and then the Lord will constrain you to be ashamed, for he will
really show you to be such as ye are; and he will not then contend with you in
words as he does now; but the announced punishment will divest you of all your
false pretenses; and he will also remove that waywardness which now hardens you
against wholesome doctrine and all admonitions.&#8221;</font><br></div>

under the guidance of thy Word, that we may cultivate true piety, and also what
is just towards our neighbors: and as there is in us no power to preserve
ourselves safe, grant that thy Son may so protect us by the power of the Holy
Spirit, that we may continue to advance towards the end of our course, until we
be at length gathered into that celestial kingdom, which he has procured for us
by his own blood. Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues the subject we discussed
yesterday, &#8212; that liberty, in iniquity, bad arrived to its highest point,
for no faithfulness remained among men; nay, there was no more any humanity; for
the son performed not his duty towards his father, nor the daughter-in-law
towards her mother-in-law; in short, there was then no mutual love and concord.
He does not here speak of that false confidence, by which many deceive
themselves, who rely on mortals, and transfer to them the glory which belongs to
God. Those therefore without any reason, philosophize here, who say, that we
ought not to trust in men; for this was not the design of the Prophet. But our
Prophet complains of his times according to the tenor of Ovid&#8217;s
description of the iron age, who says -</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;&#8212;A
guest is not safe from his
host;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i> Nor a
brother-in-law from a son-in-law; and brotherly love is
rare:</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A husband seeks
the death of his wife, and she, of her
husband;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Cruel

</i></b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff128</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also our Prophet says, that there was no regard to
humanity among men; for the wife was ready to betray her husband, the son
treated his father with reproach; in short, they had all forgotten humanity or
natural affection. We now then understand what the Prophet means by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Trust not a
friend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, if any one hopes for any thing from a friend, he will be deceived; for
nothing can be found among men but perfidy.</font><br></div>

<i>aluph</i>; some translate it, an elder brother; but there is no necessity to
constrain us to depart from the proper and true meaning of the word. As then the
Prophet had spoken of an associate or a friend, so he now adds a counselor. And
it proves what he had in view, when he says in the next clause, that no enemies
are worse than domestics. We hence see that the Prophet simply means, that the
men of his age were not only avaricious and cruel to one another, but that
without any regard to human feelings the son rebelled against his father, and
thus subverted the whole order of nature; So that they had none of those
affections, which seem at the same time to be incapable of being extinguished in
men. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet points out here the only remedy, to
preserve the faithful from being led away by bad examples and that is, to fix
their eyes on God, and to believe that he will be their deliverer. Nothing is
more difficult than to refrain from doing wrong, when the ungodly provoke us;
for they seem to afford us a good reason for retaliation. And when no one
injures us, yet custom is deemed almost a law: thus it happens that we think
that to be lawful which is sanctioned by the manners and customs of the age; and
when success attends the wicked, this becomes a very strong incentive. Thus it
happens, that the faithful can hardly, and with no small difficulty, keep
themselves within proper bounds: when they see that wickedness reigns
everywhere, and that with impunity; and still more, when they see the abettors
of wickedness increasing in esteem and wealth, immediately the corrupt lust of
emulation creeps in. But when the faithful themselves are provoked by injuries,
there seems then to be a just reason for doing wrong; for they say that they
willfully do harm to no one, but only resist an injury done to them, or
retaliate fraud with fraud: this they think is lawful. The Prophet, in order to
prevent this temptation, bids the faithful to look to God. The same sentiment we
often meet with in Psalm 119: its import is, that the faithful are not to suffer
themselves to be led away by bad examples, but to continue ever obedient to
God&#8217;s word, however great and violent the provocations they may receive.
Let us now consider the words of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I

<i>tsaphe,</i> properly means to look on, to behold; (<i>speculari;</i>) it is
sometimes taken in the sense of expecting; but I am inclined to retain its
proper meaning, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
look</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on
God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, I will do the same as though the
only true God were before my eyes. How indeed does it happen that even the good
indulge themselves while living among the wicked and ungodly, except that they
are too much occupied with things around them? If then we desire to maintain
integrity, while the world presents to us nothing but examples of sin, let us
learn to pass by these temptations as with closed eyes. This may be done, if we
direct our eyes to God alone. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will look</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will wait for the God of my
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet says nothing new
here, but only explains more clearly the last clause, defining the manner of the
looking of which he had spoken; as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Patiently will
I bear, while God helps me:&#8221; for when the wicked harass us on every side,
we shall no doubt soon turn away our eyes from Gods except we be armed with
patience. And how comes patience, unless we be fully persuaded that God will be
our deliverer, when the suitable time shall come? We now perceive the intention
of the Prophet. He shows that the godly cannot otherwise continue constant in
their integrity, except they turn their eyes to the only true God. Then he adds,
that they cannot be preserved in this contemplation, unless they wait patiently
for God, that is, for his help.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of his
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> by which he intimates that,
relying on his word, he thus perseveres in enduring injuries: for it cannot be
but that every one will submit himself to God, and surrender himself to be
protected by him, if this truth be first fixed in his mind &#8212; that God will
never forsake his own people. This then is the reason why he calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of his
salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But this title must be referred to
his present circumstances, as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Though God&#8217;s
hand does not now appear to help or to bring me aid, I yet feel assured of his
favor, and I know that my salvation is secured by it.&#8221;</font><br></div>

God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He here confirms what we have
already said, &#8212; that, being supported by the promises of God, he thus
composes his mind to patience; for patience would often vanish or would be
shaken off by temptations, unless we were surely persuaded that God provides for
our salvation, and that we shall not hope in him in vain. Nor is it to no
purpose that he says, that God was his God. He was one of his people; and this
seems to have been the common privilege of all the Jews: yet the Prophet no
doubt connects God with himself here in a peculiar manner; for men in general
had fallen away into ungodliness. They all indeed gloried in the name of God,
but absurdly and falsely. Hence the Prophet intimates, that he was under his
protection in a manner different from the rest: for when any one allows himself
the liberty of doing evil, he, at the same time, renounces God and his
protection. Therefore, the Prophet no doubt alludes indirectly to the irreligion
of the people. For though the vain boasting, that they had been adopted by God,
that they were the holy race of Abraham, was everywhere in the mouth of all, yet
hardly one in a hundred had any regard for God. But it is also of importance to
notice, that the Prophet, by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear me will
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> gives a testimony, at the same
time, respecting his own faith, &#8212; that he would always apply to God for
help, and exercise himself in prayer whenever necessity urged him; for God hears
not except when he is called upon. The Prophet then recommends here, by his
example, an attention to prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this verse shows to us in general that there is
no excuse for us if we suffer ourselves to be led away, as it is daily the case,
by bad examples. And then to look to God is especially needful, when all
excesses of wickedness prevail in the world: when the lusts of men become the
rule and the law, we ought then to renounce in a manner the society of men, that
they may not implicate us in their wickedness. They, therefore, who allege for
themselves the examples of others, employ a frivolous excuse, as many do in the
present day, who set up the shield of custom: though they are clearly condemned
by the word of God, yet they think it a sufficient defense, that they follow
others. But we see how frivolous is this confidence; for the Prophet no doubt
prescribes here a law for all the children of God as to what they ought to do,
when the devil tempts them to sin by the bad examples and shameful deeds of the
majority. Let us go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet assumes the character of the Church
and repels a temptation, which proves very severe to us in adversities; for
there is not so much bitterness in the evil itself, as in the mockery of the
wicked, when they petulantly insult us and deride our faith. And to noble minds
reproach is ever sharper than death itself: and yet the devil almost always
employs this artifice; for when he sees that we stand firm in temptations, he
suborns the wicked and sharpens their tongues to speak evil of use and to wound
us with slanders. This is the reason why the Prophet directs his discourse now
to the enemies of the Church. But as God calls the Church his spouse, and as she
is described to us under the character of a woman, so also he compares here the
enemies of the holy people to a petulant woman. As, therefore, when there is
emulation between two women, she, who sees her enemy pressed down by evils and
adverse events, immediately raises up herself and triumphs; so also the Prophet
says respecting the enemies of the Church; they sharpened their tongues, and
vomited forth their bitterness, as soon as they saw the children of God in
trouble or nearly overwhelmed with adversities. We now then understand the
design of the Prophet, &#8212; that he wished to arm us, as I have said, against
the taunts of the ungodly, lest they should prevail against us when God presses
us down with adversities, but that we may stand courageously, and with composed
and tranquil minds, swallow down the indignity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice not over
me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my
enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Why not? He adds a consolation;
for it would not be enough for one to repel with disdain the taunts of his
enemy; but the Prophet says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice not, for should I fall, I
shall rise;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or though I fall, I shall rise: and
the passage seems to harmonize better when there is a pause after Rejoice not
over me; and then to add, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though
I fall, I shall rise, though I sit in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The Prophet means, that the state of the Church was not past hope. There
would be ample room for our enemies to taunt us, were it not that this promise
cannot fail us, &#8212; seven times in the day the just falls, and rises again,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;202416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
24:16.) &#8212; How so? For God puts under him his own hand. We now perceive the
meaning of this passage. For if God deprived us of all hope, enemies might
justly deride us, and we must be silent: but since we are surely persuaded that
God is ready at hand to restore us again, we can boldly answer our enemies when
they annoy with their derisions; though I fall, I shall rise: &#8220;There is
now no reason for thee to triumph over me when I fall; for it is God&#8217;s
will that I should fall, but it is for this end &#8212; that I may soon rise
again; and though I now lie in darkness, yet the Lord will be my
light.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that our hope triumphs against all
temptations: and this passage shows in a striking manner, how true is that
saying of John, &#8212; that our faith gains the victory over the world,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:4.) For when sorrow and trouble take possession of our hearts, we shall
not fail if this comes to our mind &#8212; that God will be our aid in the time
of need. And when men vomit forth their poison against us, we ought to be
furnished with the same weapons: then our minds shall never succumb, but boldly
repel all the taunts of Satan and of wicked men. This we learn from this
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, from what the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though I fall, I shall rise
again,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> we see what God would have us to expect,
even a happy and joyful exit at all times from our miseries; but on this subject
I shall have to speak more copiously a little farther on. As to the latter
clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I sit in darkness,
God will be my light,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it seems to be a
confirmation of the preceding sentence, where the Prophet declares, that the
fall of the Church would not be fatal. But yet some think that more is
expressed, namely, that in the very darkness some spark of light would still
shine. They then distinguish between this clause and the former one, which
speaks of the fall and the rise of the faithful, in this manner, &#8212; that
while they lie, as it were, sunk in darkness, they shall not even then be
without consolation, for God&#8217;s favor would ever shine on them. And this
seems to be a correct view: for it cannot be that any one will expect the
deliverance of which the Prophet speaks, except he sees some light even in the
thickest darkness, and sustains himself by partaking, in some measure, of
God&#8217;s goodness: and a taste of God&#8217;s favor in distresses is suitably
compared to light; as when one is cast into a deep pit, by raising upward his
eyes, he sees at a distance the light of the sun; so also the obscure and thick
darkness of tribulations may not so far prevail as to shut out from us every
spark of light, and to prevent faith from raising our eyes upwards, that we may
have some taste of God&#8217;s goodness. Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Church of God animates and encourages
herself to exercise patience, and does so especially by two arguments. She first
sets before herself her sins, and thus humbles herself before God, whom she
acknowledges to be a just Judge; and, in the second place, she embraces the hope
of the forgiveness of her sins, and from this arises confidence as to her
deliverance. By these two supports the Church sustains herself, that she fails
not in her troubles, and gathers strength, as I have already said, to endure
patiently.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of Jehovah will I bear, for
sinned have I against him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This passage
shows, that when any one is seriously touched with the conviction of God&#8217;s
judgment, he is at the same time prepared to exercise patience; for it cannot
be, but that a sinner, conscious of evil, and knowing that he suffers justly
will humbly and thankfully submit to the will of God. Hence when men perversely
glamour against God, or murmur, it is certain that they have not as yet been
made sensible of their sins. I allow indeed that many feel guilty who yet
struggle against God, and fiercely resist his hand as much as they can, and also
blaspheme his name when he chastises them: but they are not touched hitherto
with the true feeling of penitence, so as to abhor themselves. Judas owned
indeed that he had sinned, and freely made such confession,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:3.) Cain tried to cover his sin, but the Lord drew from him an unwilling
confession,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:13.) They did not yet repent; nay, they ceased not to contend with God; for
Cain complained that his punishment was too heavy to be borne; Judas despaired.
And the same thing happens to all the reprobate. They seemed then to have been
sufficiently convinced to acknowledge their guilt, and, as it were, to assent to
the justice of God&#8217;s judgment; but they did not really know their sins, so
as to abhor themselves, as I have said, on account of their sins. For true
penitence is ever connected with the submission of which the Prophet now speaks.
Whosoever then is really conscious of his sins, renders himself at the same time
obedient to God, and submits himself altogether to his will. Thus repentance
does ever of itself lead to the bearing of the cross; so that he who sets
himself before God&#8217;s tribunal allows himself to be at the same time
chastised, and bears punishment with a submissive mind: as the ox, that is
tamed, always takes the yoke without any resistance, so also is he prepared who
is really touched with the sense of his sins, to bear any punishment which God
may be pleased to inflict on him. This then is the first thing which we ought to
learn from these words of the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wrath of Jehovah will I bear,
for sinned have I against him.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We also learn from this passage, that all who do not
patiently bear his scourges contend with God; for though they do not openly
accuse God, and say that they are just, they do not yet ascribe to him his
legitimate glory, by confessing that he is a righteous judge. &#8212; How so?
Because these two things are united together and joined by an indissoluble knot
&#8212; to be sensible of sin &#8212; and to submit patiently to the will of the
Judge when he inflicts punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the other argument,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until he decides my cause, and
vindicates my right; he will bring me forth into the light, I shall see his
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Church leans on
another support; for though the Lord should most heavily afflict her, she would
not yet cast aside the hope of deliverance; for she knew, as we have already
seen, that she was chastised for her good: and indeed no one could even for a
moment continue patient in a state of misery, except he entertained the hope of
being delivered, and promised to himself a happy escape. These two things then
ought not to be separated, and cannot be, &#8212; the acknowledgment of our
sins, which will humble us before God, &#8212; and the knowledge of his
goodness, and a firm assurance as to our salvation; for God has testified that
he will be ever propitious to us, how much soever he may punish us for our sins,
and that he will remember mercy, as Habakkuk says, in the midst of his wrath,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:2.) It would not then be sufficient for us to feel our evils, except the
consolation, which proceeds from the promises of grace, be
added.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows further, that the Church was
innocent, with regard to its enemies, though justly suffering punishment. And
this ought to be carefully observed; for whenever we have to do with the wicked,
we think that there is no blame belonging to us. But these two things ought to
be considered, &#8212; that the wicked trouble us without reason, and thus our
cause as to them is just, &#8212; and yet that we are justly afflicted by God;
for we shall ever find many reasons why the Lord should chastise us. These two
things, then, ought to be both considered by us, as the Prophet seems to
intimate here: for at the beginning of the verse he says, The wrath of God will
I bear, for sinned have I against him; and now he adds, The Lord will yet
vindicate my right, literally, &#8220;will debate my dispute,&#8221; that is,
plead my cause. Since the Church is guilty before God, nay, waits not for the
sentence of the judge, but anticipates it, and freely confesses herself to be
worthy of such punishment, what does this mean, &#8212; that the Lord will
decide her quarrel, that he will undertake her cause? These two things seem to
militate the one against the other: but they agree well together when viewed in
their different bearings. The Church had confessed that she had sinned against
God; she now turns her eyes to another quarter; for she knew that she was
unjustly oppressed by enemies; she knew that they were led to do wrong by
cruelty alone. This then is the reason why the Church entertained hope, and
expected that God would become the defender of her innocence, that is, against
the wicked: and yet she humbly acknowledged that she had sinned against God.
Whenever, then, our enemies do us harm, let us lay hold on this truth, &#8212;
that God will become our defender; for he is ever the patron of justice and
equity: it cannot then be, that God will abandon us to the violence of the
wicked. He will then at length<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plead our
pleading</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or undertake our cause, and be
its advocate. But, in the meantime, let our sins be remembered by us, that,
being truly humbled before God, we may not hope for the salvation which he
promises to us, except through gratuitous pardon. Why then are the faithful
bidden to be of good comfort in their afflictions? Because God has promised to
be their Father; he has received them under his protection, he has testified
that his help shall never be wanting to them. But whence is this confidence? Is
it because they are worthy? Is it because they have deserved something of this
kind? By no means: but they acknowledge themselves to be guilty, when they
humbly prostrate themselves before God, and when they willingly condemn
themselves before his tribunal, that they may anticipate his judgment. We now
see how well the Prophet connects together these two things, which might
otherwise seem contradictory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follow the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will bring me to the light, I
shall see his righteousness!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Church still confirms herself in the hope of deliverance: art it is hence also
manifest how God is light to the faithful in obscure darkness, because they see
that there is prepared for them an escape from their evils; but they see it at a
distance, for they extend their hope beyond the boundaries of this life. As then
the truth of God diffuses itself through heaven and earth, so the faithful
extend their hope far and wide. Thus it is, that they can see light afar off,
which seems to be very remote from them. And having this confidence, the Prophet
says, The Lord </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will bring me into
the light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They have, in the meantime, as I
have already said, some light; they enjoy a taste of God&#8217;s goodness in the
midst of their evils: but the Prophet now refers to that coming forth which we
ought to look for even in the worst circumstances.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall see his
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By God&#8217;s
righteousness is to be understood, as it has been elsewhere stated, his favor
towards the faithful; not that God returns for their works the salvation which
he bestows, as ungodly men foolishly imagine; for they lay hold on the word
righteousness, and think that whatever favors God freely grants us are due to
our merits. &#8212; How so? For God in this way shows his own righteousness. But
far different is the reason for this mode of speaking. God, in order to show how
dear and precious to him is our salvation, does indeed say, that he designs to
give an evidence of his justice in delivering us: but there is a reference in
this word righteousness to something else; for God has promised that our
salvation shall be the object of his care, hence he appears just whenever he
delivers us from our troubles. Then the righteousness of God is not to be
referred to the merits of works, but, on the contrary, to the promise by which
he has bound himself to us; and so also in the same dense God is often said to
be faithful. In a word, the righteousness and faithfulness of God mean the same
thing. When the Prophet says now in the person of the Church,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall see his
righteousness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means, that though God
concealed his favor for a time, and withdrew his hand, so that no hope of aid
remained, it could not yet be, as he is just, but that he would succor us:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall
see</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
righteousness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, God will at length
really show that he is righteous. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
NINETY-SEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last lecture I repeated the tenth verse of the
last chapter, in which the prophet adds, as a cause of the greatest joy, that
the enemies of the Church shall see granted, to their great mortification, the
wonderful favor of which the Prophet had been speaking. But he describes these
enemies, under the character of an envious woman, as the Church of God is also
compared to a woman: and this mode of speaking is common in Scripture. He then
calls Jerusalem his rival, or Babylon, or some city of his
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Covered shall she be with
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We know that the ungodly grow
insolent when fortune smiles on them: hence in prosperity they keep within no
bounds, for they think that God is under their feet. If prosperity most commonly
has the effect of making the godly to forget God and even themselves, it is no
wonder that the unbelieving become more and more hardened, when God is indulgent
to them. With regard then to such a pride, the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When my enemy shall see, shame
shall cover her;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, she will not continue
in her usual manner, to elate herself with her own boastings: nay, she will be
compelled for shame to hide herself; for she will see that she had been greatly
deceived, in thinking that I should be wholly ruined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who said to me, Where is Jehovah
thy God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Church of God in her turn
triumphs here over the unbelieving, having been delivered by divine power; nor
does she do this for her own sake, but because the ungodly expose the holy name
of God to reproach, which is very common: for whenever God afflicts his people,
the unbelieving immediately raise their crests, and pour forth their blasphemies
against God, when yet they ought, on the contrary, to humble themselves under
his hand. But since God executes his judgments on the faithful, what can be
expected by his ungodly despisers? If God&#8217;s vengeance be manifested in a
dreadful manner with regard to the green tree, what will become of the dry wood?
And the ungodly are like the dry wood. But as they are blind as to God&#8217;s
judgments, they petulantly deride his name, whenever they see the Church
afflicted, as though adversities were not the evidences of God&#8217;s
displeasure: for he chastises his own children, to show that he is the judge of
the world. But, as I have already said, the ungodly so harden themselves in
their stupor, that they are wholly thoughtless. The faithful, therefore, after
having found God to be their deliverer, do here undertake his cause; they do not
regard themselves nor their own character, but defend the righteousness of God.
Such is this triumphant language,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who said, Where is now Jehovah
thy God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;I can really show that I
worship the true God, who deserts not his people in extreme necessity: after he

like mire, is connected with the promise, which we already noticed; for God so
appears as the deliverer of his Church, as not to leave its enemies unpunished.
God then, while he aids his own people, leads the ungodly to punishment. Hence
the Church, while embracing the deliverance offered to her, at the same time
sees the near ruin, which impends on all the despisers of God. But what is
stated, <i>See shall my eyes,</i> ought not to be so taken, as though the
faithful exult with carnal joy, when they see the ungodly suffering the
punishment which they have deserved; for the word to see is to be taken
metaphorically, as signifying a pleasant and joyful sight, according to what it
means in many other places; and as it is a phrase which often occurs, its
meaning must be well known.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall my
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, &#8220;I shall enjoy to
look on that calamity, which now impends over all the ungodly.&#8221; But, as I
have already said, carnal joy is not what is here intended, which intemperately
exults, but that pure joy which the faithful experience on seeing the grace of
God displayed and also his judgment. But this joy cannot enter into our hearts
until they be cleansed from unruly passions; for we are ever excessive in fear
and sorrow, as well as in hope and joy, except the Lord holds us in, as it were,
with a bridle. We shall therefore be only then capable of this spiritual joy, of
which the Prophet speaks, when we shall put off all disordered feelings, and God
shall subdue us by his Spirit: then only shall we be able to retain moderation
in our joy. The Prophet proceeds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Micah pursues the subject on which he had previously
spoken, &#8212; that though the Church thought itself for a time to be wholly
lost, yet God would become its deliverer. He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the day was near, in which
they were to build the wall.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rdg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gidar,</i> means either a mound or a wall; so it ought to be distinguished
from a wall, that is, a strong fortress. He then intimates that the time would
come, when God would gather his Church, and preserve it, as though it were
defended on every side by walls. For we know that the scattering of the Church
is compared to the pulling down of walls or fences: as when a person pulls down
the fence of a field or a vineyard, or breaks down all enclosures; so when the
Church is exposed as a prey to all, she is said to be like an open field or a
vineyard, which is without any fence. Now, on the other hand, the Prophet says
here, that the time would come, when the faithful shall again build walls, by
which they may be protected from the assaults and plunder of enemies,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to build thy
walls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This day shall drive afar off the
edict</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> some render it tribute; but the
word properly means an edict, and this best suits the passage; for the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning is, that the people would not, as before, be subject to
the tyranny of Babylon. For after the subversion of Jerusalem, the Babylonians,
no doubt, triumphed very unfeelingly over the miserable people, and uttered
dreadful threatening. The Prophet, therefore, under the name of edict, includes
that cruel and tyrannical dominion which the Babylonians for a time exercised.
We know what God denounces on the Jews by Ezekiel,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Ye would not keep my good laws; I
will therefore give you laws which are not good, which ye shall be constrained
to keep; and yet ye shall not live in them,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262025&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
20:25.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those laws which were not good were the edicts of
which the Prophet now speaks.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall drive far away the
edict</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that the Jews might not dread the
laws of their enemies. For the Babylonians no doubt forbade, under the severest
punishment, any one from building even a single house in the place where
Jerusalem formerly was; for they wished that place to remain desolate, that the
people might know that they had no hope of restoration.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall put afar

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

Jews to build their city; and then they shall not tremblingly expect every hour,
until new edicts come forth, denouncing grievous punishments on whomsoever that
would dare to encourage his brethren to build the temple of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some draw the Prophet&#8217;s words to another
meaning: they first think that he speaks only of the spiritual kingdom of
Christ, and then they take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qjr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rechek,</i> in the sense of extending or propagating, and consider this to be
the Gospel which Christ, by the command of the Father, promulgated through the
whole world. It is indeed true that David uses the word decree in Psalm 2, while
speaking of the preaching of the Gospel; and it is also true, that the
promulgation of that decree is promised in Psalm 110, &#8216;The rod of his
power will Jehovah send forth from Zion.&#8217; But this passage ought not to be
thus violently perverted; for the Prophet no doubt means, that the Jews would be
freed from all dread of tyranny when God restored them to liberty; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qjr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rechek,</i> does not mean to extend or propagate, but to drive far away.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall drive away the
decree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that the faithful shall be no
more subject to tyrannical commands. We now perceive the true meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The faithful doubtless prayed in their adversities,
and depended on such prophecies as we find in Psalm 102,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;The day is now
come to show mercy to Zion, and to build its walls; for thy servants pity her
stones.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor did the faithful pray thus presumptuously, but
taking confidence, as though God had dictated a form of prayer by his own mouth,
they dealt with God according to his promise, &#8220;O Lord, thou hast promised
the rebuilding of the city, and the time has been prefixed by Jeremiah and by
other Prophets: since then the time is now completed, grant that the temple and
the holy city may again be built.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the words, &#8220;In the day in which
thou shalt build (or God shall build) thy walls &#8212; in that day shall be
removed afar off the decree.&#8221; But I doubt not but that the Prophet
promises here distinctly to the faithful both the restoration of the city and a
civil freedom; for the sentence is in two parts: the Prophet intimates first,
that the time was now near when the faithful would build their own walls, that
they might not be exposed to the will of their enemies, &#8212; and then he
adds, that they would be freed from the dread of tyranny; for God, as it is said
by Isaiah, would break the yoke of the burden, and the scepter of the oppressor,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:4;) and it is altogether the same kind of sentence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day also to thee shall
they come from Asshur.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is some obscurity
in the words; hence interpreters have regarded different words as being
understood: but to me the meaning of the Prophet appears not doubtful.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to thee shall they come
from Asshur, and cities of the fortress and from the fortress even to the river,
and from sea to sea, and from mountain to
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> but some think
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>er,</i> to be a proper name, and render the last clause, &#8220;And from
mount Hor:&#8221; and we know that Aaron was buried on this mount. But the
Prophet, no doubt, alludes here to some other place; and to render it mount Hor
is a strained version. I doubt not, therefore, but that the Prophet repeats a
common name, as though he said, &#8220;From mountains to
mountains.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see what the Prophet means. With regard to
the passage, as I have said, there is no ambiguity, provided we bear in mind the
main subject. Now the Prophet had this in view, &#8212; That Jerusalem, when
restored by God, would be in such honor along all nations that there would be
flowing to her from all parts. He then says, that the state of the city would be
very splendid, so that people from all quarters would come to it: and therefore
the copulative vau is to be taken twice for <i>even </i>for the sake of
emphasis, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day, even to
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even to the
river</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for it was not believed that
Jerusalem would have any dignity, after it had been entirely destroyed, together
with the temple. It is no wonder then that the Prophet so distinctly confirms
here what was by no means probable, at least according to the common sentiments
of men, &#8212; that Jerusalem would attract to itself all nations, even those
far away.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
they</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> (for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awby</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ibua,</i> in the singular number must be taken indefinitely as having a
plural meaning,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they from Asshur
even to thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But the Assyrians had previously
destroyed every land, overturned the kingdom of Israel, and almost blotted out
its name; and they had also laid waste the kingdom of Judah; a small portion
only remained. They came afterwards, we know, with the Chaldeans, after the seat
of empire was translated to Babylon, and destroyed Nineveh. Therefore, by naming
the Assyrians, he no doubt, taking a part for the whole, included the
Babylonians.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they from
Asshur</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and then, from the cities of the
fortress, that is, from every fortress. For they who take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsur,</i> for Tyre are mistaken; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsur</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is
mentioned twice, and it means citadels and strongholds. And then, <i>even to the
river, </i>that is, to utmost borders of Euphrates; for many take Euphrates, by
way of excellence, to be meant by the word river; as it is often the case in
Scripture; though it might be not less fitly interpreted of any or every river,
as though the Prophet had said, that there would be no obstacle to stop their
course who would hasten to Jerusalem.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even to the river</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">then, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from sea to
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, they shall come in troops
from remote countries, being led by the celebrity of the holy city; for when it
shall be rebuilt by God&#8217;s command, it shall acquire new and unusual honor,
so that all people from every part shall assemble there. And then<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from mountain to
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, from regions far
asunder. This is the sum of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then promises what all men deemed as
fabulous, &#8212; that the dignity of the city Jerusalem should be so great
after the return of the Jews from exile, that it would become, as it were, the
metropolis of the world. One thing must be added: They who confine this passage
to Christ seem not indeed to be without a plausible reason; for there follows
immediately a threatening as to the desolation of the land; and there seems to
be some inconsistency, except we consider the Prophet here as comparing the
Church collected from all nations with the ancient people. But these things will
harmonize well together if we consider, that the Prophet denounces vengeance on
the unbelieving who then lived, and that he yet declares that God will be
merciful to his chosen people. But the restriction which they maintain is too
rigid; for we know that it was usual with the Prophets to extend the favor of
God from the return of the ancient people to the coming of Christ. Whenever,
then, the Prophets make known God&#8217;s favor in the deliverance of his
people, they make a transition to Christ, but included also the whole
intermediate time. And this mode the Prophet now pursues, and it ought to be
borne in mind by us. Let us go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, as I have already said, seems to be
inconsistent with himself: for after having spoken of the restoration of the
land, he now abruptly says, that it would be deserted, because God had been
extremely provoked by the wickedness of the people. But, as I have stated
before, it was almost an ordinary practice with the Prophets, to denounce at one
time God&#8217;s vengeance on all the Jews, and then immediately to turn to the
faithful, who were small in number, and to raise up their minds with the hope of
deliverance. We indeed know that the Prophets had to do with the profane
despisers of God; it was therefore necessary for them to fulminate, when they
addressed the whole body of the people: the contagion had pervaded all orders,
so that they were all become apostates, from the highest to the lowest, with
very few exceptions, and those hidden amidst the great mass, like a few grains
in a vast heap of chaff. Then the Prophets did not without reason mingle
consolations with threatening; and their threatening they addressed to the whole
body of the people; and then they whispered, as it were, in the ear, some
consolation to the elect of God, the few remnants, &#8212; &#8220;Yet the Lord
will show mercy to you; though he has resolved to destroy his people, ye shall
yet remain safe, but this will be through some hidden means.&#8221; Our Prophet
then does, on the one hand, as here, denounce God&#8217;s vengeance on a people
past remedy; and, on the others he speaks of the redemption of the Church, that
by this support the faithful might be sustained in their
adversities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The land shall be for
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
why does he speak in so abrupt a manner? That he might drive hypocrites from
that false confidence, with which they were swollen though God addressed not a
word to them: but when God pronounced any thing, as they covered themselves with
the name of Church, they then especially laid hold of any thing that was said to
the faithful, as though it belonged to them: &#8220;Has not God promised that he
will be the deliverer of his people?&#8221; as though indeed he was to be their
deliverer, who had alienated themselves by their perfidy from him; and yet this
was a very common thing among them. Hence the Prophet, seeing that hypocrites
would greedily lay hold on what he had said, and by taking this handle would
become more audacious, says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The land shall be for
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, &#8220;Be ye gone;
for when God testifies that he will be the deliverer of his Church, he does not
address you; for ye are the rotten members; and the land shall be reduced to a
waste before God&#8217;s favor, of which I now speak, shall appear.&#8221; We
now then perceive the reason for this passage, why the Prophet so suddenly
joined threatenings to promises: it was, to terrify hypocrites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of its inhabitants,
from the fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, on account of the
fruit </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of their
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet closes the door
against the despisers of God, lest they should break forth, according to their
custom, and maintain that God was, as it were, bound to them: &#8220;See,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;what ye are; for ye have polluted the land with your vices; it
must therefore be reduced to desolation.&#8221; And when the land, which is in
itself innocent, is visited with judgment, what will become of those despisers
whose wickedness it sustains? We hence see how emphatical was this mode of
speaking. For the Prophet summons here all the unbelieving to examine their
life, and then he sets before them the land, which was to suffer punishment,
though it had committed no sin; and why was it to suffer? because it was
polluted as I have said by their wickedness. Since this was the case, we see,
that hypocrites were very justly driven away from the false confidence with
which they were inflated, while they yet proudly despised God and his Word. It
now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet turns to supplications and prayers;
by which he manifests more vehemence, than if he had repeated again what he had
previously said of the restoration of the Church; for he shows how dreadful that
judgment would be, when God would reduce the land into solitude. This prayer no
doubt contains what was at the same time prophetic. The Prophet does not indeed
simply promise deliverance to the faithful, but at the same time he doubly
increases that terror; by which he designed to frighten hypocrites; as though he
said, &#8220;Most surely except God will miraculously preserve his own people,
it is all over with the Church: there is then no remedy, except through the
ineffable power of God.&#8221; In short, the Prophet shows, that he trembled at
that vengeance, which he had previously foretold, and which he did foretell,
lest hypocrites, in their usual manner, should deride him. We now see why the
Prophet had recourse to this kind of comfort, why he so regulates his discourse
as not to afford immediate hope to the faithful, but addresses God himself.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Feed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy

&#8220;Surely that calamity will be fatal, except thou, Lord, wilt be mindful of
thy covenant, and gather again some remnant from the people whom thou hast been
pleased to choose: Feed thy people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason why he called them the people of God was,
because they must all have perished, unless it had been that it was necessary
that what God promised to Abraham should be fulfilled, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;In thy seed shall
all nations be blessed,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
12:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was then the adoption of God alone which prevented
the total destruction of the Jews. Hence he says emphatically, &#8212; O Lord,
these are yet thy people; as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;By whom wilt thou
now form a Church for thyself?&#8221; God might indeed have collected it from
the Gentiles, and have made aliens his family; but it was necessary that the
root of adoption should remain in the race of Abraham, until Christ came forth.
Nor was there then any dispute about God&#8217;s power, as there is now among
fanatics, who ask, Can God do this? But there was reliance on the promise, and
from this they learnt with certainty what God had once decreed, and what he
would do. Since then this promise, &#8216;By thy seed shall all nations be
blessed,&#8217; was sacred and inviolable, the grace of God must have ever
continued in the remnant. It is indeed certain, that hypocrites, as it has been
already stated, without any discrimination, abused the promises of God; but this
truth must be ever borne in mind, that God punished the ungodly, though relying
on their great number, they thought that they would be always preserved. God
then destroyed <i>them,</i> as they deserved; and yet it was his purpose, that
some remnant should be among that people. But it must be observed, that this
distinction ought not to be extended to all the children of Abraham, who derived
their origin from him according to the flesh, but to be applied to the faithful,
that is, to the remnant, who were preserved according to the gratuitous adoption
of God.</font><br></div>

taken also for a pastoral staff, as in Psalm 23 and in many other places. As
then he represents God here as a Shepherd, so he assigns a crook to him; as
though he said, O Lord, thou performest the office of a Shepherd in ruling this
people. How so? He immediately confirms what I have lately said, that there was
no hope of a remedy except through the mercy of God, by
adding</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, the
flock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> 
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff136</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
of thine heritage</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for by calling them
the flock of his heritage, he does not consider what the people deserved, but
fixes his eyes on their gratuitous adoption. Since, then, it had pleased God to
choose that people, the Prophet on this account dares to go forth to God&#8217;s
presence, and to plead their gratuitous election, &#8212; &#8220;O Lord, I will
not bring before thee the nobility of our race, or any sort of dignity, or our
piety, or any merits.&#8221; What then? &#8220;We are thy people, for thou best
declared that we are a royal priesthood. We are then thine heritage.&#8221; How
so? &#8220;Because it has been thy pleasure to have one peculiar people sacred
to thee.&#8221; We now more clearly see that the Prophet relied on God&#8217;s
favor alone, and opposed the recollection of the covenant to the trials which
might have otherwise made every hope to fail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who dwell
apart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or alone. He no doubt refers here
to the dispersion of the people, when he says, that they dwelt alone. For though
the Jews had been scattered in countries delightful, fertile and populous, yet
they were everywhere as in a desert and in solitude, for they were a mutilated
body. The whole of Chaldea and of Assyria was then really a desert to the
faithful; for there they dwelt not as one people, but as members torn asunder.
This is the dispersion intended by the words of the Prophet. He also adds, that
dwell </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
forest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For they had no secure
habitation except in their own country; for they lived there under the
protection of God; and all other countries, as I have already said, were to them
like the desert.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the midst of
Carmel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caph,</i> is to be understood here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As in the midst of Carmel, they
shall be fed in Bashan and Gilead, as in ancient
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, though they are now thy solitary sheep, yet thou wilt gather them again that
they may feed as on Carmel, (which we know was very fruitful,) and then, <i>as
in Bashan and Gilead.</i> We know that there are in those places the richest
pastures. Since then the Prophet compares the faithful to sheep, he mentions
Bashan, he mentions Carmel and Gilead; as though he said, &#8220;Restore, O
Lord, thy people, that they may dwell in the heritage once granted them by
thee.&#8221; Why he says that they were solitary, I have already explained; and
there is a similar passage in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19a217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:17; though there is there a different word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[r[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oror</i>; but the meaning is the same. The faithful are there said to be
solitary, because they were not collected into one body; for this was the true
happiness of the people, &#8212; that they worshipped God together, that they
were under one head, and also that they had one altar as a sacred bond to
cherish unity of faith. When therefore the faithful were scattered here and
there they were justly said to be solitary, wherever they were.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to ancient
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here he places before God the
favors which he formerly showed to his people, and prays that he would, like
himself, go on to the end, that is that he would continue to the end his favors
to his chosen people. And it availed not a little to confirm their faith, when
the faithful called to mind how liberally had God dealt from the beginning with
the posterity of Abraham: they were thus made to feel assured, that God would be
no less kind to his elect, though there might be, so to speak, a sad separation:
for when God had banished the Jews into exile, it was a kind of divorce, as
though they were given to utter destruction. Yet now when they recollect that
they had descended from the holy fathers, and that a Redeemer had been promised
them, they justly entertain a hope of favor in future from the past benefits of
God, because he had formerly kindly treated his people.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since we have
so provoked thy displeasure by our sins, that a dreadful waste and solitude

so remarkably exhibited towards thy ancient people, may shine upon us, so that
thy Church may be raised up in which true religion may flourish, and thy name be
glorified: and may we daily solicit thee in our prayers and never doubt, but
that under the government of thy Christ, thou canst again gather together the
whole world, though it be miserably dispersed, so that we may persevere in this
warfare to the end, until we shall at length know that we have not in vain hoped
in thee, and that our prayers have not been in vain, when Christ shall exercise
the power given to him for our salvation and for that of the whole world.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here introduces God as the speaker; and
he so speaks as to give an answer to his prayer. God then promises that he will
be wonderful in his works, and give such evidences of his power, as he exhibited
when he brought up his people from the land of Egypt. We now see that there is
more force in this passage, than if the Prophet had at first said, that God
would become the deliverer of his people: for he interposed entreaty and prayer
and God now shows that he will be merciful to his people; and at the same time
the faithful are reminded, that they must be instant in prayer, if they desire
to be preserved by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now God says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will show wonderful
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as when the people formerly came
out of Egypt. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> That
redemption, we know, was a perpetual monument of God&#8217;s power in the
preservation of his Church; so that whenever he designs to give some hope of
deliverances he reminds the faithful of those miracles that they may feel
assured that there will be no obstacles to prevent them from continuing in a
state of safety, provided God will be pleased to help them, for his power is not
diminished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this deserves to be noticed; for though we all
allow the omnipotence of God, yet when we struggle with trials, we tremble, as
though all the avenues to our preservation had been closed up against God. As
soon then as any impediment is thrown in our way, we think that there is no
hope. Whence is this? It is because we make no account of God&#8217;s power,
which yet we confess to be greater than that of the whole
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why God now refers to the miracles
which he wrought at the coming forth of the people. They ought to have known,
that God ever continues like himself, and that his power remains as perfect as
it was formerly; and there is in him sufficient support to encourage the hope of
assistance. We now perceive the object of the Prophet. He indeed changes the
persons; for in the beginning he addresses the people, according to the days of
thy going forth, and then he adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynara</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aranu</i>, &#8216;I will make him to see;&#8217; but this change does not
obscure the meaning, for God only means, that his power was sufficiently known
formerly to his people, and that there was a memorable proof of it in their
redemption, so that the people could not have doubted respecting their safety,
without being ungrateful to God, and without burying in oblivion that so
memorable a benefit, which God once conferred on their fathers. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the Prophet shows, that though the Church
should be assailed on every side and surrounded by innumerable enemies, no doubt
ought yet to be entertained respecting the promised aid of God; for it is in his
power to make all nations ashamed, that is, to cast down all the pride of the
world, so as to make the unbelieving to acknowledge at length that they were
elated by an empty confidence. Hence he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nations shall see;</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">as though he said, &#8220;I know what makes you
anxious, for many enemies are intent on your ruin; and when any help appears,
they are immediately prepared fiercely to resist; but their attempts and efforts
will not prevent God from delivering you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see and be ashamed of all their
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff139</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
these words the Prophet means, that however strongly armed the unbelieving may
think themselves to be to destroy the Church, and that how many obstacles soever
they may have in their power to restrain the power of God in its behalf, yet the
whole will be in vain, for God will, in fact, prove that the strength of men is
mere nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall lay their hand on
their mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they shall not
dare to boast hereafter, as they have hitherto done; for this phrase in Hebrew
means to be silent. Since then the enemies of the Church made great boastings
and exulted with open mouth, as though the people of God were destroyed, the
Prophet says, that when God would appear as the Redeemer of his people, they
should become, as it were, mute. He subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their ears shall become
deaf</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff140</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, they shall stand astounded; nay, they shall hardly dare to open their ears,
lest the rumor, brought to them, should occasion to them new trembling. Proud
men, we know, when matters succeed according to their wishes, not only boast of
their good fortune with open mouths, but also greedily catch at all rumors; for
as they think they are all so many messages of victories, &#8212; &#8220;What is
from this place? or what is from that place?&#8221; They even expect that the
whole world will come under their power. The Prophet, on the other hand, says,
&#8220;They shall lay the hand on the mouth, and their ears shall become deaf;
that is they shall tremblingly shun all rumors, for they shall continually dread
new calamities, when they shall see that the God of Israel, against who they
have hitherto fought, is armed with so much power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some apply this to the preaching of the Gospel; which
I readily allow, provided the deliverance be made always to begin with the
ancient people: for if any one would have this to be understood exclusively of
Christ, such a strained and remote exposition would not be suitable. But if any
one will consider the favor of God, as continued from the return of the people
to the restoration effected by Christ, he will rightly comprehend the real
design of the Prophet. Really fulfilled, then, is what the Prophet says here,
when God spreads the doctrine of his Gospel through the whole world: for those
who before boasted of their own inventions, begin then to close their mouth,
that, being thus silent, they may become his disciples; and they also close
their ears, for now they give not up themselves, as before, to foolish and
puerile fables, but consecrate their whole hearing to the only true God, that
they may attend only to his truth, and no more vacillate between contrary
opinions. All this, I allow, is fulfilled under the preaching of the Gospel; but
the Prophet, no doubt, connected together the whole time, from the return of the
people from the Babylonian exile, to the manifestation of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall lick the dust as a
serpent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He intimates, that however the
enemies of the Church may have proudly exalted themselves before, they shall
then be cast down, and lie, as it were, on the ground; for to lick the dust is
nothing else but to lie prostrate on the earth. They shall then be low and
creeping like serpents; and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall move themselves as
worms and reptiles of the ground</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zgr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>regez,</i> as it has been stated elsewhere, means to raise an uproar, to
tumultuate, and it means also to move one&#8217;s self; and this latter meaning
is the most suitable here, namely, that they shall go forth or move themselves
from their enclosures; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rgs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sager,</i> signifies to close up: and by enclosures he means hiding-places,
though in the song of David, in Psalm 18:, the word is applied to citadels and
other fortified places, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Men,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;trembled from their fortresses;&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">though they occupied well-fortified citadels, they
yet were afraid, because the very fame of David had broken down their boldness.
But as the Prophet speaks here of worms, I prefer this rendering, &#8212;
&#8216;from their lurkingplaces;&#8217; as though he said, &#8220;Though they
have hitherto thought themselves safe in their enclosures, they shall yet move
and flee away like worms and reptiles; for when the ground is dug, the worms
immediately leap out, for they think that they are going to be taken; so also,
when any one moves the ground, the reptiles come forth, and tremblingly run away
in all directions.&#8221; And the Prophet says that, in like manner, the enemies
of the Church, when the Lord shall arise for its help, shall be smitten with so
much fear, that they shall in every direction run away. And this comparison
ought to be carefully noticed, that is, when the Prophet compares powerful
nations well exercised in wars, who before were audaciously raging, and were
swollen with great pride &#8212; when he compares them to worms and reptiles of
the ground, and also to serpents: he did this to show, that there will be
nothing to hinder God from laying prostrate every exalted thing in the world, as
soon as it shall please him to aid his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence the Prophet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of Jehovah our God
they shall treed, and they shall fear because of
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet shows, that the
faithful ought not to distrust on account of their own weakness, but, on the
contrary, to remember the infinite power of God. It is indeed right that the
children of God should begin with diffidence, &#8212; sensible that they are
nothing, and that all their strength is nothing; but they ought not to stop at
their own weakness, but, on the contrary, to rise up to the contemplation of
God&#8217;s power, that they may not doubt but that, when his power shall
appear, their enemies shall be soon scattered. This is the reason why the
Prophet here mentions the name of God, and then turns to address God himself.
<i>Tremble </i>then<i> shall they at Jehovah our God, </i>that is, on account of
Jehovah our God; and then <i>Fear shall they because of thee.</i>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here exclaims that God ought to be
glorified especially for this &#8212; that he is merciful to his people. When he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is God as thou
art</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> he does not mean that there are
other gods; for this, strictly speaking, is an improper comparison. But he shows
that the true and only God may be distinguished from all idols by this
circumstance &#8212; that he graciously forgives the sins of his people and
bears with their infirmities. It is indeed certain, that all nations entertained
the opinion, that their gods were ready to pardon; hence their sacrifices and
hence also their various kinds of expiations. Nor has there been any nation so
barbarous as not to own themselves guilty in some measure before God; hence all
the Gentiles were wont to apply to the mercy of their gods; while yet they had
no firm conviction: for though they laid hold on this first principle, &#8212;
that the gods would be propitious to sinners, if they humbly sought pardon; yet
they prayed, we know, with no sure confidence, for they had no certain promise.
We hence see that what the Prophet means is this, &#8212; that the God of Israel
could be proved to be the true God from this circumstance &#8212; that having
once received into favor the children of Abraham, he continued to show the same
favor, and kept his covenant inviolably, though their sins had been a thousand
times a hindrance in the way. That God then in his goodness surmounted all the
wickedness of the people, and stood firm in his covenant, which had been so
often violated by vices of the people &#8212; this fact may be brought as an
evidence, that he is the true God: for what can be found of this kind among
idols? Let us suppose that there is in them something divine, that they were
gods, and endued with some power; yet with regard to the gods of the Gentiles,
it could not be known that any one of them was propitious to his own people.
Since then this can apply only to the God of Israel, it follows that in this
instance his divinity shines conspicuously, and that his sovereignty is hence
sufficiently proved. We also learn, that all the gods of heathens are vain; yea,
that in the religion of heathens there is nothing but delusions: for no nation
can with confidence flee to its god to obtain pardon, when it has sinned. This
is the sum of the whole. I shall now come to the words of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is a God like thee, taking away
iniquity, and passing by wickedness?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these
two forms of expression, he sets forth the singular favor of God in freely
reconciling himself to sinners. To take away sins is to blot them out; though
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nusha,</i>often means to raise on high; yet it means also to take, or, to
take away. To pass by wickedness, is to connive at it, as though he said,
&#8220;God overlooks the wickedness of his people, as if it escaped his
view:&#8221; for when God requires an account of our life, our sins immediately
appear, and appear before his eyes; but when God does not call our sins before
his judgment, but overlooks them, he is then said to pass by
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage teaches us, as I have already reminded
you, that the glory of God principally shines in this, &#8212; that he is
reconcilable, and that he forgives our sins. God indeed manifests his glory both
by his power and his wisdom, and by all the judgments which he daily executes;
his glory, at the same time, shines forth chiefly in this, &#8212; that he is
propitious to sinners, and suffers himself to be pacified; yea, that he not only
allows miserable sinners to be reconciled to him, but that he also of his own
will invites and anticipates them. Hence then it is evident, that he is the true
God. That religion then may have firm roots in our hearts, this must be the
first thing in our faith, &#8212; that God will ever be reconciled to us; for
except we be fully persuaded as to his mercy, no true religion will ever
flourish in us, whatever pretensions we may make; for what is said in Psalm 130
is ever true, &#8216;With thee is propitiation, that thou mayest be
feared.&#8217; Hence the fear of God, and the true worship of him, depend on a
perception of his goodness and favor; for we cannot from the heart worship God,
and there will be, as I have already said, no genuine religion in us, except
this persuasion be really and deeply seated in our hearts, &#8212; that he is
ever ready to forgive, whenever we flee to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence also appears what sort of religion is that
of the Papacy: for under the Papacy, being perplexed and doubtful, they ever
hesitate, and never dare to believe that God will be propitious to them. Though
they have some ideas, I know not what, of his grace; yet it is a vain
presumption and rashness, as they think, when any one is fully persuaded of
God&#8217;s mercy. They therefore keep consciences in suspense; nay, they leave
them doubtful and trembling, when there is no certainty respecting God&#8217;s
favor. It hence follows, that their whole worship is fictitious; in a word, the
whole of religion is entirely subverted, when a firm and unhesitating
confidence, as to his goodness, is taken away, yea, that confidence by which men
are enabled to come to him without doubting, and to receive, whenever they sin
and confess their guilt and transgressions, the mercy that is offered to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this confidence is not what rises spontaneously
in us; nay, even when we entertain a notion that God is merciful, it is only a
mere delusion: for we cannot be fully convinced respecting God&#8217;s favor,
except he anticipates us by his word, and testifies that he will be propitious
to us whenever we flee to him. Hence I said at the beginning, that the Prophet
here exhibits the difference between the God of Israel and all the idols of the
Gentiles, and that is, because he had promised to be propitious to his people.
It was not in vain that sacrifices were offered by the chosen people, for there
was a promise added, which could not disappoint them: but the Gentiles ever
remained doubtful with regard to their sacrifices; though they performed all
their expiations, there was yet no certainty; but the case was different with
the chosen people. What then the Prophet says here respecting the remission of
sins, depends on the testimony which God himself has given.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now notice the clause which immediately
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as to the remnant of his
heritage</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here again he drives away the
hypocrites from their vain confidence: for he says that God will be merciful
only to a remnant of his people; and, at the same time, he takes away an
offense, which might have grievously disquieted the weak, on seeing the wrath of
God raging among the whole people, &#8212; that God would spare neither the
common nor the chief men. When therefore the fire of God&#8217;s vengeance
flamed terribly, above and below, this objection might have greatly disturbed
weak minds, &#8212; &#8220;How is this? God does indeed declare that he is
propitious to sinners, and yet his severity prevails among us. &#8212; How can
this be?&#8221; The Prophet meets this objection and says, God is propitious to
the remnant of his heritage; which means, that though God would execute terrible
vengeance on the greater part, there would yet ever remain some seed, on whom
his mercy would shine; and he calls them the remnant of his heritage, because
there was no reason, as it was stated yesterday, why God forgave the few, except
that he had chosen the posterity of Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will not retain his wrath
perpetually</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this second consolation he
wished to relieve the faithful: for though God chastises them for a time, he yet
forgets not his mercy. We may say, that the Prophet mentions here two
exceptions. He had spoken of God&#8217;s mercy; but as this mercy is not
indiscriminate or common to all, he restricts what he teaches to the remnant.
Now follows another exception, &#8212; that how much soever apparently the wrath
of God would rage against his elect people themselves, there would yet be some
moderation, so that they would remain safe, and that their calamities would not
be to them fatal. Hence he says, God retains not wrath; for though, for a
moment, he may be angry with his people, he will yet soon, as it were, repent,
and show himself gracious to them, and testify that he is already reconciled to
them; &#8212; not that God changes, but that the faithful are made for a short
time to feel his wrath; afterwards a taste of his mercy exhilarates them, and
thus they feel in their souls that God has in a manner changed. For when dread
possesses their minds, they imagine God to be terrible, but when they embrace
the promises of his grace, they call on him, and begin to entertain hope of
pardon; then God appears to them kind, gentle, and reconcilable; yea, and
altogether ready to show mercy. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God retains not his
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows the cause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for he loveth
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the Prophet more clearly
shows, that the remission of sins is gratuitous, and that it has no foundation
but in the nature of God himself. There is then no reason, since Scripture
declares God to be reconcilable, why any one should seek the cause in himself,
or even the means by which God reconciles himself to us: for He himself is the
cause. As God then by nature loves mercy, hence it is, that he is so ready to
forgive sinners. Whosoever then imagines that God is to be propitiated by
expiations or any satisfactions, subverts the doctrine of the Prophet; and it is
the same thing as to build without a foundation: for the only prop or support
that can raise us up to God, when we desire to be reconciled to him, is this,
&#8212; that he loves mercy. And this is the reason why God so much commends his
mercy, why he says that he is merciful to thousand generations, slow to wrath,
and ready to pardon. For though the unbelieving harden themselves against God,
yet when they feel his wrath, there is nothing so difficult for them as to
believe that God can be pacified. Hence this reason, which is not in vain added
by the Prophet, ought to be especially noticed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see to whom God is merciful. For as Satan
could not have obliterated from the hearts of men a conviction of God&#8217;s
mercy, he has yet confined mercy to the unbelieving, as though God should
forgive sinners only once, when they are admitted into the Church. Thus the
Pelagians formerly thought, that God grants reconciliation to none but to
aliens; for whosoever has been once received into the Church cannot, as they
imagined, stand otherwise before God than by being perfect. And this figment led
Novatus and his disciples to create disturbances in the Church. And there are at
this day not only deluded men, but devils, who, by the same figment, or rather
delirious notions, fascinate themselves and others, and hold, that the highest
perfection ought to exist in the faithful; and they also slander our doctrine,
as though we were still continuing in the Alphabet or in the first rudiments,
because we daily preach free remission of sins. But the Prophet declares
expressly that God not only forgives the unbelieving when they sin, but also his
heritage and his elect. Let us then know, that as long as we are in the world,
pardon is prepared for us, as we could not otherwise but fall every moment from
the hope of salvation, were not this remedy provided for us: for those men must
be more than mad who arrogate to themselves perfection, or who think that they
have arrived at that high degree of attainment, that they can satisfy God by
their works. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now prescribes to the faithful a form of
glorying, that they may boldly declare that God will be pacified towards them.
Since then God loves mercy, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
will return, he will have mercy on us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
The context here ought to be observed by us; for it would avail us but little to
understand, I know not what, concerning God&#8217;s mercy, and to preach in
general the free remission of sins, except we come to the application, that is,
except each of the faithful believed that God, for his own sake, is merciful, as
soon as he is called upon. This conclusion, then, is to be borne in mind,
&#8212; &#8220;God forgives the remnant of his heritage, because he is by nature
inclined to show mercy: he will<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino">
be merciful to us, for we are of the number of his people.&#8221; Except we lay
hold on this conclusion, &#8220;He will therefore show mercy to us,&#8221;
whatever we have heard or said respecting God&#8217;s goodness will vanish
away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the true logic of religion, that is,
when we are persuaded that God is reconcilable and easily pacified, because he
is by nature inclined to mercy, and also, when we thus apply this doctrine to
ourselves, or to our own peculiar benefit, &#8212; As God is by nature merciful,
I shall therefore know and find him to be so. Until then we be thus persuaded,
let us know that we have made but little progress in the school of God. And
hence it appears very clear from this passage, that the Papacy is a horrible
abyss; for no one under that system can have a firm footing, so as to be fully
persuaded that God will be merciful to him; for all that they have are mere
conjectures. But we see that the Prophet reasons very differently, God loves
mercy; he will therefore have mercy on us: and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
return;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
this is said lest the temporary wrath or severity of God should disquiet us.
Though God then may not immediately shine on us with his favor, but, on the
contrary, treat us sharply and roughly, yet the Prophet teaches us that we are
to entertain good hope. &#8212; How so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will return,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">or, as he said shortly before, He will not retain
perpetually his wrath: for it is for a moment that he is angry with his Church;
and he soon remembers mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now specifies what sort of mercy God
shows to the faithful, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he
will tread down our iniquities;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he had said
before that he passes by the wickedness of his elect people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will then tread down our
iniquities; and he will cast</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Ff144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the depth of the sea all
their sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is our sins shall not
come in remembrance before him. We hence learn what I have said before &#8212;
that God cannot be worshipped sincerely and from the heart until this conviction
be fixed and deeply rooted in our hearts, that God is merciful, not in general,
but toward us, because we have been once adopted by him and are his heritage.
And then were the greater part to fall away, we should not fail in our faith;
for God preserves the remnant in a wonderful manner. And lastly, let us know,
that whenever we flee to God for mercy, pardon is ever ready for us, not that we
may indulge in sin, or take liberty to commit it, but that we may confess our
faults and that our guilt may appear before our eyes: let us know, that the door
is open to us; for God of his own good will presents himself to us as one ready
to be reconciled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is also said,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will cast our sins into
the depth of the sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We hence learn that there
is a full remission of sins, not half as the Papists imagine, for God, they say,
remits the sin, but retains the punishment. How frivolous this is, the thing
itself clearly proves. The language of the Prophet does however import this,
that our sins are then remitted when the records of them are blotted out before
God. It follows &#8212; for I will run over this verse, that I may today finish
this Prophet &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The faithful confirm here the former truth, that God
had deposited his covenant with them, which could not be made void: and hence
also shines forth more clearly what I have said before, that the faithful do not
learn by their own understanding what sort of Being God is, but embrace the
mercy which he offers in his own word. Except God then speaks, we cannot form in
our own minds any idea of his grace but what is uncertain and vanishing; but
when he declares that he will be merciful to us, then every doubt is removed.
This is now the course which the Prophet pursues.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt give truth to Jacob,
mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn to our
fathers;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though he said, &#8220;We do not
presumptuously invent any thing out of our own minds, but receive what thou hast
once testified to us; for thy will has been made known to us in thy word:
relying then on thy favor, we are persuaded as to thy gratuitous pardon, though
we are in many respects guilty before thee.&#8221; We now then understand the
design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words, it is not necessary to dwell on
them, for we have elsewhere explained this form of speaking. There are here two
expressions by which the Prophet characterizes the covenant of God. Truth is
mentioned, and mercy is mentioned. With respect to order, the mercy of God
precedes; for he is not induced otherwise to adopt us than through his goodness
alone: but as God of his own will has with so great kindness received us, so he
is true and faithful in his covenant. If then we desire to know the character of
God&#8217;s covenant, by which he formerly chose the Jews, and at this day
adopts us as his people, these two things must be understood, that God freely
offers himself to us, and that he is constant and true, he repents not, as Paul
says, as to his covenant: The gifts and calling of God, he says, are without
repentance,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29;) and he refers to the covenant, by which God adopted the children of
Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt
give</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, show in reality; for
this, to give, is, as it were, to exhibit in effect or really.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then <i>give,</i> that is, openly show,
that thou hast not been in vain so kind to us and ours, in receiving them into
favor. How so? Because the effect of thy goodness and truth appears to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
hast</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sworn to our fathers from the
days of old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The faithful take for granted that
God had promised to the fathers that his covenant would be perpetual; for he did
not only say to Abraham, I will be thy God, but he also added, and of thy seed
for ever. Since, then, the faithful knew that the covenant of God was to be
perpetual and inviolable, and also knew that it was to be continued from the
fathers to their children, and that it was once promulgated for this end, that
the fathers might deliver it as by the hand to their children; they therefore
doubted not but that it would be perpetual. How so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for thou hast sworn to our
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, they knew that God not
only promised, but that having interposed an oath, by which God designed to
confirm that covenant, he greatly honored it, that it might be unhesitatingly
received by the chosen people. As then the faithful knew that God in a manner
bound himself to them, they confidently solicited him, really to show himself to
be such as he had declared he would be to his own elect.</font><br></div>

COMMENTARIES ON MICAH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">CALVIN&#8217;S PREFACE TO
NAHUM</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The time in which Nahum prophesied cannot with
certainty be known. The Hebrews, ever bold in conjectures, say that he
discharged his office of teaching under Manasseh, and that the name of that king
was suppressed, because he was unworthy of such an honor, or, because his reign
was unfortunate, as he had been led into captivity. When any one asks the Jews a
reason, they only say, that it appears so to them. As then there is no reason
for this conjecture, we must come to what seems probable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who think that he prophesied under Jotham are no
doubt mistaken, and can easily be disproved; for he here threatens ruin to the
city Nineveh because the Assyrians had cruelly laid waste the kingdom of Israel;
and it is for these wrongs that he denounces vengeance: but under Jotham the
kingdom of Israel had not been laid waste. We indeed know that the Assyrians
were suborned by Ahab, when he found himself unequal to resist the attacks of
two neighboring kings, the king of Syria, and the king of Israel. It was then
that the Assyrians penetrated into the land of Israel, and in course of time,
they desolated the whole kingdom. At this period it was that Nahum prophesied;
for it was his object to show, that God had a care for that kingdom, on account
of his adoption or covenant; though the Israelites had perfidiously separated
themselves from the people of God, yet God&#8217;s covenant remained in force.
His design then was to show, that God was the father and protector of that
kingdom. As this was the Prophet&#8217;s object, it is certain that he taught
either after the death of Ahab under Hezekiah, or about that time. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He followed Jonah at some distance, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as we
may easily learn. Jonah, as we have already seen, pronounced a threatening on
the city Nineveh; but the punishment was remitted, because the Ninevites humbled
themselves, and suppliantly deprecated the punishment which had been announced.
They afterwards returned to their old ways, as it is usually the case. Hence it
was, that God became less disposed to spare them. Though indeed they were
aliens, yet God was pleased to show them favor by teaching them through the
ministry and labors of Jonah: and their repentance was not altogether feigned.
Since then they were already endued with some knowledge of the true God, the
less excusable was their cruelty, when they sought to oppress the kingdom of
Israel. They indeed knew, that that nation was sacred to God: what they did then
was in a manner an outrage against God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand at what time it is probable that
Nahum performed his office as a teacher; though nothing certain, as I have said
at the beginning, can be known: hence it was, that I condemned the Rabbis for
rashness on the subject; for they are bold enough to bring any thing forward as
a truth, respecting which there is no certainty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have already in part stated the design of the
Prophet. The sum of the whole is this: When the Assyrians had for some time
disturbed the kingdom of Israel, the Prophet arose and exhorted the Israelites
to patience, that is, those who continued to be the servants of God; because God
had not wholly forsaken them, but would undertake their cause, for they were
under his protection. This is the substance of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to Nineveh, we have already stated that
it was the capital of the empire, as long as the Assyrians did bear rule: for
Babylon was a province; that is, Chaldea, whose metropolis was Babylon, was one
of the provinces of the empire. The kingdom was afterwards taken away from
Meroc-baladan. Some think that Nabuchodonosor was the first monarch of Chaldea.
But I bestow no great pains on this subject. It may be, that Meroc-baladan had
two names, and this was very common; as we know that the kings of Egypt were
called Pharaohs; so the Assyrians and Chaldeans, though otherwise called at
first, might have taken a common royal name. Now Nineveh was so celebrated, that
another kingdom could not have been established by the Babylonians without
demolishing that city. We indeed know that it was very large, as we have stated
in explaining Jonah. It was, as profane writers have recorded, nearly three
days&#8217; journey in circumference. Then its walls were one hundred feet high,
and so wide, that chariots could pass one another without coming in contact:
there were one thousand and five hundred towers. We hence see that it was not
without reason that this city was formerly so celebrated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They say that Ninus was its founder, but this is
proved to be a mistake by the testimony of Moses in Genesis 10. They also
imagine that emiramis was the first queen of Babylon, and that the city was
built by her: but this is a fable. It may have been that she enlarged the city;
but it was Babylon many ages before she was born. So also Ninus may have
increased and adorned Nineveh; but the city was founded before his birth.
Profane authors call it Ninus, not Nineveh; probably the Hebrew name was
corrupted by them, as it is often the case. However this may be, it is evident,
that when Meroc-baladan, or his son, who succeeded him, wished to fix the seat
of the empire at Babylon, he was under the necessity of destroying Nineveh to
prevent rivalry. It thus happened, that the city was entirely demolished. Of
this destruction, as we shall see, Nahum prophesied.</font><br></div>

did not in vain denounce destruction on the Ninevites, because he faithfully
delivered what he had received from God. For if he had simply prefaced, that he
threatened ruin to the Assyrian,, some doubt might have been entertained as to
the event. But here he seeks to gain to himself authority by referring to
God&#8217;s name; for he openly affirms that he brought nothing of his own, but
that this burden had been made known to him by a celestial oracle: for

fantasy or imagination, but that kind of revelation which is mentioned in
Numbers 14, where God says, that he speaks to his Prophets either by vision or
by dream. We hence see why this was added &#8212; that the burden of Nineveh was
a vision; it was, that the Israelites might know that this testimony respecting
God&#8217;s vengeance on their enemies was not brought by a mortal man, and that
there might be no doubt but that God was the author of this
prophecy.</font><br></div>

himself was a Prophet: for when the name of a Prophet&#8217;s father is
mentioned, they hold that he whose name is given was also a Prophet. But these
are mere trifles: and we have often seen how great is their readiness to invent
fables. Then the termination of the word leads us to think that it was, on the
contrary, the proper name of a place; and Jerome tells us that there was in his
time a small village of this name in the tribe of Simon. We must therefore
understand, that Nahum arose from that town, and was therefore called &#8220;the
Elkoshite.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Nahum begins with the nature of God, that what he
afterwards subjoins respecting the destruction of Nineveh might be more weighty,
and produce a greater impression on the hearers. The preface is general, but the
Prophet afterwards applies it to a special purpose. If he had only spoken of
what God is, it would have been frigid at least it would have been less
efficacious; but when he connects both together, then his doctrine carries its
own force and power. We now apprehend the design of the Prophet. He might indeed
have spoken of the fall of the city Nineveh: but if he had referred to this
abruptly, profane men might have regarded him with disdain; and even the
Israelites would have been perhaps less affected. This is the reason why he
shows, in a general way, what sort of Being God is. And he takes his words from
Moses; and the Prophets are wont to borrow from him their
doctrine:</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and it is from that most memorable vision, when God appeared to Moses after the
breaking of the tables. I have therefore no doubt but that Nahum had taken from
Exodus 34 what we read here: he does not, indeed, give literally what is found
there; but it is sufficiently evident that he paints, as it were, to the life,
the image of God, by which his nature may be seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is
jealous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> (<i>amulus &#8212;
</i>emulous); for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">anq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kona, </i>means to irritate, and also to emulate, and to envy. When God is
said to be
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awnq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>konua,</i> the Greeks render it jealous,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zhlwthn</font><font face="Palatino">,
and the Latins, emulous, (<i>amulatorem</i>) But it properly signifies, that God
cannot bear injuries or wrongs. Though God then for a time connives at the
wickedness of men? he will yet be the defender of his own glory. He calls him
afterwards the avenger, and he repeats this three times,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah avengeth, Jehovah
avengeth and possesseth wrath, he will avenge.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
When he says that God <i>keeps
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for his
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he means that vengeance is
reserved for the unbelieving and the despisers of God. There is the same mode of
speaking in use among us, <i>Je lui garde, et il la garde a ses ennemis.</i>
This phrase, in our language, shows what the Prophet means here by saying, that
God keeps for his enemies. And this awful description of God is to be applied to
the present case, for he says that he proclaims war against the Ninevites,
because they had unjustly distressed the Church of God: it is for this reason
that he says, that God is jealous, that God is an avenger; and he confirms this
three times, that the Israelites might feel assured that this calamity was
seriously announced; for had not this representation been set before them, they
might have thus reasoned with themselves, &#8212; &#8220;We are indeed cruelly
harassed by our enemies; but who can think that God cares any thing for our
miseries, since he allows them so long to be unavenged?&#8221; It was therefore
necessary that the Prophet should obviate such thoughts, as he does here. We now
more fully understand why he begins in a language so vehement, and calls God a
jealous God, and an avenger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God possesses
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I do not take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheme,</i> simply for wrath, but the passion or he it of wrath. We ought not
indeed to suppose, as it has been often observed, that our passions belong to
God; for he remains ever like himself. But yet God is said to be for a time
angry, and for ever towards the reprobate, for he is our and their Judge. Here,
then, when the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is the Lord of
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or that he possesses wrath, he
means that he is armed with vengeance and that, though he connives at the sins
of men, he is not yet indifferent, nor even delays because he is without power,
or because he is idle and careless, but that he retains wraths as he afterwards
repeats the same thing, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He keeps
for his enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
short, by these forms of speaking the Prophet intimates that God is not to be
rashly judged of on account of his delay, when he does not immediately execute
His judgments; for he waits for the seasonable opportunity. But, in the meantime
there is no reason for us to think that he forgets his office when he suspends
punishment, or for a season spares the ungodly. When, therefore, God does not
hasten so very quickly, there is no ground for us to think that he is
indifferent, because he delays his wrath, or retains it, as we have already
said; for it is the same thing to retain wrath, as to be the Lord of wrath, and
to possess it. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on with the same subject; and still
longer is the preface respecting the nature of God, which however is to be
applied, as I have said, to the special objects which hereafter he will state.
He says here that God is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>slow to
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Though this saying is taken also
from Moses yet the Prophet speaks here for the purpose of anticipating an
objection; for he obviates the audacity of the ungodly who daringly derided God,
when any evil was denounced on them, &#8212; Where is the mercy of God? Can God
divest himself of his kindness? He cannot deny himself. Thus profane men, under
the pretense of honoring God, cast on him the most atrocious slander, for they
deprive him of his own power and office: and there is no doubt but that this was
commonly done by many of the ungodly in the age of our Prophet. Hence he
anticipates this objection, and concedes that God is slow to wrath. There is
then a concession here; but at the same time he says that God is great in
strength, and this he says, that the ungodly may not flatter and deceive
themselves, when they hear these high attributes given to God, that he is
patient, slow to wrath, merciful, full of kindness. &#8220;Let them,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;at the same time remember the greatness of God&#8217;s power, that
they may not think that they have to do with a child.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the design of the Prophet: for this
declaration &#8212; that God hastens not suddenly to wrath, but patiently defers
and suspends the punishment which the ungodly deserve. This declaration would
not have harmonized with the present argument, had not the Prophet introduced it
by way of concession; as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;I see that the world
everywhere trifle with God, and that the ungodly delude themselves with such
Sophistries, that they reject all threatening. I indeed allow that God is ready
to pardon, and that he descends not to wrath, except when he is constrained by
extreme necessity: all this is indeed true; but yet know, that God is armed with
his own power: escape then shall none of those who allow themselves the liberty
of abusing his patience, notwithstanding the insolence they manifest towards
him.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By clearing he will not
clear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some translate, &#8220;The innocent, he
will not render innocent.&#8221; But the real meaning of this sentence is the
same with that in Exodus 34; and what Moses meant was, that God is
irreconcilable to the impenitent. It has another meaning at the end of Joel 3,
where it is said, &#8216;I will cleanse the blood which I have not
cleansed.&#8217; On that text interpreters differ; because they regard not the
change in the tense of the verb; for God means, that he would cleanse the filth
and defilements of his Church, which he had not previously cleansed. But Moses
means, that God deals strictly with sinners, so as to remit no punishment. By
clearing then I will not clear; that is, God will rigidly demand an account of
all the actions of men; and as there is nothing hid from him, so everything done
wickedly by men must come forth, when God ascends his tribunal; he will not
clear by clearing, but will rigidly execute his judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There seems to be some inconsistency in saying,
&#8212; that God is reconcilable and ready to pardon, &#8212; and yet that by
clearing he will not clear. But the aspect of things is different. We have
already stated what the Prophet had in view: for inasmuch as the ungodly ever
promise impunity to themselves, and in this confidence petulantly deride God
himself, the Prophet answers them, and declares, that there was no reason why
they thus abused God&#8217;s forbearance, for he says, By clearing he will not
clear, that is, the reprobate: for our salvation consists in a free remission of
sins; and whence comes our righteousness, but from the imputation of God, and
from this &#8212; that our sins are buried in oblivion? yea, our whole clearing
depends on the mercy of God. But God then exercises also his judgment, and by
clearing he clears, when he remits to the faithful their sins; for the faithful
by repentance anticipate his judgment; and he searches their hearts, that he may
clear them. For what is repentance but condemnation, which yet turns out to be
the means of salvation? As then God absolves none except the condemned, our
Prophet here rightly declares,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that by clearing he will not
clears </i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, he will not remit their sins,
except he tries them and discharges the office of a judge; in short, that no sin
is remitted by God which he does not first condemn. But with regard to the
reprobate, who are wholly obstinate in their wickedness, the Prophet justly
declares this to them, &#8212; that they have no hope of pardon, as they
perversely adhere to their own devices, and think that they can escape the hand
of God: the Prophet tells them that they are deceived, for God passes by
nothing, and will not blot out one sin, until all be brought to
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the way of God is in the
whirlwind and the tempest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, that
God, as soon as he shows himself, disturbs the whole atmosphere, and excites
storms and tempests: and this must be applied to the subject in hand; for the
appearance of God is in other places described as lovely and gracious: nay, what
else but the sight of God exhilarated the faithful? As soon as God turns away
his face, they must necessarily be immersed in dreadful darkness, and be
surrounded with horrible terrors. Why then does the Prophet say here, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>way of God is in the whirlwind
and storms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> Even because his discourse
is addressed to the ungodly, or to the despisers of God himself, as in Psalm 18;
where we see him described as being very terrible, &#8212; that clouds and
darkness are around him, that he moves the whole earth, that he thunders on
every side, that he emits smoke frown his nostrils, and that he fills the whole
world with fire and burning. For what purpose was this done? Because
David&#8217;s object was to set forth the judgments of God, which he had
executed on the ungodly. So it is in this place; for Nahum speaks of the future
vengeance, which was then nigh the Assyrians; hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The way of God is in the
whirlwind and tempest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, when God
goes forth, whirlwinds and tempests are excited by his presence, and the whole
world is put in confusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the clouds are the dust of
his feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When any one with his feet
only moves the dust within a small space, some dread is produced: but God moves
the dust, not only in one place, &#8212; what then? he obscures, and thus covers
the whole heaven, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The clouds then
are the dust of his feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>

apprehend the whole meaning of the Prophet, and the purpose for which this
description is given. Of the same import is what follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Nahum continues his discourse, &#8212; that God, in
giving proof of his displeasure, would disturb the sea or make it dry. There may
be here an allusion to the history, described by Moses; for the Prophets, in
promising God&#8217;s assistance to his people, often remind them how God in a
miraculous manner brought up their fathers from Egypt. As then the passage
through the Red Sea was in high repute among the Jews, it may be that the
Prophet alluded to that event,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:22.) But another view seems to me more probable. We indeed know how impetuous
an element is that of the sea; and hence in Jeremiah 5, God, intending to set
forth his own power, says, that it is in his power to calm the raging of the
sea, than which nothing is more impetuous or more violent. In the same manner
also is the majesty of God described in Job 28. The meaning of this place, I
think, is the same, &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God by his chiding makes the sea
dry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
that he can </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dry up the
rivers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> That the prophet connects rivers
with the sea, confirms what I have just said, &#8212; that the passage through
the Red Sea is not here referred to; but that the object is to show in general
how great is God&#8217;s power in governing the whole world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bashan shall be weakened, and
Carmel, and the branch of Lebanon shall be
weakened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or destroyed. By these words
he intimates, that there is nothing so magnificent in the world, which God
changes not, when he gives proofs of his displeasure; as it is said in Psalm
104,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Send forth thy
Spirit, and they shall be renewed;&#8217;</font><br></div>

remove it, &#8216;and all things will return to the dust;&#8217; yea, into
nothing. So also Nahum says in this place, &#8220;As soon as God shows his
wrath, the rivers will dry up, the sea itself will become dry, and then the
flowers will fade and the grass will wither;&#8221; that is, though the earth be
wonderfully ornamented and replenished, yet all things will be reduced to
solitude and desolation whenever God is angry. And he afterwards adds

<div><font face="Palatino">Nahum continues still on the same subject, &#8212;
that when God ascended his tribunal and appeared as the Judge of the world, he
would not only shake all the elements, but would also constrain them to change
their nature. For what can be less consonant to nature than for mountains to
tremble, and for hills to be dissolved or to melt? This is more strange than
what we can comprehend. But the Prophet intimates that the mountains cannot
continue in their own strength, but as far as they are sustained by the favor of
God. As soon, then, as God is angry, the mountains melt like snow, and flow away
like water. And all these things are to be applied to this purpose, and are
designed for this end, &#8212; that the wicked might not daringly despise the
threatening of God, nor think that they could, through his forbearance, escape
the punishment which they deserved: for he will be their Judge, however he may
spare them; and though God is ready to pardon, whenever men hate themselves on
account of their sins, and seriously repent; he will be yet irreconcilable to
all the reprobate and the perverse.<i>

<div><font face="Palatino">This useful instruction may be gathered from these
words, that the world cannot for a moment stand, except as it is sustained by
the favor and goodness of God; for we see what would immediately be, as soon as
God manifests the signals of his judgment. Since the very solidity of mountains
would be as snow or wax, what would become of miserable men, who are like a
shadow or an apparition? They would then vanish away as soon as God manifested
his wrath against them, as it is so in Psalm 39, that men pass away like a
shadow. This comparison ought ever to be remembered by us whenever a
forgetfulness of God begins to creep over us, that we may not excite his wrath
by self-complacencies, than which there is nothing more pernicious.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here why he gave in the part
noticed in the last lecture, such an awful description of God; it was that men
might know, that when they shall come before his tribunal, no one will be able
to stand unless supported by his favor. Of the Prophet&#8217;s main object we
have sufficiently spoken, nor is it necessary to repeat here what has been
stated. It is enough to bear this in mind, &#8212; that as the enemies of the
Church relied on their power; and daringly and immoderately raged against it,
the judgment of God is here set before them, that they might understand that an
account was to be rendered to him whose presence they were not able to bear. But
the question has more force than if the Prophet had simply said, that the whole
world could not stand before God: for he assumes the character of one adjuring.
After having shown how terrible God is, he exclaims,

indignation? and who shall be able to bear his
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for his indignation, he says, is poured forth as fire. The Hebrew
interpreters have here toiled in vain: as the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;tn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nutae,</i> means to pour forth it seems to them an inconsistent expression,
that the wrath of God should be poured forth as fire; for this would be more
suitably said of some metal than of fire. But to be poured forth here is nothing
else than to be scattered far and wide.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Poured
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is thy wrath as
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, it advances every moment,
as when a fire seizes a whole forest; and when it grows strong, we know how
great is its violence, and how suddenly it spreads here and there. But if a
different meaning be preferred, I do not much object to it, &#8220;His wrath,
which is like fire, is poured out.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that the Prophet alludes to lightnings,
which, as it were, melt through the air, at least as they appear to us. But as
the meaning of the Prophet is sufficiently evident, there is no need of
anxiously inquiring how fire is poured out: for I have already mentioned, that
the Prophet means no other thing than the wrath of God spreads itself, so that
it immediately takes hold, not only of one city but also of the widest regions
and of the whole world, and is therefore like fire, for it passes through here
and there, and that suddenly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rocks

or dissolved </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We must be aware how great our
brittleness is. Since there is no hardness which melts not before God, how can
men, who flow away of themselves like water, be so daring as to set themselves
up against him? We hence see that the madness of men is here rebuked, who,
trusting in their own strength, dare to contend even with God, because they
forget their own frailty. This is the import of the whole. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet expresses more clearly here what we
referred to in our last lecture, &#8212; that God is hard and severe toward
refractory men, and that he is merciful and kind to the teachable and the
obedient, &#8212; not that God changes his nature, or that like Proteus he puts
on various forms; but because he treats men according to their disposition. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As then
the Prophet has hitherto taught us, that God&#8217;s wrath cannot be sustained
by mortals; so now, that no one might complain of extreme rigor, he, on the
other hand, shows that God favors what is right and just, that he is gentle and
mild to the meek, and therefore ready to bring help to the faithful, and that he
leaves none of those who trust in him destitute of his aid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, by saying that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he turns aside whatever might be
objected on the ground of extreme severity. There is indeed nothing more
peculiar to God than goodness. Now when he is so severe, that the very mention
of his name terrifies the whole world, he seems to be in a manner different from
himself. Hence the Prophet now shows that whatever he had hitherto said of the
dreadful judgment of God, is not inconsistent with his goodness. Though God then
is armed with vengeance against his enemies he yet ceases not to be like
himself, nor does he forget his goodness. But the Prophet does here also more
fully confirm the Israelites and the Jews in the belief, that God is not only
terrible to the ungodly, but that, as he has promised to be the guardian of his
Church, he would also succor the faithful, and in time alleviate their miseries.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Good</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then <i>is
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i>
and it is added </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
help</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The intention of the Prophet may
be hence more clearly understood, when he says that he is for strength in the
day of distress; as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;God is ever ready to bring
help to his people:&#8221;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And he
adds,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the day of
distress</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that the faithful may not
think that they are rejected, when God tries their patience by adversities. How
much soever then God may subject his people to the cross and to troubles, he
still succors them in their distress.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He lastly adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He knows them who hope in
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This to know, is no other thing than not
to neglect them. Hence God is said to know them who hope in him, because he
always watches over them, and takes care of their safety: in short, this
knowledge is nothing else but the care of God, or his providence in preserving
the faithful. The Prophet, at the same time, distinguishes the godly and sincere
worshipers of God from hypocrites: when God leaves many destitute who profess to
believe in him, he justly withholds from them his favor, for they do not from
the heart call on him or seek him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.
He shows, on the one hand, that God is armed with power to avenge his enemies;
And, on the other, he shows that God, as he has promised, is a faithful guardian
of his Church. How is this proved? He sets before us what God is, that he is
good; and then adds, that he is prepared to bring help. But he does not in vain
mention this particular, &#8212; that he takes care of the faithful, who truly,
and from the heart, hope in him; it is done, that they may understand that they
are not neglected by God, and also that hypocrites may know that they are not
assisted, because their profession is nothing else but dissimulation, for they
hope not sincerely in God, however they may falsely boast of his name. It now
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on with the same subject, &#8212;
that God can easily preserve his people, for he is armed with power sufficient
to overcome the whole world. But the Prophet now includes the two things which
have been mentioned: Having spoken in general of God&#8217;s wrath, and of his
goodness towards the faithful, he now applies his doctrine to the consolation of
his chosen people. It is then a special application of his doctrine, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By inundation, he, passing
through, will make a consummation in her
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is a twofold interpretation
of this verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some make this distinction, &#8212; that God, as it
were, in passing through, would consume the land of Israel and Judah, but that
perpetual darkness would rest on his enemies. Hence they think, that the
distress of the chosen people is distinguished from the overthrow of the kingdom
of Asshur, for God would only for a time punish his own people, while he would
give up profane and reprobate men to endless destruction. Then, by <i>passing
through, </i>must be understood, according to these interpreters, a temporary
distress or punishment; and by <i>darkness,</i> eternal ruin, or, so to speak,
irreparable calamities. But the Prophet, I doubt not, in one connected sentence,
denounces ultimate ruin on the Assyrians.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By inundation, then, he, in
passing, will make a consummation in her
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, God will suddenly
overwhelm the Assyrian, as though a deluge should rise to cover the whole earth.
He intimates, that God would not punish the Assyrians by degrees, as men
sometimes do, who proceed step by step to avenge themselves, but suddenly. God,
he says, will of a sudden thunder against the Assyrians, as when a deluge comes
over a land. Hence this passing of God is opposed to long or slow progress; as
though he said &#8212; &#8220;As soon as God&#8217;s wrath shall break forth or
come upon the Assyrians, it will be all over, for a consummation will
immediately follow: by inundation, he, passing through, will make a consummation
in her place.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
place he means the ground; as though he had said that God would not only destroy
the face of the land, but would also destroy the very grounds and utterly
demolish it. A feminine pronoun is here added, because he speaks of the kingdom
or nation, as it is usual in Hebrew. But it ought especially to be noticed that
the Prophet threatens the Assyrians, that God would entirely subvert them, that
he would not only demolish the surface, as, when fire or waters destroy houses,
but that the Lord would reduce to nothing the land itself, even the very
ground.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And pursue his enemies shall
darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He has designated the
Assyrians only by a pronoun, as the Hebrews are wont to do; for they set down a
pronoun relative or demonstrative, and it is uncertain of whom they speak; but
they afterwards explain themselves. So does the Prophet in this place; for he
directs his discourse to the Israelites and the Jews, and he begins by
announcing God&#8217;s vengeance on Nineveh and its monarchy; but now he speaks
as of a thing sufficiently known and adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pursue shall darkness the enemies
of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By this second clause he
intimates that the ruin of that kingdom would be perpetual. As then he had said
that its destruction would be sudden, as God would, as it were, in a moment
destroy the whole land; so now he cuts off from them every hope, that they might
not think that they could within a while gather strength and rise again as it is
the case with the wicked, who ever contend against God. The Prophet then shows
that evil which God would bring on them would be without remedy. Some render the
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;rry</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iredaph, </i>transitively in this form, &#8220;He will pursue his enemies by
darkness:&#8221; but as to the meaning of the Prophet there is but little or no
difference; I therefore leave the point undecided. On the subject itself there
is nothing ambiguous; the import of what is said is, &#8212; that God would, by
a sudden inundation, destroy his enemies, &#8212; and that he would destroy them
without affording any hope of restoration, for perpetual darkness would follow
that sudden deluge. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Some interpreters so consider this verse also, as
though the Prophet had said, that the calamity of the chosen people would not be
a destruction, as God would observe some moderation and keep within certain
limits. The unbelieving, we know, immediately exult, whenever the children of
God are oppressed by adverse things, as though it were all over with the Church.
Hence the Prophet here, according to these interpreters, meets and checks this
sort of petulance, What imagine ye against God? He will indeed afflict his
Church, but he will not repeat her troubles, for he will be satisfied with one
affliction. They also think that the kingdom of Judah is here compared with the
kingdom of Israel: for the kingdom of Israel had been twice afflicted: for,
first, four tribes had been led away, and then the whole kingdom had been
overturned. As then one calamity had been inflicted by Shalmanezar, and another
by Tiglathpilezar, they suppose that there is here an implied comparison, as
though the Prophet said, &#8220;God will spare the kingdom of Judah, and will
not repeat his vengeance, as it happened to the kingdom of Israel.&#8221; But
this meaning is forced and too far-fetched. The Prophet then, I doubt not,
continues here his discourse, and denounces perpetual ruin on the enemies of the
Church. He says first, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What
imagine ye against Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> He exults
over the Assyrians, because they thought that they had to do only with mortals,
and also with a mean people, and now worn out by many misfortunes. For we know
that the kingdom of Judah had been weakened by many wars before the Assyrians
made an irruption into the land: they had suffered two severe and grievous
attacks from their neighbors, the king of Israel and the king of Syria; for then
it was that they made the Assyrians their confederates. When therefore the
Assyrians came against Judea, they thought that they would have no trouble in
obtaining victory, as they engaged in war with an insignificant people, and as
we have said, worn out by evils. But the Prophet shows here that the war was
with the living God, and not with men, as they falsely thought.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>imagine ye against
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> as though he said, &#8220;Know
ye not that this people are under the care and protection of God? Ye cannot then
attack the kingdom of Judah without having God as your opponent. As it is
certain that this people are defended by a divine power, there is no reason for
you to think that you will be victorious.&#8221; At the same time, I know not
why the Prophet&#8217;s words should be confined to the tribe of Judah, since
the purpose was to comfort the Israelites as well as the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this is a very useful doctrine; for the Prophet
teaches us in general, that the ungodly, whenever they harass the Church, not
only do wrong to men, but also fight with God himself; for he so connects us
with himself, that all who hurt us touch the apple of his eye, as he declares in
another place,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
2:8.) We may then gather invaluable comfort from these words; for we can fully
and boldly set up this shield against our enemies, &#8212; that they devise
their counsels, and make efforts against God, and assail him; for he takes us
under his protection for this end, that whenever we are injured, he may stand in
the middle as our defender. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now in the second clause he adds, that he will make a
complete end, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rise up again shall
not distress</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, God is able to
reduce you to nothing, so that there will be no need to assail you the second
time. This passage, we know, has been turned to this meaning, &#8212; that God
does not punish men twice nor exceed moderation in his wrath: but this is wholly
foreign to the mind of the Prophet. I have also said already that I do not
approve of what others have said, who apply this passage to the Church and
especially to the kingdom of Judah. For I thus simply interpret the words of the
Prophet, &#8212; that God can with one onset, when it seems good to him, so
destroy his enemies, that there will be no need of striving with them the second
time: <i>Il n&#8217;y faudra plus retourner, </i>as we say in our language. God
then will make a full end; that is, he will be able in one moment to demolish
his enemies and the ruin will be complete, that is, the wasting will be entire.
There will be no </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>distress
again</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or the second time; for it will be all
over with the enemies of God; not that God observes always the same rule when he
punishes his enemies, nor does Nahum here prescribe any general rule; but he
simply means, that God, whenever it pleases him, instantly destroys his enemies.

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with this same subject, &#8212; that Gods
when he pleases to exercise his power, can, with no difficulty, consume his
enemies: for the similitude, which is here added, means this, &#8212; that
nothing is safe from God&#8217;s vengeance; for by perplexed thorns he
understands things difficult to be handled. When thorns are entangled, we dare
not, with the ends of our fingers, to touch their extreme parts; for wherever we
put our hands, thorns meet and prick us. As then pricking from entangled thorns
make us afraid, so none of us dare to come nigh them. Hence the Prophet says,
they who are as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entangled
thorns</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is &#8220;However thorny ye
may be, however full of poison, full of fury, full of wickedness, full of
frauds, full of cruelty, ye may be, still the Lord can with one fire consume
you, and consume you without any difficulty.&#8221; They were then as entangled
thorns.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as drunken by their own
drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If we read so, the meaning is,
&#8212; God or God&#8217;s wrath will come upon you as on drunker men; who,
though they exult in their own intemperance, are yet enervated, and are not fit
for fighting, for they have weakened their strength by extreme drinking. There
seems indeed to be much vigor in a drunken man, for he swaggers immoderately and
foams out much rage; but yet he may be cast down by a finger; and even a child
can easily overcome a drunken person. It is therefore an apt similitude, &#8212;
that God would manage the Assyrians as the drunken are wont to be managed; for
the more audacity there is in drunken men, the easier they are brought under;
for as they perceive no danger, and are, as it were, stupefied, so they run
headlong with greater impetuosity. &#8220;In like manners&#8221; he says,
&#8220;extreme satiety will be the cause of your ruin, when I shall attack you.
Ye are indeed very violent; but all this your fury is altogether drunkenness:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to you shall the
vengeance of God as to those drunken with their own
drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the last words, &#8220;To the drunken
according to their drinking;&#8221; and this sense also is admissible; but as
the Prophet&#8217;s meaning is still the same, I do not contend about words.
Others indeed give to the Prophet&#8217;s words a different sense: but I doubt
not but that he derides here that haughtiness by which the Assyrians were
swollen, and compares it to drunkenness; as though he said, &#8220;Ye are indeed
more than enough inflated and hence all tremble at your strength; but this your
excess rather debilitates and weakens your powers. When God then shall undertake
to destroy you as drunken men, your insolence will avail you nothing; but, on
the contrary, it will be the cause of your ruin as ye offer yourselves of your
own accord; and the Lord will easily cast you down, as when one, by pushing a
drunken man, immediately throws him on the ground.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And these comparisons ought to be carefully observed
by us: for when there seems to be no probability of our enemies being destroyed,
God can with one spark easily consume them. How so? for as fire consumes thorns
entangled together, which no man dares to touch, so God can with one spark
destroy all the wicked, however united together they may be. And the other
comparison affords us also no small consolation; for when our enemies are
insolent, and throw out high swelling words, and seem to frighten and to shake
the whole world with their threatening, their excess is like drunkenness; there
is no strength within; they are frantic but not strong, as is the case with all
drunken men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be devoured as stubble
of full dryness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alm</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
mela,</i> means not only to be full, but also to be perfect or complete. Others
render the words, &#8220;As stubble full of dryness,&#8221; but the sense is the
same. He therefore intimates, that there would be nothing to prevent God from
consuming the enemies of his Church; for he would make dry their whole vigor, so
that they would differ nothing from stubble, and that very dry, which is in such
a state, that it will easily take fire. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

Prophet then designed here to give the Jews a firm hope, so that they might know
that God had a care for their safety; for if he had only threatened the
Assyrians without expressing the reason, of what avail could this have been to
the Jews? It is indeed gratifying and pleasing when we see our enemies
destroyed; but this would be a cold and barren comfort, except we were persuaded
that it is done by God&#8217;s judgment, because he loves us, because he would
defend us, having embraced us with paternal love; but when we know this, we then
triumph even when in extreme evils. We are indeed certain of our salvation, when
God testifies, and really proves also, that he is not only propitious to us, but
that our salvation is an object of his care. This is the Prophet&#8217;s design
when he thus addresses Nineveh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From thee has gone forth a devisor
of evil against Jehovah, an impious
adviser</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The manner of speaking is much
more emphatical, when he says, that the Assyrians consulted against God, than if
he had said, that they had consulted against the Jews, or consulted against the
chosen people of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though this was said of the Jews, let us yet
remember that it belongs also to us. The Prophet confirms the doctrine which I
lately alluded to, that whenever the ungodly cause trouble to us, they carry on
war with God himself, that whenever they devise any evil against us, they run
headlong against him. For God sets up himself as a shield, and declares, that he
will protect under the shadow of his wings all those who commit themselves to
his protection. If we then lie hid under the guardianship of God, and flee to
him in all our adversities, and while patiently enduring all wrongs, implore his
protection and help, whosoever then will rise up against us will have God as his
enemy. Why so? because he consults against him. And this reason shows, that
whatever the Prophet has hitherto said against the Assyrians ought to be
extended indiscriminately to all the enemies of the Church. For why did God
threaten the Assyrians with a sudden inundation and with perpetual darkness? The
reason is here subjoined, &#8212; because they consulted against him and his
Church. The same thing then will also happen to our enemies, provided we remain
quiet, as it has been said, under the protection of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had gone forth from that city who
contrived evil against Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>&#8212;
this ought not to be confined to Sennacherib, but must rather be viewed as
common to all the Assyrians; as though he said, &#8220;Thou produces the fruit
which thou shalt eat; for from thee will arise the cause of thy ruin. There is
no reason for thee to expostulate with God, as though he cruelly raged against
thee; for from thee has gone forth he who devised evil against Jehovah: thou
reapest now the reward worthy of thy bringing forth; for where have originated
counsels against the Church of God, except in thine own bosom, and in thine own
bowels? The evil then which has proceeded from thee shall return on thine own
head.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An impious
consulter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or counselor,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;[wy
l[ylb</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ivots beliol</i>. Respecting the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[ylb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beliol,</i> the Hebrews themselves are not agreed. There are those who
suppose it to be a compound word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[y

applied to designate things of nought as well as men of nought. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
are others who, like <i>Jerome,</i> render it, Without a yoke, but without
reason. Then <i>Beliol,</i> is properly a vain thing, which is wholly
unsubstantial; and so it designates a man in whom there is no integrity. It is
also applied to all the wicked, and to their crimes: hence a thing or work of
Belial is said to be any heinous sin or a detestable crime; and the man who acts
perversely and wickedly is called Belial. And Paul takes Belial simply for the
very gravity of Satan, and of all the wicked; for he opposes Belial to Christ,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:15.) We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet to be this,
&#8212; that God denounces war on the Assyrians, because they made war unjustly
on his people, and consulted not only against the Jews, but also against God,
who had taken them, as it has been stated, under his own keeping and protection.

HUNDRED AND FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We stated yesterday what the Prophet meant by these
words, that<i> though</i> the Assyrians

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut

that the Lord can, without any difficulty, destroy them.</font><br></div>

trust in their own number, yet they shall be removed.&#8221; But the repetition
of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">
in Hebrew is common; and the sentence may be thus explained, Though they be

&#710;kw</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ucan ucan</i>, that is, &#8220;As they

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zwg

from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zzg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gezaz</i>,) I take it in the sense of removing from the middle, of
destroying: it properly means in Hebrew to remove to a distance, though almost
all interpreters render it, &#8220;They are shorn,&#8221; which ought rather to
be, &#8220;They shall be shorn:&#8221; and both the verbs,

<i>guz</i> as well as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zzg</font><font face="Palatino">,

the Prophet&#8217;s discourse better, I hesitate not thus to render it,
&#8220;They shall be taken away,&#8221; or destroyed. What the Prophet next
adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb[w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>uober</i>, and he shall pass, is applied by some to the angel, by whom the
army of Sennacherib was destroyed. Others think that a temporary pestilence is
meant; as though he had said, that it would only pass through. But the Prophet
seems to refer to a former clause, where he said, that God would suddenly
destroy the Assyrians as it were with a sudden and unexpected deluge. This,
then, is the most suitable meaning, that however much the Assyrians excelled in
number of men and in strength, they would yet be suddenly destroyed; for the
Lord would pass through, that is, the Lord would by one onset reduce them to
nothing.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg16</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>and,</i> literally) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
afflicted thee, yet afflict thee will I no
more.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But this sentence must be thus rendered,
&#8216;Though thee have I afflicted, I will not afflict thee any more.&#8217;
The Prophet meets a doubt, which might have laid hold on the perplexed minds of
the faithful; for they saw that God had been hitherto angry with them. They
might then have succumbed under their griefs had it not been added, that they
had indeed been afflicted for a time, but that God would now put an end to his
severity, for he would no longer afflict them. It is indeed certain, that they
were often afflicted afterwards; but this ought to be confined to what the
Assyrians had done; for we know that our Prophet directed his predictions
chiefly against that monarchy: and then the monarchy of Babylon succeeded; but
it was necessary that Nineveh should be first subverted, and that the government
should be transferred to the Chaldeans, that the Israelites as well as the Jews
might know, that that monarchy had been overthrown, because it rebelled against
God himself by distressing his own people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the intention of the Prophet:
after having threatened the Assyrians, he now turns his discourse to the
Israelites, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though I have
afflicted thee, I will no more afflict thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, There is no reason for the faithful to despond, because they have
been hitherto severely treated by God; let them on the contrary remembers that
these scourges are temporary, and that God&#8217;s displeasure with his elect
people and his Church is such that he observes moderation; for this must ever be
fulfilled, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;In the moment of

<div><font face="Palatino">This promise has been once given to the Church; and
it is now in force, and will be in force to the end of the world. Thus we see
that the Prophet obviated a doubt, lest the faithful should think that there was
no hope for them, because they had found God so severe towards them; for he says
that God was satisfied with the punishment which he had inflicted and that he
would no longer afflict his people. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what the former verse contains, &#8212;
that God would now cease from his rigor; for he says, that the deliverance of
this chosen people was nigh, when God would break down and reduce to nothing the
tyranny of that empire. This verse clearly shows, that a clause in the preceding
verse ought not to be so restricted as it is by some interpreters, who regard it
as having been said of the slaughter of the army of Sennacherib. But the Prophet
addresses here in common both the Israelites and the Jews, as it is evident from
the context; and this verse also sufficiently proves, the Prophet does not speak
of the Jews only; for they had not been so subdued by the Assyrians as the
Israelites had been. I indeed allow that they became tributaries; for when they
had broken their covenant, the Assyrian, after having conquered the kingdom of
Israel and the kingdom of Syria, extended his arms at length to Judea. It is
then certain, that they had been in some measure under the yoke; but it was not
so hard a servitude that the words of the Prophet could be applied to it. I
therefore take the expression generally, that God would free from the tyranny of
Nineveh his own people, both the Israelites and the Jews. If any one objects and
says, that the Israelites were never delivered. This indeed is true; but as to
Nineveh, they were delivered when the empire was transferred to the Chaldeans,
and Babylon became the seat of the empire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see, that the meaning of our Prophet is
simply this, &#8212; that though God by the Assyrians chastised his people, he
yet did not forget his covenant, for the Assyrians were punished. It was then
sufficient for his purpose to say that the Jews as well as the Israelites were
no longer under the yoke of Nineveh, how much soever they might have afterwards
suffered under other tyrants. And what is said about the yoke being broken,
belongs also in some measure to the Jews; for when we extend this to both, the
Israelites and also the Jews, it would not be unsuitable to say, that they were
both under the yoke and bound with chains. For though the servitude of Israel
was hard, yet the Jews had also been deprived of their liberty. It is then right
that this which is said should be taken generally,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will now break his yoke from
thee, and thy bonds will I
burst</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this verse teaches us, that the people were not
so subdued by the tyranny of their enemies, but that their deliverance was
always in the hand and power of God. For how came it, that the Assyrians
prevailed against the Israelites, and then subjugated the Jews, except that they
were as a rod in the hand of God? So Isaiah teaches us in the tenth chapter.
Though they armed themselves, they were yet but as the weapons and arms of God,
for they could not have made any movement, except the Lord had turned their
course, wherever he pleased, as when one throws a javelin or a dart with his
hand. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

what he had previously said of darkness, &#8212; that the kingdom of Nineveh
would be so overturned, that it could never recruit its strength and return

person he includes no doubt the whole kingdom.</font><br></div>

sown of thy name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, God has so
decreed, that the memory of thy name shall not survive: for to sow from the name
of one, is to extend his fame. When, therefore, God entirely exterminates a race
from the world, or when he obliterates a nation, he is said to command that
there should not be sown of such a name; that is, that there should be no
propagation of that name. In short, our Prophet denounces on the Assyrians a
ruin, from which they were never to rise again. And when such a command is
ascribed to God, it means, that by the sole bidding of God both nations and
kingdoms are propagated, and are also abolished and destroyed: for what is said
of individuals ought to be extended to all nations, &#8216;Seed, or the fruit of
the womb,&#8217; as it is said in the Psalms, &#8216;is the peculiar gift of
God,&#8217; (Psalm 127.) For how comes it, that many are without children, while
others have a large and a numerous family, except that God blesses some, and
makes others barren? The same is to be thought of nations; the Lord propagates
them and preserves their memory; but when it seems good to him, he reduces them
to nothing, so that no seed remains. And when the Prophet testifies, that this
is the command of Jehovah, he confirms the faith of the Israelites and of the
Jews, that they might not doubt, but that the Assyrians would perish without any
hope of restoration; for it was so decreed by Heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or from the temple,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of thy gods will I cut off graven
images.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is probable, and it is the commonly
received opinion, that the Prophet alludes here to Sennacherib, who was slain in
the temple of his idol by his own sons, shortly after his return from Judea,
when the siege of the holy city was miraculously raised through the
instrumentality of an angel. As then he was slain in the temple, and it was by
his murder profaned, I am inclined to receive what almost all others maintain,
that there is here a reference to his person: but, at the same time, the Prophet
no doubt describes, under the person of one king, the destruction and ruin of
the whole kingdom. Gods indeed, did at that time make known what he had
determined respecting the empire of Nineveh and all the Assyrians; for from this
event followed also the change, that Nebuchodonosor transferred the empire to
Babylon, and that the whole race, and every one who assumed power, became
detestable. When, therefore, the Assyrians were torn by intestine discords, it
was an easy matter for the Chaldeans to conquer them. Hence the Prophet does not
here predict respecting one king only; but as his murder was, as it were, a
prelude of the common ruin, the Prophet relates this history as being worthy of
being remembered, &#8212; that the temple would be profaned by the murder of
Sennacherib, and that then the monarchy would be soon transferred to the
Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will appoint thy
sepulcher</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he connects this clause with
the former; for how was it that idols were cut off from that temple, except that
that tragic deed rendered the place detestable? For there is no one who feels
not a horror at such a base crime as that of children killing their father with
their own hands. We know when a proud woman at Rome ordered her chariot to be
drawn over the dead body of her father, the road was counted polluted. So also
the temple was no doubt viewed as polluted by the murder of the king. Then these
two clauses ought to be read together, that God would cut off idols and graven
images from the temple, &#8212; and then, that the sepulcher of Sennacherib
would be there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou art
execrable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have
rendered
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twlq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kolut,</i> a thing to be abominated. It may indeed be referred to that
history; but I take it by itself as meaning, that Sennacherib was to be
abominable, and not he alone, but also the whole royal family, and the monarchy
of Nineveh. For it is not consistent, as we have said already, to say, that all
these things refer to the person of Sennacherib; for the Prophet speaks of the
destruction of the city and nation, and that generally; at the same time, this
does not prevent him from referring, as it were, in passing, to the person of
Sennacherib.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must, at the same time, be noticed, that the vain
confidence, which the Assyrian kings placed in their idols and graven images, is
here indirectly reproved; for we know that idolaters not only confide in their
own strength, but that a part of their hope is also founded on their
superstitions. Hence the Prophet says, that their temple was to be profaned by
God, so that no aid would remain to the Assyrians, to the kings themselves any
more than to the whole people. Let us proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again teaches us, that whatever he
prophesied respecting the destruction of the city Nineveh, was for this end,
&#8212; that God, by this remarkable evidence, might show that he had a care for
his people, and that he was not unmindful of the covenant he had made with the
children of Abraham. This prophecy would have otherwise produced no salutary
effect on the Israelites; they might have thought that it was by chance, or by
some fatal revolution, or through some other cause, that Nineveh had been
overthrown. Hence the Prophet shows, that the ruin of the city, and of the
monarchy of Nineveh, would be a proof of the paternal love of God towards his
chosen people, and that such a change was to be made for the sake of one people,
because God, though he had for a time punished the Israelites, yet purposed that
some seed should remain, for it would have been inconsistent, that the covenant,
which was to be inviolate, should be entirely abolished. We now then understand
the Prophet&#8217;s object, and how this verse is to be connected with the rest
of the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the mountains the
feet of him who announces peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
think that the Prophet alludes to the situation of Jerusalem. We indeed know
that mountains were around it: but the Prophet speaks more generally, &#8212;
that heralds of peace shall ascend to the tops of mountains, that their voice
might be more extensively heard:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, on the mountains the
feet of him who announces peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for all
the roads had been before closed up, and hardly any one dared to whisper. If any
one inquired either respecting peace or war, there was immediate danger lest he
should fall under suspicion. As then the Assyrians, by their tyrannical rule,
had deprived the Israelites of the freedom of speech, the Prophet says now, that
the feet of those who should announce peace would be on the mountains; that is,
that there would be now free liberty to proclaim peace on the highest places. By
<i>feet,</i> he means, as we have explained, coming; and Isaiah speaks a similar
language,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;How beautiful are
the feet of those who announce
peace,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">who announce good
things!&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
52:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Arise, then, he says, shall heralds of peace
everywhere: and the repetition in other words seems to express this still more
clearly; for he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
him who announces and causes to hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
might have simply said
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;bm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mebesher</i>, but he adds
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[ym&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshemio</i>; not only, he says, he will announce peace, but also with a
clear and loud voice, so that his preaching may be heard from the remotest
places. We now perceive what the Prophet had in view, and what his words
import.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Celebrate, Judah, thy festal
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is indeed a repetition of the same
word, as if we were to say in Latin<i>, Festiva festivitates,</i> feast
festivities; but this has nothing to do with the meaning of the passage. I am
disposed to subscribe to the opinion of those who think, that there is here an
intimation of the interruption of festal days; for so disordered were all things
at Jerusalem and in the country around, that sacrifices had ceased, and festal
days were also intermitted; for sacred history tells us, that the Passover was
celebrated anew under Hezekiah, and also under Josiah. This omission no doubt
happened, owing to the wars by which the country had been laid waste. Hence the
Prophet now intimates, that there would be quietness and peace for the chosen
people, so that they might all without any fear ascend to Jerusalem, and
celebrate their festal days, and give thanks to the Lord, and rejoice before
him, according to the language often used by Moses. At the same time, the
Prophet no doubt reminds the Jews for what end the Lord would break off the
enemy&#8217;s yoke, and exempt them from servile fear, and that was, that they
might sacrifice to God and worship him, while enjoying their quiet condition.
And that he addresses Judah is not done without reason; for though the kingdom
of Israel was not as yet so rejected, that God did not regard them as his
people, yet there were no legitimate sacrifices among them, and no festal days
which God approved: we indeed know that the worship which prevailed there was
corrupt and degenerated. Inasmuch then as God repudiated the sacrifices which
were offered in Israel, Nahum addresses here his discourse to Judah only; but
yet he intimates, that God had been thus bountiful to the Israelites, that they,
remembering their deliverance, might give him thanks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know, that when the Lord grants us
tranquillity and preserves us in a quiet state, this end ought ever to be kept
in view, &#8212; that it is his will, that we should truly serve him. But if we
abuse the public peace given us, and if pleasures occasion a forgetfulness of
God, this ingratitude will by no means be endured. We ought, indeed, in extreme
necessities to sacrifice to God, as we have need then especially of fleeing to
his mercy; but as we cannot so composedly worship him in a disturbed state of
mind, he is pleased to allow us peaceable times. Now, if we misapply this
leisure, and indulge in sloth, yea, if we become so heedless as to neglect God,
this as I have said will be an intolerable evil. Let us then take notice of the
Prophet&#8217;s words in setting forth the design of God, &#8212; that he would
free his people from the power of the Assyrians, that they might celebrate their
festal days.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pay thy
vows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He not only speaks here of the
ordinary sacrifices and of the worship which had been prescribed; but he also
requires a special proof of gratitude for having been then delivered by the hand
of God; for we know what paying of vows meant among the Hebrews: they were wont
to offer peace-offerings, when they returned victorious from war, or when they
were delivered from any danger, or when they were relieved from some calamity.
The Prophet therefore now shows, that it was right to pay vows to God, inasmuch
as he had dealt so bountifully with his people; as it is said in Psalm 116,
&#8216;What shall I return to the Lord for all his benefits which he has
bestowed on me? The cup of salvation will I take, and on the name of the Lord
will I call.&#8217; We also find it thus written in Hosea,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;The calves of thy
lips to me shalt thou
render,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;281401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
14:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what Nahum substantially meant,
&#8212; that when peace was restored, the people were not to bury so great and
so remarkable a kindness of God, but to pay their vows; that is, that the people
were to testify that God was the author of their deliverance, and that the
redemption which they had obtained was the peculiar work of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows, &#8220;Add no more to pass through thee
shall Belial, for utterly is he cut off.&#8221; This passage must not be
explained in a general sense; for we know that the Chaldeans became more
grievous to the Jews than the Assyrians had been; but the Prophet here refers
especially to the Ninevites, that is, to the Assyrians, whose metropolis, as it
has been said, was Nineveh. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
wicked one then shall not add any more to pass through thee. &#8212; Why? for he
is entirely cut off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This reason given by the
Prophet clearly proves, that he speaks not of the wicked generally, but that he
especially points out the Assyrians. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The waster spoken of here by the Prophet, some
consider him to have been Sennacherib, and others, Nebuchodonosor. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ole,</i> is also variously explained: it is often taken metaphorically in
Hebrew for vanishing, as we say in French,<i> Il s&#8217;en va en fumee;</i> for
smoke ascends, and this is the reason for the metaphor. They then elicit this
meaning, &#8212; that a destroyer had ascended before the face of the chosen
people, that is, openly; so that it was evidently the work of God, that the
Assyrians vanished, who had come to lay waste the whole land: Vanished then has
the destroyer; and then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
thy face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, manifestly, and
before thine eyes. </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">Rwxn
hrwxm</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>nutsur metsure,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>guard the
fortress</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is let every one return
to his own city, and keep watch, as it is usually done; for the country shall be
left without men; and watch the way, that is, look out which way Sennacherib
took in coming to assail the holy city; that way shall be now free from enemies;
and then, keep firm or strengthen
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
loins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesek,</i> sometimes means to keep firm, &#8212; keep <i>firm</i> then or
strengthen the loins, that thou mayest not relax as before, but stand
courageously, for there is no one who can terrify thee; and, lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fortify strength
greatly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, doubt not but thou
shalt be hereafter strong enough to retain thy position; for cut off shall be
that monarchy, which has been an oppression to thee. But others take a different
view and say, &#8212; that the destroyer had ascended, that is, that Sennacherib
had come; and what follows, they think, was intended to strike terror, as though
the Prophet said &#8220;Now while ye are besieged keep watch, and be careful to
preserve your fortresses and strengthen all your strongholds; but all this will
avail nothing. &#8212; Why? Because God has taken away the pride of Jacob as he
has the pride of Israel.&#8221; This is the second explanation. Others again
think, that the Prophet addresses here the Assyrians, and that Nebuchodonosor is
here called a waster, by whom the empire was removed, and Nineveh, as it has
often been stated, was destroyed. According to these interpreters, the Prophet
here denounces ruin on the Assyrians in this manner, &#8212; &#8220;The
destroyer now ascends before thy face.&#8221; The Assyrians might indeed have
regarded such threatening with disdain, when they were surrounded by many
provinces and had cities well fortified: &#8212; &#8220;It will not be,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;according to your expectation; the waster will yet come&#8221;
before thy face; and how much soever thou mayest now guard thy fortresses, watch
thy ways, and carefully look around to close up every avenue against thy
enemies, thou wilt yet effect nothing; strengthen the loins as much as thou
pleasest and increase thy power, yet this shall be useless and vain.&#8221; If
this view be approved, it will be in confirmation of what has been previously
said, &#8212; that God had now determined to destroy the city Nineveh and the
empire possessed by the Assyrians. This meaning then is not unsuitable; but if
we receive this view, something additional must also be stated, and that is,
&#8212; that God now designed to destroy Nineveh and its monarchy, because it
had humbled more than necessary his people, the kingdom of Judah, as well as the
ten tribes. I cannot proceed farther now.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said yesterday that some interpreters regard these
words of the Prophet, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascended
has the destroyer before it face, guard the
fortress</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as having a reference to
Sennacherib; that is, that God had taken him away and made him like mist to
disappear. We also said, that some elicit this meaning, &#8212; that Sennacherib
ascended into Judea and filled the whole country with terror, and that he had at
length laid it wholly waste. But I am disposed to take their view, who think
that this is said of Nebuchodonosor, the waster of Nineveh: as he had been
raised up by God to overturn the tyranny of that city, the Prophet ridicules all
the efforts and preparations made by the Ninevites (as it is usual when a
country is invaded) to oppose him. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>guard the fortress, watch the
way, confirm the loins, and strengthen thy courage
greatly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But these are ironical
expressions; as though he said, Whatever the Ninevites may contrive to defend
themselves against the assault of their enemies will be all in vain. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is now subjoined has been added, in my view, in
reference to what had already taken place, that is that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had taken away the pride of
Jacob, as the pride of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some give
this rendering, &#8220;God has made to returns or to rest;&#8221; and they take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wag</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gaun,</i> in a good sense, as meaning courage or glory. The sense, according
to these, would be, &#8212; that God, having routed the army of Sennacherib, or
destroyed the Assyrians, would make the ancient glory of his people to return;
for both kingdoms had fallen. They then understand this to have been said
respecting the restoration of the whole people; and they who translate,
&#8220;he will make to rest,&#8221; think that continual peace is here promised
to the Israelites, as well as to the Jews. But, on the contrary, it appears to
me, that the Prophet shows, that it was the ripened time for the destruction of
the city Nineveh, for God had now humbled his people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
had</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken away the pride of Jacob, as
the pride of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, God,
having first corrected the pride of Israel, had also applied the same remedy to
Judah: thus the whole people were humbled, and had left off their extreme
height; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wag</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gaun</i>, for the most part, is taken in a bad sense, for haughtiness or
pride. This then is the reason why God now declares, that the ruin of Nineveh
was nigh at hand; it was so, because the Jews and the Israelites had been
sufficiently brought down. This sense is the most suitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then for the same purpose is the next clause,
&#8212; that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the emptiers had
emptied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is that robbers had
pillaged them, and left nothing to remain for them. There is a passage in Isaiah
which corresponds with this, where it is said, &#8212; that when the Lord had
completed his work on mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he would then turn his
vengeance against the Assyrians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:12:) but why were they not sooner destroyed? Because the Lord designed to
employ them for the purpose of chastising the Jews. Until then the whole work of
God was completed, that is, until he had so corrected their pride, as wholly to
cast it down, it was not his purpose to destroy the Ninevites; but they were at
length visited with destruction. The same thing does our Prophet now teach us
here, &#8212; that Nebuchodonosor would come to demolish Nineveh, when the Lord
had taken away the haughtiness of his people.

<div><font face="Palatino">What follows,
</font><font face="Koine" color="Blue">And they have destroyed their
shoots</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or their branches, I take
metaphorically, because the Israelites, as to outward appearances had been
pulled up by the roots; for before the eyes of their enemies they were reduced
to nothing, and their very roots were torn ups so that they perceived nothing
left. The Lord indeed always preserved a hidden remnant; but this was done
beyond the perceptions of men. But what the Prophet says metaphorically of the
ruined branches, is to be understood of what was apparent.</font><br></div>

painted red, that blood might not appear; and that the soldiers had on red
garments, that they might not be frightened in case they were wounded; and this
is what history records of the Lacedemonians. But as the habits of these nations
are not much known to us, it is enough for us to know, that their warlike
appearance is here described; as though he had said, that the Chaldeans would
come against Nineveh with violent and terrible power. Hence he says, that<i>

describes here the Chaldeans, and shows that they would be so armed that even
their very appearance would put to flight their enemies, that is, the
Assyrians.</font><br></div>

same sense. It is certainly evident from the context that either torches or
lamps are meant by the Prophet. His chariot then is with the fire of lamps, that
is, his chariots drive so impetuously that they appear as flames of fire, when
wheels roll with such velocity.</font><br></div>

Assyrians, &#8212; that their great men (whom they think are here compared to
fir-trees, or are metaphorically designated by them) were stunned through
amazement. Astonished then shall be the principal men among the Assyrians; for

verb

stupefying. But their opinion is more correct who think that fir-trees are to be
taken for lances, though they do not sufficiently express the meaning of the
Prophet; for he means, I have no doubt, that such would be the concussion among
the lances, that it would be like that of fir-trees, tossed here and there in
the forest. For lances, we know, are made of fir-trees, because it is a light
wood and flexible, as when any one says in our language, les lances branslent.
The lances then trembled, or shook in the hands of the soldiers, as fir-trees
shake. Thus we see that the Prophet here continues to describe the terrible
appearance of the Chaldeans. Let us go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

they shall be furious in the streets that is, that they shall he so turbulent,
as though they were out of their minds: as furious men are wont to be who are
impetuously carried away beyond all reason and moderation, so shall they also
become mad in their tumult. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall

he who hastens shakes the hips, and moves them with a quick motion; and if it be
lawful to coin a word, it is, they shall hip; <i>Ils remueront les hanches.</i>

might exceed every thing human. But these forms of speech, though they are
hyperbolical, were not yet used without reason; for we may easily conjecture how
great was then the security of the city Nineveh, and how incredible was the
event of its ruin. That monarchy was then preeminent over every other in the
whole world, and no one could have thought that it could ever be assailed. Since
then it was difficult to persuade the Jews that ruin was nigh the Assyrians, it
was necessary for the Prophet to accumulate these various forms of expressions,
by which he sets forth the power of God in the destruction of the Assyrians. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Some interpreters explain this also of the Chaldeans:
The king of Babylon then shall remember his mighty men; that is, shall recount
his forces and whatever strength he will have under his power; all this he will
collect to make war with Nineveh and the Assyrians. Others think that there is
here a transposition in the words, (which is too strained,) &#8220;Mighty men
shall remember,&#8221; as though it were a change of number. But I take the
words of the Prophet simply as they are, &#8212; that he will remember mighty
men: but this, as I think, refers to the Assyrians. He then, that is, either the
king of Nineveh, or the people, will remember the mighty men; that is, he will
gather from every quarter his forces and will omit nothing which may avail for
defense; as it is usually done in great danger and in extremities: for they were
noted then as warlike men; and every one who had any skill, every one who was
endued with courage, every one who was trained up in arms, all these were
mustered, that they might give help. So then the Prophet says, that such would
be the dread in the land of Assyria, that they would collect together whatever
force they had, to defend themselves against their enemies. The king then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall remember his mighty
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, he will muster all the
subsidies within his reach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall stumble in their
march</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, the mighty men, when
gathered, shall tremble and stumble like the blind: and this will be occasioned
by fear; so that like men astounded, they will move to and fro, and have no
certain footing. The Prophet then declares here two things, that the Assyrians
would be diligent in gathering forces to repel the assault of their enemies,
&#8212; but that yet they would effect nothing, for trembling would seize the
minds of all, so that mighty men would stumble in their marches. They shall
stumble, and then it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall hasten to its
wall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, they shall ascend the
wall; and it is added, Prepared shall be the covering, as it is usual in
defending cities. Some apply this to the Chaldeans;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared shall be the
covering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, when they shall come
to the wall. It was indeed usual, as it is well known from histories, for those
who approached a wall to defend themselves either with turrets or hurdles. But
the Prophet, I doubt not, intimates, that the Assyrians would come with great
trembling to meet their enemies, but without any success. However then they
might defend themselves, their enemies would yet prevail.

<div><font face="Palatino">By the gates of the rivers the Prophet means that
part of the city which was most fortified by the river Tigris; for the Tigris
flowed close by the city. As then the Tigris was like the strongest defense,
(for we know it to have been a most rapid river,) the Prophet ridicules the
confidence of the Ninevites, who thought that the access of enemies could be
wholly prevented in that part where the Tigris flowed.

the Israelites and Jews might know, that that city was no less in the power of
God than any other; for God can no less easily pass through rivers than go along
the plain, where there is no obstacle. We now see why the Prophet says, that the
gates of the rivers were opened: and then he adds, The palace is dissolved; that
is, there will be no impediment to prevent the approach of enemies; for all the
fortresses will melt away, and that of themselves, as though they were walls of

<div><font face="Palatino">There is some ambiguity in these words, and many
interpreters think that

of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bxh</font><font face="Palatino">,

migrate to a hostile land. But this view is too strained; nor was there any
reason to suppose the word to be a proper name, except that there was a wish to
say something, and that there was no other conjecture more probable. But I
regard their opinion more correct, who refer this to the state of the kingdom;
and there is here, I have no doubt, a personification, which is evident if we
attend to the meaning. If any one prefers to regard the queen as intended, it
would yet be better to take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bxh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>estab,</i> in its proper and real meaning, &#8212; that the queen, previously
hid in her palace, and hardly able, through being so delicate, to move a step,
&#8212; that she was brought forth to the light; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gele,</i> means to uncover, and also to cast out. If we render it, was made
manifest, the Prophet alludes to hiding-places, and means that the queen did not
go forth to the light, but was like delicate women who keep themselves within
their chambers: but if we render it, Who is drawn forth into exile, it would be
more suitable to one who was previously fixed in her dwelling. The word comes
from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bxy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>itsab</i>, to stand; but it is here in Hophal,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bxwh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eustab,</i>: it then signifies one who was before fixed and firmly settled,
that is, in her concealment; she is drawn, he says, into exile. If then any one
chooses to refer this to the person of the queen, the most suitable meaning
would be, &#8212; that the queen, who before sat in the midst of her pleasures,
shall be violently drawn into exile, and carried away to another country. And it
is probable that the Prophet speaks of the queen, because it immediately
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her handmaids
lead</i></font><font face="Palatino"> her as<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the voice of doves, and
smite on their breasts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, her
maids, who before flattered her, shall laments and with sighing and tears, and
mourning, shall lead away, as a captive, their own mistress. Thus the context
would harmonize.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, as I have said, their opinion seems right, who
think that under the person of a woman the state of the kingdom is here
described. She then, who before stood, or remained fixed, shall be drawn into
captivity; or she, who before sat at leisure, shall be discovered; that is, she
shall no more lie hid as hitherto in her retirement, but shall be forced to come
abroad. And then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she shall
ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, vanish away, for the
verb is to be here taken metaphorically;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vanish
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or be reduced to nothing. And as
the Prophet sets a woman here before us, what follows agrees with this idea,
&#8212; Her handmaids shall weep and imitate the doves in their moaning; that
is, the whole people shall bewail the fate of the kingdom, when things shall be
so changed, as when handmaids lead forth their own mistress, who had been before
nourished in the greatest delicacies.

the city Nineveh, which would have been otherwise incredible; and of this we can
easily form a judgment by our own experience. If any one at this day were to
speak of mighty kings, whose splendor amazes the whole world, &#8212; if any one
were to announce the ruin of the kingdom of one of them, it would appear like a
fable. This then is the reason why the Prophet, by so many figures, sets forth
an event which might have been expressed in few words, and confirms it by so
many forms of speech, and even by such as are hyperbolical. He at length

<div><font face="Palatino">The prophet here anticipates a doubt which might have
weakened confidence in his words; for Nineveh not only flourished in power, but
it had also confirmed its strength during a long course of time; and antiquity
not only adds to the strength of kingdoms, but secures authority to them. As
then the imperial power of the city Nineveh was ancient, it might seem to have
been perpetual: &#8220;Why! Nineveh has ever ruled and possessed the sovereign
power in all the east; can it be now shaken, or can its strength be now suddenly
subverted? For where there is no beginning, we cannot believe that there will be
any end.&#8221; And a beginning it had not, according to the common opinion; for
we know how the Egyptians also fabled respecting their antiquity; they imagined
that their kingdom was five thousand years before the world was made; that is,
in numbering their ages they went back nearly five thousand years before the
creation. The Ninevites, no doubt, boasted that they had ever been; and as they
were fixed in this conceit respecting their antiquity, no one thought that they
could ever fail. This is the reason why the Prophet expressly declares, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nineveh had been like a pool of
waters from ancient days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, Nineveh had been, as it were, separated from the rest of the world; for
where there is a pool, it seems well fortified by its own banks, no one comes
into it; when one walks on the land he does not enter into the waters. Thus,
then, had Nineveh been in a quiet state not only for a short time, but for many
ages. This circumstance shall not, however, prevent God from overturning now its
dominion. How much soever, then, Nineveh took pride in the notion of its
ancientness, it was yet God&#8217;s purpose to destroy it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
flee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> by fleeing, he means, that, though
not beaten by their enemies, they would yet be overcome by their own fear. He
then intimates, that Nineveh would not only be destroyed by slaughter, but that
all the Assyrians would flee away, and despair would deliver them up to their
enemies. Hence the Chaldeans would not only be victorious through their courage
and the sword, but the Assyrians, distrusting their own forces, would flee
away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stand ye, stand ye, and no one
regards</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet places, as it were,
before our eyes, the effect of the dread of which he speaks. He might have given
a single narrative, &#8212; that though one called them back they would not dare
to look behind; and that, thinking that safety alone was in flight, they would
pursue their course. The Prophet might have formed this sort of narrative: this
he has not done; but he assumes the person of one calling back the fugitives, as
though he saw them fleeing away, and tried to bring them back:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>regards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
We now see what the Prophet meant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But from this passage we ought to learn that no trust
is to be put in the number of men, nor in the defenses and strongholds of
cities, nor in ancientness; for when men excel in power, God will hence take
occasion to destroy them, inasmuch as pride is almost ever connected with
strength. It can hardly be but that men arrogate too much to themselves when
they think that they excel in any thing. Thus it happens, that on account of
their strength they run headlong into ruin; not that God has any delight, as
profane men imagine, when he turns upside down the face of the earth, but
because men cannot bear their own success, nor keep themselves within moderate
bounds, but many triumph against God: hence it is that human power recoils on
the head of those who possess it. The same things must also be said of
ancientness: for they who boast of their antiquity, know not for how long a time
they have been provoking the wrath of God; for it cannot be otherwise but that
abundance of itself generates licentiousness, or that it at least leads to
excess; and further, they who are the most powerful are the most daring in
corrupting others. Hence the increase at putridity; for men are like the dead
when not ruled by the fear of God. A dead body becomes more and more fetid the
longer it continues putrifying; and so it is with men. When they have been for a
long time sinning, and still continue to sin, the fetidness of their sins
increases, and the wrath of God is more and more provoked. There is then no
reason why ancientness should deceive us. And if, at any time, we are tempted to
think that men are sufficiently fortified by their own strength, or by numerous
auxiliaries, or that they are, as it were sacred through their own ancientness,
let what is said here come to our minds, &#8212; that Nineveh had been like a
pool of waters from the ancient days; but that, when it was given up to
destruction, it fled away; and that, when their enemies did not rout them, they
yet, being driven by their own fear, ran away and would not stop, though one
called them to return.</font><br></div>

constantly remindest us, in thy word, and teachest us by so many examples, that

thy breath thou shakest that strength in which men trust, &#8212; O grant, that
we being really subdued and humbled, may not rely on earthly things, but raise
up our hearts and our thoughts to heaven, and there fix the anchor of our hope;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet, as it were, by the command and
authority of God, gives up Nineveh to the will of its enemies, that they might
spoil and plunder it. Some think that this address is made in the name of a
general encouraging his soldiers; but we know that the Prophets assume the
person of God, when they thus command any thing with authority; and it is a very
emphatical mode of speaking. It is adopted, that we may know that the Prophets
pour not forth an empty sound when they speak, but really testify what God here
determined to do, and what he in due time will execute. As then we know, that
this manner of speaking is common to the Prophets there is no reason to apply
this to the person of Nebuchadnezzar or of any other. God then shows here that
Nineveh was given up to ruin; and therefore he delivered it into the hands of
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed certain, that the Babylonians, in
plundering the city, did not obey God&#8217;s command; but yet it is true, that
they punished the Assyrians through the secret influence of God: for it was his
purpose to visit the Ninevites for the cruelty and avarice for which they had
been long notorious, and especially for having exercised unexampled barbarity
toward the Jews. This is the reason why God now gives them up to the Babylonians
and exposes them to plunder. But as I have spoken at large elsewhere of the
secret judgments of God, I shall only briefly observe here, &#8212; that God
does not command the Babylonians and Chaldeans in order to render them
excusable, but shows by his Prophet, that Nineveh was to be destroyed by her
enemies, not by chance, but that it was his will to avenge the wrongs done to
his people. At the same time, we must bear in mind what we have said elsewhere,
&#8212; that the Prophets thus speak when the execution is already prepared; for
God does not in vain or without reason terrify men, but he afterwards makes it
manifest by the effect: as he created the world from nothing by his word, so
also by his word he executes and fulfill his judgments. It is then no wonder,
that the Prophet does here, as though he ruled the Chaldeans according to his
will, thus address them, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take ye
away, take ye away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> But this must be
viewed as having a reference to the faithful; for the Babylonians, in plundering
the city Nineveh, did not think that they obeyed God, nor did they give to God
the praise due for the victory; but the faithful were thus reminded, that all
this was done through the secret providence of God, and that it was also a
clear, and, as it were, a visible evidence of God&#8217;s paternal love towards
his Church, when he thus deigned to undertake the cause of his distressed
people.</font><br></div>

there is no need of laboring much about this word; if we take it simply for
place, the meaning would be, that there was no plot of ground in that city which
was not as it were a gulf filled up; for it had amassed all the wealth of the
nations: and this sense would harmonize well with the subject of the Prophet,
&#8212; that the soldiers were to plunder until they were satiated; for the
place was, as it were, a deep abyss.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is glory from every
desirable vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Those who think
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem</i>, a particle of comparison in this place are much mistaken, and
misapply the meaning of the Prophet; their rendering is, In comparison with
every desirable vessel; but this, as all must see, is very frigid. The Prophet,
I have no doubt, declares that the wealth of Nineveh consisted of every
desirable vessel; for they had for a long time heaped together immense wealth,
and that of every kind. The Hebrews call what is precious a desirable thing; and
their vessels we include under the term furniture. We now then perceive what the
Prophet means. Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dbk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cabed,</i> as a participle, and give this version, It is burdened, or
adorned, (for it means both,) with every desirable vessel. But the simpler mode
of speaking is what we have explained, &#8212; that its glory was from every
desirable vessel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here the Prophet condemns what the Assyrians had
done in heaping together so much wealth from all quarters; for they had
committed indiscriminate plunder, and gathered for themselves all the riches of
the nations. They had indeed plundered all their neighbors, yea, and wholly
stripped them. The Prophet now shows, in order to expose them to ridicule, that
other robbers would be made rich, whom the Lord would raise up against them. The
same is said by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;O thou plunderer,
shalt not thou also be exposed to plunder?&#8217; (Isaiah 33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also the Prophet shows in this passage, that men
foolishly burn with so much avidity for money, and with so much anxiety heap
together great wealth; for God will find out some who in their turn will plunder
those who have plundered. It follows&#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here confirms what the last verse
contains; for he shows why he had called the Chaldeans to take away the spoil,
&#8212; because it was to be so. He did not indeed (as I have already said)
command the Chaldeans in such a way as that their obedience to God was
praiseworthy: but the Prophet speaks here only of His secret counsel. Though
then the Chaldeans knew not that it was God&#8217;s decree, yet the Prophet
reminds the faithful that the Ninevites, when made naked, suffered punishment
for their cruelty, especially for having so hostilely conducted themselves
towards the Jews: and hence he declares, that Nineveh is <i>emptied, is emptied,
and made naked.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
repeating the same word, he intimates the certainty of the event: Emptied,
emptied, he says, as when one says in our language, <i>videe et revidee. </i>We
hence see that by this repetition what the Prophet meant is more distinctly
expressed that the faithful might not doubt respecting the event: and then for
the same purpose he adds, she is made naked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design. As
in the last verse he shows that he had power given him from above to send armies
against Nineveh, and to give up the city to them to be spoiled and plundered; so
he now shows that he had not so commanded the Chaldeans, as though they were the
legitimate servants of God, and could pretend that they rendered service to Him.
He therefore points out for what end he had commanded the Chaldeans to plunder
Nineveh; and that was, because God had so decreed; and he had so decreed and
commanded, because he would not bear the many wrongs done to his people whom he
had taken under his protection. As then Nineveh had so cruelly treated
God&#8217;s chosen people, it was necessary that the reward she deserved should
be repaid to her. But the repetition, which I have noticed, ought to be
especially observed; for it teaches us that God&#8217;s power is connected with
his word, so that he declares nothing inconsiderately or in
vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knees smite
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and every
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is dissolved, or melted, and also, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all loins
tremble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We hence learn, that there is
in men no courage, except as far as God supplies them with vigor. As soon then
as He withdraws his Spirit, those who were before the most valiant become
faint-hearted, and those who breathed great ferocity are made soft and
effeminate: for by the word heart is meant inward boldness or courage; and by
the knees and loins the strength of body is to be understood. There is indeed no
doubt but the Assyrians, while they ruled, were a very courageous people, as
power ever generates boldness; and it is also probable that they were a warlike
people, since all their neighbors had been brought under their power. But the
Prophet now shows, that there would be no vigor in their hearts, and no strength
in their loins, or in any part of their body.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then, he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
melted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And hence we learn how foolishly
men boast of their courage, while they seem to be like lions; for God can in a
moment so melt their hearts, that they entirely lose all firmness. Then as to
external vigor, we see that it is in God&#8217;s hand; there will be, he says,
<i>a confriction,</i> or the knees will knock one against another, as they do
when they tremble. And he says afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And trembling shall be in all
loins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He at
last adds<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the faces

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:6, for the sentence there is the same. But they who disapprove of this meaning
say, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;bq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kobets,</i> cannot mean to draw in or to withdraw; and so they render the
noun, blackness. But this is a strained explanation.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwrap</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>parur</i>, [they say,] does not mean a black color but a pot: when therefore
a caldron or a kettle contracts blackness from smoke, it is then called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwrap</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>parur</i>: but in this place these interpreters are constrained to take it
metaphorically for that color; which is, as I have said, strained and
far-fetched. I am therefore inclined to adopt their opinion who render the
sentence, all faces shall withdraw their beauty, or their brightness: but as to
the import of the passage, there is little or no difference; let then every one
have his free choice. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> With
regard to the Prophet&#8217;s design, he evidently means, that the faces of all
would be sad, for the Lord would fill their minds and thoughts with dread. The
withdrawing then of beauty signifies an outward appearance of sorrow, or
paleness, or whatever may appear in the countenance of men, when dejected with
grief. In short, the Prophet means, that how much soever the Assyrians might
have hitherto raised on high their crests, and breathed great swelling words,
and conducted themselves insolently, they would now be dejected; for the Lord
would prostrate their courage and melt their strength: he would, by casting down
their high spirits, constrain them to undergo shame. This is the import of the
whole. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet triumphs over the Assyrians, because
they thought that the city Nineveh was remote from every danger: as lions, who
fear nothing, when they are in their dens, draw thither their prey in their
claws or in their mouths: so also was the case with the Assyrians; thinking
themselves safe, while Nineveh flourished, they took the greater liberty to
commit plunders everywhere. For Nineveh was not only the receptacle of robbers
but was also like a den of lions. And the Prophet more fully expresses the
barbarous cruelty of the Assyrians by comparing them to lions, than if he had
simply called them lions. We now then see what he means, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is the place of
lions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> And he designedly speaks thus of
the Assyrians: for no one ever thought that they could be touched by even the
least injury; the fear of them had indeed so seized all men, that of themselves
they submitted to the Assyrians. As then no one dared to oppose them, the
Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i>
as though he had said that though all thought it incredible that Nineveh could
be overthrown, it would yet thus happen. But he assumes the character of one
expressing his astonishment, in order to intimate, that when the Lord should
execute such a judgment, it would be a work of wonder, which would fill almost
all with amazement. This question then proves that those are very foolish who
form a judgment of God&#8217;s vengeance, of which the Prophet speaks, according
to the appearance of things at the time; for the ruin of Nineveh and of that
empire was to be the incomprehensible work of God, and which was to fill all
minds with astonishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is the place of
lions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> The feminine gender is indeed
here used; but all agree that the Prophet speaks of male lions. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He then
adds<i>, the </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>place of feeding
for lions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrpk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caphrim,</i> mean young lions as we shall hereafter see; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ariut,</i> are old lions. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arie came</i>: and then comes
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aybl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>labia</i>, which some render, lioness; but
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aybl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>labia,</i> properly means an old lion; the Prophet, no doubt, uses it in the
next verse in the feminine gender for lionesses. I therefore do not deny, but
that we may fitly render the terms here, lion and lioness; afterwards, and the
whelp of lions, and none terrifying. He then adds, Seize did the lion (the word
is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arie</i>) for his whelps to satiety, that is, sufficiently; and strangle did
he for his lionesses,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wytabll</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lalabatiu</i>. Here no doubt the Prophet means lionesses; there would
otherwise be no consistency in the passage. He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And filled has he with prey his
dens and his recesses with ravin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> it is
the same word with a different termination,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;rf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thereph</i>, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hprf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>therephe</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the repetition, made here by the Prophet, of
lion, young lion, and lioness, was not without its use; for he meant by this
number of words to set forth the extreme ferocity of the Assyrians, while they
were dominant. He no doubt compares their kings, their counselors, and their
chief men, to lions: and he calls their wives lionesses, and their children he
calls young lions or whelps of lions. The sum of the whole is, that Nineveh had
so degenerated in its opulence, that all in power were like ferocious wild
beasts, destitute of every kind feeling. And I wish that this could have only
been said of one city and of one monarchy! But here, as in a mirror, the Prophet
represents to us what we at this day observe, and what has always and in all
ages been observed in great empires; for here great power exists, there great
licentiousness prevails; and when kings and their counselors become once
habituated to plunder, there is no end of it; nay, a kind of fury is kindled in
their hearts, that they seek nothings else but to devour and to tear in pieces
to rend and to strangle. The Prophet indeed wished here to console both the
Israelites and the Jews by showing, that the injustice of their enemies would
not go unpunished: but at the same time he intended to show how great, even to
the end of the world, would be the cruelty of those who would rule tyrannically:
and as I have said, experience proves, that there are too many like the
Ninevites. It is indeed unquestionable, that the Prophet does not without reason
speak so often here of lions and lionesses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says, &#8220;Come thither did the lion, the
lioness, and the whelp of the lion.&#8221; He means that when justice was sought
in that city, it was found to be the den of cruel beasts; for the king had put
off all humanity, as well as his counselors; their wives were also like
lionesses, and their children and domestics were as young lions or the whelps of
lions. And cruelty creeps in, somewhat in this manner: When a king takes to
himself too much liberty, his counselors follow him; and then every one follows
the common example, as though every thing received as a custom was lawful. This
is the representation which the Prophet in these words sets before us; and we
with our own eyes see the same things. Then he adds, &#8216;The lion did tear
what sufficed his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses; he filled with prey
his dens and his recesses with plunder. He goes on with the same subject,
&#8212; that the Assyrians heaped for themselves great wealth by unjust spoils,
because they had no regard for what was right. The lion, he says, did tear for
his whelps: as lions accustom their whelps to plunder, and when they are not
grown enough, so as to be able to attack innocent animals, they provide a prey
for them, and also bring some to the lionesses; so also, as the Prophet informs
us, was the case at Nineveh; the habits of all men were formed for cruelty by
the chief men and the magistrates. By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ydb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bedi</i>, sufficiency, he means not that the Ninevites are satisfied with
their prey, for they were insatiable; but it rather refers to the abundance
which they had. And he says, that the lion strangled for his lionesses: I wish
there were no lionesses to devour at this day; but we see that there are some
who surpass their husbands in boldness and cruelty. But the Prophet says here
what is natural, &#8212; that the lion strangles the prey and gives it
afterwards to his lionesses. He then adds, that the Ninevites were not satisfied
with daily rapines, as many robbers live for the day; but he says, that their
plunder was laid up in store. Hence they filled their secret places and dens
with their booty and spoils. Still further, though the Prophet speaks not here
so plainly, as we shall see he does in what follows, it is yet certain, that the
reason is here given, why God visited the Ninevites with so severe a vengeance,
and that was, because they had ceased to be like men, and had degenerated into
savage beasts. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">To give more effect to what he says, the Prophet
introduces God here as the speaker.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am against
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He has been hitherto, as it were,
the herald of God, and in this character gave an authoritative command to the
Chaldeans to plunder Nineveh: but when God himself comes forward, and uses not
the mouth of man, but declares himself his own decrees, it is much more
impressive. This then is the reason why God now openly speaks:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I
am</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says, against thee. We understand
the emphatical import of the demonstrative particle, <i>Behold;</i> for God, as
if awakened from sleep, shows that it will be at length his work, to undertake
the cause of his people, and also to punish the world for its wickedness,
Behold, I am against thee, he says. We have elsewhere seen a similar mode of
speaking; there is therefore no need of dwelling on it here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
burn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with smoke her
chariots</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here by smoke some understand
a smoky fire; but the Prophet, I think, meant another thing, &#8212; that at the
first onset God would consume all the chariots of Nineveh; as though he had
said, that as soon as the flame burst forth, it would be all over with all the
forces of Nineveh; for by chariots he no doubt means all their warlike
preparations; and we know that they fought then from chariots: as at this day
there are employed in wars horsemen in armor, so there were then chariots. But
the Prophet, by taking a part for the whole, includes all warlike forces:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
burn</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
chariots</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
How? By smoke alone, that is as soon as the first flame begins to emerge; for
the smoke rises before the fire appears or gathers strength: in short, the
Prophet shows that Nineveh would be, as it were, in a moment, reduced to
nothing, as soon as it pleased God to avenge its wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds in the third person,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy young lions shall the
sword devour</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He indeed changes the
person here; but the discourse is more striking, when God manifests his wrath in
abrupt sentences. He had said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I am against
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> then,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will burn her
chariots</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he now hardly deigns to direct
his speech to Nineveh; but afterwards he returns to her,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy young lions shall the
sword devour</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Then God, by speaking thus
in broken sentences, more fully expresses the dreadful vengeance which he had
determined to execute on the Ninevites. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will exterminate from the
earth thy prey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, it will not now
be allowed thee to go on as usual; for I will put a stop to thy inhuman cruelty.
Thus <i>prey </i>may be taken for the act itself; or it may be fitly explained
of the spoils taken from the nations, for the Ninevites, by their tyrannical
ravening, had everywhere plundered; and thus it may be applied to the pillaging
of the city. I <i>will </i>then<i> exterminate</i> from the land, that is from
thy country, those riches which have been hitherto heaped together as though a
lion had been everywhere gathering a prey.</font><br></div>

&#8212; that God would at length produce silence, so that they should not
hereafter disturb all their neighboring countries with the clamor of war. But as
this explanation is strained, I am inclined to adopt what others think, &#8212;
that the grinding teeth are here intended. The word is not written, if it be
taken for messengers, according to grammar; it is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkkalm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melakke</i>; there ought not to have been the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>he</i> at the end, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>jod,</i> ought to have been inserted before the last letter but one: and if
it be deemed as meaning the king, it ought then to have been written
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;klm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melkak</i>. All then confess, that the word is not written according to the
rule of grammar; and as the Persians call the grinders
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkkalm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melakke,</i> we may give this version, which well suits the context,
&#8216;No more shall be heard the sound of grinders.&#8217; For since lions
seize the prey with their teeth, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
also break the bones, and thus make a great noise when they tear an animal or a
man with their teeth, this rendering seems to be the most suitable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heard no more shall be the sound
of teeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, heard shall not be
the noise made by thy teeth; for when thou now tearest thy prey, thy teeth make
a noise. No more heard then shall the noise from that breaking, or the clashing
or the crashing of the teeth. But as to the chief point, this is no matter of
importance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet simply teaches us here that it could not
be, but that God would at length restrain tyrants; for though he hides himself
for a time, he yet never forgets the groans of those whom he sees to be unjustly
afflicted: and particularly when tyrants molest the Church, it is proved here by
the Prophet that God will at length be a defender; and hence we ought to
consider well these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I am against
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For though God addresses these
words only to the Assyrians, yet as he points out the reasons why he rises up
with so much displeasure against them, they ought to be extended to all tyrants,
and to all who exercise cruelty towards distressed and innocent men. But this is
more clearly expressed in the following verse.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, as I have said, more clearly expresses
here the reason why the vengeance of God would be so severe on the Ninevites,
&#8212; because they had wholly given themselves up to barbarous cruelty; and
hence he calls it the bloody city.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bloody
city!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says. The exclamation is emphatical.
Though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eu,</i> sometimes means Woe; yet it is put here as though the Prophet would
have constrained Nineveh to undergo its punishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O sanguinary
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole of it is
full</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;jk</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>cachesh</i>: the word signifies leanness and the Prophet no doubt joins here
together two words, which seem to differ widely, and yet they signify the same
thing. For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qrp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>perek,</i> means to lay by; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;jk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cachesh,</i> is taken for a lie or vanity, when there is nothing solid in
what is said: but the Prophet, I doubt not, means by both words the spoils of
the city Nineveh. It was then full of leanness for it had consumed all others;
it was also full of spoils, for it had filled itself. But the meaning of the
Prophet is in no way dubious; for at length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart shall not the
prey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is as some think, it shall
not be withdrawn from the hands of conquerors; but others more correctly think
that a continued liberty in plundering is intended, that the Assyrians were
constantly employed in pillaging and kept within no bounds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the Prophet now shows why God says,
that he would be an adversary to the Ninevites, because he could not endure its
unjust cruelty. He bore with it indeed for a time; for he did not immediately
execute his judgment; but yet he never forgot his own people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, God has once declared by the mouth of his
Prophet that he would be the avenger of the cruelty which the Assyrians had
exercised, let us know that he retains still his own nature; and whatever
liberty he may for a time grant to tyrants and savage wild beasts, he yet
continues to be a just avenger. It is our duty calmly to bear injuries, and to
groan to him; and as he promises to be at length our helper, it behaves us to
flee to him, and to ask him to succor us, so that seeing his Church oppressed,
and tyrants exercising licentiously their power, he may hasten the time to
restrain them. If then we were at all times to continue thus resigned under
God&#8217;s protection, there is no doubt but that he would be ready even at
this day to execute a similar judgment to that which the city Nineveh and its
people had to endure.</font><br></div>

heard of punishments so dreadful denounced on all tyrants and plunderers, this
warning may keep us within the limits of justice, so that none of us may abuse
our power to oppress the innocent, but, on the contrary, strive to benefit one
another, and wholly regulate ourselves according to the rule of equity: and may
we hence also receive comfort whenever the ungodly molest and trouble us, and
doubt not but that we are under thy protection, and that thou art armed with
power sufficient to defend us, so that we may patiently bear injuries, until at
length the ripened time shall come for thee to help us, and to put forth thy
power for our preservation; nor let us cease to bear our evils with patience, as
long as it may be thy will to exercise us in our present warfare, until having
gone through all one troubles, we come to that blessed rest which has been

prevail against it: and therefore he adds, that all the roads would be full of

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet mentions again the cause why God would
execute so dreadful a vengeance on that city, which yet procured by its splendor
so much glory and respect among all people: and God seems in a manner to have
but little regard for the order of the world when he thus overturns great
cities. For since he is the Creator of the whole world, it seems to be his
proper office to protect its various parts, especially those which excel in
beauty, for they seem to deserve a higher regard. When therefore any splendid
city is demolished, such thoughts as these occur to us, &#8212; That God is
either delighted with the ruin of the world, or is asleep in heaven, and that
thus all things revolve by chance and contingency. Therefore the Prophet shows,
that God had just reasons for decreeing the ruin of Nineveh, and for deforming
that beauty, that it might not deceive the eyes of men. Hence he compares
Nineveh to a harlot. The similitude seems not to be very suitable: but yet if we
take a nearer view of things, the Prophet could not have more fitly nor more
strikingly set forth the condition of that city. He had before mentioned its
barbarous cruelty, and said, that it was the den of lions, and that savage and
bloody wild beasts dwelt there. He now begins to speak of the frauds and crafty
artifices by which the kings of this world attain for themselves both wealth and
power. The Prophet then makes the city Nineveh to be like a harlot for this
reason, &#8212; because it had not only brought under its power neighboring
nations by threats and terrors, and also by cruelty, but because it had ensnared
many by oblique arts and fraudulent means, by captious dealings and allurements.
This is the reason why it is now called a <i>harlot </i>by the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophets of God seem indeed to speak but with
little reverence of great cities and empires: but we know that it rightly
belongs to the Spirit of God, that in exercising his own jurisdiction, he should
uncover the base deeds of the whole world, which otherwise would lie concealed
and even under the appearance of virtues deceive the eyes and senses of the
simple: and as men so much flatter themselves, and are inebriated with their own
delusions, it is necessary that those who are too self-indulgent and delicate
should be roughly handled. As then kings ever set up their own splendor that
they may dazzle the eyes of the simple, and seem to have their own greatness as
a beautiful covering, the Spirit of God divests them of these masks. This then
is the reason why the Prophet speaks here, in no very respectful terms, of that
great monarchy which had attracted the admiration of all nations. For when the
Spirit of God adopts a humble and common mode of speaking, men, blinded by their
vices, will not acknowledge their own baseness; nay, they will even dare to set
up in opposition those things which cover their disgraceful deeds: but the
Spirit of God breaks through all these things, and dissipates those delusions by
which men impose on themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such is the reason for this similitude;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the multitude, he
says, of the whoredoms of the harlot, who excels in
favor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It is said by way of concession
that Nineveh was in great favor, that is, that by her beauty she had allured to
herself many nations, like a harlot who attains many lovers: and thus the
Prophet allows that Nineveh was beautiful. But he adds that she was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mistress of
sorceries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;&ccedil;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>casheph,</i> means sorcery, and also juggling: we may then render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yp&ccedil;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cashaphim</i>, used here, juggleries, (<i>praestigias &#8212; </i>sleights of
hand.) But the Prophet seems to allude to filters or amatory potions, by which
harlots dementate youths. As then harlots not only attract notice by their
beauty and bland manners and other usual ways; but they also in a manner
fascinate unhappy youths, and use various arts and delusions; so the Prophet
under this word comprehends all the deceits practiced by harlots; as though he
said, &#8220;This harlot was not only beautiful, but also an enchantress, who by
her charms deceived unhappy nations like a strumpets who dementates unhappy
youths, who do not take care of themselves.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who sells nations by her
whoredoms, and tribes by her sorceries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Though Nahum still carries on the same metaphor, he yet shows more clearly what
he meant by whoredoms and sorceries, &#8212; even the crafts of princes, by
which they allure their neighbors, and then reduce them to bondage. Then all the
counsels of kings (which they call policies) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are
here, by the Spirit of God, called sorceries or juggleries, and also
meretricious arts. This reproof, as I have already said, many deem to have been
too severe; for so much majesty shone forth then in the Assyrians, that they
ought, as they think, to have been more respectfully treated. But it behaved the
Spirit of God to speak in this forcible language: for there is no one who does
not applaud such crafty proceedings. Where any one, without mentioning princes,
to ask, Is it right to deceive, and then by lies, deceptions, perjuries, cavils,
and other arts, to make a cover for things? &#8212; were this question asked,
the prompt answer would be, that all these things are as remote as possible from
virtue, as nothing becomes men more than ingenuous sincerity. But when princes
appear in public, and make this pretense, that the world must be ruled with
great prudence, that except secret counsels be taken, all kingdoms would
immediately fall into ruin, &#8212; this veil covers all their shameful
transactions, so that it becomes lawful for them, and even praiseworthy, to
deceive one party, to circumvent another, and a third to oppress by means of
deception. Since then princes are praised for their craftiness, this is the
reason why the Prophet here takes away, as it were by force, the mask, under
which they hide their base proceedings; &#8220;They are,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;meretricious arts, and they are sorceries and
juggleries.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is of one city, it is true, that he speaks here;
but the Prophet no doubt describes in this striking representation how kingdoms
increase and by what crafty means, &#8212; first, by robberies, &#8212; and then
by artful dealings, such as would by no means become honest men in the middle
class of life. But princes could never succeed, except they practiced such
artifices. We yet see how they are described here by the Spirit of God, &#8212;
that they are like strumpets given to juggleries, and to other base and filthy
arts, which he calls whoredoms. But I have said, that the meaning of the Prophet
can be more clearly elicited from the second clause of the verse, when he says
that the Ninevites made a merchandise of the nations. We see indeed even at this
day that princes disturb the whole world at their pleasure; for they deliver up
innocent people to one another, and shamefully sell them, while each hunts after
his own advantage, without any shame; that he may increase his own power, he
will deliver others into the hand of an enemy. Since then there are crafty
proceedings of this kind carried on too much at this day, there is no need that
I should attempt to explain at any length the meaning of the Prophet. I wish
that examples were to be sought at a distance. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms here what he has said of the
fall of Nineveh; but, as it was stated yesterday, he introduces God as the
speaker, that his address might be more powerful. God then testifies here to the
Assyrians, that they should have no strife or contention with any mortal being,
but with their own judgment; as though he said, &#8220;There is no reason for
thee to compare thy forces with those of the Chaldeans; but think of this
&#8212; that I am the punisher of thy crimes. The Chaldeans indeed shall come;
chariots shall make a noise and horses shall leap, and horsemen shall shake the
earth; they shall brandish the flaming swords, and their spears shall be like
lightning; but there is no reason for thee to think that the Chaldeans will, of
themselves, break in upon thee: for I guide them by my hidden providence, as it
is my purpose to destroy thee; and now the time is come when I shall execute on
thee my judgment.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twabx</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>tsabaut,</i> must be referred to the circumstance of this passage; for God
declares here his own power, that the Assyrians might not think that they could
by any means escape. He then adds<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will disclose thy
extremities on thy face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He alludes to
the similitude which we have lately observed; for harlots appear very fine, and
affect neatness and elegance in their dress; they not only put on costly
apparel, but also add disguises. Though then this fine dress conceals the
baseness of strumpets, yet, were any to take the clothes of a harlot and throw
them over her head, all her beauty would disappear, and all men would abhor the
sight: to see her concealed parts disclosed would be a base and filthy
spectacle. So God declares that he would strip Nineveh of its magnificent dress,
that she might be a detestable sight, only exhibiting her own reproach. We now
then apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; as though he said, &#8220;Nineveh
thinks not that she is to perish. &#8212; How so? Because her own splendor
blinds her: and she has willfully deceived herself, and, by her deceits, has
dazzled the eyes of all nations. As then this splendor seems to be a defense to
the city Nineveh, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will disclose her hidden
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>I will deprive the Assyrians of
all this splendor in which they now glory, and which is in high esteem and
admiration among other nations.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage ought to be especially noticed; for,
as I have said, true dignity is not to be found in the highest princes. Princes
ought, indeed, to seek respect for themselves by justice, integrity, mercy, and
a magnanimous spirit: but they only excel in mean artifices; then they
shamelessly deceive, lie, and swear falsely; they also flatter, even meanly,
when circumstances require; they insinuate themselves by various crafty means,
and by large promises decoy the simple. Since then their true dignity is not
commonly regarded by princes, this passage ought to be observed, so that we may
know that their elevation, which captivates the minds of men, is an abomination
before God; for they do not discern things, but are blind, being dazzled by
empty splendor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Disclose</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I thy
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Disclose will I thy fringes on
thy face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will show to the nations thy
nakedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And the nakedness of great
kings is shown to the nations when the Lord executes his vengeance: for then
even the lowest of the low will dare to pass judgment, &#8212; &#8220;He
deserved to perish with shame, for he exercised tyranny on his own subjects, and
spared not his own neighbors; he never was a good prince; nay, he only employed
deceits and perjuries.&#8221; When, therefore princes are cast down, every one,
however low, becomes a judge, and ascends as it were, the tribunal to burden and
load them with reproaches. And hence the Prophet says, in the person of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Disclose will I thy fringes on
thy face, and will show to the nations thy nakedness, and to kingdoms thy
filthiness.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will besprinkle thee with
filth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or defilements. The Prophet still
alludes to the similitude of a harlot, who is well and sumptuously adorned, and
by her charms captivates the eyes of all: but when any one takes mire and filth
from the middle of the road, and bespatters her with it, there is then no one
who will not turn away his eyes from so filthy an object. But we have already
explained the import of this. God is indeed said to besprinkle kingdoms with
defilements, when he casts them down; for they all begin freely to express their
opinion: and those who before pretended great admiration, now rise up and bring
forth many reproachful things. Then it is, that the Lord is said to besprinkle
great kingdoms with filth and defilements.</font><br></div>

are here reproached for their cruelty, because they made themselves so hated by
all that they were unworthy of sympathy; for they spared none, they allowed
themselves full liberty in injuring others, they had gained the hatred of all
the world. Hence some think that what is here intimated is, that the Ninevites
were justly detested by and so that no one condoled with them in so great a
calamity, inasmuch as they had been injurious to all: &#8220;It shall then
happen, that whosoever sees thee shall go far away from thee and shall say,
Wasted is Nineveh; who will condole with her? Whence shall I call comforters to

the Prophet&#8217;s mind. We may explain the words more simply, that all would
flee far away as a proof of their horrors and that the calamity would be such,
that no lamentation would correspond with it. Who will be able to console with
her? that is, were the greatness of her calamity duly weighed, though all were
to weep and utter their meanings, it would not yet be sufficient: all
lamentations would be far unequal to so great a calamity. The Prophet seems
rather to mean this.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, in order to gain credit to his prophecy,
produces here the ensample of Alexandria. It is indeed certain, from many
testimonies of Scripture, that Alexandria is called No, which was a very ancient
city, situated on the confines of Africa, and yet in Egypt. It might, at the
same time, be, that the Alexandrians formerly had their own government, at least
their own kings: and this is probable; for the Prophet says here, that Egypt and
Ethiopia, as well as Africa and the Libyan nations, were the confederates of
this city. It may hence then be concluded, that Alexandria was not then a part
of Egypt, but had its own government, and was in alliance with the Egyptians, as
with the other nations. But as Egypt, after the death of our Prophet, was in
part overthrown by the Assyrians, and in part by the Chaldeans, some
interpreters think, that the Prophet speaks of a ruin which had not yet taken
place.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg40</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But this would not harmonize with his design; for the Prophet shows here, as in
a mirror, that the chief empires fall according to the will of God, and that
cities, the richest and the best fortified, come to nothing, whenever it pleases
God. Unless, then, the destruction of Alexandria was notorious and everywhere
known, the Prophet could not have suitably adduced this example: I therefore
doubt not but that Alexandria had been then demolished. It is no matter of
wonder that it afterwards returned to its former state and became rich; for the
situation of the city was most commodious, not so much on account of the
fertility of the land, as on account of its traffic; for ships from the
Mediterranean sailed up near to it. It had, indeed, on one side, the lake
Marcotis, which is not very healthy; and then the sea fortified it; and Pharos
was a neighboring island: but yet the city was inhabited by many, and adorned
with splendid buildings; for the advantage of traffic drew together inhabitants
from all quarters. It was afterwards built again by Alexander of Macedon. But it
is evident enough that it had been already an opulent city: for Alexander did
not build a new city but enlarged it.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us
now come to the words of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall it be better to thee than to
Alexandria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amun</i>, some render populous; and I am inclined to adopt this meaning,
which has been received nearly by the consent of all. Others have supposed it to
be the name of a king; but as proof fails them, I leave to themselves their own
conjecture. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall it then be
better to thee than to Alexandria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> For
<i>it stood,</i> he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>between
the rivers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Alexandria had the Nile, as
it were, under its own power; for it was then divided into many parts, so that
it intersected the city in various places. So then he says, that Alexandria
dwelt between the rivers; for it divided the Nile, as it suited its convenience,
into several streams.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sea was around
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for it was surrounded on one side
by the sea, and protected by the island Pharos, which had a tower, not only for
the sake of defense, but that ships coming in from the Mediterranean, might have
a signal, by which they might direct their course straight to the harbor.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was around
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the sea encircled more than
half of the city; and then the lake Mareotis was on the other side to the south.
He afterwards adds<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
its wall</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or moat
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The word is written with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iod,</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chil</i>; but it means a wall or a moat, though Latins render antemurale
&#8212; a front-work: for they were wont formerly to fortify their cities with a
double wall, as old buildings still show. According to these interpreters
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chil,</i> is the inner wall, and so they render its front-work: and there was
also an outer wall towards the sea. But we may take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chil,</i> for a moat or a trench; and it is easy to find from other passages
that it was a trench rather than a front-work. It is said that the body of
Jezebel was torn by dogs in the trench, and the word there is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chil</i>. As to the object of the Prophet, he evidently intended to show,
that Alexandria was so well fortified, that Nineveh had no reason to think
herself to be in a safer state; for its fortress was from the sea, and also from
Ethiopia, on account of the munitions which he has mentioned. Then he speaks of
<i>Africa</i> and <i>Egypt,</i> and the Libyan nations,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
says in short, that there was no end of her strength; that is, that she could
seek the help of many friends and confederates: many were ready to bring aid,
even Africa, Ethiopia, and the Lybians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she departed into
captivity a captive</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, the
inhabitants of Alexandria have been banished, and the city become as it were
captive, for its inhabitants were driven here and there.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dashed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have been their little
ones at the head of every street</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
Prophet means, that so great a power as that of Alexandria did not prevent the
conquerors to exercise towards her the most barbarous cruelty; for it was a
savage act to dash little children against stones, who ought on account of their
tender age, to have been spared. There was indeed no reason for raging against
them, for they could not have been deemed enemies. But yet the Prophet says that
Alexandria had been thus treated; and he said this, that Nineveh might not trust
in her strength, and thus perversely despise God&#8217;s judgment, which he now
denounced on it. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
cast lots on her princess and bound were her great men with
fetters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In saying that lots were cast,
he refers to an ancient custom; for when there was any dispute respecting a
captive, the lot was cast: as for instance, when two had taken one man, to
prevent contention, it was by lot determined who was to be his master. So then
he says that lots were cast on their princes. This usually happened to the
common people and to the lowest slaves; but the Prophet says that the conquerors
spared not even the princes. They were therefore treated as the lowest class;
and though they were great princes, they were led into captivity and bound with
chains, in the same manner with the meanest and the lowest of the people. They
were not treated according to their rank; and there was no differences between
the chief men and the most degraded of the humbler classes; for even the very
princes were so brought down, that their lot differed not from that of the
wretched; for as common people are usually treated with contempt, so were the
chiefs of Alexandria treated by their enemies.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Nahum, after having adduced the example of
Alexandria, now shows that nothing would be able to resist God, so that he
should not deal with Nineveh in the same manner; and he declares that this would
be the case, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
also</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt be
inebriated</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Well known is this metaphor, which
often occurs in Scripture: for the Prophets are wont frequently to call
punishment a cup, which God administers. But when God executes a heavy
punishment, he is said to inebriate the wicked with his cup. The Prophet says
now, that the chastisement of Nineveh would make her like a drunken man, who,
being overcome with wine, lies down, as it were, stupefied. Hence by this
metaphor he intended to set forth a most severe punishment:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt be also
inebriated</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam,</i> is here emphatical; it was introduced, that the Ninevites might
know, that they could not possibly escape the punishment which they deserved;
for God continues ever like himself.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt be also
inebriated</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This would not be
consistent, were not God the judge of the world to the end. There is then a
common reason for this proceeding; hence it necessarily follows, &#8212; since
God punished the Alexandrians, the Assyrians cannot escape his hand, and be
exempt from punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be
hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some refer this to shame, as
though the Prophet had said, &#8212; &#8220;Thou indeed showest thyself now to
be very proud, but calamity will force thee to seek hiding-places, in which to
conceal thyself.&#8221; But I am more inclined to this meaning, &#8212; that
Nineveh would vanish away, as though it never had been; for to be hidden is
often taken in Hebrew in the sense of being reduced to nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Thou shalt also seek
strength, or supplies, from the enemy.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">The
words </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bywam
zw[m</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>meouz meavib,</i> may admit of two
meanings, &#8212; either that she will humbly solicit her enemies, &#8212; or
that on account of her enemies she will flee to some foreign aid; for the
preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem,</i> may be taken in both senses. If we adopt the first meaning, then I
think that the Prophet speaks not of the Babylonians, but of the other nations
who had been before harassed by the Assyrians. Thou shalt now then humbly pray
for the aid of those who have been hitherto thine enemies, &#8212; not because
they had provoked thee, but because thou hast as an enemy treated them. Now it
is an extreme misery, when we are constrained to seek the help of those by whom
we are hated, and hated, because we have by wrongs provoked them. But the other
sense is more approved, for it is less strained:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt also seek aids on
account of the enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, as
strength to resist will fail thee, thou wilt seek assistance from thy neighbors.

Assyrians would avail them nothing; whether they trusted in the number of their
men, or in their walls, or in other defenses, they would be disappointed; for
all things, he says, will of themselves fall, even without being much assailed.
And he employs a very apposite similitude, &#8220;Thy fortifications,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;which thou thinkest to be very strong, shall be like figs; for when
the fruit is ripe, and any comes to the tree, as soon as he touches it or any of
the branches, the figs will fall off themselves.&#8221; We indeed know that
there is not much firmness in that fruit; when it is ripe, it immediately falls

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet declares here, that the hearts of them
all would become soft and effeminate when God would proceed to destroy Nineveh.
We have said before that the hearts of men are so in the hand of God, that he
melts whatever courage there may be in them, whenever he pleases: and God
prepares men for ruin, when he debilitates their hearts, that they cannot bear
the sight of their enemies. God indeed can leave in men their perverseness, so
that they may ever run furiously into ruin, and not be able, with a courageous
heart, to repel the attacks of their enemies; but he often softens their hearts
and deprives them of power, that he may make more evident his judgment: God does
not, however, always work in the same way; for variety in his judgments is
calculated to do us good, for thereby our minds are more powerfully awakened.
Were his proceedings uniformly the same, we could not so well distinguish the
hand of God, as when he acts now in this way, and then in another. But, as I
have already said, it is what is well known, that God enervates men and strips
them of all courage, when he gives them over to destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So now the Prophet speaks of the Ninevites,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy people are
women</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
demonstrative particle, Behold, is here emphatical: for the Assyrians, no doubt,
ridiculed, as a fable, the prediction of the Prophet; and it was what the
Israelites found it difficult to believe. This is the reason why the Prophet
pointed out, as by the finger, what surpassed the comprehensions of men. By
saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the midst of
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates, that though they
should be separated from their enemies and dwell in a fortified city, they
should yet be filled with trembling. This amplification deserves to be noticed:
for it is nothing wonderful, when an onset frightens us, when enemies join
battle with us, and when many things present themselves before our eyes, which
are calculated to deprive us of courage; but when we are frightened by report
only concerning our enemies, and we become fainthearted, though walls be between
us, it then appears evident, that we are smitten by the hand of God; for when we
see walls of stone, and yet our hearts become brittle like glass, is it not
evident, that we are inwardly terrified by the Lord, as it were, through some
hidden influence, rather than through intervening and natural causes? We now
then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, when he says, that the people would
become women, or effeminate, in the midst of the city, in its very bowels; as
though he had said, that they would not cease to tremble, even while they were
dwelling in a safe place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By opening, opened shall be thy
gates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to thy
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shows again, that though the
Assyrians were fortified, every access would be made open to their enemies, as
though there was no fortress. By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the gates of thy
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it is probable that he speaks not
only of the city, but of all their strongholds. The Assyrians, no doubt,
fortified many cities, in order to keep afar off the enemy, and to preserve the
chief seat of the empire free from danger and fear. I therefore understand the
Prophet as referring here to many cities, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By opening, opened shall be the
gates of thy land to thine enemies and fire shall consume thy
bars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He means, that though they had
before carefully fortified the whole land around, so that they thought
themselves secure from all hostile invasion, yet all this would be useless; for
the fire would consume all their bars. By fire, the Prophet understands
metaphorically the judgment of God. For as we see that so great is the vehemence
of fire, that it melts iron and brass, so the Prophet means, that there would be
no strength which could defend Nineveh and its empire against the hand of God.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on with the same subject, &#8212;
that the Ninevites would labor in vain, while striving anxiously and with every
effort to defend themselves against their enemies. The meaning then is,
&#8220;That though thou remittest no diligence, yet thou shalt lose all thy
labor; for thou wilt not be able to resist the vengeance of God; and thou
deceives thyself if thou thinkest that by the usual means thou canst aid
thyself; for it is God who attacks thee by the Babylonians. How much soever then
thou mayest accumulate of those things which are usually employed to fortify
cities, all this will be useless.&#8221;

<i>chezek,</i> means, here is to hold, or to lay hold, is wholly foreign to the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning:) to <i>fortify</i> then the <i>brick- kiln,</i> that
is, the bricks which come forth from the kiln, nothing else than to construct
and join them together, that there might be a solid building: for we know that
buildings often fall, or are overturned, because they are not well joined
together: and he refers to the mode of building which historians say was in use
among the Assyrians. For as that country had no abundance of stones, they
supplied the defect by bricks. We now then understand the intention of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall the fire consume
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is much importance in the
adverb of place, <i>there,</i> which he uses: there also, he says<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the fire eat thee
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for he expresses more than before,
when he said, that the Assyrians would weary themselves in vain in fortifying
their city and their empire; for he says now, that the Lord would turn to their
destruction those things in which they trusted as their defenses;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the fire
consume thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We now then see what the
Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time observe, that he mentions
water; as though he said, However sparingly and frugally thy soldiers may live,
being content with water as their drink, (for it is necessary, when we would
firmly resist enemies, to undergo all indulgences, and if needs be to endure
want, at least the want of delicate meat and drink,) &#8212; though thy soldiers
be content with water, and seek not water fresh from the spring or the river,
but drink it from cisterns, and though thy fortresses be repaired, and thy walls
carefully joined together in a solid structure, by bricks well fitted and
fastened, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet there shall the
fire consume thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, thy
frugality, exertion, and care, not only will avail thee nothing, but will also
turn out to thy ruin; for the Lord pronounces accursed the arrogance of men,
when they trust in their own resources.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exterminate thee shall the
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, the Lord will find out
various means by which he will consume thee. By the fire, then, and by the
sword, will he waste and destroy thee. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will consume thee as the
chafer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> we may read the last word in the
nominative as well as in the objective case &#8212; He as a chafer will consume
thee. If we approve of this rendering, then the meaning would be, &#8212;
&#8220;As chafers in a short time devour a meadow or standing corn, so thy
enemies shall soon devour thee as with one mouthful.&#8221; We indeed know, that
these little animals are so hurtful, that they will very soon eat up and consume
all the fruit; and there is in these insects an astonishing voracity. But as the
Prophet afterwards compares the Assyrians to chafers and locusts, another sense
would be more suitable, and that is, &#8212; that God&#8217;s judgment would
consume the Assyrians, as when rain, or a storm, or a change of season, consumes
the chafers; for as these insects are very hurtful, so the Lord also
exterminates them whenever he pleases. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
afterwards adds,<i> to be multiplied;</i> which is, as I have said, a verb in
the infinitive mood. But the sentence of the Prophet is this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by multiplying as the chafer, to
multiply as the locusts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> but why he
speaks thus, may be better understood from the context; the two following verses

<div><font face="Palatino">From these words we may learn what the Prophet before
meant, when he said that the Assyrians were like locusts or chafers; as though
he said, &#8212; &#8220;I know that you trust in your great number; for ye are
like a swarm of chafers or locusts; ye excel greatly in number; inasmuch as you
have assembled your merchants and traders as the stars of heaven.&#8221; Here he
shows how numerous they were. But when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The chafer has spoiled, and
flies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> away,</i> he points out another reason
for the comparison; for it is not enough to lay hold on one clause of the verse,
but the two clauses must be connected; and they mean this, &#8212; that the
Assyrians, while they were almost innumerable, gloried in their great number,
&#8212; and also, that this vast multitude would vanish away. He then makes an
admission here and says, by multiplying thy merchants, thou hast multiplied
them; but when he says, as chafers and as locusts, he shows that this multitude
would not continue, for the Lord would scatter them here and there. As then the
scattering was nigh, the Prophet says that they were chafers and
locusts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the design of the Prophet: He first
ridicules the foolish confidence with which the Assyrians were inflated. They
thought, that as they ruled over many nations, they could raise great armies,
and set them in any quarter to oppose any one who might attack them: the Prophet
concedes this to them, that is, that they were very numerous,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by multiplying thou hast
multiplied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> but what will this avail
them? They shall be locusts, they shall be chafers. &#8212; How so? A fuller
explanation follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
multiplied thy merchants as the stars of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">: but this shall be temporary; for thou
shalt see them vanishing away very soon; they shall be like the chafers, who,
being in a moment scattered here and there, quit the naked field or the meadow.
But by merchants or traders some understand confederates; and this comparison
also, as we have before seen, frequently occurs in the Prophets: and princes at
this day differ nothing from traders, for they outbid one another, and excel in
similar artifices, as we have elsewhere seen, by which they carry on a system of
mutual deception. This comparison then may be suitable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast multiplied thy
traders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8212; <i>tes practiciens.</i>
But the meaning of the Prophet may be viewed as still wider; we may apply this
to the citizens of Nineveh; for the principal men no doubt were merchants: as
the Venetian of the present day are all merchants, so were the Syrians, and the
Ninevites, and also the Babylonians. It is then nothing strange, that the
Prophet, by taking a part for the whole should include under this term all the
rich</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, Thou hast then multiplied
thy merchants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg46</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He has hitherto allowed them to be very numerous; but
he now adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The chafer has
spoiled, and flies away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb means
sometimes to spoil, and it means also to devour: The chafer then has devoured,
and flies away; that is, &#8220;Thy princes, (as he afterwards calls them,) or
thy principal men, have indeed devoured; they have wasted many regions by their
plunders, and consumed all things on every side, like the chafers, who destroy
the standing corn and all fruits: thou hast then been as a swarm of
chafers.&#8221; For as chafers in great numbers attack a field, so Nineveh was
wont to send everywhere her merchants to spoil and to denude the whole land.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he says &#8220;the chafer has devoured, but he flies away,
he is scattered; so it shall happen,&#8221; says the Prophet, &#8220;to the
citizens of Nineveh.&#8221; And hence he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy princes are as
locusts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> this refers to the wicked
doings, by which they laid waste almost the whole earth. As then the locusts and
chafers, wherever they come, consume every kind of food, devour all the fields,
leave nothing, and the whole land becomes a waste; so also have been thy
princes; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have been as
locusts and thy leaders as the locusts of
locusts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, as very great locusts;
for this form, we know, expresses the superlative degree in Hebrew. Their
leaders were then like the most voracious locusts for the whole land was made
barren by them, as nothing was capable of satisfying their avarice and
voracity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then adds, They are locusts,
who</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> dwell in the mounds during
the time of cold; but when the sun rises, not known any more is their
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He now shows, that it would not
be perpetual, that the Ninevites would thus devour the whole earth, and that all
countries would be exposed to their voracity; for as the locusts, he says, hide
themselves in caverns, and afterwards fly away, so it shall happen to thy
princes. But this passage may be taken to mean, &#8212; that the Ninevites
concealed themselves in their hiding-places during the winter, and that when the
suitable time for plundering came, they retook themselves in different
directions, and took possession of various regions, and brought home plunder
from the remotest parts. This meaning may be elicited from the words of the
Prophet; and the different clauses would thus fitly coalesce together, that when
the Ninevites left their nests, they dispersed and migrated in all directions. I
do not at the same time disapprove of the former meaning: they are then like
locusts, who<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lodge in
mounds during the time of cold; but when the sun
rises</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212;</i> that is, when the season
invites them, (for he speaks not of the winter sun,) but when the heat of the
sun prevails and temperate the air, &#8212; then, he says, the locusts go forth
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fly away, and known no more
is their place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He means, in short, that
the Ninevites plundered, and that they did so after the manner of locusts; and
that a similar end also was nigh them; for the Lord would destroy them, yea,
suddenly consume them, so that no trace of them could be found. It follows

them prudence enough, and therefore they commit to them the care of the whole

the shepherds would not have so much vigilance as to take care of themselves,
and of the people, and of the whole kingdom. He speaks in the past tense, either

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here more clearly, that when the
empire of Nineveh should be scattered, it would be an incurable evil, that every
hope of a remedy would be taken away. Though the wicked cannot escape calamity,
yet they harbor false expectations, and think that they can in a short time
gather new strength. Hence, in order to take from them this hope, the Prophet
says, that there would be no
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>contraction of the
fracture</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
this is a striking similitude; for he compares the ruin of Nineveh to a wound
which cannot be seamed and healed. There is then no contraction; some render it,
a wrinkle, but improperly. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There
is</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no
contraction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy stroke is full of
pain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, the pain of thy stroke cannot be allayed. This is one thing, &#8212; that
the ruin of Nineveh would be irreparable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever shall hear the
report, shall strike the hand on thy
account</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Many give this rendering, They
shall clap the hand over thee, or with the hands; and they think that the
singular is put for the plural number. But as in Hebrew to strike the hand is a
token of consent, it would not be unsuitable to say, that the Prophet means,
that wherever the report of this calamity would be heard, all would express
their approbation, &#8220;See, God has at length proved himself to be the just
avenger of so much wickedness.&#8221; To strike the hand is said to be done by
those who make an agreements or when any one pledges himself for another. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fg50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As then
in giving pledges, and in other compacts, men are said to strike the hand; so
also all shall thus give their assent to God&#8217;s judgment in this case,
&#8220;O how rightly is this done! O how justly has God punished these tyrants,
these plunderers.&#8221; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strike the hand on thy
account</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;This thy ruin
will be approved;&#8221; as though he said, &#8220;Not only before God art thou,
Nineveh, accursed, but also according to the consent of all nations.&#8221; And
thus he intimates, that Nineveh would perish in the greatest dishonor and
disgrace. It sometimes happens that an empire falls, and all bewail the event:
but God here declares, that he would not be satisfied with the simple
destruction of the city Nineveh without adding to it a public infamy, so that
all might acknowledge that it happened through his righteous
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For upon whom has not thy
wickedness passed continually</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> This is a
confirmation of the last clause; and this reason will suit both the views which
have been given. If we take the striking of the hand for approbation, this
reason will be suitable. &#8212; How? For all nations will rejoice at thy
destruction, because there is no nation which thou hast not in many ways
injured. So also, in token of their joy, all will congratulate themselves, as
though they were made free; or they will clap their hands, that is, acknowledge
that thou hast been destroyed by the judgment of God, because all had
experienced how unjustly and tyrannically thou hast ruled. As then thy
wickedness has been like a deluge, and hast nearly consumed all the earth, all
will clap or shake their hands at thy ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, <i>continually,</i> to show that
God&#8217;s forbearance had been long exercised. Hence, also, it appears, that
the Assyrians were inexcusable, because, when God indulgently spared them, they
did not repent, but pursued their wicked ways for a long course of time. As then
to their sinful licentiousness they added perverseness, every excuse was
removed. But the Prophet does, at the same time, remind the Israelites, that
there was no reason for them to be cast down in their minds, because God did not
immediately execute punishment; for by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dymt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tamid,</i> he insinuates, that God would so suspend for a time his judgment
as to Nineveh, that his forbearance and delay might be an evidence of his
goodness and mercy. We hence see that the Prophet here opposes the ardor of men,
for they immediately grow angry or complain when God delays to execute vengeance
on their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He shows that God has a just reason for not visiting
the wicked with immediate punishment; but yet the time will come when it shall
appear that they are altogether past recovery, &#8212; the time, I say, will
come, when the Lord shall at length put forth his hand and execute his
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we are not
able to keep a firm footing in the way of justice and uprightness, &#8212; O
grant, that, being governed by thy Spirit, we may restrain ourselves from doing
any harm, and thus abstain from all evil deeds, and that we may labor to do good
to all, so that we may, by experience, find that all are protected by thee, who
so conform themselves to the rule of thy Law, that they take no advantage of the
simple, either for the purpose of ruining or of injuring them, but who, being
content with their own small portion, know that there is nothing better than to
be wholly subject to thee, and to thy guidance: and may we thus live in
forbearance and justice towards our neighbors, that we may, at the same time,
rely on thy mercy, by which alone we can be defended, and made safe against so
many assaults of Satan and of the wicked, until, having at length completed the
course of our warfare, we shall come into that blessed rest which has been
prepared for us in heaven by Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>

&#8220;Prophecy is of a prodigious extent; it commenced from the fall of man,
and reaches to the consummation of all things. So many illustrious events
falling in, one after another, just as the word of prophecy foretold they
should, must afford the most convincing proof that our Religion is, as it claims
to be, of divine institution, &#8212; a <i>proof </i>the more convincing,
because it is continually growing upon us; and the farther we are removed from
the source of our religion, the clearer is the evidence of its <i>truth.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">FTe4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
is some difference in the account given. <i>Diodorus Siculus,</i> as quoted by
<i>Marckius,</i> says, that if it was in form oblong; one side was 150 stadia,
the other 90; so that its circumference must have been 480 stadia. A stadium is
nearly equal to a furlong, eight of which make a mile. It must then have been in
circuit about 60 miles. Its walls are reported to have been 100 feet <i>high
&#8212; </i>33 yards and 1 foot, and so <i>broad</i> that three chariots might
run abreast, and adorned by 1,500 towers, the height of which were 200 feet.
From the circumstance of having in it 120,000 not knowing the right hand from
the left, supposed to be infants, some think that its population must have been
above two million. It was situated on the river <i>Tigris</i> on the eastern
side, not far from the present <i>Mosul.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In building this city, as reported by <i>Bochart</i>,
there were no less than 140 myriads of men for eight years. A myriad being ten
thousand, the number must have been one million, four hundred thousand. Such a
city none has ever built since, was the declaration of Diodorus: and there has
not probably on record an account of such a city. That it had large gardens, and
even fields, within its walls, there can be no doubt. &#8212;

appropriate remarks &#8212; </font><br><font face="Palatino">&#8220;God
sometimes not only suffers the wicked to advance prosperously in their sins, but
does not immediately restore the godly in their declensions; nay, he gives them
every facility for a time in their downward course, in order that they may know
themselves more, and that the glory of God may become thereby more manifest.
Foolish then is the sinner, who, having begun life prosperously, concludes that
the end will be equally happy.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Matthew Henry&#8217;s</i> remarks are of the same
import, but still more striking &#8212; &#8220;Providence seemed to favor his
design, and gave him an opportunity to escape: we may be out of the way of duty,
and yet may meet with favorable gale. The ready way is not always the right
way.&#8221;</font><br></div>

example, to put implicit confidence in lots, nor to connect with it the instance
recorded in the Acts, when Matthias was chosen an Apostle by lot, since

answer reverses the order of the questions. He answers the last question first.
&#8220;Whence comest thou, and what is thy country?&#8221; The answer is,
&#8220;I am Hebrew.&#8221; The previous question was, &#8220;What is thy
work,&#8221; or occupation? To this he answers, &#8220;I fear Jehovah,&#8221;

course, includes worship and service. This ought to be the work and occupation
of all. But to the first question, as to what evil he had done, he gives no
answer. <i>Calvin</i> supposes that the whole is not here related, but is to be
gathered from what follows. It is, however, probable that he had previously told
them, that is, before the storm arose, that he was fleeing from the presence of
the Lord: he therefore left them to conclude what evil it was which he had done.
It may be inquired why he said that he was &#8220;Hebrew,&#8221; and not that he
was an Israelite, as the case really was, for he belonged to the ten tribes, and
not to the kingdom of Judah; and Israelites, and not Hebrews seem to have been
then the common name of the ten tribes. The reason may be, that as the
Israelites were then for the most part idolatrous, he wished to show that he was
a true descendant of the patriarchs, who were God&#8217;s faithful servants,
real Hebrews, passengers, sojourners, and pilgrims, as the word imparts, on the
earth. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

these things have taken place through thine appointment, &#8212; that Jonah came
to the ship, that a storm has been raised, that the lot has fallen on Jonah, and
that he has confessed his sin: we unwillingly do this dreadful deed, but this is

willest that he should be cast into the sea: be then that done which thou
willest; for who can resist thy will?&#8221; According to this view, it is an

to the sentence &#8212; that they <i>said</i> that they would sacrifice to
Jehovah; and <i>Grotius</i> adopts his addition. Another Rabbi, <i>Elieser,</i>
has fabricated a fine tale, that they returned immediately to Joppa, went up to
Jerusalem, and were circumcised! The fact alone is stated here, as to when and
where we know nothing, and it signifies nothing to us; only that the most

verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnm</font><font face="Palatino">
does not necessarily include the idea of creation, but its meaning is, to
distribute, to arrange, to order, to provide, to prepare; and yet this
preparation may involve the exercise of a creative power, as in the case of the
gourd mentioned in the fourth chapter, for it is the same verb. Though it might
be an indigenous plant, yet to provide it so quickly in one night was the act of
Divine power. So also as to this fish, it might or it might not have been one
usually found in that part of the sea. To provide it, but bringing it to the
spot, was as much a miracle as to provide it by a new act of creation. To allow
the one and to deny the other, is wholly unreasonable. The whole was clearly
miraculous: and the discovery of any such fish now does not in the least render
the transaction less miraculous. Every part of it must be ascribed to a Divine
interposition; and let those stumble who are resolved to stumble. It has been
supposed to have been the &#8220;whale,&#8221; because the word

he was so displeased as to be angry. His pettish request to die is a sufficient
proof of this. Calvin was not a man to trifle with the word of God for this

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">FTe47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
clause has been variously rendered. The original words are these,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;l hrj
bfyhh</font><font face="Palatino">. It is not to the point to say, as <i>Dr.
Henderson</i> does, that the first word is sometimes rendered adverbially, as
meaning &#8220;greatly,&#8221; etc.; for in other places it is rendered as a
verb, &#8220;to be good,&#8221; or &#8220;to do good.&#8221; It depends wholly
on the form of the sentence what rendering is the most suitable. Both the
construction of the words and the connection of the passage seem to favor the
literal rendering. The first
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino"> is
the <i>an</i> of the Latin, <i>whether,</i> it is an interrogation. Then the
rendering is, &#8220;Whether it is good,&#8221; or, &#8220;Is that good?&#8221;
Jonah had said before that it was &#8220;good&#8221; for him to die rather than
to live; for it is the same word in a different form &#8212;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yyjm ytwm bwf
yk</font><font face="Palatino">, &#8220;for good my death rather than my
life.&#8221; Then the question to him is, &#8220;Is it good <i>that</i> thou art
wrathful,&#8221; or literally, &#8220;<i>that</i> wrath is to thee?&#8221; the
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrj</font><font face="Palatino">,
as in the first verse, is to be construed impersonally.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The rendering, &#8220;Art thou much vexed?&#8221; is
pointless and vapid. It is indeed countenanced by the Septuagint; but we must
remember that on some points there is a wrong leaning in that version, and this
is one of those points. As in the case of Jerome and the early Fathers, there
was a disposition and an attempt to lessen and even to obliterate all the faults
and defects of the ancient saints, so it was evidently with the authors of this
version. Superstition and Pharisaism must have all their saints perfect, while
the word of God represents all true saints as imperfect in the present state,
but aiming at, and longing for, perfection, and fully expecting to enjoy it
hereafter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The version of <i>Newcome</i> is, &#8220;Doest thou
well that <i>thine anger</i> is kindled?&#8221; Kindling or heat, that is, of
anger or wrath, is the ideal meaning of the verb. <i>Junius</i> and
<i>Tremelius,</i> as well as <i>Dathius,</i> consider that anger, and not grief
is meant. <i>Dr. Adam Clarke&#8217;s</i> version is this, &#8220;Is anger good
for thee?&#8221; which is certainly very literal; or, as the verb is in the
causative mood, it might be rendered, &#8220;Can anger do good to thee?&#8221;
It may be doubted whether here, and in the ninth verse, where the same phrase
twice occurs, this rendering is the most obvious and natural. &#8212;

wood was overlaid with plates, either of gold or of silver, or, sometimes
perhaps, of an inferior metal. And, in this finished state, it was called a

internal, the framing, the setting in order, the preparation of evil in the
mind. The Prophet points out here that source from which outward evils proceed.
What numberless schemes, both good and evil, are concocted and arranged by men
on their beds! &#8220;They set their wits on work to invent ways of

the second is a common term for man, but sometimes signifies a husband, and also
a man in years. We may, indeed in harmony with the passage, consider the first
as meaning a householder, and the latter as signifying a husbandman. The fields
in the first line are the same with the inheritance in the last: and houses and
a house are mentioned in the two intervening

as the nominative case, <i>i.e.,</i> the person, who utters the lamentation
afterwards mentioned. The two last lines are the most difficult. <i>Marckius</i>

<div><font face="Palatino">To call the king of Babylon an apostate, seems
incongruous, as it cannot be applied to any one but who has turned away from
true religion. The most obvious and literal rendering is that given by

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Newcome, </i>apparently on the authority of the Septuagint, joins a part of
the last verse to this, and gives this rendering,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>In the congregation

<div><font face="Palatino">The last line he applies to the true prophet, that he
would not subject himself to disgrace by exercising his office.
<i>Henderson&#8217;s </i>version is the following:&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Prophesy not; those
shall prophesy</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Who
will not prophesy of these
things:</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Reproaches
are incessant.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is viewed as being altogether the language of
the people, interdicting the true prophets, specifying those whom they approved,
and deprecating the reproaches cast upon them by the true prophets. Another
version, which is materially adopted by <i>Calvin,</i> is admitted by our Author
as not unsuitable, but he prefers the one given above. The main objection is to
the last line, which in the original is this,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twmlk gsy
al</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last word is plural, and means reproaches; and
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gsy</font><font face="Palatino">
is in the third person of the future tense, and may be derived either from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gws</font><font face="Palatino">,
to recede, to depart, or from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gsg</font><font face="Palatino">,
to remove, both in a transitive and intransitive sense. Having an objective
case, it cannot be the first verb, and must be the second in its transitive
meaning. Then the rendering is, He will not, or let him not, or let none remove
reproaches. This being the literal rendering of this sentence, we must now
consider what version of the former part will correspond best with it. It is
that no doubt adopted by Calvin, though the last clause cannot admit of the
meaning he attaches to it. The people say, &#8220;Prophesy ye not who
prophesy;&#8221; God answers, &#8220;They shall not prophesy to these;&#8221;
and then the Prophet adds, speaking of God, &#8220;He will not remove
reproaches;&#8221; that is, he will not remove them by his prophets with the
view of amending their reproachful conduct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last clause is evidently viewed as an anomalous
construction by <i>Henderson;</i> for he renders it as though the plural noun
were the nominative case to the verb in the singular number, and this because
the latter precedes the former. There may be instances of this in Hebrew, but it
is by no means a common usage; though it be so in the <i>Welsh</i> language,
which in so many of its peculiarities is very much like Hebrew. This sort of
construction is the ordinary one in that language: a plural noun has commonly a
verb in the singular number, when placed before it. This sentence in Welsh would
be exactly the same as in Hebrew&#8212;<i>Nid ymadawa gwaradwyddiadau.</i> The
noun in the plural number is the nominative case to the preceding verb, which is
in the singular number, and the verb too is in the future tense, and is yet
understood as having the meaning of the present
tense.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

the same view, while <i>Henry</i> regards the passage as containing a promise,
and so do <i>Marckius, Newcome, </i>and <i>Henderson.</i> But some have
considered the words as those of the false prophets, referred to in the eleventh
verse, and that Micah answers them in the next chapter. There is no sufficient
ground for this opinion. Of those who regard the passage as including a promise,
some apply it to the restoration from the Babylonian captivity, and others to
spiritual restoration by the gospel. But the passage, viewed by itself, and in
its connection with the next chapter, bears evidently the appearance of a
commination: there are especially two words which manifestly favor this
view,&#8212;

and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;rph</font><font face="Palatino">;
both are taken generally, if not uniformly, in a bad sense. The first means to
tumultuate, to be turbulent and riotous, to be clamorous and noisy; the second
signifies to demolish, to break through, to destroy, and in every instance in
which it is found as a personal noun, it means a destroyer or a

<div><font face="Palatino">The idea of sheep or flock, to which the people are

done, and hate those that are good; and they love the evil, delight in mischief,

evil was to render them afflictive, injurious, and oppressive to others,

this meaning. Almost all critics, except some of the Greek Fathers, who followed
the Septuagint, agree in attaching to this import to the sentence. The
paraphrase of Rabbi <i>Jonathan</i> is, &#8220;To him who offers to them a feast

their enemies; to them they do not cry, Peace, but even prepare war against
them; against them they denounce the judgments of God: they preach either
comfort or terror to men, not according as they are to God, but as they are to

firmly fixed on the top of mountains, etc.? The answer is here given, &#8220;for
go forth shall a law from Zion,&#8221; etc. And this was literally fulfilled at
the commencement of the Gospel; it was first preached at Jerusalem: in
consequence of this, the mount of Jehovah&#8217;s house, or the Church, was

<div><font face="Palatino">It is said, &#8220;on top of the mountains,&#8221;

is better to retrain the most common meaning as a simple copulative, as it is

faith.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

certainly no objection, as it is but seldom used in Hebrew. But &#8220;a
law&#8221; is better except we render the copulative before &#8220;word,&#8221;
even; and then we shall destroy the distinct character of the line. It appears
that, according to the usual style of the Prophets, what the first line states
indefinitely, is in the second specified, as being the &#8220;word of

<div><font face="Palatino">The word

law, in Hebrew, is more comprehensive than the word law, in our language. It is
derived from the Hiphil of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hry</font><font face="Palatino">,
which means to direct, to appoint, to instruct, to teach. Hence the noun,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">,
may be rendered, directory, institution, law, teaching, or doctrine. &#8220;It
doth,&#8221; says <i>Leigh</i>, &#8220;not only signify strictly what is to be
done, but it denoteth largely any heavenly doctrine, whether it be promise or
precept.&#8221; It means often the whole of God&#8217;s revealed word, as in

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is
a difference of opinion as to the nominative case to the verb
&#8220;judge;&#8221; whether it be Jehovah in the preceding line, or the word of
Jehovah. The most natural construction is the last supposition. <i>Jerome</i>
and <i>Cyril,</i> as quoted by <i>Marckius,</i> refer it to the word of Jehovah,
taking the word for Christ: but this cannot be admitted, as the law and the word
seem to mean the same thing, and must be considered as the word of the Gospel;
and <i>Justin Martyr</i> and <i>Irenaeus,</i> when referring to this passage
regard it as such. And this is the view which <i>Marckius</i> seems to prefer.

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jykwh</font><font face="Palatino">,
in Hiphil, to reprove. The first is to decide what is right and wrong, and also
to defend the right and to punish the wrong; hence it means to arbitrate, and
also to vindicate as well as to punish. The first sense is most suitable to this
place.&#8212;The other verb does not occur in Kal, but in Hiphil, it means to
make manifest, or show, by facts or by words, or by action; and hence it
signifies to demonstrate, to convince, to reprove, to chastise. The Septuagint
often renders it by
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">elegcein</font><font face="Palatino">,
which, Parkhurst says, means, in its primary sense, to demonstrate by convincing
reasons or arguments. <i>Lowth&#8217;s</i> version in Isaiah is, &#8220;And

&#8220;convince.&#8221; The rendering of <i>Henderson,</i> &#8220;give

&#8220;All these predictions must be confined to the nations converted by the
word of Jehovah, and brought into Zion, that is, such as truly repent and
believe, and must not be extended to all nations indiscriminately, or to all who
embrace the Christian name, who are often as far as possible from the kingdom of
Christ, inasmuch as they neither learn nor follow his
doctrine.&#8212;<i>Marckius.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf69</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Marckius</i> views this passage differently. He considers that the converted
Gentiles are meant here,&#8212;that when turned from their idols and their
superstitions, they shall profess the true God, as revealed in the Gospel, and
that each nation will regard him as its own God: however various in outward
circumstances, they shall yet acknowledge the God revealed in his Word as their
own. This view most certainly harmonizes better with the context than that of
<i>Calvin,</i> which is commonly adopted. There is another, which is the same
nearly in meaning, but founded on a different rendering of the words. The Jewish
commentator <i>Abarbanel,</i> as quoted by <i>Marckius,</i> gives this
version:&#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
verse has been variously interpreted. It is considered by most as connected with
the last chapter. Some, as <i>Marckius</i>, consider it as an address to the
Roman power; some, to the Babylonian; and others, to Jerusalem. The construction
of it is the main point. The virst verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yddgtt</font><font face="Palatino">,
is found in six other places, and rendered in all, except in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

5:7, and evidently here is to troop or band together; and the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwdg</font><font face="Palatino">,
which follows, commonly means a band or a troop. The participle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the next clause, can refer to nothing in the text but to &#8220;the daughter
of a troop.&#8221; The obvious and natural rendering of the verse would be the
following,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Band thyself
together, thou daughter of a
band,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Laying against
us a
siege:&#8212;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>With
the rod shall they strike on the
cheek</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>The judge of
Israel.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The daughter of a band or a troop means a military
power, which collects bands or troops for warlike purposes. It is certainly more
obvious to apply this to the Babylonian power than to Jerusalem, especially as
the next line, &#8220;Laying against us a siege,&#8221; necessarily refers to
the latter. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The judge&#8221; is, as Calvin seems to take
it, a poetical singular for the plural. No particular person is meant, as
<i>Newcome</i> and others seem to think, but judges in
general.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
does not follow; for to say that it was &#8220;not the least,&#8221; is not to
deny that it was &#8220;small.&#8221; There is, in fact, no contradiction in the
expressions. Matthew quotes literally neither the Hebrew nor the Septuagint
version. The latter, in this case, agrees with the former. He gives the sense,
but not the words, even in two instances besides this. Instead of
&#8220;Ephratah,&#8221; he has, &#8220;in the land of Judah;&#8221; and instead
of &#8220;Ruler,&#8221; he has, &#8220;Governor that shall rule,&#8221; or feed.
The meaning in these three instances is the same, though the words are
different. The place was, in former times, called Bethlehem-Judah, and also
Ephratah. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;013519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

<div><font face="Palatino">The attempt by a question to produce similarity of
expressions in the second line, according to what is done by <i>Marckius</i> and
<i>Newcome</i>, is by no means to be approved. The literal rendering is the
following:&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And thou, Bethlehem

&#8220;Israel.&#8221; In the original, the latter clause is before the former,

after its pronoun.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Most
commentators differ from Calvin in their view of this verse, regarding it as a
distinct prophecy of the Savior&#8217;s birth. There are difficulties on both
sides: but taking the whole context, especially the following verse, we can
hardly resist the conclusion, that Christ, born of a Virgin, is the subject.
Indeed, the whole of this chapter, notwithstanding the reference to the
Assyrian, is not capable of a satisfactory explanation, without applying what is
said to Christ and his Church. Some things, no doubt, in the history of the
Jews, may be alluded to, or incidentally mentioned; but the full accomplishment
must be looked for in the new dispensation. And it is a splendid prophecy, in
words often derived from customs and incidents among the Jews, of the birth of
the Savior, and the character and extent, and blessedness of his kingdom, and
the destruction of his enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Newcome</i> and <i>Adam Clarke</i> propose to
divide the chapter after the first line in verse 5, thinking that a new subject
is there introduced: but evidently the same subject, the Gospel dispensation, is
continued to the end of the chapter. The Assyrian, the especial enemy of the
ancient Church, designates the enemies of the Christian Church in all
ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;As Sennacherib&#8217;s invasion,&#8221; says
<i>Scott,</i> &#8220;was not repelled by the ruler or chieftains of Israel: nor
did the Jews ever invade or waste the Assyrian dominions; it seems evident, that
these expressions must be understood as mystically intending other enemies and
persecutors of the Church, who should be of the same spirit with Sennacherib and
the Assyrians.&#8221; <i>Henry</i>, who is much more learned critic and much
profounder divine than what is commonly thought, agrees with <i>Scott,</i> and
many others, in the interpretation of this
chapter.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftf90A</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;The Prophets prefaced their messages with, <i>Thus saith the Lord;</i>

power was given him in heaven and earth, a power over all flesh, by the virtue

no means a safe rule, to draw a conclusion from the spiritual government as to
what a temporal government should be. The subjects are guided by very different
principles; and the same sort of government will not suit countries under
different degrees of civilization. To theorize on this subject, as on many
others, leads often to wrong conclusions. An hereditary sovereignty may seem to
trench on liberty; but our own country exhibits an example where both exist to
an extent unknown in the present or in any former age. Under no democracy has

similar to that in Greek, when plural neuters take a verb in the singular

are here represented as our enemies; God subdues them; and then in the next line
the simile is continued, they are to be drowned like Pharaoh and his hosts in
the depths of the sea. <i>Henderson&#8217;s</i> remarks on this point are very
excellent. &#8220;There is no ground,&#8221; he says, &#8220;for rejecting the
radical idea of <i>trampling under foot as enemies.</i> Sin must ever be
regarded as hostile to man. It is not only contrary to his interests, but it
powerfully opposes and combats the moral principles of his nature, and the
higher principles implanted by grace; and but for the counteracting energy of
divine influence, must prove victorious. Without the subjugation of evil

2:2, that Nahum prophesied after the captivity of the ten tribes. Josephus
places him in the reign of Jotham, and says that his predictions came to pass
one hundred and fifteen hears afterwards. <i>Ant.</i> IX. 11. 3. According to
our best chronologers, this date would bring us to the year in which Samaria was
taken. And I agree with those who think Nahum uttered this prophecy in the reign
of Hezekiah, and not long after the subversion of the kingdom of Israel by
Shalmaneser.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Newcome.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTg2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The

by the Prophets from God to the people, and hence the same as Prophecy. Others
consider it to be the judgment to be <i>borne</i> by the people respecting whom
it was announced. The latter seems to be its meaning here, where it is said,
&#8220;the burden of Nineveh.&#8221; It was the judgment laid on them, and which
that city was to bear, endure, and undergo.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTg4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;It

it.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Henderson.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTg5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> How far
this language is right, may be questioned. The Prophets, under the immediate
direction of the Divine Spirit, can hardly be said to <i>borrow</i> from a
previous writer. They have no doubt announced the same sentiments, and in some
instances, used the same words, as those found in the writings of Moses; but
they derived them not from those writings, but from Divine inspiration: and, as
<i>Calvin</i> has often observed, they adduced nothing but what they received
from God. But this language is not peculiar to <i>Calvin:</i> he adopted it from
the fathers.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTg6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
following may be proposed as the literal rendering of this

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A God jealous and

watch does he for his enemies.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God is said to be <i>jealous</i> in the second
commandment, being one who will not allow his own honor to be given to another.
<i>Avenger,</i>

wrath, or great displeasure; </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmj

<i>His adversaries,</i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rfwn</font><font face="Palatino">
means to watch, rather than to keep. Its meaning here is to watch the
opportunity to take than to keep. Its meaning here is to watch the opportunity
to take vengeance on his enemies. The description here is remarkable, and
exactly adapted to the oppressive state of the Jews. The dishonor done to
God&#8217;s people was done to him. He is jealous, a defender of his own rights,
full of indignation, and watches and waits for a suitable time to execute
vengeance, to vindicate his own honor.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTg7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I offer
the following translation of this verse,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Jehovah is slow to

<div><font face="Palatino">The second line presents some difficulty. It is
evidently an imperfect sentence; most supply the word, <i>guilty;</i> but rather
the &#8220;enemies&#8221; mentioned before are to be understood. The meaning
appears to be this,&#8212;Jehovah is slow to wrath, that is, to execute his
vengeance, though he is great in power, capable of doing so; but though he
delays, he will not eventually clear or absolve his enemies. With the Septuagint
I connect &#8220;Jehovah&#8221; with the second and not with the third line, and
agreeably with the idiom of the Hebrew; the verb generally precedes its
nominative. The order of the words in Welsh would be exactly the
same,&#8212;</font><br></div>

giving the words here used their distinctive character, I offer the following
version of the whole verse,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Before his anger

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FTg12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
no doubt the right view. The object here is not to assert generally that God is
good, but that he is good for aid and help in the day of distress. The versions
then both of <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i> are faulty; for they divide
into two clauses what is one in the original,&#8212;</font><br></div>

inundation.&#8221; The remaining part has occasioned a variety. The text as it
is, and there are no different readings, is this, &#8220;A full end he will make
of her place;&#8221; or, as Henderson renders it, &#8220;He will effect a
consummation of her place.&#8221; The only difficulty is, that &#8220;her&#8221;
has no near antecedent; but it is not unusual with the Prophets to allow the
general context to supply this. As the vision is the &#8220;burden of
Nineveh,&#8221; that city is no doubt referred to. <i>Newcome,</i> following the
Greek versions, excepting that of Symmachus, translates thus,&#8212;&#8221;He
will make a full end of those who rise up against him.&#8221; But it is better
to follow the Hebrew text; for the many <i>evident </i>instances of mistake

them. The following may be viewed as a literal version:&#8212;</font><br></div>

<i>Newcome.</i> But <i>Kimchi, Dathius, Henderson, </i>and some others, regard
the &#8220;destroyer&#8221; as the king of Assyria. What agrees best with the
context is the former opinion. Having in the preceding verse announced the
release of the people of Israel from the rule of Assyria, the Prophet now
introduces its destroyer, and then proceeds with the main object of his
prophecy, and describes the fall of Nineveh. <i>Marckius</i> considers the whole
verse as addressed to the Babylonian power under the person of the king, while
<i>Calvin</i> regards it, with the exception of the first line or clause, as
addressed ironically to Nineveh. The verbs are either participles or preterites

imperatives.

then all the verbs in the verse appear to be in the same form, and may be

a rendering which seems not to comport with the context. It is like that of

proves its connection with the former verse, it being masculine, while the verbs
in this verse are feminines. His version of the two verses is the

a delineation of the state of Nineveh in the Prophet&#8217;s time; and with the
last <i>Newcome</i> agrees, while <i>Henderson</i> coincides with the former.
The version given by them is all nearly the same. It seems certainly more
consistent with the order of the poem to regard the verse as describing the
state of Nineveh at the time, for the sacking of Nineveh had been before very
minutely delineated. Having done this, the Prophet may be supposed to give here
a reason for the dreadful catastrophe which he had mentioned. Entertaining this
