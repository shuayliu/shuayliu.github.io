Moses expressly declares that God not only gave them a visible sign, by
uplifting the cloud, but that He also verbally commanded the people to leave
Mount Sinai, and to set about the performance of the rest of their journey. God
says, then, that enough time had been spent in one place; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, before they left it, an entire year had passed away there. Although there
were eleven days' journey before them before they would arrive at Kadesh-barnea,
nevertheless, lest anything should delay the people, who were naturally but too
indolent, tie stimulates them by setting before them the ease with which it
might be accomplished, telling them that they had but to lift up their feet and
advance, in order to attain the promised rest.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when the cloud was taken
up from the tabernacle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses before
informed us that the tabernacle was so distinguished by a visible miracle, that
God made it manifest that He dwelt there: not that He left heaven and removed to
that earthly house, but in order to be nigh to His people by the presence of His
power and grace, whenever He was invoked by them. He now reports another
miracle, that God, by uplifting the cloud, gave a sign, as it were, by which He
commanded them to strike the camp; and when the cloud rested on the tabernacle,
it was a sign that they should abide where they were. Here, however, a question
arises; since it has been already said that, immediately after their departure
from Egypt, the cloud was like a banner to direct the march of the people, it
follows that they were not now for the first time admonished by its being lifted
up to collect their baggage, and ordered as it were to advance. The answer is
easy, that the people were indeed previously directed by the sight of the cloud,
as we have seen; but that here a new fact is related, viz., that since the
tabernacle was set up, the cloud, which hitherto was suspended in the air and
went before the camp, now settled on the sanctuary: for a fresh acquisition of
grace is here proclaimed by the more certain and conspicuous sign, as if God
showed himself more closely and familiarly as the leader of the people.
Although, therefore, the cloud had been the director of their march from its
very commencement, yet it more fully illustrated the glory of the tabernacle
when it proceeded from thence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the commandment of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The <i>mouth </i>is here used by metonymy for the speech; nor does there
appear to me to be so much harshness in the Hebraism, but that it may be
appropriately retained. But it is asked whether God actually spoke or not; for
the word <i>mouth </i>is often repeated. It is indeed likely that Moses was
instructed but <i>once </i>what was meant by the removal or remaining of the
cloud; yet I doubt not but that the name of <i>word, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>was given to the sign, inasmuch as God speaks as much to the eyes by outward
signs as He does to the ears by His voice. Still, from this mode of expression
we may gather that the use of signs 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is perverted and nullified, unless they are taken to be visible doctrine, as
Augustin writes. The repetition, which certainly has no little force, shows how
worthy this is of observation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the children kept the charge
of the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in my opinion, extend this too far, thinking that when the cloud tarried, the
children of Israel, being as it were at leisure, employed themselves in the
worship of God; but I restrict it rather to that heedfulness which is then
praised at some length. To keep the charge <i>(custodiam,) </i>then, is
equivalent to regarding the will of God with the greatest earnestness and care.
For, when the cloud had begun to rest in any place, the people knew that they
were to remain there; but if on the next day they were not attentive, the cloud
might vanish, and thus their neglect and carelessness might deprive them of this
incomparable advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To this end it is said
immediately afterwards that, If for one day, or more, or even for a month, or a
year, the cloud stood still, the people was, as it were, tied to the spot. The
old interpreter 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
has not badly rendered it, "The children of Israel were upon the watch;" since
day and night they anxiously expected the time when God would command them to
move forward. The last verse of the chapter confirms this sense, where it is
again added, that "they kept the charge of the Lord at His mouth by the hand of
Moses:" whence it appears that Moses was God's interpreter, so that they might
set forth on their march whenever the cloud being lifted up pointed out to them
the way. Nor can it be doubted but that it preceded them; so that they might
know in what direction God would have them proceed, and whither they were to go.
Moreover, it must be observed that in both respects it is counted worthy of
praise in the people, that they should either journey, or continue where they
were, at God's command. Thus is that absurd activity condemned which engages
itself in endless work; as if men could only obey God by turmoil. Whereas it is
sometimes no less a virtue to rest, when it so pleases God.

<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus
40:36-38	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b> And when the cloud was
taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all
their journeys:	<b>36.</b> Quum recederet nubes a tabernaculo, proficiscebantur
filii Israel in cunctis profectionibus suis:
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b> But if the cloud were not taken up,
then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.	<b>37.</b> Quod si
non recederet nubes, non proficiscebantur usque ad diem qua recedebat.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b> For the cloud of the Lord was upon
the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the
house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.	<b>38.</b> Quia nubes Jehovae
erat super tabernaculum interdiu, ignis vero noctu in eo, coram oculis totius
domus Israel, in cunctis profectionibus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the cloud of the Lord was on
the tabernacle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses more distinctly
explains what he had said generally respecting the cloud, viz., that by night a
fiery column appeared, because the cloud would not have been visible amidst the
darkness. A second explanation is also added, that this did not happen once or
twice only, but "in all their journeys;" so that they were never without a sight
of the cloud, which might be a witness of God's presence, whether, being settled
on the tabernacle, it commanded them to rest, or, by its ascension, gave them
the sign for removing the camp. Now, the equability of this proceeding, in all
the variety of times and marches, did not a little conduce to certainty; for, if
the cloud had daily accomplished the same course, this very regularity would
have obscured the power' of God; but when for a whole year it did not move, and
then frequently proceeded to a new place, and now by its. guidance pointed out a
longer journey, now a shorter one, by this very diversity the paternal care of
God, who was never unmindful of His people, more conspicuously manifested
itself.</font><br></div>

unto the place of which the Lord said, I will give it you: come thou with us,

Israel.	<b>29.</b> Dixit autem Moses ad Hobab filium Reuel Madianitae soceri

mount of the Lord three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord
went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for
them.	<b>33.</b> Profecti sunt itaque a monte Jehovae via trium dierum: et arca
foederis Jehovae proficiscebatur ante eos via trium dierum illorum, ad

cloud of the Lord was upon them by day, when they went out of the

the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be
scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.	<b>35.</b> Quum autem
coepit proficisci arca, dicebat Moses, Surge Jehova, et despergantur inimici

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto Hobab the son
of Raguel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Very grossly are those
mistaken who have supposed Hobab 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, whom we have already seen to have
returned a few days after he had come to see him. Now, old age almost in a state
of decrepitude would have been but little suited for, or equal to, such
difficult labors. Moses was now eighty years old, and still far short of the age
of his father-in-law. But all doubt is removed by the fourth chapter of Judges,
where we read that the descendants of Hobab were still surviving in the land of
Canaan. When, therefore, the good old man went home, he left Hobab his son
&#8212; still in the vigor of life, and to whom on account of his neighborhood,
the desert-country was well known &#8212; as a companion for his son-in-law,
that might be useful to him in the performance of many services. Here, however,
whether wearied by delay and difficulties, or offended by the malignant and
perverse spirit of the people, or preferring his home and a stationary life to
those protracted wanderings, he desired to follow his father. In order, however,
that we might know that he had not sought his dismissal as a mere feint, (as is
often the case, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) Moses expressly states that he could not immediately prevail upon him to stay
by his prayers; nay, that he was not attracted by the promises whereby Moses
endeavored to tempt him, until he had been perseveringly entreated. Although the
expectation of the promised land is set before him, yet, since mention is only
made of temporal and transient prosperity, it may thence be probably conjectured
that he had not profited by his advantages as he should. He had seen and heard
the tokens of God's awful power when the Law was given; yet Moses urges him to
come on by no other argument than that he would enjoy the riches of the land.
Unless perhaps Moses desired to give him some taste of the graciousness and
fatherly love of God as manifested in the temporal blessing, in order to lift up
his mind to higher things. Still he merely refers to the promise of God, and
then engages that he shall share in all their good things. Nevertheless, this
alone is no trifle, that he should be attracted by no uncertain hope, but by the
sure enjoyment of those good things which God, who cannot lie, had promised: for
deceptive allurements often invite men to undergo labors, and to encounter
perils; but Moses brings forward God, as it were, as his surety, inasmuch as tie
had promised that He would give the people a fertile land, full of an abundance
of all good things. At any rate, Hobab represents to us, as in a mirror, the
innate disposition of the whole human race, to long for that which it apprehends
by the carnal sense. It is natural to prefer our country, however barren and
wretched, to other lands the most fertile and delightful: thus the Ithaca of
Ulysses has passed into a proverb. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But let me now reprove another fault, viz., that, generally speaking, all set
their affections on this present life: thus Hobab despises the promise of God,
and holds fast to the love of his native
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, Leave us not, I pray
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses perseveres and urges what he
had just said, that Hobab should be a sharer in the prosperity which God had
given his people reason to expect. <i>"To this end" </i>(he says) "thou hast
known all our stations in the desert," which words commentators do not appear to
have observed or understood; for they translate them simply, "for thou hast
known," as if Moses desired to retain Hobab to be of use to himself, whereas
there is more than one causal particle here; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and thus it is literally, <i>"Since, for this cause, </i>thou hast known all our
resting-places," etc. Its meaning, then, is as follows, that Hobab was
ill-advised for his own interest; for he had borne many inconveniences, for this
reason, that he might at sonic time or other receive his recompense; as if it
were said, Wherefore hast thou hitherto endured so many inconveniences whilst
directing our course, unless that thou mightest enjoy with us the blessings of
our repose? In a word, Moses signifies that the labors of Hobab would be vain
and fruitless, unless he should endure them a little while longer, until,
together with the children of Israel, he should enjoy the promised inheritance.
What is here said, then, does not relate to the future, as if Moses had said, Be
to us instead of eyes, as thou hast been heretofore; but by reminding him that
the reward of his labors was at hand, he urges and encourages him to
proceed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they departed from the mount
of the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He calls Sinai "the mount
of the Lord," because in no other place had God's glory been so conspicuously
manifested. This, I admit, it had been called by anticipation
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;
pro&gt;lhyin</font><font face="Palatino">)<i> </i>before the promulgation of the
law; but this name was imposed upon it afterwards to inspire eternal reverence
for the law. By "three days' journey," we must understand a continuous march of
three days, for they did not pitch their tents until they reached the desert of
Paran, but slept in the. open air. When it is said that the ark went before them
in the three days' journey, there is no reference to its distance, as if it was
sent forward three days ahead; but that it was so placed in their van that, when
the cloud settled upon it, they halted as at a station prescribed to them by
God. This was the searching for a resting-place of which he
speaks.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass, when the
ark set forward.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since their journey was
by no means a peaceful one, but the attack of enemies was constantly to be
dreaded, it was needful to beseech God that He would go forth as if prepared for
battle. Thus, too, did Moses support their courage, lest any more immediate
cause for terror should render them sluggish and inert. It is, then, as if he
had prayed thus: O Lord, not only show us the way, but open it to us also by the
power of thy hand in the destruction of the enemies. He calls them not the
enemies of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order that the Israelites might be assured that they fought under His
auspices; for thus might both a more certain victory be expected, since the
righteous God, who avenges iniquity, was defending His own cause; and also, it
was no slight matter of consolation and rejoicing, when the people heard, that
whosoever should arise to harass them unjustly were also the enemies of God,
since He will protect his people as the apple of His eye. Therefore has the
Prophet borrowed this passage, in order to arm the Church with confidence, and
to maintain it in cheerfulness under the violent assaults of its enemies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:1.) Further, the analogy and similitude between the visible sign, and the
thing signified, must be observed; for Moses was not so foolish as to address
the Ark in these words; he only asked God to prove effectually that the Ark was
a lively image of His power and
glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when it rested, he said,
Return, O Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By thus praying he also
exhorts the people to be patient, lest the weariness which arose from the delay
should beget indignation. Otherwise it would have been annoying that the time of
their journeying should be protracted, so that they would arrive the later at
their rest. And we see, indeed, how their minds were exasperated, as if a slower
progress was a kind of disappointment. In order, therefore, to correct this
impatience, Moses reminds them that their halts were advantageous to them, so
that God, dwelling at home like the father of a family, might manifest His care
of them; for the allusion is to men who Lake advantage of a time of repose and
release from other business, to occupy themselves more un-restrainedly in paying
attention to their own family.</font><br></div>

</i>The ambiguous signification of the participle

causes the translators to twist this passage into a variety of meanings. Since
the Hebrew root

aven, </i>is sometimes trouble and labor, sometimes fatigue, sometimes iniquity,
sometimes falsehood, some translate it, "The people were, as it were,
complaining or murmuring." Others (though this seems to be more beside the mark)
insert the adverb <i>unjustly; </i>as if Moses said, that their complaint was
unjust, when they expostulated with God. Others render it, "being sick,
(<i>nauseantes,</i>")<i> </i>but this savors too much of affectation; others,
"lying, or dealing treacherously." Some derive it from the root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnawt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thonah, </i>and thus explain it, "seeking occasion," which I reject as far
fetched. To me the word fainting <i>(fatiscendi) </i>seems to suit best; for
they failed, as if broken down with weariness. It is probable that no other
crime is alleged against them than that, abandoning the desire to proceed, they
fell into supineness and inactivity, which was to turn their back upon God, and
repudiate the promised inheritance. This sense will suit very well, and thus the
proper meaning of the word will be retained. Thus, Ezekiel calls by the name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynat</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>theunim, </i>those fatigues, whereby men destroy and overwhelm themselves
through undertaking too much work. Still, I do not deny that, when they lay in a
state of despondency, they uttered words of reproach against God; especially
since Moses says that this displeased the ears of God, and not His eyes; yet the
origin of the evil was, as I have stated, that they fainted with weariness, so
as to refuse to follow God any
further.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord heard
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He more plainly declares that the
people broke forth into open complaints; and it is probable that they even east
reproaches upon God, as we infer from the heaviness of this punishment. Although
some understand the word <i>fire </i>metaphorically for vengeance, it is more
correct to take it simply according to the natural meaning of the word, <i>i.e.,
</i>that a part of the camp burnt with a conflagration sent from God. Still a
question arises, what was that part or extremity of the camp which the fire
seized upon? for some think that the punishment began with the leaders
themselves, whose crime was the more atrocious. Others suppose that the fire
raged among the common people, from the midst of whom the murmuring arose. But I
rather conjecture, as in a matter of uncertainty, that God kindled the fire in
some extreme part, so as to awaken their terror, in order that there might be
room for pardon; since it is presently added, that tie was content with the
punishment of a few. It must, however, be remarked, that because the people were
conscious of their sin, the door was shut against their prayers. Hence it is,
that they cry to Moses rather than to God; and we may infer that, being devoid
of repentance and faith, they dreaded to look upon God. This is the reward of a
bad conscience, to seek for rest in our disquietude, and still to fly from God,
who alone can allay our trouble and alarm. From the fact that God is appeased at
the intercession of Moses, we gather that temporal punishment is often remitted
to the wicked, although they still remain exposed to the judgment of God. When
he says that the fire of the Lord was sunk down, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for this is the proper signification of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[q&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shakang, </i>he designates the way in which it was put out, and in which
God's mercy openly manifested itself; as also, on the other hand. it is called
the fire of God, as having been plainly kindled by Him, lest any should suppose
that it was an accidental conflagration. A name also was imposed on the place,
which might be a memorial to posterity both of the crime and its punishment; for
<i>Tabera </i>is a burning, or
combustion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the mixed multitude that
was among them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> A </i>new murmuring of the
people is here recorded: for we gather from many circumstances that this
relation is different from that which precedes: although, as evil begets evil,
it is probable that after they had begun to be affected by the disease of
impatience, they spitefully invented grounds for increased tedium and annoyance.
Yet there was something monstrous in this madness, that, when they had just been
so severely chastised, and part of' the camp was even yet almost smoking, and
when God was hardly appeased, they should have given way to the indulgence of
lust, whereby they brought upon themselves a still more severe punishment.
Unquestionably, when they again provoked God by their iniquity, the remains of
the fire were still before their eyes; whence it appears how greatly they were
blinded by their obstinate wickedness. He states, indeed, that the murmuring
first began among the strangers, or mixed multitude, who had mingled themselves
with the Israelites, as we have seen elsewhere; but he adds that the whole
people also were led into imitation of their ungodly complainings. Hence we are
taught, that the wicked and sinful should be avoided, lest they should corrupt
us by their bad example; since the contagion of vice easily spreads. At the same
time also, we are warned, that it does not at all avail to excuse us, that
others are the instigators of our sin; since it by no means profited the
Israelites, that they fell through the influence of others, inasmuch as it was
their own lust; which carried them away. In the first place, therefore, we must
beware that our corrupt desires do not tempt us, and we must put a restraint
upon ourselves; and then that the profane despisers of God do not add fuel to
the fire.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question here occurs, whether it is
sinful to long for flesh; for if so, all our appetites must. likewise be
condemned. I answer, that God was not wroth because the desire of flesh affected
the Israelites; but, first, their disobedience displeased Him, because they
longed to eat; flesh, as it were, against His will, when He would have them
content with the manna alone; and then their intemperance and violent passion.
For this reason Moses says that they "lusted a lust," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
indicating that they abandoned all self-control, so as to go beyond all bounds.
In the third place, their ingratitude displeased Him, which is here adverted to,
but openly condemned in the Psalm, where the Prophet reproves them, for that God
"had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven," so as to
supply them with the <i>"corn </i>of heaven," and the bread "of angels,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:23-25;) and yet, even so they were not restrained from despising so excellent
a benefit, and abandoning themselves to lawless intemperance. The rule of
moderation, and of a sober and frugal life, which Paul prescribes, is well
known; that we should</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"know both how to be full
and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
4:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Well known, too, is his admonition, that we
should</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"make not provision for
the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
13:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All improper longing is, therefore, to be repressed,
so that we should desire nothing which is not lawful; and, secondly, that our
appetites should not be excessive. Hence, when he refers elsewhere to this
occurrence,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:6,)he warns us to fear the judgment of God; "to the intent we
should not lust after evil things," thus distinguishing wild and uncontrolled
appetites from such as are moderate and well
regulated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When they ask, "Who shall give us
flesh to eat?" they seek to have it elsewhere than from God, who abundantly
supplied them with food, though it was of a different kind. We see, then, that
they rebelled with a brutal and blind impetuosity; for necessity was laid upon
them by God, that they should eat nothing but manna; against this they struggled
like fierce and stubborn beasts, as if they would make God the servant of their
lust.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We remember the fish which we
did eat in Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this comparison
with the former mode of living, they depreciate the present grace of God: and
yet they enumerate no delicacies, when they speak of leeks, and onions, and
garlic. Some, therefore, thus explain it, When such great abundance and variety
was commonly to be met with, how painful and grievous must it be to us to be
deprived of greater delicacies! My own opinion is, that these lowly people, who
had been used to live on humble fare, praised their accustomed food, as if they
had been the greatest luxuries. Surely rustics and artisans value as much their
pork and beef, their cheese and curds, their onions and cabbage, as most of the
rich do their sumptuous fare. Scornfully, therefore, do the Israelites magnify
things which, in themselves, are but of little value, in order the more to
stimulate their depraved appetite, already sufficiently excited. Still there is
no doubt but that those who had been accustomed to a diet of herbs and fish,
would think themselves happy with that kind of food. Moreover, to make the
matter more invidious, they say in general, that they ate <i>gratis</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of that, which cost them but little: although such a phrase is common in all
languages. For even profane writers testify that all that sea-shore abounds with
fish. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The fisheries of the Nile also are very productive, and a part: of the wealth of
Egypt: whilst the country is so well watered, that it produces abundance of
vegetables and fruits. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f17</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But now our soul is dried
away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They complain that they are almost
wasted away with famine and hunger, whilst they are abundantly supplied with
manna; in the same way as they had just been loudly declaring that they had
lived in Egypt for a very little money; as if they were affected by a great
dearth of provisions, when, by the pure liberality of God, a kind of food was
provided for them, more easy to prepare than any other, and so actually prepared
without trouble or cost. But such is the malignity and ingratitude of men, that
they count all God's bounty for nothing, whilst they are brooding over their own
importunate lusts. Many in their gluttony consume, and bring to naught whatever
God bestows upon them: others, in their avarice, dry up the fountain of His
liberality, which else would be inexhaustible. But these, in the midst of their
abundance, say that they are dry, because insatiable cupidity inflames them, so
that God's blessing, however ample, cannot satisfy them. Thus the rain, washing
the hard rock, wets it not within, neither tempers its dryness by its moisture.
Since, therefore, a contempt of God's blessings withers them all, like a hot
blast, let us learn to assign them their due honor, that they may be supplied to
us in sufficiency. Thus will be fulfilled in our
ease:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The righteous shall flourish

what could be more unseemly and intolerable than thus to eschew a food
delightful both in appearance and taste v. For the same reason the Prophet, in
Psalm 78, records that men were not satisfied with "angels' food," and "corn
from heaven." Here, instead of saying that it was white, he calls it the color
of <i>Bedola,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a precious stone, whether a pearl, or some other kind. Its very appearance,
then, was calculated to give them pleasure; and, since without much labor,
either by grinding or crushing it, they might make it into various sorts of
food, and all of a sweet and pleasant taste;. the baser was their ingratitude in
complaining, as if God treated them with but little liberality as to their
food.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Moses heard the people
weep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Wonderful indeed, and almost
prodigious was the madness of the people, thus all of them to mourn as if
reduced to the extremity of despair. What would they have done in actual famine?
what if they had to gnaw bitter roots, almost without any juice in them? What if
they had had to live on tasteless and unwholesome bread? We see, therefore, how
by the indulgence of their depraved lusts men make themselves wretched in the
very midst of prosperity. Let us, then, learn to bridle our excessive passions,
that we may not bring upon ourselves troubles and inconveniences, and all sorts
of painful feelings; for if the cause be duly weighed, when men afflict
themselves with sorrow and lamentation, we shall generally find that, whereas
the evil might be lightened by endurance, its pain is increased by preposterous
imaginations. But here a gross instance of luxury is set before us, when, in
their satiety, they weep as if long abstinence threatened them with death. It
was an effect of holy and praiseworthy zeal, that this great perverseness should
displease Moses; but he was not without error in carrying it to excess; for he
unjustly expostulates with God, complaining that He had laid too heavy a burden
upon him, when tie knew all the time that he was sustained by His power. His
charge was indeed difficult and laborious; but in that he had experienced God's
wondrous aid, whenever he had groaned beneath his burden, there was no room for
complaint; besides, since he had been dignified by a peculiar honor, it was
ungrateful to brand with disgrace the good gift of God. He reputes it his
greatest evil that the charge of governing the people had been intrusted to him;
whereas all his senses ought rather to have been ravished with astonishment,
that God had condescended to choose him to be the redeemer of His people, and
the minister of His wondrous power. This, too, was very inconsiderate, to ask
whether he had begotten or brought forth the people; as if his calling by God
did not lay him sufficiently under obligation, or as if there were no other ties
than those of nature. God, indeed, has inspired parents with such love towards
their offspring, that they willingly undergo incredible troubles on their
account; but Moses was bound by another kind of piety, for by God's command he
was father of the people. Wherefore he ought not to have only regarded nature,
but the obligation of his office
also.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whence should I have flesh to
give to all this people?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Justly, indeed,
does he accuse the people, and deny that he is possessed of flesh wherewith to
satisfy so great a multitude; but he is wrong in expostulating with God, as if
he were burdened beyond his strength; for, since God knew that he was unequal to
so many difficulties, He supported him by the influence of His Spirit. But he
sinned most grossly in the conclusion of his complaint, requesting God to kill
him. In these words we see how far even the best of God's servants may be
carried, when they give too great indulgence to their passions. For it is the
longing of despair to seek that we may be removed from the world, so that death
may bring our troubles to an end. Since the impetuosity of his grief hurried
away Moses God's most chosen servant to this, what might not happen to us, if
impatience should hold dominion over our hearts? Let us, then, learn to put a
stop to this disease in good time.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto Moses,
Gather unto me seventy men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God complies
with the request of Moses, by associating with him seventy companions, by whose
care and assistance he may be relieved from some part of his labor; yet not
without some signs of indignation, for, by taking from him some portion of His
Spirit to distribute amongst the others, He inflicts upon him that mark of
disgrace which he deserved. I know that some 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
regard it differently, and think that nothing was taken away from Moses, but
that the others were endued with new grace, such as Moses had been preeminent
for possessing alone before. But, since the words expressly declare that God
will make them partakers of that grace which He will take from Moses himself, I
by no means admit the truth of this subtle exposition. The passage in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
27:36 is quoted, in which it is said, "Hast thou not reserved a blessing for
me?" but, when God expressly says, "I will separate 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the Spirit which is upon thee," there can be no question but that a
diminution is indicated. For, as long as Moses alone was appointed to rule the
people, he was so supplied with the necessary gifts of the Spirit, as that his
ability should not be inferior to the greatness of the labor. God now promises
that the others shall be his companions in such sort, as that He divides His
gifts among them all. I have no doubt, then, but that this division comprehends
punishment in it; and from hence we may gather a useful piece of instruction,
viz., that the greater the difficulty is which God imposes upon any one, the
greater is the liberality with which He treats him, in order that he may be
sufficient for his charge. Thus it is in His power to work with equal efficiency
by one man, as by a hundred, or a thousand; for He has no need of a multitude
(of agents,) but, as He pleases, He executes His works sometimes without the aid
of men, sometimes by their hands. In sum, God indirectly reproves the gross
ingratitude of Moses, whereby he depreciated that marvelous grace which had
hitherto shone forth in him; and He declares that he shall not be hereafter so
great as he was, in regard to the <i>excellency </i>he derived from the Spirit;
inasmuch as he had in a manner thrown away the gifts of the Spirit, by refusing
to bear the trouble imposed upon him. Our modesty, indeed, is praiseworthy, if
through consciousness of our own weakness we recoil from arduous charges; but it
is too absurd for us to withdraw ourselves under this pretext from our duty,
and, despising the calling of God, to shake off the
yoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word Spirit is here, as frequently
elsewhere, applied to the gifts themselves; as if He had said, I had deposited
with thee gifts sufficing for the government of the people; but now, since thou
refusest, I will distribute his due measure to each of the seventy, so that the
grace of the Spirit, which dwelt in thee alone, shall be manifestly dispersed
among many. It is now asked how Moses separated the seventy, whether according
to his own judgment only, or by the election of the people. It is generally
agreed that six were chosen from each tribe, and thus that they were
seventy-two; but that for the sake of brevity two were omitted, as amongst the
Romans, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they spoke of the <i>Centumviri, </i>although they were a hundred and five; for
they appointed three for each of the thirty-five tribes. Since the opinion is
probable, I leave it undecided; but at the same time I retain the conjecture
which I have elsewhere made, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f23</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
viz., that, since the race of Abraham had been increased in an incredible manner
in two hundred and twenty years, lest so astonishing a miracle should ever be
forgotten, the seventy were elected in accordance with the number of the fathers
who had gone down into Egypt with Jacob. And, in fact, this seems to have been
with them, as it were, a sacred number; as recalling to their memory that little
band from which they had derived their origin. For, before the Law was
promulgated, Moses was commanded to take with him seventy to accompany him to
the mount, and to be eye-witnesses of God's glory. Meanwhile, I do not deny that
there were two more than the number seventy; but I only point out why God fixed
upon this number, viz., to equalize the leaders and heads of the people with the
family of Jacob, which was the source of their race and name. In truth, from the
fact that, when Hoses went up into Mount Sinai to receive the Tables from the
hand of God, he took with him seventy officers, we infer that <i>the </i>number
of those who should excel in honor, was already fixed at this, although the
charge of governing, which is here spoken of, was not yet committed to them. And
it is probable that these same persons who had been appointed leaders, were
called to this new and unwonted office, as the words themselves imply. It is
indeed certain, that when the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity,
because they were not permitted to appoint a king, they followed the example
here set them in the establishment of their Sanhedrim; only this honor was paid
to the memory of David and their rings, that from their race they chose their
seventy rulers in whom the supreme power was vested. And this form of government
continued down to Herod, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who abolished the whole council by which he had been condemned, and destroyed
the lives of them all. Still, I think that he was not impelled to commit the
massacre only out of vengeance, but also lest the dignity of the royal race
should be an obstacle to his tyranny.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It must,
however, be observed that, although God promises new grace to the seventy men,
he would not have them taken indiscriminately from the people in general, but
expressly commands them to be chosen from the order of the elders, and heads of
the people, being such as were already possessed of authority, and had given
proofs of their diligence and virtue. Thus, also, now-a-days, when he calls both
the pastors of the Church and magistrates to their office, although He furnishes
them with new gifts, still He would not have them raised to their honorable
stations promiscuously as they may come first, but chooses rather with reference
to their spiritual endowments, wherewith He distinguishes, and commends those
whom He has destined to any exalted office. In short, He commands the most
fitting to be chosen; but, after they have been elected, tie promises that He
will add what is wanting. For this reason He commands that they should station
themselves at the door of the tabernacle, that He may there display His grace.
Although I think that two other reasons were likewise taken into consideration,
viz., that they might know that the office was intrusted to them by God, and
might always be mindful of the heavenly tribunal, before which they must be
accountable: and also that they might be held in additional reverence by the
very associations of the place, and that the people might submit to them as the
ministers of God. Now, although God does not at present dwell in a visible
tabernacle, yet are we reminded by this example that pastors and magistrates are
not duly ordained, unless they are placed in the presence of God; nor rightly
inaugurated in their offices, unless when they consecrate themselves to God
Himself, and when His majesty, on the other hand, acquires their reverence.

kadesh, </i>signifies to <i>prepare, </i>yet its literal meaning seems to be
most appropriate here; I have therefore retained the word <i>sanctify, </i>which
is, however, here used ironically, for Moses does not exhort: them to purge
themselves from all defilement's, and piously and sincerely to receive the grace
of God, but he chastises their profane and brutal gluttony. Others translate it
simply, as if it were said, Whet your teeth, and make ready your bellies: but,
in my judgment, there is a reproof implied, because they are polluted by a foul
and wicked desire, so as to be incapable of receiving God's paternal favor: for
"ye shall eat flesh" follows, "because your weeping and complaining has reached
the ears of God;" by which words he signifies that by their importunate cries
they had provoked God's anger, so that they should devour none but deadly food.
And soon afterwards it is stated more clearly that by their insolence they had
deserved to be destroyed by the bounty of God. For "a whole month," he says, ye
shall gormandize, "till it come out of your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto
you." Thus he compares them to those guttlers who so overwhelm themselves with
gluttony, that they are obliged soon afterwards to vomit what they have eaten
too greedily, or who abominate the taste of their superfluous luxuries, as if
they were something filthy. This is what is meant by to "come out," or to be
blown out, "at the nostrils."

<i>tzara, </i>which we have translated <i>abomination, </i>properly means

out, like something unfit to be swallowed. If any should object that it is said
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:30, "They were not yet estranged from their lust:" this is easily solved by
understanding that their unrestrained gluttony is there rebuked, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if he called them guttlers <i>(gurgites,) </i>whom no abundance can suffice
to satisfy. Therefore the Prophet says, that although they were bursting with
excess, they were not satiated; but were so inflamed by their boundless
voracity, that God's vengeance could alone repress it. But the reason alleged
for this is especially to be observed, "because they had rejected God, who was
in the midst of them." By these words, the excuse of error or inadvertency is
barred; for if, for the purpose of proving their patience God had withdrawn His
power, the terror which they conceived at His absence might, perhaps, have been
excusable; but now, when they knew by sure experience that their means of
subsistence were supplied by Him, they betray their deliberate wickedness by
despising His present beneficence. For that God was in the midst of them is
equivalent to His giving manifest tokens both of His infinite power and His
paternal favor. These words show us that the more immediately God manifests His
grace to us, the more inexcusable we are, if we disparage it when it is thus
liberally offered to us. What follows might appear not to deserve severe
reproof, viz., that they "wept before God;" but the enormity of the sin is
specified directly afterwards, <i>i.e. </i>that they were vexed by their
departure from Egypt: for this was not merely to repudiate the deliverance,
which they had so greatly longed for, but to quarrel with God, because He had
listened to their cry, and had condescended to redeem them from their wretched
and lost estate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, The people among
whom I am, are six hundred thousand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Although Moses' object was right, yet he fell into unbelief, and thus
stumbled at the very threshold. His pious solicitude indeed impelled him to
doubt; because he feared that God's holy name would be exposed to derision and
contumely, if he should send away empty those to whom he had promised food. But
it seemed to him incredible that so mighty a multitude should be sufficiently
supplied with flesh. When he calls them "six hundred thousand," he either does
not calculate their numbers exactly, or indicates that some had died since their
departure, when he had numbered the people. (Exodus 14.) Yet it is probable that
he referred to the recent <i>census, </i>in which they were found to be 603,550,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;040146&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
1:46;) but for the sake of brevity he put the sum in the gross, as he does
elsewhere, omitting the 3550.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:37.) By speaking of foot-<i>men, </i>he means the men, and thus excepts the
women and. children. Assuredly such a multitude might astonish him, or, at any
rate, might inspire him with alarm, so that he should mistrust the promise. His
doubt, however, was wrong in two respects; first, because he did not simply
trust, as if he were not assured that God was true in all His words; and,
secondly, because he improperly allowed his mind to measure God's inestimable
power by his own senses. Let us learn, therefore, that, as soon as God has
spoken, we should embrace, without discussion, whatever has proceeded out of His
mouth; and so likewise let us learn to humble ourselves, and our own minds, and
at the same time to rise by faith above the world, and our natural reason; so
that no absurdity, which the flesh may suggest to us, should prevent us from
certainly concluding that whatever God has promised He will, by His might,
perform. For it is a most incorrect calculation to bind down God's doings to
ordinary standards; as if His power were not more extensive than our minds can
reach. We must, therefore, carefully take notice of the rebuke, whereby God so
corrected Moses at once, that it ought to prevent and to <i>cure </i>all
diseases of distrust in us. For the immensity of God's hand convicts the folly
of those who would subject it to their own imaginations and rules. For, even
although God should not stretch forth His hand, He holds heaven and earth in its
"hollow," as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:12. What madness, then, is it to seek to grasp by our own senses, and, as it
were, to imprison that hand which is greater than a hundred worlds! As soon,
therefore, as distrust on the score of difficulties begins to take possession of
our minds, let this conclusion be remembered, that the promises of God do not
exceed the measure of His power to accomplish effectually whatever He has
declared. This question, however, "Is the Lord's hand waxed short?"<i> </i>may
be explained in two ways: for the old interpreter 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
has rendered it, "Is God's hand weak?" But God seems to adduce the proof,
whereby He had borne witness to His power, not only in the creation of heaven
and earth, but also in so many recent miracles; as if to rebuke the ingratitude
of Moses, who had profited so little by these most striking lessons: for Isaiah
uses the same word in this sense, where he says: "Behold, the Lord's hand is not
shortened."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
59:1.) Moses is unquestionably exalting the blessings received on former
occasions, wherein the people had experienced the saving power of God. I have
retained the future tense of the verb, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
since it does not injure the sense. What is said amounts to this, Will God's
hand be weaker than usual, so as not to put forth its power already
known?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses went out and told the
people the words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We here see how
greatly Moses profited by his brief rebuke, for he now actively sets about what
he was commanded. Doubt had given him a check, so that he stopped in the middle
of his course; whereas he now testifies by the promptitude of his obedience that
his distrust is overcome. For just as unbelief discourages men, so that they
sink down into inactivity, so faith inspires both body and mind with rigor for
the effectual discharge of their
duties.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although the narrative does not
expressly state that he spoke to them respecting the flesh, it declares in
general terms that he omitted nothing; and, indeed, it would have been very
inappropriate to speak only of the Seventy Elders, when the origin of all the
evil had been the craving for flesh. Briefly stating, then, that he had reported
the commands of God to the people, he includes both parts of the matter, the
second of which he then follows up. And, first, he says that the elders were
called to the Tabernacle, that they might there be appointed rulers and
officers. When be states that they were "set round about," I do not interpret
the words so precisely as to suppose that eighteen were ranged on each side,
and, of the rest, half were placed before the court, and half behind the
Tabernacle; but that they were so arranged, as to surround some part of the
Tabernacle. Now, this was equivalent to their being set before God, so that they
might hereafter exercise their office with more authority, as being sent by Him;
and at the same time that they might devote themselves to God, and dedicate
themselves to His service; and also, that being invested with the necessary
endowments, they might bear the tokens of their calling. For this reason, it is
soon afterwards added, that enough of the spirit of Moses was given them for the
discharge of their official duties; for, although Moses by God's command had
chosen men of approved virtue and experience, yet He would have them prepared
anew, in order that their call might be effectual. When they are said to have
"prophesied," this was a visible sign of the gift of the Spirit, which,
nevertheless, had reference to a different object; for they were not appointed
to be. prophets, though God would testify by this outward mark that they were
new men, in order that the people might receive them with greater reverence. In
my opinion, however, prophecy here is equivalent to a special faculty of
discoursing magnificently of <i>secret </i>things or mysteries. We know that
poets were called prophets by profane writers, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f31</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because poetry itself savors of inspiration
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejnqousiasmo&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">);<i>
</i>in the same way that extraordinary ability,   
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in which the <i>afflatus </i>of the Spirit shone forth, obtained the name of
prophecy. Thus, the gift of prophecy in Saul was a kind of mark of royalty; so
that he might not ascend the throne without credentials.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 10:10.) Thus, then, this Spirit of Prophecy was only accorded to these
persons for a short time; since it was sufficient that they should be once
marked out by God: for so I understand what Moses says afterwards, "and they
added not." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is too forced an interpretation to refer it, as some do, to the past. I
confess, indeed, that they were not previously prophets; but I have no doubt but
that Moses here indicates that the gift was a temporary one: as we are also told
in the case of Saul: for, as soon as this token of God's grace had manifested
itself in him, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f34</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he ceased to prophesy. The meaning, therefore, is that their call was thus
substantiated for a short period, so that this unusual circumstance should
awaken the more admiration.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But there remained two of the men
in the camp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not certain why they
had not appeared amongst the others. I do not at all doubt but that they were
called for by Moses; nor would they have been endued with the same grace of the
Spirit as the others, if through idleness or contempt they had not come at the
time appointed. We may, therefore, probably infer that they did not actually
receive the invitation, because they could not be found; and hence it arose that
God excused their ignorance. Still, however, it must be observed that they were
kept back by the secret counsel of God, that His grace might be made known by
this illustrious proof amongst the common people in general, when they were not
all eye-witnesses of it: for the greater portion of them had not assembled at
the Tabernacle. In order, therefore, that its fame might spread more widely, and
might reach even to the most lowly, God chose that this new and extraordinary
gift of His Spirit should be conspicuous in the midst of the camp, lest any of
the dullest and grossest among them should pretend to be ignorant of it. In
fact, it is plain that they were all aroused by the miracle; for the "young
man," who is spoken of, would not have run to bear the incredible news to Moses,
unless struck by the novelty of the
case.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua the son of Nun, the
servant of Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is obvious that
this foolish and preposterous jealousy arose from a good source. Joshua saw that
Moses was so preeminent above all others, as to be justly deemed, after God, the
head of the people; he feared, therefore, lest, if any portion of his
superiority should be withdrawn, the grace of God would be dispelled and lost.
We know, too, that almost every change is injurious, and apt to give a shock to
public affairs. In asserting, then, the rights of Moses, he desired, as far as
he could, to consult the welfare of all; but the excess of his zeal had some
alloy in it, in consequence of the immoderate affection and love which he bore
to Moses; just as it often happens to ourselves, that although our desires have
a right object, they still go astray into erroneous feelings. So, then, let us
learn to revere the most illustrious servants of Christ, as that God alone
should be supreme; and that He, who is far above all, should still maintain His
pre-eminence. And this will be the case, if we hold fast to the principle, that
although "there are diversities of gifts," yet there is but one Spirit from whom
they flow; and although there are "differences of administrations,"<i> </i>yet
but one Lord who must be served,

be mine and not yours to grieve and grudge; but I think Moses spoke more simply,
as if he had said, Behold, how differently I feel from you; for I, whose cause
you suppose yourselves to be promoting, should desire that all were endowed with
the spirit of prophecy. So was that foolish jealousy admirably rebuked, which
would put a restraint upon God's blessing, so greatly to be desired by every
pious mind. At the same time, we fully perceive the gentleness and humility of
Moses, whom no ambition, nor consideration of his personal dignity, prevents
from willingly admitting the very lowliest into companionship with himself. If
any should object that it is God's pleasure, in order to enhance the excellency
of the gift, that there should be but few prophets in the Church, and
consequently that Moses inconsiderately sought for that, which is in repugnance
to God's counsel in this matter, the reply is easy, that, al &#8212; though the
saints acquiesce in His ordinary dispensations, and are persuaded that the
arrangement, which He makes, is the best, yet that it is an act of piety in them
to desire to communicate with all others what is given to themselves, so as to
be anxious rather to be last of all, than to begrudge perfection to their
brethren. In sum, Moses declares that nothing would be more gratifying to him,
than that God should diffuse the grace of the spirit of prophecy amongst the
whole people, so that all should be partakers of it, from the least to the
greatest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses gat him into the
camp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although, after the appointment of
the Seventy, all betook themselves to their own stations and dwelling-places,
yet there is no doubt but that they were all forewarned of the approaching
miracle, so as to be universally attentive to the event, which is presently
related. When it is said that it was "a wind of the Lord" which brought the
quails, there was no other reason for this than that God might openly manifest
that all things under heaven are subject to His dominion, and are ready to obey
Him. He might, indeed, have created the quails at will <i>(nutu,) </i>just as He
rained the manna from heaven; nor was it natural that by the force of the winds
such an abundance of birds should be east, and heaped together in one place; but
by using the aid of the wind He confirmed what is written in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:3, 4, that "He maketh the winds his messengers 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f35</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and they bear him on their wings;" because in their swiftness they rapidly bear
His commandments from the east to the west. Now, although it is true in the
abstract that the winds come from Him, so that they are only His breath, and
that the air cannot be stirred in the slightest degree except at His will, still
an extraordinary miracle is here specified, as before in the passage of the Red
Sea. The Prophet in the Psalm goes further:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He caused an east wind
to blow in the heaven; and by his power he brought in the south wind,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
78:26,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">in which words He signifies that the whole air was
shaken, since the winds suddenly arose from different quarters, which covered
the earth in all directions with an immense multitude of the
birds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says that the earth was filled
"as it were a day's journey," I do not understand it as if the dead birds lay at
so great a distance, but that they occupied such a space of ground in thick
heaps, and, in fact, continuously. And this also we gather from the Psalm, where
the Prophet says, that they fell "in the midst of their camp," and were carried
to their tents round about.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:28.) What is added, as to their being "two cubits high," I do not interpret,
as some do, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they did not fly above two cubits from the ground, so as to be more easily
taken with the hand; but that there was such a mass of them, that every one
might carry away as much as he would. For to this also do those magnificent
descriptions in the Psalm relate, whereby the miracle is
extolled:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He rained flesh also
upon them as dust, and leathered fowls, like as the sand of the sea."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197827&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
78:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how "they spread them abroad &#8212; round
about," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is not very clear to me; unless, perhaps, they were placed in cages or coops,
and daily taken out for food.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while the flesh was yet
between their teeth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses does not
specify any particular day; but only that God did not wait till satiety had
produced disgust, but inflicted the punishment in the midst of their greediness.
We may, however, conjecture from what precedes, that time was given them to
gorge themselves. From whence their insatiable voracity may <i>be </i>gathered,
which prevailed for so many continuous days, and could not be appeased by any
quantity of food. God, therefore, allowed them time abundantly sufficient for
them to gorge themselves, unless their gluttony was prodigious: and yet punished
their intemperance, while the meat was <i>yet </i>in their mouths. They were,
then, suddenly surprised in the midst of their guttling; and hence it is said in
the Psalm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:30,) "they were not <i>yet </i>estranged from their lust;" just as any
glutton might choke himself, by devouring more than his throat could hold. Nor
is that at variance with their repletion, of which mention was lately made; for,
however the belly may swell with the quantity of its contents, the furious lust
of eating is never appeased. But, in order that their punishment might be more
manifest, God inflicted it in the very act; nor could any better opportunity
have been chosen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he called the name of
that place Kibroth-hattaavah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was
requisite that some memorial of so great a sin should exist, that the sons might
not imitate their fathers. Heretofore God had sustained them with a food both
agreeable and wholesome: by longing for unlawful nourishment they were their own
poisoners and murderers. Now, such ingratitude was deservedly to be detested by
their posterity; and therefore the name was given to the place, not without the
inspiration of the Spirit of God. So Paul reminds us, that in this narrative
God's judgment against corrupt and vicious lusts was portrayed, that we might
ourselves learn not to lust.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Miriam and Aaron spoke
against Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This relation is
especially worthy of observation for many reasons. If Aaron and Miriam had
always quietly and cordially supported the honor of their brother, and had not
been carried away by perverse and ungodly jealousy, their harmony, however holy
it was, would have been perverted by the injustice of many, and alleged against
them as a deceitful and insidious conspiracy. It came to pass, then, in the
wonderful providence of God, that his own brother and sister set on foot a
contention with respect to the supremacy, and endeavored to degrade Moses from
the position in which God had placed him: for thus all suspicion of family favor
was removed, and it was clearly shown that Moses, being opposed by his own
belongings, was sustained by the power of God alone. At the same time it may be
perceived how natural is ambition to the minds of almost all men, and also how
blind and furious is the lust of dominion. Aaron and Miriam contend with their
own brother for the supremacy; and yet they had received the most abundant
proofs, that lie, whom they desire to overthrow, had been elevated by the hand
of God, and was thus maintained in his position. For Moses had arrogated nothing
to himself; and, therefore, it was not allowable that man should attempt to
undermine the dignity of that high office, which God had conferred upon him.
Besides, God had ennobled their own house and name in the person of Moses, and
out of favor to him they had also been endued with peculiar gifts of their own.
For by what right had Miriam obtained the gift of prophecy, except for the
fuller ratification of her brother's power? But the arrogance and ingratitude of
Aaron was still more disgraceful. He had been by his brother associated with
himself: Moses had allowed the high-priesthood to be transferred to him and his
descendants, and rims had placed his own in subjection to them. What, then, was
there for Aaron to begrudge his brother; when so exalted a dignity was vested in
his own sons, whilst all the race of Moses was degraded? Still he was so blinded
as to deem the honor of his brother a reproach to himself; at any rate, he could
not endure to be second to him in dignity, although he was his superior in right
of the priesthood. By this example, then, we are taught how anxiously we should
beware of so baneful a plague (as ambition). The wicked brother 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the tragic Poet says: &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"For, if injustice
must at all be
done,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>'Tis best to do
it for dominion;"</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that, under this pretext, he might through treachery
and murder proceed against his own blood with impunity. Now, although we all
hold this sentiment in detestation, still it plainly shows that, when the lust
for rule takes possession of men's hearts, not only do they abandon the love of
justice, but that humanity becomes altogether extinct in them, since brothers
thus contend with each other, and rage, as it were, against their own bowels.
Indeed it is astonishing that, when this vice has been so often and so severely
condemned in the opinion of all ages, the human race has not been ever freed
from it; nay, that the Church of God has always been infested by this disease,
than which none is worse: for ambition has been, and still is, the mother of all
errors, of all disturbances and sects. Since Aaron and his sister were infected
by it, how easily may it overspread the multitude! But I now proceed to examine
the words.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Miriam is here put before Aaron, not
by way of honorable distinction, but because she stirred up the strife, and
persuaded her brother to take her side; for the ambition of the female sex is
wonderful; and often have women, more high-spirited than men, been the
instigators not merely of squabbles, but of mighty wars, so that great cities
and countries have been shaken by their violent conduct. Still. however, this
does not diminish the guilt of Aaron, who, at the instance of his foolish
sister, engaged in an unjust and wicked contest with his brother, and even
declared himself an enemy to God's grace. Further, because they were unable to
allege any grounds, upon which Moses in himself was not far their superior, they
seek to bring disgrace upon him on account of his wife; as if in half of himself
he was inferior to them, because he had married a woman who was not of their own
race, but a foreigner. They, therefore, cast ignominious aspersions upon him in
the person of his wife, as if it were not at all becoming that he should be
accounted the prince and head of the people, since his wife, and the companion
of his bed, was a Gentile woman. I do not by any means agree with those who
think that she was any other than Zipporah, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
since we hear nothing of the death of Zipporah, nay, she had been brought back
by Jethro, her father, only a little while before the delivery of the Law;
whilst it is too absurd to charge the holy Prophet with the reproach of
polygamy. Besides, as an octogenarian, he would have been but little suited for
a second marriage. Again, how would such a marriage have been practicable in the
desert? It is, therefore, sufficiently clear that they refer to Zipporah, who is
called an Ethiopian woman, because the Scripture comprehends the Midianites
under this name: although I have no doubt but that they maliciously selected
this name, for the purpose of awakening greater odium against Moses. I
designedly forbear from adducing the frivolous glosses in which some indulge. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f40</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses, however, acknowledges that it 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f41</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was not accorded to him to have a wife of the holy race of
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they said, Hath the Lord
indeed spoken only by Moses?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They pride
themselves on their gift of prophecy, which ought rather to have schooled them
to humility. But such is the natural depravity of men, not only to abuse the
gifts of God unto contempt of their brethren, but so to magnify them by their
ungodly and sacrilegious boasting, as to obscure the glory of their Author.
Miriam and Aaron had received the spirit of prophecy, in order that the grace of
God might shine forth in them; but from thence they raise up clouds to throw
darkness upon the light, which was far brighter in Moses. They boast themselves
to be prophets; why, then, do they not consider that there was no ground for
glorying in this, inasmuch as that, which had been gratuitously bestowed upon
them by God, was not their own? Again, why do they not correctly estimate their
own insignificance in comparison with the excellency of Moses, so as, by
willingly yielding to him, to show that they set at its proper value what God
had respectively conferred upon them? Lest, then, the knowledge of those graces
which God has intrusted to us, should puff us up with pride and presumption, let
us remember that the more each of us has received, the greater obligations are
we under to God and our brethren; and let us also reflect how much is wanting,
in us, and how much, too, God has conferred on others, so as to prefer to
ourselves those whom God has designed to
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the man Moses was very
meek.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This parenthesis is inserted, in
order that we might perceive that God was not moved by any complaint of Moses,
to be so greatly wroth with Aaron and Miriam. It is said that "the Lord heard,"
that is to say, to undertake the cause in His character of Judge: and it is now
added, that He spontaneously summoned the criminals to His tribunal, though no
accuser requested that justice should be done him. For this is the, tendency of
the eulogium of his meekness, as if Moses had said that he submitted in silence
to the wrong, because, in his meekness, he imposed patience on himself.
Moreover, he, does not praise his own Virtue for the sake of boasting, but in
order to exhort us by his example, and, if it should be our lot to be treated
with indignity, quietly and calmly to wait for the judgment of God. For whence
does it come that, when any one has injured us, our indignation carries away our
feelings in all directions, and our pain boils up without measure, except
because we do not think that our ills are regarded by God until we have made
loud and boisterous complaints? This passage, then, teaches us that although the
good and gentle refrain from reproaches and accusations, God nevertheless keeps
watch for them, and, whilst they are silent, the wickedness of the ungodly cries
out to, and is heard by, God. Again, the silence of long-suffering itself is
more effectual before God than any cries, however loud. But if God does not
immediately proceed to execute vengeance, we must bear in mind what is written
elsewhere, that <i>the blood </i>of Abel <i>cried out </i>after his death, that
the murder which Cain had committed might not be unpunished.

haughtiness; for forgetfulness of God had overspread their minds, when they
began to be so insolent before men. They are, therefore, brought back to the
presence of God, from which all their senses had turned away, in order that they
at length might learn to revere Moses, whose cause is upheld by God. God
commands them to "hear His words," because they would never have dared to murmur
against Moses if they had reflected on the account they would have to give. God,
therefore, claims their attention, that they may learn to recollect themselves,
and to awaken from the senselessness of their presumption. Moreover, they are
separated from Moses, that they may confess their inferiority, and be ashamed of
their temerity in daring to compare themselves with
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>

the truth of His word <i>(oraculi) </i>to the eyes and all the senses. Thus has
God often appeared to His servants, so that His majesty might be inscribed upon
His addresses to them. Before the giving of the Law such visions were frequently
vouchsafed to the Patriarchs; whilst sometimes they were instructed by dreams.
Thus Joel, when he promises that under the kingdom of Christ there shall be a
complete fullness of all revelations, also enumerates these two forms of
them,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Your sons (he says) and your

the kingdom of Christ under the likeness of their own times: when, therefore,
God sets forth these two ordinary modes of revelation, he withdraws Moses from
the condition of others, as if to exalt him by a special privilege. Now, since
Aaron and Miriam were not superior to others, they were thus reminded that they
were far behind Moses in rank. With this view he is said to be "faithful in all
God's house;" in quoting which passage in order to prove his inferiority to
Christ, the Apostle says he was <i>a servant, </i>and a member of the Church,
whereas Christ was its Lord and builder, or creator.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
3:2-6.) But the difference between them is more clearly specified immediately
afterwards, viz., that God speaks to him "mouth to mouth," by which expression,
as I have said elsewhere, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
more intimate and familiar communication is denoted. Still God does not thus
deprive the prophets of anything which is requisite for the discharge of their
office; but merely establishes Moses as the chief of them all. It is true,
indeed, that the Patriarchs are so ranked, as Abraham was called a prophet by
the mouth of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

105:15; but still God at the same time includes the whole dispensation, which He
afterwards chose to employ under the Law; and so prefers Moses to all who were
hereafter to arise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Further, the word <i>vision
</i>is used in a different sense from that which it had just above; for God,
distinguishing Moses from others, says that He speaks with him <i>in vision,</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

which He contrasts with "dark speeches <i>(aenigmata) </i>and similitude," which
word is equivalent to a representation <i>(figura,) </i>if the negative be
referred to both. For there are some who take similitude for a lively and
express image; as if God should assert that He reveals His face to Moses; and
therefore read the clause <i>adversatively, </i>as I have given it in the
margin. But the former reading is the most
natural.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have elsewhere treated of dreams and
visions. It will then be sufficient to give the sum in one word, namely, that
they were seals for the confirmation of prophecies; so that the Prophets, as if
sent from heaven, might with full confidence declare themselves to be God's
lawful interpreters. For visions had their own peculiar marks, to distinguish
them from phantoms and false imaginations; and dreams also were accompanied by
their signs, in order to remove all doubt of their authenticity. The prophets,
therefore, were fully conscious of their vocation, so that nothing was wanting
to the assurance of faith. Meanwhile, the false prophets dressed themselves up
in these masks to deceive. Thus Jeremiah, in refutation of their ungodly
<i>pretences, </i>says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The
prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let
him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
23:28.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the anger of the Lord was
kindled against them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The expostulation
is succeeded by punishment. God's departure was a sign of immediate
condemnation; because there was no need of any further questioning, as
concerning some matter of obscurity. After God, then, had convicted them of
their sin, and had inveighed in a severe and stern reprehension against the
ingratitude of Miriam and Aaron, He first pronounced their sentence, and then
suddenly withdrew. What follows, that "the cloud departed," is added in
explanation; for God, who fills all things, never moves from His place; but His
name is applied metaphorically to the cloud, which was the symbol of His absence
or presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The nature of the punishment which
was inflicted upon Miriam was very appropriate to the offence. The foolish
woman, puffed up with pride, had coveted more than was lawful; and her ignominy
was the just reward of her arrogance, according to the declaration of Christ,
"Every one that exalteth himself shall be abased."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
18:14.) Let us understand, then, that in proportion as the proud are led away by
their ambition to long for unlawful honors, they bring upon themselves nothing
but disgrace; and although they may gloriously triumph for a season, still, it
cannot be but that their glory will at length be turned into disgrace. For
inasmuch as all who exalt themselves wage war with God, He must needs encounter
them with the awful power of His hand, in order to restrain their madness. Now,
whosoever are moved by envy to enter into contention with His servants,
endeavor, as hr as in them lies, to overthrow His glory by obscuring the gifts
of the Spirit. No wonder, then, that God should avenge the insult offered to
Himself, and should repay them with the infamy they deserve; as it is
written,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Miriam desired to be equal with her brother, whom God
had exalted above all others; what she attains is, that she should not occupy
the extremist corner of the people, but be cut off from companionship with
mankind. A similar instance occurred in the case of king Uzziah, who, not
contented with the royal dignity, when he had unlawfully attempted to make an
incense-offering, was also smitten with leprosy, so as to be no longer suffered
to continue in association even with the common people.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 26:16-21.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, however, the
question arises, why, when Aaron participated in the guilt, he was exempted from
the punishment? If no reason existed, still we should have to adore the judgment
of God; for it is not our business to complain, when He has mercy upon whom He
will have mercy, nevertheless, it appears probable that God's wrath was more
exceedingly kindled against Miriam, because she had applied the torch to the
ungodly contention, and had inflamed her brother's mind, as we see at the
beginning of the chapter. It was just, then, that the blame should rest on her,
since she had been the origin of the evil. I imagine, however, that in sparing
Aaron, He had regard to the priesthood, inasmuch as, in his person, it would
have been subjected almost to eternal disgrace. Since, therefore, Aaron was an
image of God's only-begotten Son and our only Mediator, and this great dignity
had recently had its commencement in him, it was of exceeding importance that he
should be exempted from such infamy, lest any diminution of the reverence due to
religion should arise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Aaron said unto Moses,
Alas! my lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although Aaron was aware
that, through God's indulgence, his own punishment was remitted, still he does
not cease to consider what he had deserved. For we ought not to wait until God
smites ourselves, but since in chastising others He invites us to repentance,
although He may spare ourselves, we should profit betimes by their punishments.
The disfigurement, therefore, of his sister, alarmed and terrified Aaron, so
that, examining his own condition, he acknowledged himself to be deserving of a
similar judgment. His humble prayer manifests that those high aspirations were
subdued, which had carried him away into unholy jealousy. Moses, who was younger
than himself, and whose superiority he just before could not endure, tie now
calls his <i>lord, </i>and confesses himself to be subject to his authority and
power. Thus the dread of punishment was the best medicine to cure his disease of
ambition. In beseeching Moses not to impute his sin to him, he does not usurp
for mortal man a right which God by Isaiah claims for Himself alone; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but inasmuch as Moses had been injured, he asks his pardon, lest by his
accusation he should be brought before the divine tribunal. Where he confesses
his own and his sister's foolishness, he does not extenuate the grossness of his
crime, as most people do, when they generally seek to cover their transgressions
under the plea of error or thoughtlessness; but it is precisely as if he had
said that they were senseless, and out of their minds, as we gather from the
next clause, in which he plainly acknowledges their
criminality.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the comparison which he
introduces, it is evident that the leprosy of Miriam was of no ordinary kind,
for nothing can be more disgusting than the dead body of any abortive <i>foetus,
</i>corrupt with purulence and decay.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses cried unto the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The event now proves, what was
recently asserted, that Moses was of a meek and gentle disposition beyond all
other men; for he is not only ready at once to forgive, but also intercedes with
God for them. And thus the presumption of Miriam is best reproved; for the only
hope of safety that remains to her is in the dignity of Moses, which of late she
could not endure.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From the reply of God, it is
manifest that the punishment which she alone had received was intended for the
instruction of all. The pride and temerity of Miriam were sufficiently
chastised, but God wished it to be a lesson for all, that every one should
confine himself to his own bounds. Meanwhile, let us learn from this passage to
pay due honor to the judgments of God, so that they may suffice us as the rule
of supreme equity. For if such power over their children is accorded to earthly
parents, as that they may put them to shame at their will, how much more
reverence is due to our heavenly Father, when he brands us with any mark of
disgrace? This was the reason why Miriam was shut out for seven days, not only
that she might mourn apart by herself, but also that her chastisement might be
profitable to all. It is likewise addressed to us, that we may learn to blush
whensoever God is angry with our sins, and thus that shame may produce in us a
dislike of sin. This special example afterwards passed into a law, as we have
already seen,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
24:9); 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for when God commands lepers to be separated, He recalls to the recollection of
the people what He had appointed with respect to Miriam, lest, if internal
impurity be cherished, its infection may spread beyond
ourselves.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And afterward the people departed
from Hazeroth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>At first sight Moses
appears to be at variance with himself: for he here states that he sent the
spies at God's command, whereas in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
1:22, he relates that he made this concession at the request of the people; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but the two statements are easily reconciled. It is, indeed, unquestionable that
God had regard to the infirmity and distrust of the people; for the spies are
not sent to see in what direction the land was to be attacked, with which design
two were<i> </i>afterwards sent by Joshua, but God had here no other object than
to encourage them, when they else were cowardly and inert, to throw off their
inactivity, and eagerly to advance. The necessity of such a remedy was evidently
shown, when they all demanded this of Moses. The second narrative, therefore, is
fuller, and in it Moses goes back further than he had done in the first, viz.,
that it arose from the timidity and pusillanimity of the people that he did not
at onto hasten whither God invited him; for, if they had straightway obeyed,
they would have won the land of their enemies without any delay; but they
requested that a respite might be given them. It is, then, by no means
inconsistent that Moses did, at the request of the people, what God at the same
time enjoined, because tie saw that they were otherwise hesitating, and but
little disposed to advance, and needed this stimulus. For, if the spies had
honestly per.-formed their duty, the people would have been led forward as if
they had seen the land themselves, which would have been the readiest means for
putting an end to all delays.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, however,
the place is described, from whence the spies were sent, viz., at no great
distance from mount Sinai, although they had encamped twice, so that it was
their third station. It has already been stated in chapter 10, that the cloud
rested in the wilderness of Paran, which some understand to have been said by
anticipation,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&gt;lhyin,</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>as if Moses had said that, from the time when the people left Mount Sinai,
they had not made any permanent halt, until they came to that wilderness, and
there pitched their tents. But this opinion is by no means consistent; for it is
clear that they stayed some time in Taberah; and many days were spent at the
graves of lust, (Kibroth-hattaavah; ) for there they were gorged for a month
with the flesh of the birds, and then the pestilence attacked them, which cut
off many of them, for whose burial it was necessary to provide. Now, their next
halt was for more then seven days. It, therefore, appears probable to me that by
the word Paran, a different place is not expressed; but that it is merely meant
that, though they advanced, they still remained in some part of that wilderness.
For, since the wilderness of Paran was in one direction contiguous to Mount
Sinai, that name is sometimes given to it; for Moses certainly confounds them
elsewhere, as also does the Prophet Habakkuk.

taken from one tribe, or from any single portion of the people, their fidelity
might have been suspected by the others. God, therefore, would have each tribe
assured by its own witness, in order that their report might be more
unquestionable. All cause for jealousy was also to be taken away; lest, if any
tribe had been passed over, it might have excepted against the messengers, whom
it supposed to have been elected in contempt of it. This, then, was the
advantage of the equal distribution, lest any sinister suspicion or offence
might disturb the unanimity of the whole people. Secondly, it is required that
they should be possessed of personal dignity, since God commands that chief men
should be chosen, whose testimony would be of greater authority; for it would
have been easy to throw discredit upon obscure individuals. Since, however, both
precautions were unsuccessful, it appears from hence that there is no counsel so
wise and salutary as not to be capable of perversion by the wickedness of
mankind. Thus this excellent providence of God rendered the people the more
inexcusable. At the same time, God has reminded us once for all by this example
that, however those, who seemed to be like pillars, may totter and stumble, or
even fall altogether, still our minds must be supported by faith, so as not to
give way.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Their names are enumerated, in
perpetual remembrance of their ignominy, except in the case of two, Joshua and
Caleb; for it was just that their crime should be handed down to all ages, and
that the infamy of their perfidiousness should never be blotted out, since they
endeavored, as far as in them lay, to bring to naught the promise and the grace
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses gave the name of Jehoshua to the

the result, when they invent titles of honor of their own accord; but Moses was
not induced by the blindness of affection to change the name Oshea into
Jehoshua; but God directed his tongue and mind thus to commend, beforehand, him
who 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was to be the future minister of their preservation. Still it cannot be inferred
with certainty from this passage at what time the new name was given him; for it
is not specified that he was called Jehoshua at the time he was sent out; nay,
it is probable that he had been previously thus distinguished, viz., from the
period in which he had been associated with Moses as his companion and minister
in all important matters.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And see the land what it
is.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The counsel of Moses had this
object, that the people might be made aware how rich and fertile the land was;
for a barren country does not support a large population; and the healthfulness
of a locality is inferred from the rigor of its inhabitants, tie, therefore,
chiefly insists on the goodness of the land and its abundant production of
fruits. Still, perhaps, God would intentionally have the Israelites forewarned,
that they would have to do with strong and powerful enemies; lest they might be
alarmed and discouraged at suddenly beholding them. But the main point was, that
the pleasantness and fertility of the land might allure them to take possession
of it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they ascended by the
south, and came unto Hebron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Their
direct course was not, indeed, towards the south, but they <i>proceeded
</i>along the southern border, until they came to Rehob and Hamath, after having
passed the mountains. Hebron, however, in which Abraham had sojourned, is
specified from amongst the other cities; and it is probable that the three sons
of the giant, who are here named, were in possession of that city. But some
think that Anak is not a proper name, and is used, by <i>enallage </i>of the
number, for giants. In fact, giants are elsewhere called Anakim. Nor is there
any doubt but that these three, who are mentioned, were formidable from their
great stature and strength, as we gather from the book of Joshua. It is, then,
equivalent to saying that this city was then possessed by warlike men, famous
for their prowess. It will, however, appear from the end of the chapter, that
Anak was the proper name of a man, whose sons were of excessive height. The
antiquity of the city is afterwards signalized by comparison, viz., that it was
founded seven years before Zoan, one of the chief cities of Egypt, and of which
mention is often made in Scripture. Heathen writers call it Tanis; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and it is situated on one of the seven famous mouths of the Nile, which is
called from the city, <i>Ostium Taniticum. </i>Now, since the Egyptians gloried
in their antiquity above all other nations, it is evident that the land of
Canaan was well peopled immediately after the deluge; and this is a sign of its
great fertility, for if the neighboring countries had been more so, they would.
not have settled themselves there by preference, when they were at liberty to
make their choice. A <i>prolepsis </i>is to be noted in the name of the valley
of Eshcol: for it was afterwards that it began to be so called by the Israelites
in memory of the remarkable cluster of grapes which Moses states to have been
brought from hence; and this is immediately after
specified,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they returned from searching
of the land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The activity and diligence
of the twelve men is commended, who in so short a time examined the whole of the
land from the desert of Sin to the sea, and along the whole course of the
Jordan; and this, too, in the hottest part of the year, when the grapes were
beginning to ripen. Thus far, then, they faithfully executed the task intrusted
to them. In their report, also, there seems to be nothing unworthy of honest
men. They had been commanded by Moses to consider the inhabitants of the land,
whether they were strong or weak, and also whether the cities were fortified;
and they relate nothing which was not true and fully ascertained by them. In a
word, at first sight their relation contains nothing worthy of reprehension.
Nevertheless, we may gather from the context that the ten of them, whose desire
was to turn away the people, spoke in such discouraging terms of their
difficulties, that they produced exactly the contrary effect to what Moses had
hoped. No other accusation, however, is as yet alleged against them, than that,
by maliciously and deceptively inspiring despondency, they held back the people
from entering the land. Although, therefore, they had not openly lied, they were
wanting in sincerity. Perhaps, too, the whole of their address is not recorded;
because Moses deemed it sufficient to state their perversity of feeling, in that
they added to their praises of the land an exception, which overwhelmed the
people's minds with fear. From whence also we gather a useful admonition, that
crafty sophists avail nothing with God, when they endeavor to cover their deceit
by tortuous prevarication's. Wherefore, if we desire to approve our discourse to
God, we must take care to lay aside all such unfair evasions, and, rejecting all
disguise, to speak simply and from the heart. The ten spies, then, lay a
foundation of good faith, in order that they may afterwards be more competent to
deceive. The land, they say, is a good one, except that the people are strong;
and what is this but that there was little hope that the Israelites would obtain
the blessing promised them by God, and that the attempt must by no means be
made? With the same view they thunder out 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the names of several nations, in order to increase the alarm; for, after having
reported that they had seen the sons of Anak, they state that their contests
would be too arduous with the various peoples, who would advance from all sides
to resist them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Caleb stilled the people
before Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That is, he restrained the
murmurs of the people before Moses, against whom they had begun to rise
tumultuously. Hence it appears that much was said on both sides which is passed
over in silence, for there would have been no need of restraining the violence
of the people, unless the contention had waxed warm. His words, however, show
what was the state of the whole case and question, viz., that the ten
treacherous spies had dissuaded the people from foolishly advancing to the land,
which it was impossible to win; and urged them not to attack rashly very
powerful enemies, to whom they would be far from equally matched. But Caleb
opposes them with the confidence of victory. We (he says) shall conquer the
land, and upon this he grounds his exhortation. Moreover, there is no doubt but
that, relying on God's promise, he believed that they would, be successful, and
thus boldly foretold it, whilst the others took not at all into consideration
that, with the banner of the Lord before them, the people would come into the
promised inheritance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This does not appear to
accord with what Moses relates in Deuteronomy 1, where he absolves the spies,
and casts the whole blame on the people; but the contradiction is easily
reconciled, for there he had no other object than to assert the criminality of
the Israelites, who, by their contumacy, had for a long time impeded the
fulfillment of God's promise. Omitting, therefore, that part of the history
which did not affect the matter in hand, he only adverts to that which convicted
them of wicked ingratitude, <i>i.e., </i>that the fertility of the land was
commended by the spies; and consequently, since the people were abundantly
assured of God's liberality, that they sinned grossly by rejecting it. He,
therefore, states their crime to have been, that they<i> </i>were rebellious
against the mouth or word of Jehovah, viz., because they had refused to follow
Him when He invited them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What Moses here
ascribes to Caleb alone, he elsewhere attributes to Joshua also. It is plain,
then, that Caleb spoke for both of them, and that Joshua was prudently and
modestly silent, lest a tumultuous altercation should arise. It may, however, be
probably conjectured that the bravery and firmness of him, who is praised, was
the more conspicuous, whilst the honesty of Moses is perceivable, inasmuch as,
by his preference of Caleb, he obscures and diminishes the praise due to his own
minister.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the men that went up with him
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We here see, as in a mirror, how
impiety gradually gathers audaciousness in evil. At the outset, the authors of
the rebellion were ambiguous in their expressions, and contented themselves with
obscure insinuations; they now throw aside all shame, and openly and
acrimoniously oppose the address of Caleb, which was certainly nothing less than
casting discredit on God's words, and setting at naught His power. God had
promised to give the land to the Israelites; they deny that He will do so. He
had afforded them many proofs that nothing is difficult to Him: they deny that
His aid will suffice against the forces of their enemies. Moreover, they at
length break out into such impudence, that in their falsehood they contradict
themselves. They had confessed that the land was rich; they now declare that it
consumes or devours its inhabitants, which is entirely the reverse. For this is
equivalent to saying, that the wretched men, who cultivated it, wore themselves
out with their assiduous labors; or, at ally rate, that it was pestilential from
the inclemency of its climate; either of which statements was utterly false. The
mode in which some understand it, viz., that the giants 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in their violence committed indiscriminate slaughter, is without foundation; for
this evil was by no means to be feared by the people, after the extermination of
the inhabitants. I do not doubt, then, but that it means that the cultivation of
the land was difficult, and full of much
inconvenience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the end of the last verse,
where it is said, "as grasshoppers," etc., I think the words are inverted, and
ought to be thus connected; "As grasshoppers are despised in our eyes, so we
were looked down upon by these giants on account of our lowness of
stature."</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the congregation
lifted up their voice.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we see how
easily, by means of a few incentives, sedition is excited in a great multitude;
for the people, unless governed by the counsel of others, is like the sea,
exposed to many tempests; and the corruption of human nature produces this
amongst innumerable other evils, that lies and impostures prevail over truth.
There was, indeed, some pretext for the error of the people, in that they saw
ten most choice leaders of their tribes dissuading them from entering the land,
and only two advising them to proceed. But that credulity, to which they were
too much inclined, is without excuse, because it arose from incredulity; for, if
the dignity and reputation of ten men availed so much with them, that they were
thus easy of belief, ought they not much rather to have given credit to the word
of God, who had promised them the land four hundred years before? For when they
cried out beneath the oppressive tyranny of the Egyptians, the memory of the
promise given to their fathers was not effaced, since the holy Jacob had
carefully provided for its transmission. They had recently heard and embraced
its confirmation, and in this confidence had come forth from Egypt. We see,
then, that they had already been induced by their own supineness and depravity
to recoil from entering the land, because they had thrown aside their confidence
in God, so that they might seem to have deliberately laid hold of the
opportunity. Still the evil counselors gave an impulse to them, when they were
falling of their accord, and east them down
headlong.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They begin with weeping, which at
length bursts out into rage. The cause of their weeping is the fear of death,
because they think that they are being carried away to slaughter; and whence
does this arise, except because the promised aid of God is of no account with
them? Thus it appears how greatly opposed to faith is cowardice, when, on the
occurrence of danger, we look only to ourselves. But:. whilst the beginning of
infidelity is to be withheld by fear from obedience to God, so another worse
evil presently follows, when men obstinately resist God, and, because they are
unwilling to submit themselves to His word, enter into altercation with Him.
This was the case with the Israelites, who, being overwhelmed with grief, at
length are stirred up by its impetuosity against Moses and Aaron. And this is
wont too often to occur, that impatience bursts forth from the anguish into
which our unbelief has brought us. The desire for death, which they conceive,
arises from ingratitude and contempt of God's blessing. They wished that they
had died either in Egypt or in the wilderness; why, then, had they just before
humbly beseeched Moses to propitiate God?</font><br><font face="Palatino">With

desert would have been more bitter than in Egypt; whereas they only deplore that
they would be exposed to death if they should enter the land of Canaan, as
follows in the next verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wherefore has the Lord
brought us into this land?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The pride,
and even the madness of their impiety here more fully betrays itself, when they
accuse God of deception and cruelty, as if tie were betraying them to the
Canaanitish nations, and leading them forth to slaughter; for they conclude that
they ought not to obey His command, because He would destroy them, and not only
so, but that He would at the same time give their wives and children to be a
prey. We see how mad is unbelief, when it gives way to itself, since these
wretched people do not hesitate to prefer charges against God, and to repay His
kindnesses by calling Him their betrayer. But what was the cause of this
blasphemous audacity, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
except that they hear they would have to do with powerful enemies? as if they
had not experienced the might of God to be such, that nothing which they might
encounter was to be feared whilst He was on their side! At the same time, they
also accuse God of weakness, as if He were less powerful than the nations of
Canaan. At length their monstrous blindness and senselessness comes to its
climax, when they consult as to their return, and, rejecting Moses, set
themselves about choosing a leader, who may again deliver them up to Pharaoh.
Were they so quickly forgetful how wretched their condition there had been? It
was for no fault of theirs, but whilst they were peaceful and harmless guests,
that the Egyptians had so cruelly afflicted them, since they were hated by
Pharaoh on no other account but because he could not endure their multitude;
what, then, was he likely to do, when, for their sakes, he had undergone so many
calamities; what humanity, again, was to be expected from that nation which had
conspired for their destruction already, when it had suffered no injury from
them? Surely there was no house among them which would not long to avenge its
first-born! Yet they desire to give themselves up to the will of a most bitter
enemy, who, without any cause for ill-will, had proceeded to all sorts of
extremities against them. Hence we plainly see that unbelievers are not only
blinded by the just vengeance of God, but carried away by a spirit of
infatuation, so as to inflict upon themselves the greatest
evils.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Moses and Aaron fell on
their faces.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is doubtful whether they
so humbled themselves towards the people, as to he prostrate before them, or
whether it was in prayer that they fell with their faces on the earth; the
latter, however, seems more likely to me, as if, by thus turning themselves to
God, they reproved the stupidity of the people,. And, in fact, in such a case of
obduracy, nothing remained except to call upon God, yet in such sort that the
prayer should be made in the sight of all, in order to influence their minds.
Otherwise they might have sought some place of retirement; but by this pitiful
spectacle they endeavored to recall the people to their right senses. This,
indeed, is beyond dispute, that they sought for nothing on their own account,
but were only anxious for the welfare of the people; since, if the people had
gone back, they would have been at liberty to sojourn in the land of Canaan, or
elsewhere. Yet still they were not merely concerned with regard to the people,
but the interruption of God's grace troubled them most, with which the Covenant
made with Abraham would also have been buried. In a word, this was justly felt
by them to be the same as if they had seen both the glory of God and the
salvation of the human race altogether brought to naught. Wherefore they must
needs have been more than senseless who were unmoved by this sad sight,
especially when Moses, whom God had exalted by so many privileges above all
other mortals, was lying prostrate on the earth for their
sake.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua, the son of Nun,
and Caleb.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The magnanimity of Joshua is
here specified, whereas, before, only Caleb had been praised. But Moses says
that they both rent their clothes in token of their excessive sorrow, and even
of their abhorrence. For, as is well known, this, amongst the Orientals, was a
solemn ceremony in extreme grief, or when they would express their abomination
of some crime. Hypocrites have improperly imitated this custom, either when they
made a pretence of sorrow, or desired to deceive the simple. But it is plain
that Caleb and Joshua were moved to rend their garments by solemn feelings, nay,
by the fervor of their indignation; whilst, at the same time, they seek to
reclaim the people from their madness. And, first, they commend the fertility of
the land; and then base their hope of obtaining it on the favor or good pleasure
of God. Some take the conditional particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>im, </i>for the causal particle, and translate it, "For <i>because </i>God
loves us, therefore He will bring us in;" but this I do not approve of, and it
is manifestly foreign to the true meaning; for, since the Israelites had in a
manner rejected so great a benefit, they were surely unworthy through unbelief
of being still pursued by His favor. The condition is, therefore, introduced as
if doubtingly, not in order to diminish their hopes, as though it were a mark of
uncertainty, but simply that the people should be convinced of their impiety,
and repent; as if they had said, If only we afford room for the continuance of
God's favor towards us, be ye of good courage. And this they state more clearly
soon afterwards, in reproving the stubbornness of the people, where they say,
"Only (or but) rebel not ye;" in which words they admonish them that they shut
up all the ways whereby God might still pursue the course of His work; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that there is no other obstacle to these wretched people except their own
unbelief, which does not permit them to obey God. In this way, then, they assert
that God's power is sufficient to perform what He had promised; and then exhort
the people to conciliate His favor, from whence they had fallen through their
own fault. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ac, </i>is used emphatically, as though Joshua and Caleb had said that there
was no fear of danger, except because the people's minds were set on bringing
evil upon themselves. Finally, in their reliance upon God's aid, they exult like
conquerors; "They will be bread for us," they say, <i>i.e., </i>we shall devour
them without any trouble. And the reason is subjoined, because, if God stands by
the Israelites, their enemies will be destitute of all defense. Justly, then,
and for the best of reasons they conclude, that although our enemies would
otherwise be formidable, they are not to be feared, if only God, apart from whom
there is no strength, be favorable unto us.</font><br></div>

He then reminds them how malignant had been their ingratitude and perversity in
upbraiding God on account of the special blessing which He had conferred upon

a more manifest proof of His paternal love towards them than by their

no contradiction in his words. A little before, he had seemed to give

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then I said unto you, Dread
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here omits the address of Caleb
and Joshua: since he only states briefly the heads of what he had spoken to the
people. He merely shows that, when he endeavored to recall them to their right
senses, his efforts and pains were ineffectual. Moreover, he reasons from
experience that they might well place their hopes in the assistance of God,
because He went before them as a light; and, in proof of this, he reminds them
that, after the discomfiture of the Egyptians, He did not fail still to exert
His power, so as to protect even to the end those whom He had once delivered.
This, then, is his proposition, that although they might be aware of their own
weakness, still, through the power of God, they would be conquerors, since He
had taken them under His <i>care, </i>and had declared Himself their leader;
which he indicates by the expression, "goes before you." And, lest any
hesitation should remain, he sets against their present obstacles the miracles
of God's power, which they had experienced, not only in the commencement of
their redemption, but in the continued progress of their deliverance's, when, in
their lost and desperate state, He had by ways innumerable restored them from
death unto life. Hence he concludes that they ought not to be afraid, not that
he would wish them to be altogether free from all fear and <i>care, </i>but so
that they might overcome all hindrances, when confidence derived from the ready
help of God should prevail in their hearts. He says emphatically that God had
fought "before their eyes," to lead them to fuller conviction by the evidence of
their own senses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it, the wilderness where thou
hast seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The constant course of God's
grace is here commemorated; from whence they might safely infer, that He, who
had pursued them with so many benefits, would still be the same in this crowning
act. He, therefore, uses the image of <i>bearing, </i>because the way would have
been by no means passable unless God had borne them, as it were, on His
shoulders, just as a father is wont to bear his infant child. Thus, on the one
hand, the incredible goodness of God is exalted, who had deigned so far to
condescend as to take up the people in His arms; and, on the other hand, the
people are reminded of their own infirmity, for, unless upheld by the power of
God, they would scarcely have been competent to advance a step. Elsewhere,
retaining a portion of this similitude, Moses compares God to an eagle, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who bears her young upon her wings, and teaches them to fly. And surely, unless
(the Israelites) had been uplifted by supernatural means, they would never have
been equal to a hundredth part of the difficulties they
encountered.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet in this thing ye did not

<i>dabar, </i>which we have translated <i>thing, </i>he embraces all the proofs
whereby God had testified, that in Him alone there was all that was necessary to
insure their complete salvation. And this was, so to speak, real or practical
doctrine, when God called upon them to trust Him by stretching forth His hand.
Still, He accuses them of unbelief with reference to the promise; for, whilst
faith is not only prompt and ready in obedience, but invigorates and quickens
the whole mall, so the cause of their inertness was that they gave no heed to
God who had promised to bestow upon them the land of Canaan, and did not rest
upon His covenant. In relation to this also, he says, that God marked out the
places and stations where they should pitch their camp, for, unless it had been
His design to guide them onwards, this change of places would have been
superfluous. It was, therefore, gross supineness not to refer these signs for
halting and proceeding to their proper object, since it was equivalent to
despising God when He held out His hand to them.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But all the congregation bade
stone them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When these wicked men began
by murmuring against God, and openly casting censure upon Him, no wonder that
they should also rage against His servants; for, when we endeavor to subdue
pride, it generally begets cruelty; and so also, when iniquity is reproved, it
always ends at last in fury. Caleb and Joshua did not constrain them by force of
arms, neither did they menace them; but only persuaded them to trust in God's
promise, and not to hesitate to advance into the land of Canaan; yet, because in
their obstinacy the people had determined not to believe God, they champ the
bit, as it were, upon being chastised, and desire to stone their reprovers. How
great was the impetuosity of their wrath is manifest from this, that God does
not attempt to appease their fury, nor to restrain them by threats, or by His
authority, but openly displays His power from heaven, and miraculously protects
His servants by the manifestation of His glory, as if He were rescuing them from
wild beasts. There is, indeed, no express mention made of the cloud, but we may
infer that the sign to which they were accustomed, was given not merely to
terrify them, but also to cast them prostrate, so that they might be deprived of
their power to inflict injury, and might desist even against their wills. For
the majesty of God, although it truly humbles believers only, yet sometimes
subdues the reprobate and the lost, or renders them astounded in all their
ferocity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God remonstrates with respect to
their indomitable obstinacy, because they had just now hesitated not petulantly
to despise and reject Him with the most atrocious insults, and notwithstanding
all the clearest manifestations of His power. For I know not whether the sense
which some give be suitable, when they translate the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#732;an</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>naatz, </i>"to provoke." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jerome comes nearer to the genuine sense, How long will they detract me? But let
us be contented with the genuine intention of God, which He confirms by the
succeeding <i>antithesis, </i>where He complains that He is disparaged, because
they do not take into consideration the many miracles whereby He had abundantly
testified His power and loving-kindness; and thus He proves their contempt,
because they deliberately refuse credit to the many signs of which the
accumulation at least ought to have subdued or corrected their
stubbornness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The denunciation of their final
punishment follows, together with a statement of the atrocity of their crime;
for the particle "How<i> </i>long" indicates its long continuance, as well as
the enduring patience of God. He had, indeed, punished others severely, but only
for example's sake, in order that the name of their <i>race </i>should remain
undestroyed, whereas he now declares that He will deal with them as. with
persons in a desperate condition, who cease not to make a mock of His patience.
Hence we are taught, that, although God is placable in His nature, still the
hope of pardon is deservedly cut off from unbelievers, who are so obdurate as
that tie produces no effect upon them by His hand, or by His countenance, or His
word. he then briefly adverts to the use of the signs, viz., that their object
was, that the knowledge or experience of them should awaken hopes of
success.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If the apparent contradiction offends
any one, that God should declare the people to be cast off, when it was already
decreed that tie would pardon them, a reply may be sought from elsewhere in
three words; for God does not here speak of His secret and incomprehensible
counsel, but only of the actual circumstances, showing what the people had
deserved, and how horrible was the vengeance which impended,

in respect to their wicked and detestable revolt, since it was not His design to
keep Moses back from earnest prayer, but to put the sincerity of his piety and
the fervency of his zeal to the proof. And, in fact, he does not contravene the
prohibition, except upon the previous exhibition of some spark of faith. See
Exodus 32.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the Egyptians shall hear
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses here, according to his custom,
stands "in the breach" of the wall, as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A623&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:23, to sustain and avert the anger of God, which else would burst forth,
since through his intercession it came to pass that the fire was speedily
extinguished, and the people were not consumed. In order to support his
request., he only objects that God's holy namo would be the sport of the wicked,
if the people should perish altogether I have endeavored to reduce to their
proper meaning the words which translators variously render. First, he says,
"The Egyptians shall hear, whereas it is a thing sufficiently notorious, and
testified by miracles, that this people was rescued from among them by thy
might. The same report will also obtain currency among; the nations of Canaan,
who have already heard that thou: art the protector of this people, and have
undertaken the charge of governing them. If, therefore, they should altogether
perish, all the nations which have heard of thy fame will east the blame on
thee, and will think that thy power is broken down in the midst of its course,
so that thou could not carry through to the end the work thou hadst undertaken."
The substance amounts to this, that because God had manifested by clear and
evident signs that He was the deliverer of this people, He would be exposed to
the reproach of the wicked, unless He should preserve in safety those whom He
had once redeemed. For nothing else would occur to the minds of the heathen
nations, except that God was unable to maintain His blessing, however desirous
He might be to do so. And assuredly this is no ordinary effect of God's
goodness, so to connect the glory of His name with our salvation, that whatever
is adverse to us brings with it reproach upon Him, because the mouth of the
wicked will be open to blaspheme. And this will in fact turn to our advantage,
if on our part, without dissimulation, and in zealous sincerity, we beseech God
to uphold His own glory in saving us; for many boldly plead the name of God in
their own behalf, although they are unaffected by any real care or love for it.
Moreover, because the more illustrious God's exercise of His power has been, the
more insolently are the ungodly disposed to blaspheme, if it has appeared to
fail; we must always entreat of Him that He should not desert the work of His
hands which He has begun in us. To this effect are the words, "They have heard
that thou art seen face to face;" for, if the people's safety were not
maintained, the failure would have been imputed to none but God, who had put.
forth the power of His hand to preserve them. In fine, since their astonishing
exodus had been a testimony of God's favor, so, if he had suffered the people to
perish in the desert, all would have considered it a sign of His weakness,
inasmuch as it was not probable that He should not accomplish what tie desired,
unless He were unable to do so.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now, I beseech thee, let the
power of my Lord be great.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He derives
another ground of confidence from the vision, in which God had more clearly
manifested His nature, from whence it appears how much he had profited by it,
and what earnest and anxious attention he had paid to it. Hence, however, we
derive a general piece of instruction, that there is nothing more efficacious in
our prayers than to set His own word before God, and then to found our
supplications upon His promises, as if He dictated to us out of His own mouth
what we were to ask. Since, then, God had manifested Himself to Moses in that
memorable declaration, which we have already considered, he was able to derive
from thence a sure directory for prayer; for nothing can be more sure than His
own word, on which if our prayers are based, there is no reason to fear that
they will be ineffectual, or that their results should disappoint us, since He
who has spoken will prove Himself to be true. And, in fact, this is the reason
why He speaks, viz., to afford us the grounds for addressing Him, for else we
must needs be dumb.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since I have expounded the

encourage his hope of pardon, he first sets before himself the greatness of
God's mercy, and then the past instances by which it had been proved that God
was inclined to forgiveness. And, indeed, the mercy of God continually invites
us to seek reconciliation whenever we have sinned; and, though iniquities heaped
upon iniquities, and the very enormity of our sins, might justly make us afraid,
still the abundance of His grace, of which mention is here made, must needs
occur to us, so as to swallow up all dread of His wrath. David, also, betaking
himself to this refuge, affords us an example how all alarm is to be overcome.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:1) But, since the bare and abstract recognition of God's goodness is often
insufficient for us, Moses applies another stay in the shape of experience:
Pardon, (he says,) as thou hast so often done before. For, since the goodness of
God is unwearied and inexhaustible, the oftener we have experienced it, the more
ought we to be encouraged to implore it; not that we may sink into the
licentious indulgence of sin, but lest despair should overwhelm us, when we are
lying under the condemnation of God, and our own conscience smites and torments
us. In a word, let us regard this as a most effective mode of importunity, when
we beseech God by the benefits which we have already experienced, that He will
never cease to be gracious.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said, I have
pardoned, according to thy word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God
signifies that tie pardons for His servant Moses' sake, and makes, as it were, a
present to him of those whom He had already devoted to destruction. Hence we
gather how much the entreaties of the pious avail with God: as He is said, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
145:19, to "fulfil the desire of them that fear him." He would, indeed, have
done of His own accord what He granted to Moses; but, in order that we may be
more earnest in prayer, the use and advantage of prayers is commended, when God
declares that He will not only comply with our requests, but even obey
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But how is it consistent for Him to
declare that He had spared those, upon whom He had determined to inflict the
most extreme punishment, and whom He deprived of their promised inheritance? I
reply that the pardon in question was not granted to the individuals, but to
their race and name. For the opinion of some is unnatural, who think that they
were released from the penalty of eternal death, and thence that God was
propitiated towards them, because He was contented with their temporal
punishment. I do not doubt, then, but that Moses was so far heard, as that the
seed of Abraham should not be destroyed, and the covenant of God should not fail
For He so dispensed the pardon as to preserve their posterity uninjured, whilst
He inflicted on the unbelievers themselves the reward of their rebellion. Thus
the conditions of the pardon were of no advantage to the impious rebels, though
they opened a way for the faithful fulfillment of His
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But as truly as I live, all the
earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is, indeed, plain that God
here swears by His life and glory: the meaning is only ambiguous in this
respect, that some translate it in the past tense, that the earth had been
filled with His glory, which had already been displayed in so many miracles. And
this seems to accord well with what follows, "Those, who have seen my glory
&#8212; shall not see the land;" still the future tense suits the context
better, viz., that God should call to witness His glory, which He will hereafter
assert. Moses feared lest the destruction of the people should be turned into a
reproach and contumely against God; God now declares with an oath that He would
so vindicate His glory, as that those, who were guilty of so great a crime,
should not escape punishment. He proclaims that those should not see the land,
who had shut their eyes against the miracles, of which they had been spectators
and eye-witnesses, and in their blindness had endeavored to set them at naught.
For, inasmuch as they had not been taught to fear God by so many signs, they
were worse than unworthy of beholding the land, the possession of which ought to
have been assured to them by those very signs, if God's truth had not been

ceased constantly to provoke Him by their frowardness; for it is no fixed or

done so without measure or end. We have elsewhere

shown what it is to tempt God, viz., to subject His power to the narrow rule of
our own senses, and to prescribe to Him the mode in which He is to act,
according to our own desires: so as to defer to Him no further than our carnal
reason dictates. The source and cause of this tempting of God is subjoined,

obedience, which is the mistress of humility, can restrain our
insolence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>

the expression is complete without any addition. God, therefore, commends
Caleb's perseverance in obeying; because he not only promptly exhorted the
others, but also proceeded boldly and unhesitatingly, without being deterred by
any obstacles. God, however, magnifies his perseverance, because he looked to
Him alone in his noble conflict with so great a multitude. For it is an
extraordinary case for a person to stand firm, and to hold a straight course in

the Amalekites abide in the valleys to lay ambuscades." Others think that their
object is to inspire terror, lest the Israelites should remain too long in the
enemy's country, since they would be daily exposed to fresh attacks. I am,
however, rather of opinion that they are spoken in reproach. For they had
already arrived at the borders of the inhabited land, so that their enemies
might be put to the rout at once: whereas God commands them to retire, and thus
expels them from the land, which they had actually reached. Still I do not deny
that He sets before them the necessity of the case, and thus enforces their
obedience; as if He had said, that nothing now remained but to retreat, and
again to throw themselves into the

</i>I have translated the <i>copula </i>by the word <i>itaque </i>(therefore,)
to indicate the connection with what precedes: for Moses does not here recount
anything new, but, by way of explanation, repeats a point of great importance,
viz., that they, who had refused to enter the land, would be deprived of <i>its
</i>possession. He begins with the passionate interrogation:

</i>"How long shall this troublesome dregs of a people be borne with, who never
cease to murmur against me?" And God says that He "had heard" their turbulent
cries; in order that they might more certainly perceive that their pride was
intolerable, since God Himself was weary of it, although He is long-suffering
and slow to anger. It is in bitter irony that He says He will deal with them in
accordance with their own resolution and desire. Nothing, indeed, was further
from their intention than to wander in the wilderness, but, since they had held
back from entering the land, God says that He will gratify them in a very
different sense, viz., that they shall never enjoy the sight of that land, which
they had despised. By His oath, He expresses His extreme wrath, as also it is
said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">It was necessary that their stolidity should be thus
aroused, lest, when God was so greatly provoked, they should still continue
self-satisfied, according to their went. He aggravates their punishment by
another circumstance, <i>i.e., </i>that, they were to be deprived of the
inheritance which He had sworn to give to Abraham; for the lifting up of the
hand 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f66</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(as I have said elsewhere) was a form of oath; just as if God were called down
from heaven by the outstretched hand to be witness and judge: and, although this
does not indeed literally apply to God, still we know that He commonly transfers
to Himself the things that belong to men. Moreover, this was a most severe
reproof, that they by their wickedness and self-will should nullify a promise,
which God had ratified by an oath, in so far, at least, as its fulfillment
affected themselves: for He points out immediately afterwards that, although
they had rejected the proffered blessing, he would still be true; and would
bestow on their little ones that which they had refused for themselves. It is
thus that God tempers His judgments against those hypocrites, who falsely
profess to honor His name, so as to preserve a seed for the propagation of His
Church: nor is He ever so severe towards the reprobate, as to fail in sustaining
His mercy towards His elect. Nay, He here declares that Hie will be gracious
towards their children, as a means of inflicting punishment on the fathers. It
was an indirect accusation of God, when they lamented over their children, as if
they were to be carried away as "a prey;" whereas, God promises that they shall
be the possessors of the land, in order to reprove this wicked
blasphemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>

time that God had espoused them to Himself, their true chastity would have been
to embrace His grace in sincere faith, and at the same time to devote themselves
to His service; but by rejecting tits pure worship, they had broken their sacred
marriage-vow like gadding harlots.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This example

although atoning for the fault of others, were still by no means innocent
themselves. But in the judgments of God there is always a deep abyss, into which
if you fear to be plunged, adore that which it is not lawful to question.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt but that thus also God provided for the welfare
of those, towards whom He appeared to show some marks of severity. For He waited
not only until they had grown up, but also, as was advantageous to themselves,
until they had attained the strength of manhood, and until a new generation had
sprung up. He assigns a second reason why He postponed the fulfillment of His
promise for forty years, viz., that tie might repay the ill-spent days by as
many years. Having, then, spoken of their children, He again returns to the
actual criminals themselves, who were to be consumed in all that long period of
time, as if by a lingering disease. The noun

<i>tenuoth, </i>which I have rendered <i>vanity,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awn</font><font face="Palatino">,

from it various meanings. Some thus construe it: Ye shall know whether I am
false, or whether my word shall be vain. Others, rendering it <i>prohibition,

concession, whereby God reproves their detestable pride, which had no other
object than to accuse God of falsehood, and to charge Him calumniously with
failing to fulfil His words. Unless, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f72</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
perhaps, it should be preferred to take it passively; because the people had
endeavored to annihilate, as it were, God himself. But still I rather adopt this
sense, that they should perceive by certain and experimental proof, whether
God's promises were frivolous or vain. Moreover, we must bear in mind the
admonition of the Prophet, to which I have referred,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

4:6,) viz., that a better rest is now offered to us, from which we are to fear
lest our unbelief should withhold us. For it is not sufficient for us that God's
hand should once have been extended to us, unless we allow ourselves to be
directed by it, until our earthly wanderings are concluded, and it conducts us
into our heavenly rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b><i>

there is no question but that Moses recounts the special punishment which was
inflicted by God upon the perfidious spies. He had previously treated of the
general punishment of the whole people; when he now relates that the ten men
were smitten by the plague, he intimates that God would begin with them, so as
to manifest by this conspicuous and notable example how grossly He was offended
by their very disgraceful contempt of His grace. Their sudden and unnatural
death was, therefore, a kind of presage to all the others of the punishment
which awaited them. For in the first place, the expression, "the plague," is
emphatic, as much as to say that they should not die in the ordinary course of

executed His awful judgment, as if He had publicly ascended the tribunal. And
this appeared more clearly by His prolonging the life of Caleb and Joshua, who
were the only survivors of that generation until the end of the time prescribed.

just Judge, does not proceed hastily and without cause to inflict punishment on
men, and that He does not manifest severity without a full examination of the

enjoy the inheritance which they had despised: yet declares that He will

incredible prodigy, that so great a multitude should be so carried away by
diabolical fury, as that nothing should remain unaffected by it, unless perhaps
a timely death removed some of the old men rather on account of the vice of
others than their own. But, if even a hundredth part of them had been guiltless

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10,) when the wicked, as they weep and complain, cease not to
murmur against God; nay, when they gnaw the bit with greater obstinacy, and
thus, like savage and untamable beasts, rush forward to their destruction in
blind desperation. The temporal punishment could not, indeed, be redeemed by any
tears; but, if there had been the disposition to repent, their only remedy would
have been voluntarily to submit themselves, and calmly to undergo whatever
chastisement God might be pleased to inflict. First of all, however, they
proudly struggle to shake off the punishment awarded to them, and whilst they
pretended penitence, increasingly kick against God. There is no doubt but that
it was under the pretence of submission that they prepared themselves on the
morrow to advance; but wherefore was this, except that they may overturn God's
inviolable decree! Nevertheless, they sought, as if against His. will, to make a
way for themselves, though He forbade. "Behold us, (they said,) we are ready;"
but it was too late; for the opportunity had fled. For, as the Prophet exhorts
us to "seek the Lord while he may be found,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
4:6,) so also we ought to follow Him when He calls us. But of what avail was
this unseasonable alacrity of the people? When God wishes them to retire into
the desert, they affect a desire to obey Him by advancing further; and still
would have their confession of sin accepted as a sufficient
satisfaction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, Wherefore do ye

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f78</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so as not to submit himself to God. "If thou wilt return, O Israel, return unto
me,"<i> </i>saith the Lord by Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
4:1.) The first thing, therefore, which we must consider is, what God requires
of us; so that it may plainly appear that we truly submit ourselves to His
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order to restrain their temerity,
Moses reminds them that they will seek in vain for success, when they depart
from God's command. And this is a very useful piece of instruction, that His
grace will never be wanting to us, if we simply obey His word; but when, in
contempt and neglect of His precepts, we are carried away by our own feelings,
the event will never be prosperous. If any should object that the wretched
people had no other remedy, I have already stated, that they ought to have been
contented with this consolation, viz., that banishment from the land of Canaan
was not disinheritance from the hope of eternal life. Nay, if they had humbled
themselves before God, they might expect that their punishment would have been a
profitable help to them. By their misdirected activity they double the evil.
After having pointed out their danger, Moses again impresses upon them that God
is not with them, because they had deserted Him: and that His blessing was
withheld, because they had refused to follow Him at the proper
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>44.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they presumed to go up unto
the hill-top.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was not, indeed, their
intention deliberately to array themselves against God, but rather did they
endeavor to appease Him by this means of propitiation. Nor was their self-deceit
devoid of a colorable pretext, inasmuch as they were ready cheerfully to welcome
death, so as to offer their lives in sacrifice, and thus to compensate for their
previous hesitation and inertness. It is thus that the zeal of the wicked is
fervent, when it ought to be still; whereas, when God commands, coldness and
apathy possess their minds, so that they are no more aroused by His voice, than
as if they were stones. In a word, when it ought to be quiet, unbelief is always
active, prompt, and bold; but when God would have it advance, it is timid, slow,
and dead.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In conclusion, Moses adds, that their
foolish enterprise was punished; for they were not merely routed and put to
flight by their enemies, but utterly destroyed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f79</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence we gather, that their audacity failed them in the trial, and was deficient
in true courage. At the same time he recounts another sign of their
senselessness, in that they left behind the ark of God, as well as Moses, and
rushed forward, like doomed persons, to be slaughtered. Hence it appears that
unbelievers, when carried away by the blind impulse of their zeal, are as much
destitute of reason and discretion as if they deliberately conspired for their
own destruction.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then ye answered and said unto
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The repentance was too late, which
impelled the Israelites to their unseasonable effort of activity; although, as I
have above explained, they did not truly and seriously repent, since, when they
ought patiently to have borne the chastening of God, they endeavored to shake it
off, and to drive it far away from them by a new act of disobedience. In a word,
they did nothing else but kick against the pricks. But such is the energy of
men, when their own fancy leads them, that they will dare anything which God
forbids. But herein did their far worse folly betray itself, in that, when they
were again withheld, they still refuse to obey. Besides, He does not merely
forbid them to fight, but denies them His assistance. What then could be more
monstrous than that, in opposition to God's will, and when the hope of His
assistance was withdrawn, they should engage in what they had just before
obstinately refused to attempt under His auspices, and by His command, and with
the sure promise of success? And yet, so does hypocrisy blind men's minds, that
they imagined they were correcting and compensating for the evil which they
doubled. Moses then relates how they received the reward which they deserved; as
much as to say, that, although they might be slow to learn, still they were made
acquainted, by the reverse which they experienced, how fatal a thing it is not
to obey God: for fools never learn wisdom except beneath the
rod.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>45.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye returned and wept
before the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here appeals to the
testimony of their own conscience; for they never would have been brought to
weeping and prayers, except by the force of their own feelings. Since, then,
they were abundantly convinced, that a just punishment was inflicted upon their
obstinacy, necessity drove them to seek after God: consequently they had no
cause to complain, though God manifested Himself to be
implacable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the last verse there is an
ambiguity in the meaning of these words, "many days, according to the number of
the days." Some, rendering the verb in the pluperfect tense, "in which we had
remained there,"

suppose that they still abode there another forty days. But it is equally
probable; that an indefinite time is referred to: as if he had said, that the
people delayed there a long time, from whence it might be inferred, that they
lay like persons stupified, from lack of knowing what to
do.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is Kadesh-barnea to which Moses refers,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the son of an Israelitish
woman.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In what year, and in what station
in the desert this occurred, is uncertain. I have, therefore, thought it
advisable to couple together two cases, which are not dissimilar. It is probable
that between this instance of punishment, and that which will immediately
follow, there was an interval of some time: but the connection of two similar
occurrences seemed best to preserve the order of the history; one of the persons
referred to having been stoned for profaning God's sacred name by wicked
blasphemy, and the other for despising and violating the Sabbath. It is to be
observed that the crime of the former of these gave occasion to the promulgation
of a law, which we have expounded elsewhere: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in accordance with the common proverb, Good laws spring from bad habits: for,
after punishment had been inflicted on this blasphemer, Moses ordained that none
should insult the name of God with impunity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
was providentially ordered by God that the earliest manifestation of this
severity should affect the son of an Egyptian: for, inasmuch as God thus harshly
avenged the insult of His name upon the offspring of a foreigner and a heathen,
far less excusable was impiety in Israelites, whom God had, as it were, taken up
from their mothers' womb, and had brought them up in His own bosom. It is true,
indeed, that on his mother's side he had sprung from the chosen people, but,
being begotten by an Egyptian father, he could not be properly accounted an
Israelite. If, then, there had been any room for the exercise of pardon, a
specious reason might have been alleged why forgiveness should be more readily
extended to a man of an alien and impure origin. The majesty of God's name,
however, was ratified by his death. Hence it follows that it is by no means to
be permitted that God's name should be exposed with impunity to blasphemies
among the sons of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may learn from
this passage that during their tyrannical oppression many young women married
into the Egyptian nation, in order that their affinity might protect their
relatives from injuries. It might, however, have been the case that love for his
wife attracted the father of this blasphemer into voluntary exile, unless,
perhaps, his mother might have been a widow before the departure of the people,
so as to be at liberty to take her son with
her.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To <i>proceed, </i>he is said to have "gone
out," not outside the camp, but in public, so that he might be convicted by
witnesses; for he would not have been brought to trial if his crime had been
secretly committed within the walls of his own house. This circumstance is also
worthy of remark, that, although the blasphemy had escaped him in a quarrel,
punishment was still inflicted upon him; and assuredly it is a frivolous
subterfuge to require that blasphemies should be pardoned on the ground that
they have been uttered in anger; for nothing is more intolerable than that our
wrath should vent itself upon God, when we are angry with one of our
fellow-creatures. Still it is usual, when a person is accused of blasphemy, to
lay the blame on the ebullition of passion, as if God were to endure the penalty
whenever we are provoked.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nakab, </i>which some render to <i>express, </i>is here rather used for to
curse, or to transfix; and the metaphor is an appropriate one, that God's name
should be said to be transfixed, when it is insultingly abused. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f82</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spoke unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It must be remembered, then, that
this punishment was not inflicted upon the blasphemer by man's caprice, or the
headstrong zeal of the people, but that Moses was instructed by Divine
revelation what sentence was to be pronounced. It has been elsewhere stated 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f83</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
why God would have malefactors slain by the hands of the witnesses. Another
ceremony is here added, viz., that they should lay their hands upon his head, as
if to throw the whole blame upon him.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while the children of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since we know not in what year,
or in what month this happened, it appeared that nothing would be better than to
follow the context of Moses. This history shows that the Israelites were not
always affected by the same degree of madness, so as to be rebellious against
God; since in this instance their moderation is no less manifested than the
fervency of their pious zeal. But as one swallow does not make spring, so we
shall form an incorrect judgment of men's whole lives from one noble action. The
transgressor of the law is brought to Moses and Aaron, whose authority retains
the whole people in the path of duty. Their humility is also worthy of praise,
in that they quietly wait for the decision of God; and finally, must be added,
their energy in executing the punishment as soon as God has declared the
sentence. You would say that in every point they were rightly conformed to the
rules of piety; but, since the most trifling occasion immediately led them
astray, their hypocrisy was discovered by this great levity of
conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This, however, is the sum of the
history, that by the death of one man the obligation of the Sabbath was
sanctioned, so that it might <i>henceforth </i>be held in greater reverence. It
might indeed be the case that these men, who brought the transgressor of the
Sabbath, were careless in other matters, and, as is usual with hypocrites, were
excessively rigid in their assertion of the claims of an outward ceremony. From
the punishment, however, we may infer that the criminal himself had not erred
through inadvertence, but in gross contempt of the Law, so as to think nothing
of subverting and corrupting all things sacred. Sometimes, indeed, God has
severely avenged inconsideration in the pollution of holy things; but it is
probable that He would not have commanded this man to be stoned, unless he had
been convicted of willful crime. Moreover, by this severity God testified how
much stress He laid upon the observance of the Sabbath. The reason of this has
been elsewhere set forth, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f84</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
viz., that by this mark and symbol He had separated His chosen people from
heathen nations. Whence also arose the main reproach against the Jews, when they
were called Sabbatarians. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f85</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">But
it must be borne in mind that the worship of God was not to consist in mere
idleness and festivity; and therefore that what God enjoined respecting the
seventh day had another object: not only that they should then employ themselves
in meditating upon His works, but that, renouncing themselves and their own
works, they should live unto God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Furthermore,
this case shows us in general that the magistracy is appointed no less for the
maintenance of the First Table, than the Second; so that, if they inflict
punishment upon murder, adultery, and theft, they should also vindicate the
worship of God: for it is to be observed that the man was not stoned by a mere
unreflecting impulse, but by the direct command of God. They knew, indeed, what
he had deserved before God's tribunal; but, since no political law had been
given on this head, Moses was unwilling to come to any decision except by the
authority of God.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now Korah, the son of
Izhar.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The impious conspiracy is here
related of a few men, but these of the highest rank, whose object was to subvert
and destroy the divinely-appointed priesthood. They make their attack, indeed,
upon Moses, and accuse him of ruling unjustly; for thus it is that turbulent
persons are carried away without reason or discrimination; but, the only cause
why they are set against him is because they suppose him to be the originator of
the priesthood, as we easily collect from his reply. For he does not command
them to stand forth, in order that they may decide respecting the political
government or chieftainship, but that it may be made plain whether God
acknowledges them as priests; nor does he reproach the Levites with anything but
that, not content with their own lot, they have an unreasonable ambition to
obtain the honor of the high-priesthood. It was jealousy, then, that instigated
Korah and his companions to set on foot first a quarrel, and then a tumult;
respecting the priesthood, because they were indignant that the hope of
attaining that honor was taken away from themselves and their posterity for
ever. Thus there never was any more deadly or abominable plague in the Church of
God, than ambition; inasmuch as it cannot be that those who seek for
pre-eminence should range themselves beneath God's yoke. Hence arises the
dissolution of legitimate authority, when each one neglects the duties of his
position, and aims at his own private
advancement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, this conspiracy was the more
formidable, because the sedition did not arise from the dregs of the people, but
amongst the princes themselves, who were of high dignity, and held in the
greatest estimation. For although there were only four leaders of the faction,
there is but little room to doubt but that the purpose of the two hundred and
fifty was the same; for they would never have eagerly embarked in a grave and
invidious contest for the sake of four men; but the fact was, that all unholy
covetousness misled them all, for there was none of them who did not expect some
prize as a reward of victory. They not only, then, dissemble their mental
disease, but conceal it under an honorable pretext; for they pretend that they
are instigated by zeal for the public good, and that their object is the defense
of liberty. For, inasmuch as ambition is crafty, it is never destitute of some
specious excuse: thus, whilst schismatics are influenced by nothing but pride to
disturb the peace of the Church, they always invent plausible motives, whereby
they may conciliate in some degree the favor of the ignorant, or even of the
unstable and worthless. We must, therefore, cautiously weigh the designs of
those who seek to make innovations, and to overthrow a state of things which
might be endured; for thorough investigation will make it plain that; they aim
at something besides what they pretend. By the, fact of their so speedily
engaging such a multitude of persons in their party, we perceive how disposed
man's nature is to the most unpromising and unreasonable revolts in the world.
Four worthless men wickedly endeavor to overthrow Moses and Aaron; and
straightway two hundred and fifty persons are ready to follow them, not of the
populace, but chiefs of the tribes, whose reputation might dazzle the eyes of
the simple. Hence we must be the more cautious, lest any bugbears <i>(larvae)
</i>should deceive us into making rash
innovations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect to the wording of the
passage, some refer the verb "he took," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f86</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to the other conspirators, as if it were said that Korah stirred them up. Others
explain it that he instigated himself, and hurried himself onwards by his evil
passions. I do not, however, assent to either signification, but take it for
"he<i> </i>set to work" <i>(aggressus est.) </i>When it is afterwards said that
"they rose up before Moses," some understand the words according to their simple
meaning, others in a bad sense; and undoubtedly here the expression "before the
face of," is equivalent to <i>"against," </i>and thus indicates the wantonness
of their aggression. There is more difficulty in the words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm

<i>mogned, </i>not only an assembly, but also an appointed time, or convention,
it seems probable to me that these princes and men of high name are stated to
have been present, because they were called according to appointment: as if
Moses had said that they were called at a fixed time, or by agreement. For
neither do I see any reason why, after the word

</i>Some explain, "Let it suffice," as if they desired to put an end to the
tyranny of Moses; but I am rather of opinion that they would thus make a charge
of presumptuous and sacrilegious supremacy, as if Moses and Aaron had not only
usurped more than their right, but had also robbed God of His supreme authority.
They, therefore, reproach the holy men with having impiously subjected to
themselves the inheritance of God. Thus we see that God's faithful servants,
whatever may be their moderation, are still not exempted from false accusations.
Moses was an extraordinary example, not only of integrity, but also of humility
and gentleness; yet he is called proud and violent, as if he unworthily
oppressed the people of God. Observe further, that God permits His servants to
be loaded with such unjust calumnies, in order to teach them that they must
expect their reward elsewhere than from the world; and that the may humble them
and make trial of their endurance. Let us learn, then, to harden ourselves, so
as to be prepared, though we do well, to be evil spoken of. These ungodly and
seditious men betray their senselessness as well as their impudence. For by what
right do they seek to degrade Moses and Aaron? Because, forsooth, God dwells
amongst the people, and all in the congregation are holy! But holiness is
neither destructive of subordination, nor does it introduce confusion, nor
release believers from the obligation to obey the laws. It is madness in them,
then, to infer that those, whom God has sane-titled, are not subject to the
yoke; yet they maliciously stigmatize as tyranny that care of the people which
God has intrusted to His servants, as if they would purposely turn light into
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Moses heard it, he
fell upon his face.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no doubt
but that he had recourse to prayer in his perplexity, since he knew that the
remedy for so great an evil was only in the hand of God. It is in this respect
that the magnanimity of the ungodly differs from the firmness of believers; for
it often happens that unbelievers also labor in the defense of a good cause,
voluntarily expose themselves to the hatred of many, undergo severe contests,
and encounter of their own accord great perils; but with them obstinacy stands
in the place of virtue. But those who look to God, since they know that the
prosperous or unhappy events of all things are in His power, thus rely upon His
providence; and when any adversity occurs, implore His faithfulness and
assistance. When, therefore, Moses cast himself upon the earth, this 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f90</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
supplication was of more: value than all those heroic virtues in which
unbelievers have ever seemed to
excel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he spoke unto
Korah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses did not inconsiderately
choose this mode of divination, but by the dictation of the Spirit maintained
the priesthood of his brother by this token and testimony; for we know how, in
matters of doubt and obscurity, he was accustomed to inquire what God's pleasure
was. He did not, therefore, at this time make this proposal hastily and at
random, but by the inspiration of the Spirit had recourse to the sure judgment
of God. The effect of his prayer was that God suggested an easy and expeditious
mode of conquest.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He bids them take their
censers, that by their incense-offering it might be manifested whether their
oblation was acceptable to God. By deferring it to the morrow he con-suited
their own safety, if any of them might still be not incurable; for he saw that
they were carried away headlong by blind fury, and that they could not be
recalled to their senses in a moment. He, therefore, grants them some space of
time for repentance, that they might be led to consideration during the night;
or perhaps his object was that, the tumult being appeased, he might render them
all attentive to the decision of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, I pray you, ye sons of
Levi.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He addresses the whole body, and
yet it is said that his discourse was directed to Korah alone, and this was
because he had corrupted others of the Levites, and therefore is first summoned
to God's tribunal, so that the whole party might be at the same time included.
He was able to expostulate with the Levites at once, because their residence was
close to the sanctuary.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He accuses them of
ingratitude, because they were not satisfied with the honor with which God had
already dignified them, but also sought the high-priesthood. In this they
betrayed their despisal of His grace; for, if they had rightly valued the gifts
of God, each of them would have quietly contented himself with his lot;
especially since, in proportion as a person has been liberally dealt with, his
ingratitude is more intolerable, if he aspires to anything higher. We are
taught, therefore, that the higher the degree may be to which we have been
elevated by God's goodness, the greater is the punishment which our crime
deserves, if our ambition still incites us to overleap the bounds of our
calling. Nevertheless, such is the perversity of almost all men, that as soon as
a person has attained some intermediate position, he uplifts, as it were, the
standard of pride 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f91</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and prescribes to himself no limit, until he shall have reached above the
clouds. In a word, few are found who do not grow insolent in places of honor.
Wherefore we ought to be all the more attentive to this admonition of Moses,
that those are most ungrateful to God who despise their lot, which is already
honorable, and aim at something
higher.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For which cause both thou,
and all thy company.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here lays open
their sin, which they had endeavored to disguise. For they had neither scruple
nor shame, as we have seen, in pretending pious zeal. But in one word Moses
scatters these mists, telling them that they were instigated by nothing but
pride and envy to disturb the condition of the people. We must observe the
expression which he uses, that they are in "arms against God;"<i> </i>for,
although they might have never confessed to themselves that they had to do with
Him, but only that they were contending for the pre-eminence with men; still,
because it was their aim to overthrow the order established by God, Moses casts
aside all false pretences, and sets before them the simple fact that they are
waging war with God, when they are fighting with His servants. If, therefore, we
are afraid of contending with Him, let us learn to remain in our right place.
For, however they may prevaricate, who disturb the Church through their
ambition, in fighting against the servants of God, they attack Himself: and
therefore it is needful that He should resist them, to avenge Himself. For war
is not waged against God, as the poets feign the giants to have done, when they
heaped up mountains, and endeavored to surmount heaven; but when He is assailed
in the person of His servants, and when what He has decreed is in any wise
undermined. The vocation of the priests was sacred, so that they who conspired
to overthrow it, were the open enemies of God, as much as if they had directed
their arms, their strength, and their assaults against Him. We must, therefore,
bear in mind the reason which is subjoined, "And what is Aaron?" for, if Aaron
had usurped anything for himself, his temerity and audacity would not have been
supported by the countenance of God. Moses, therefore, declares that this is
God's cause, because there was nothing human in the ordinance of the priesthood.
It was, indeed, an honorable office, so that Aaron justly deserved to be thought
something of; but Moses indicates that he had nothing of his own, nor arrogated
anything to himself; in a word, that he is nothing in himself, and moreover,
that he is not elevated for his own private advantage, and that his dignity is
no idle one; but rather a laborious burden placed upon his shoulders for the
common welfare of the Church. How utterly ridiculous, then, is the folly of the
Pope in comparing all the enemies of his tyranny to Koran, Dathan, and Abiram;
for, in order to prove that his cause is connected with that of God, let him
show us the credentials of his calling, and at the same time thoroughly fulfil
his office. But what frivolous and vapid trifling it is, when some mimic Aaron
sets himself up &#8212; produces no divine command or vocation &#8212; domineers
in obedience to his own lusts, and is rather an actor on the stage than a priest
in the temple; that all who reject this spurious dominion should be condemned as
schismatics! Wherefore let us hold fast this principle, that war is waged
against God when His servants are molested, who are both lawfully called and
faithfully exercise their office.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses sent to call Dathan and
Abiram.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He desired, in this way, if it
might be, by his holy admonitions, to withhold them from that destruction, on
which they were rushing. Therefore he ceased not to provide for their welfare,
though he had thus far experienced that they were altogether in a desperate
state. Herein he presented a likeness of the loving-kindness of God, by whose
Spirit he was directed; not only because he was unwilling to pass sentence
without hearing the cause, but also because he endeavored to bring them to
repentance, that they might not willfully destroy themselves. Nevertheless it
came to pass at this time, as also often afterwards, that not only was the
earnestness of the Prophet, with respect to these unbelievers, throw away, but
that it hardened them more and more. For we know what was said by
Isaiah;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Make the heart of this
people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with hearts, and convert,
and be healed."

6:10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus does it please God to discover the

hast brought us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not enough for
these wicked men, when they are invited to discussion, contumaciously to
repudiate the superiority of Moses, unless they also assail him with
counter-accusations. The crime they allege against him must be observed. They
reproach him for having led them up out of the land of Egypt: though they
cunningly suppress its name, whilst they magniloquently extol its fruitfulness,
in order to throw into the shade all that God had promised with respect to the
land of Canaan. Nay, they seem to transfer slyly to Egypt the very phrase which
Moses had often used, so that thus God's blessing may be, as it were buried. But
what gross ingratitude it showed, to allege as a crime against Moses, God's
minister, that deliverance, which was so extraordinary an act of His kindness!
In the next place, they reproach him with having brought them into the desert,
to die: and this they enlarge upon in the next verse, and maliciously inquire,
Where is the truth of the promises? At length they conclude that Moses is
impudent in his deceptions, inasmuch as it plainly appears that the people had
been imposed upon by him: as if it were his fault that they had deprived
themselves of the possession of the promised land. Moses had exhorted them, by
God's command, to enter upon the inheritance promised to them: what dishonesty
and petulance, therefore, was it, when they had shut the door against
themselves, to complain of Moses, upon whom it had not depended that they were
not in the enjoyment of fields and vineyards! In the third place, they taunt
Moses with seeking to domineer over a free people. He did indeed preside over
them; but how far short of dominion was that moderate control, which was as
onerous to Moses, as it was advantageous to the whole people! But this is the
condition of God's servants, that their course is through reproaches,

nor did intemperate feelings, if he was at all tempted by them, prevail.
Assuredly, it appears probable, from the context, that he was inflamed with holy
ardor; since he executes the vengeance of God, as His lawful minister, so that
it is plain he neither spoke nor did anything but at the dictation of the
Spirit. Nay, we shall soon see that, although he was anxious with regard to the
public safety, he required that but a few offenders should be punished, and not
that the multitude should perish. Nor does his anger burst forth into revilings:
as those, who are carried away by excess, usually assail the enemies by whom
they are injured, with their tongue as well as their hands: but he betakes
himself to God; nor does he ask more than flint they may be brought to shame in
their pride. This is, indeed, expounded generally, by many, as if Moses desired
that God should have no mercy upon them; but inasmuch as the decision of the
quarrel depended on the approbation or rejection by God of rite offering they
were about to make, he does not seem to me to pray for more than that God, by
refusing their polluted gift, should thus chastise their ambition. At the same
time also he shows that his prayer springs from the confidence of a good
conscience, when he dares to testify before God that he had injured no man. Now
this was the extreme of integrity and disinterestedness, that, when the people
owed everything to him, he had not taken even the value of a single ass as the
reward of all his labors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto
Korah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The idea of Moses is not to make
an experiment as if in a doubtful matter; but, being assured by the Spirit of
prophecy what the event would be, he summons Korah before the tribunal of God,
that he may receive the sentence of condemnation which he deserves. Nor does he
inveigle him so as to destroy him unawares, but rather still endeavors to cure
his madness, if it were possible to do so. For the sacred incense-offering was
calculated to inspire him with alarm, lest, by rashly attempting more than was
lawful, he should effect his own destruction, especially after so memorable an
example had been made in the case of Nadab and Abihu. Moses, however, in
reliance on God's command, does not hesitate to engage in an open contest, in
order that the judgment of God might be the more
conspicuous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they took every man his
censer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is manifest how greatly they
were blinded by pride, since, although admonished both by the confidence of
Moses and also by the previous examples, they still obstinately go forward.
Surely if any spark of the fear of God had remained in them, their censers would
straightway have fallen from their hands; but Korah seems to have sought, as it
were, deliberately how he might cast aside all fear, and totally bereave himself
of his senses. For in the next verse, Moses narrates how ostentatiously he
hardened himself in his rebellion, before he should offer the incense; for he
gathered the people together to his party, in order that the magnificence of his
array might overwhelm the grace of God, which opposed[ him. Herein also his
senselessness is clearly seen, when he seeks to fortify himself against God by
the favor of the, mob, as if he had desired to extinguish the light of the sun
by interposing a little smoke. Now, let us learn so to condemn his folly, as
that nothing similar may happen in ourselves; for all ambitious persons are
affected by the same disease. They collect their forces by endeavoring to
ingratiate themselves with men; and, if the world approves of' them, they are
inebriated with such fatal confidence, as to spit at the very clouds. But we
shall soon see how God, by a single breath, dissipates all their ungodly
conspiracies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On the other side, the levity of
the people is set before our eyes. For some time they had been all accustomed to
the duly-appointed priesthood, which they knew to be instituted by God; yet only
a single night is required to make them revolt to Korah. And, in fact, as we are
by nature slow to act aright, so also we are carried away to evil in a moment,
as soon as some villain lifts up his
finger.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Separate yourselves from among
this congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again does God
declare that He will bear the people's great impiety no longer, but will destroy
them all to a man. Just, therefore, as he had commanded Lot to depart from
Sodom, nay, had drawn him out by the hand of the angel, when He desired to
destroy that city, so He now commands Moses and Aaron to give Him room to
exercise His wrath. In this He declares His extraordinary favor towards them; as
if He were not free to execute vengeance, until they had gone out of the way,
lest the destruction should reach themselves. In speaking thus, however, He does
not absolutely affirm what He had determined in His secret counsel, but only
pronounces what the authors of this wickedness had deserved. It is, therefore,
just as if He were ascending His judgment-seat. Thus Moses by his intercession
by no means changed His eternal decree; but, by appeasing Him, delivered the
people from the punishment they had merited. In the same sense God is said to be
influenced by our prayers; not that after the manner of men He assumes new
feelings, but, in order to show the more than paternal love with which he honors
us, He, as it were, indulges us, when He listens to our desires. Hence we gather
that even by this express denunciation Moses was not prohibited from praying;
because his faith in the adoption of the people was not destroyed. For we have
already said that this principle, that the covenant which God had made with
Abraham could not be made void, was so thoroughly an-graven upon his mind, that
it surmounted whatever obstacles might present themselves. Resting, therefore,
on the gratuitous promise, which depended not on men, his prayer was the
offspring of faith. For the saints do not always reason accurately and subtlety
as to the form of their prayers; but, after they have once embraced that which
suffices to awaken in them confidence in prayer, viz., God's word, their whole
attention is so directed to it, that they pass over the things which seem
apparently to contradict it. Nor can we doubt but that it was God's design, when
He delivered his terrible sentence as to the destruction of the people, to
quicken the earnestness of Moses in prayer, since necessity more and more
inflames the zeal of the pious. In short, Moses was always consistent in his
care for the well-being of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>

There is no question but that Moses applies this epithet to God in connection
with the present matter; as if he desired to induce God to preserve His own
work, just as a potter spares the vessels formed by himself. To the same effect
is the prayer of Isaiah:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"But now,
O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all
are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very sore,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
64:8, 9:)</font><br><font face="Palatino">for hence he alleges a reason why God
should relent, and be inclined to mercy. There is this difference, that Isaiah
refers to that special grace wherewith God had embraced His people, whereas
Moses carries his address further, viz., to the general grace of creation. It is
of little importance whether we choose to expound this 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with reference to all animals, or only to the human race, since Moses merely
prays that, since God is the Creator and Maker of the world, He should not
destroy the men whom He has formed, but rather have pity upon them, as being His
work. In passing, however, we may infer from this passage, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f96</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that all (men) have their separate souls, for God is not said to have inspired
all flesh with life, but to have created their spirits. Hence the monstrous
delusion of the Manicheans is refuted, that our souls are so infused by the
transmission of the Spirit of God, as that there should still be only one
spirit. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But if it be preferred to include the animals, we must mark the grades of
distinction between the spirit of man and the spirit of a dog or an ass. It is,
however, more fitting to restrict it to
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto the congregation,
saying.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is evident, from this answer,
that Moses was heard as regarded the general preservation of the people, on
condition, however, that they should give proof of their repentance, by
deserting the authors of the wicked rebellion; for, when God commands them to
retire from amongst them, He indirectly implies, that, if they remain mixed up
with them, they shall share in the same destruction. Yet it is probable that the
elders who "followed" Moses, held to his side, and continued firm in the
performance of their duty. And, indeed, it is not at all consistent that Caleb
and Joshua, and such like, were ever drawn away into so great a sin. We must
not, therefore, take what is said of the whole congregation without exception.
When Moses, in his delivery of God's command, does not address Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram by their names, but calls them "these wicked men," it is not the
reviling of anger, but an urgent mode of exhortation; for, had he not thus
vehemently marked his detestation of them, there was danger lest his words
should have been but coldly received by many, and lest they should have been of
little avail. To the same effect also is what he immediately adds: "Lest ye be
consumed in all their sins;"<i> </i>as if tie had said, Lest the contagion of so
many and such great crimes should infect yourselves. Since they obeyed Moses, it
is plain that many of the multitude had been carried away before by folly and
levity, for deliberate iniquity would not have been so quickly or so easily
corrected. But on the other hand, the marvelous stolidity of Dathan and Abiram
is described, in that they came forth unawed, with their wives and children.
Still it is not to be doubted but that they were terrified, after they saw
themselves to be stripped of all aid and favor; but although the withdrawal of
the people disturbed them, they nevertheless stood like maniacs; nor did fear
subdue them or prevent them from proceeding in their fatal audacity to their
doom. Thus 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do the wicked often stand astounded, yet in their fear they by no means think of
appeasing God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now begins more clearly to
show wherefore he has brought the rebels to this open contest, viz., that God
may sanction before the whole people, by a terrible exertion of His power, the
system established by Himself. For it was no ordinary effort of confidence to
concede the victory to His enemies, unless the earth should swallow them up
alive. But, inasmuch as this was to be a most conspicuous judgment of God, he
arouses their attention by the striking words he uses. If they should be cut off
by a sudden death, he would have justly boasted that his cause was approved by
God; but not content with this, he desires to be accounted a mere impostor, if
they should die the common death of men. In order to express the strangeness of
the miracle, whereby men's senses should be ravished, he employs the word
<i>create</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>emphatically; as much as to say, that the mode of their death would be no
less unusual than as if God should add something to His creation, and change the
face of the world. Thus David, when he prays that his enemies should go down
alive into hell <i>(infernos) </i>or the grave, seems to allude to this history,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
55:23;) for although that descent be understood to mean sudden death overtaking
the wicked in a moment in the midst of their happiness and security, still, he
at the same time indicates by it this horrible retribution, which had occurred
in times past, inasmuch as memorable punishments pass into proverbial instances
of God's wrath.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all Israel that were round
about them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must suppose that the

separation (from this wicked company.)   
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f100</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
That they should now fly in confusion, lest the same destruction should
overwhelm themselves, is a sign of their bad conscience, which is always
troubled in itself, and agitates the wicked with sore inquietude. It is needful,
indeed, that even the pious should be alarmed by God's judgments, in order that
their consternation or dread should instruct them 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f101</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in his holy fear, and therefore they never reflect without dread on the
punishments which God has inflicted upon the crimes of men. But, since
hypocrites carry in their hearts a hot iron, as it were, they fall down like
dead men, as if the lightning fell from God upon their own heads. Thus we shall
presently see that this blind fear profited them but
little.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there came out a fire from
the Lord. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The diver-sky of the punishments had
the effect of awakening more astonishment in the people, than as if all had been
destroyed in the same manner, although God's anger raged more fiercely against
the original authors of the evil, so as to make it manifest that each received a
recompense according to the measure of his iniquity. He says that a fire went
forth from Jehovah, because it was not kindled naturally, nor accidentally, but
was accompanied by conspicuous marks, which showed that it was sent by Him. Yet
I do not reject the opinions of others, viz., that God thundered from heaven,
since thus His power would have been more manifestly
exerted.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto Eleazar the son of
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since there is no manifestation
of God's wrath so conspicuous as not to be forgotten too often by man's
stupidity, God was willing to anticipate this evil, and set up a monument for
posterity, lest the recollection of this memorable judgment should ever be
obscured. He commands, therefore, that a covering for the altar should be made
of the censers, in order that none should rashly intrude himself to make the
sacred offerings. When He calls them <i>"hallowed," </i>some understand that it
was sinful to transfer them to profane purposes, because they had once been
devoted to the service of God. I am, however, rather of opinion that they were
set apart <i>(sacratas) </i>as things accursed <i>(anathemata.) </i>Thus the
fire which had been upon them is scattered afar, in order that the altar should
be cleansed from its pollution. Although, however, there was the same pollution
in the censers, yet God would have them preserved as accursed, so that all
posterity might understand that none but the priests were to be admitted to the
sacrifices. Nor is it superfluous for Him to speak of the rebels as having acted
criminally "against their own souls;" but it was in order that the memory of
their punishment might be inn manner engraved upon those brazen enclosures, in
order to awaken continued dread.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be a memorial unto the
children of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage again
confirms what I have just said, that God's judgments, which ought to remain in
full remembrance in every age, straightway escape, and are blotted out front
men's minds, unless they are provided with certain aids to meditate upon them.
This, however, does not happen so much from ignorance as neglect. Wherefore we
ought to be the more attentive to the aids to memory, which may retain us in the
path of duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But on the morrow all the
congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is something more
than monstrous in this madness of theirs. The conflagration was yet smoking,
wherein God had appeared as the awful avenger of pride: the chasm in which the
leaders of the rebellion had been swallowed up, must still have been almost
before their eyes. God had commanded the plates to be molten, which might record
that severe judgment through many succeeding ages. All had confessed by their
alarm and hasty flight that there was danger lest they should themselves also be
exposed to similar punishments. Yet, on the next day, am if they desired
deliberately to provoke God, who was still, as it were, armed, they accuse God's
holy servants of having been the authors of the destruction, though they had
never lifted a finger against their enemies. Was it in the power of Moses to
command the earth to open? Could he draw down the fire from heaven at his will?
Since, then, both the chasm and the fire were manifest tokens of God's wonderful
power, why do not these madmen reflect that they are engaging in fatal warfare
against Him? For to what purpose was this extraordinary mode of punishment,
except that in their terror they might learn to humble themselves beneath God's
hand? Yet hence did they only derive greater wildness in their audacity, as if
they desired to perish voluntarily with these sinners, whose punishment they had
just been shuddering at. In two ways they betray their senselessness; first, by
substituting Moses and Aaron as guilty of the murder, in place of God; and,
secondly, by sanctifying these putrid corpses, as if in despite of God. They
accuse Moses and Aaron of the slaughter, of which God had plainly shown Himself
to be the author, as they themselves had been compelled to feel. But such is the
blindness of the reprobate with respect to God's works, that His glory rather
stupifies them than excites their admiration. The foulest ingratitude was also
added; for they do not consider that only a very few hours had elapsed since
they had been preserved by the intercession of Moses from impending destruction.
Thus, in their desire to avenge the death of a few, they call those the killers
of the people of the Lord, to whom they ought to have been grateful for the
safety of all. Again, what arrogance it is to count among the people of God, as
if against His will, those reprobates, when He had not only cut them off from
His Church, but had also exterminated them from the world, and from the human
race! But thus do the wicked wax wanton against God under the very cover of His
gifts, and especially they do not hesitate to mock Him with empty titles and
outward signs, as the masks of their
iniquity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass when the
congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From the fact that Moses
and Aaron were protected by the covering of the cloud, we gather how
uncontrollable was the rage of the people. For, although the glory of God only
stood over the tabernacle, so that Moses and Aaron were still exposed to
stoning, and any other acts of violence, yet it so dazzled the eyes of these
wicked men, that they could not touch the holy persons. Nor can we doubt but
that they betook themselves to the sanctuary, because, in the extremity of their
danger, the only hope that remained to them was in the help of God. When,
therefore, they had fled to this sacred asylum, God received them under the
shadow of His wings. Thus did He testify, that the prayers and hopes of His
people are never in vain, but that He succors them whenever they call upon Him.
For although, now-a-days, He does not appear in a visible abode, still He is
nigh unto all those who cast their cares upon Him. It might, indeed, have been
the case that the sign of God's glory was seen by none but Moses and Aaron, in
order that they might be fully assured that God was near to help them; but,
since the expression is indefinite, it is probable that God threatened also the
frantic multitude, lest they should proceed to any further acts of violence,
although the light was presented in vain to them in their
blindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>45.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Get you up from among this
congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have expounded the
meaning of this expression a little above, namely, that as God regards His
people with constant and peculiar love, so He defers His vengeance against the
wicked, until these people are set apart, and placed in safety. For tie declares
that, as soon as Moses and Aaron have secured themselves, all the rest shall
perish in a moment. But incredible was the kindness of both of them, thus humbly
to intercede for so ungrateful a people, who deserved to die a hundred times
over; for, forgetful of their own lives, which they saw to be imperiled, they
were ready to make atonement for the guilt, so as to rescue from death those
abandoned wretches who were plotting their destruction. I do not, however,
understand this, <i>"Get </i>you up," merely with reference to place, for they
were already separated, having taken refuge in the tabernacle; but it is just as
if God had commanded them to sever themselves from the people, and, quitting
them altogether, and casting away all care for the public welfare, to provide
for their own private safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>46.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The expiation of so great a sin
did not indeed depend on the incense-offering, nor are we to imagine that God is
appeased by the savor of frankincense; but thus was a symbol set before this
grosshearted people, whereby they might be alike aroused to repentance and
faith; for however insensible they might be in their rebellion, yet the dignity
of the priesthood was so conspicuous in the censer, that they ought to have been
awakened by it to reverence. For who would not view his impiety with horror,
when he is made conscious of having despised and violated that sanctity wherein
the Divine power displays itself for life or death? The sight of the censer
might have justly availed to subdue their hardness of heart, so that at last
they might begin to condemn and detest their unrighteous act. The second warning
which it gave them was no less profitable, <i>i.e., </i>that they might perceive
that God was only propitiated towards them by virtue of a mediator; but., in so
far as the actual state of things allowed, the visible type directed them to the
absent Savior. Since, however, men corrupt and obscure the truth by their fond
inventions, His majesty is asserted by the Divine institution of sacrifice.
Whilst Aaron, the typical priest, stands forth, until the true, and only, and
perpetual Mediator shall be revealed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The verb

men through the medium of an expiation <i>(piaculum;) </i>but, since here it
refers to the people, the sense of Moses is rightly expressed by a single word,
as one may say, to purge, or lustrate from
pollution.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>48.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he stood between the
living and the dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If <i>you

conjecture that God's wrath did not so fall upon one part of the camp, as to
destroy all that came in its way without exception, as had been the case in the
other revolt, but that He selected those who had sinned most grievously. But it
is probable that Aaron proceeded so far as to leave behind those who still
remained uninjured, and, in the very place where the destruction had occurred,
encountered the wrath of God, and arrested its course. Hence it was that both
the fervor of his zeal might be the better perceived, and his office of
appeasing God was more fully confirmed by its actual success. For what more
evident miracle could be required, than when the slaughter, which had both begun
to rage suddenly, and then to proceed in a course no less rapid than continuous,
was stopped by the arrival of Aaron, exactly as if a hedge had been set up
against it? The efficacy of the priesthood in propitiating God, is therefore
both clearly and briefly set before us; and hence we are taught, that though we
are so dose to the reprobate when they perish, as that their destruction should
reach to ourselves, still that we shall be safe from all evil, if only Christ
intercede for us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>49.</b>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spoke unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Howsoever stubborn the Israelites
might be, yet their hardness of heart being now subdued, and their pride broken
down, they ought to have acknowledged the authority of the priesthood, and to
have perpetually held it in pious reverence. But it is plain from the
confirmation of it, which is now added, that they were not yet thoroughly
overcome. For God never appoints anything in vain; the remedy, therefore, was
necessary, that He now applied to that disease of obstinacy which He perceived
still to maintain its secret hold upon their hearts. Herein we also behold His
inestimable goodness, when He not only had regard to the relief of their
infirmity, but even struggled with their depravity and perverseness, in order to
restore them to their senses. In the same way also He now deals with us, for he
not only strengthens the weakness of our faith by many aids, but He puts
constraint upon our light and inconstant minds, and retains us in the path of
duty though we strive against Him. He likewise anticipates our willfulness, so
as to keep us from growing presumptuous, or rouses us up when we are disposed to
be slothful. In fact, his our business so to apply to our use whatever helps to
faith and piety He sets before us, as to be assured that they are so many pieces
of evidence to convict us of unbelief Although, therefore, the majesty of the
priesthood had been already sufficiently, and more than sufficiently
established, still God saw float in the extreme perversity of the people there
would be no end to their murmurs and rebellions, unless the final ratification
were added, and that, too, in a season of repose, inasmuch as, whilst the
sedition was in progress, they were not so disposed and ready to learn. By this
confirmation, then, He set aside whatever doubts could at any time arise, when
Aaron's rod, severed as it was from the tree, was the only one of the twelve
which blossomed. For it was no natural circumstance that a branch which derived
no sap from the root, and which at that season of the year would have been dry
upon the tree, should produce flowers and fruit, when it was east before the Ark
of the Covenant, whilst the others, although altogether similar, remained dry
and dead.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto the children of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They are mistaken who suppose
that to the twelve rods there was another added for the tribe of Levi; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, since there was no question here as to the possession of the land, there
was no occasion at all for the division of the tribe of Joseph into two parts.
We know, too, that it was endowed with a double portion, because the Levites had
no inheritance; and in this case the circumstances were different, because all
the other tribes were contending for the priesthood with the tribe of Levi
alone. Hence it was, then, that rods were given to each of them, in accordance
with the origin of their race. But, when Aaron's rod is said to have been "in
the midst of them," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f104</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is in the usual phrase of the Hebrew language, because it was mixed with them
as one of their number. And this is expressly stated, to show us that all ground
for caviling might be taken from the ungodly, <i>since </i>all the rods were
east promiscuously into the same bundle, so that none should be distinguished
above the others, and thus nothing could be ascribed to the collusion of men. If
any should object that by these means the rivalry was not extinguished which the
other Levites had with the house of Aaron, since his own name alone was
inscribed upon the rod, so that there would be no comparison between the
families; I reply, that since the power of God manifested itself distinctly in
the name of Aaron, the rejection of the others was sufficiently shown forth by
his election; for, if this honor had been common to the others, God would have
defrauded them by giving distinction to him alone. Besides, no other plan could
have been adopted for putting an end to this quarrel; for if there had been
several rods for one tribe, the whole people would have complained of the
inequality. It was necessary, then, that all should be brought to the contest on
equal terms, so that the difference between them might be seen to depend upon
God's good pleasure. But if the name of Levi had been inscribed, all its
families would have claimed the right of succession, as if common to them all.
There was, therefore, no other course open but that God should prefer to the
whole people one individual chosen from amongst the members of his own kindred
and tribe.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt lay them up in
the tabernacle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The place itself had not
a little to do with the effectual decision of the matter; because it was clearly
manifested that God was the author of the miracle, and consequently that the
priesthood proceeded from Him. For we have elsewhere said that the whole
government of the Church so entirely depends upon His decree, that men are not
permitted to interfere with it. Wherefore He set the ark of the covenant in
opposition to the voices of the whole people, in order to testify that no
further dispute was to be raised respecting the priest, whom He had appointed by
His own declaration and authority. At the same time, it had the effect of
consoling the people, and silencing their complaints that the rods of all the
tribes were brought in common into the sanctuary before God; for, although a
peculiar dignity was accorded to that of Aaron alone, still the people ceased
not to be a priestly kingdom. Hence it follows, that the honorable privilege
conferred on one family contributed to the public welfare of all; so far was it
from being the case that their inferiority ought to have caused them pain or
envy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass,
that the man's rod.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Aaron, indeed, had
been previously chosen; but the expression here refers to his manifestation; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because God is said again to choose those, whom He has chosen by His secret
counsel, when He brings them forth into the sight of men with their peculiar
marks of distinction; and this not once only, but as often as he confirms their
election by new indications. And this seems to be spoken of by way of
concession, as if God would pass over all His former decrees, and invite the
people afresh to take cognizance of the matter. With this view tie states that
He will put an end to all the malevolent and noisy detractions of the people, so
that Aaron may henceforth exercise his office without controversy; for, although
not even thus was their perverseness altogether cured, still their insolence was
restrained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass, that on
the morrow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without cause
that, the time is notified, for by no skill could it be brought about that a rod
should blossom in the lapse of a single night. Again, all suspicion of fraud was
removed by the fact that Moses departed when he had placed the rods in the
sanctuary, and, returning on the next day, brought out the bundle of rods before
them all. But in this respect was the power of God principally shown forth, that
in so short a space of time not only flowers, but fruits also, were formed upon
a dry bough, which could not have occurred but by the reversal of the order of
nature. And further, the time of year is to be taken into account, which was by
no means in accordance with such maturity, Now, by this miracle the dignity of
the typical priesthood was undoubtedly ratified to the ancient people under the
Law; but, in so much as the truth itself is more excellent than its figure or
image, the intention of God unquestionably was to assert the priesthood of His
only-begotten Son rather than that of Aaron. Hence the profit to be derived from
this miracle most especially pertains to us,("Nous appartient plus qu'aux
Juifs;" pertains to us more than to the Jews. &#8212; <i>Fr</i>.) in order that
we may embrace the Priest presented to us by God with the veneration He
deserves. I pass by the frivolous allegories 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f106</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in which others take delight. And in fact it ought to be abundantly sufficient
for us, that the power of God which might direct the people to the Mediator,
appeared of old under a visible symbol; but when the Son of God came, whatever
He then represented to their sight was spiritually revealed in Him: for not only
was He a sprout <i>(surculus) </i>from the stem of Jesse, as He is called by
Isaiah
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1); and a stone hewn without the art or labor of man, under which form he was
shown to Daniel
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270234&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:34); but by His resurrection tie was separated from the whole human race. For
this, too, we must diligently observe, that it is not enough that He should
obtain with us the prerogative and title of Priest, unless He is so only and
indivisibly. Hence it is plain that His honor is in the Papacy torn in pieces by
foul and intolerable sacrilege, when they invent innumerable
mediators.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What God had prescribed
concerning the censers, He now commands as to the rod, <i>i.e., </i>that it
should be preserved as a monument for future ages; because men are forgetful and
slow to consider His works, and not only so, but because they bury their memory
as if of deliberate malice, he bids, therefore, and not without reproach, that
this sign should be laid up in safety, saying, that this is done on account of
their perverseness. At the same time, however, He commends His paternal love and
pity, in that, whilst tie chastises their pride, He provides for their welfare.
For, as they were given to rebellion, they would still have provoked His wrath
by new murmurings. He says, then, that He anticipates them, and restrains their
impetuous fury, lest they should die. Thus in humbling us, tie not only punishes
our transgressions, but tie has regard to what is profitable for us, and proves
that He cares for us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Israel
spoke unto Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was indeed somewhat
better to be alarmed by admiration of God's power than as if they had despised
it in brutal stupidity; but there is a medium between torpor or obstinacy, and
consternation. It is true that believers tremble at the judgments of God, and,
in proportion as each of us has advanced in piety, so we are the more affected
by a sense of His anger. But this fear humbles believers in such a manner that
they nevertheless seek after God; whilst the reprobate so tremble as fretfully
to desire to drive God far away from them. Hence it arose that the Israelites,
stunned as it were by God's severity, which they deemed excessive, deplored
their wretched lot; for, inasmuch as they had no sense of God's goodness, the
chastisement to them was like a gibbet rather than a medicine. They exclaim,
therefore, that they are destroyed, because God so severely avenges His polluted
worship; as if all such instances of rigor were not profitable for the purpose
of rendering them more heedful and cautious. No doubt this servile fear
sometimes prepares men for repentance; but nothing is more perilous than to rest
in it, because it first engenders bitterness and indignation, and at length
drives them to despair, Howsoever formidable, then, may be God's severity, let
us learn at the same time to apprehend His mercy, so that we may be prepared to
endure willingly with meek and quiet minds the punishments which we have
deserved. In short, this passage shows how little progress the Israelites had
made, since the rods of God so greatly exasperated them, that they cut
themselves off from all hope of salvation. For this is the meaning of the words,
"Shall we be consumed with dying?" as if it were not the case that God, on the
contrary, was preserving them from death, when in His paternal solicitude He
warned them of their danger.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then came the children of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the twenty-third chapter of
this book many intermediate stations are mentioned, which are not here referred
to: perhaps because, from the time that God compelled them to draw back, <i>they
</i>had made no advance for thirty whole years, but had wandered about by
circuitous paths. In connecting the history, therefore, in this place he relates
that they passed from the desert of Paran to the desert of Sin; because they
then began to direct their journey straight towards the land of Canaan, and to
advance more closely to it, so as at length to conclude their wanderings. When
he tells us that Miriam died here, we may infer from hence that her life was
greatly prolonged. It is probable that she was a girl of ten or twelve years of
age, when Moses was born, since she was able to provide adroitly for his safety,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
2:4;) for although her name is not actually given, yet it may be reasonably
supposed that she was the person who fetched her mother to nurse the child that
had been exposed. She reached the age, then, of about 130 years, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f107</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
an unusual length of life, and especially for a
woman.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there was no water for
the congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have already seen a
similar, though not the same, history. For, when the people had hardly come out
of Egypt, they began to rebel in Rephidim on account of the scarcity of water;
and now, after thirty-eight years, or thereabouts, a new sedition arose in
Kadesh, because there, too, they wanted water. Their first murmuring, indeed,
sufficiently showed how great was their depravity and contumacy; for, when God
gave them their food from heaven every day, why did they not supplicate Him for
water, so that their sustenance might be complete? Yet, not less with foul
ingratitude than with impious refractoriness, they assail God with reproaches,
and complain that they are deceived and betrayed. But this second rebellion is
far worse; for, when they had experienced that it was in God's power to extract
plenty of water from the barren rock, why do they not now implore His aid? why
does not that marvelous interference in their behalf recur to their minds? Yet,
in their madness, they clamor that they have been more cruelly dealt with than
as if they had been swallowed up by the earth, or consumed by fire from heaven,
as if there were no remedy for their thirst. Assuredly this was incredible
stupidity, designedly, as it were, to shut the gate of God's grace, and to east
themselves into despair. It is true that they rebel against Moses and Aaron; but
they direct their complaints like darts against God Himself. They deem it a very
great injustice that they had been brought into the desert, as if they had not
in their own impious obstinacy themselves preferred the desert to the land of
Canaan, and were deserving, therefore, of pining, in want of all things, to
death itself. Perversely, then, do they throw the blame, which belongs to
themselves alone, upon the ministers of their salvation. With truth, indeed, do
they call the place evil and barren; but God would not have wished to keep them
imprisoned there, unless they had voluntarily refused the land flowing with milk
and honey, after it had been set before their eyes, and an easy entrance to it
had been accorded to them under the guidance and authority of God. Thus the
Prophet, in Psalm 105, in recounting the history of their redemption, before he
descends to the punishments inflicted upon their sins, relates that they were
brought forth by God "with joy" and "with gladness." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But, further, taking occasion from the inconvenience they experienced from
thirst, they maliciously heap together other complaints. There was no lack of
food to satisfy their hunger, and such as was pleasant to the taste; yet they
complain exactly as if hunger oppressed them as well as thirst. God daily rained
for them food from heaven, which it was mere sport for them to gather; but the
ground of their murmuring is that they had not to fatigue themselves with
ploughing and sowing. Behold to what senselessness men are driven by
preposterous lust, and by contempt of God's present blessings! The climax of
their madness, however, is that they lament their fate in not having been
swallowed up with Korah and his companions, or consumed by fire from heaven.
They had been overwhelmed with great fear at that melancholy spectacle; and
justly so, for God had exhibited a prodigy, terrible throughout all ages. Now
they quarrel with Him because His lightnings did not smite them also. Nor do
they only lament that they were not destroyed by that particular kind of death,
but they willfully provoke God's vengeance upon their heads, which ought to have
terrified them more than a hundred deaths: for it is emphatically added, that
those, with whom they desired to be associated, had "died <i>before the Lord."
</i>They acknowledge, therefore, that the destruction, which they imprecate upon
themselves, had come to pass not by chance, but by the manifest judgement of
God, as if they were angry with God for having spared themselves. Most truly do
they call them their <i>brethren, </i>to whom they were only too like; yet is it
in brutal arrogance that they desire to be accounted God's Church; for, whilst
they professedly connect themselves with the adverse faction, they arrogate
falsely this title to themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron went from
the presence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that they
fled in fear, inasmuch as the tabernacle was a kind of refuge for them from the
violence of the people. Still, we may conjecture from other passages that they
had consideration not only for themselves, but for the wretched people,
howsoever unworthy of it they might be so also, when they throw themselves upon
their faces, I understand that they did so, not so much (to pray) that God would
protect them from the wrath of their enemies, but also that He would calm these
madmen by some appropriate remedy. Still their agitation appears to have been
such as to deprive them of their ordinary self-restraint. Neither, indeed, does
God try their faith and patience, as He often did on other occasions; perhaps
because He saw that they were too much overwhelmed to be able to persevere
inflexibly in pious zeal, patience, and care for the public good. Consequently
the appearance to them of God's glory was a support for their weakness, as in a
case of extremity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This example shows us how
earnestly God should be entreated constantly to support us with new supplies of
His grace, since otherwise the boldest of us all would fail at every moment. The
invincible resolution of Moses had so often overcome every obstacle, that there
seemed to be no fear of his being in danger of falling; yet the conqueror in so
many struggles at length stumbles in a single act. Hence we should more
carefully bear in mind the exhortation of Paul:
Because</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"it is God which worketh in
us both to will and to do of his good pleasure," we should "work out our own
salvation with fear and trembling."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;503512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
2:12, 13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take the
rod.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is unquestionable that the faith
of Moses had now begun to waver; but we gather from his prompt obedience that it
had not altogether failed; for he wastes no time in discussion, but comes
straight to the rock in order that he may perform God's command. His faith,
then, was only so smothered, that its hidden rigor at once directed him to his
duty. Thus is it that the saints sometimes, whilst they totter like children,
still advance toward their mark.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the sight of
"the rod," God would recall both to Moses and the people so many miracles, which
were well fitted to awaken confidence for the future; just as if He were
uplifting the standard of His power. The command to speak to the rock is not
unattended with a severe reproach, as if He had said, that in the lifeless
elements there was more reason and intelligence than in men themselves. And
assuredly it was a thing much to be ashamed of, that the rock, as if it could
hear and was endued with sense, should obey God's voice, whilst the people, to
whom the Law had been given, remained in deafness and
stupidity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron gathered the
congregation together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no doubt
but that Moses was perplexed between hope and doubt, so that, although he
committed the event to God, he was still to a certain extent oppressed with
anxiety; for he would never have been so ready and prompt in obeying, and
especially in such an unusually arduous matter, if he had been without faith.
Aaron and himself had recently hidden themselves in alarm; it was, therefore, a
task of no slight difficulty straightway to call the people, from whom they had
fled, and voluntarily to encounter their madness. Thus far, then, we see nothing
but a readiness to obey, conjoined with magnanimity, which is deserving of no
common praise; but inasmuch as the unbelief of Moses is condemned by the
heavenly Judge, in whose hands is the sovereign power, and at whose word we all
stand or fall, we must acquiesce in His sentence. We scarcely perceive anything
reprehensible in this matter, yet, since God declares that the fall of Moses
displeased Him, we must abide by His decision rather than our own. And hence,
too, let us learn that our works, on the surface of which nothing but virtue is
apparent, are often abounding in secret defects, which escape the eyes of men,
but are manifest to God alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be asked in
what respect Moses transgressed, the origin of his transgression was unbelief;
for it is not allowable, when this species of sin is expressly referred to in
the answer of God, to imagine that it was anything else. But it is doubtful in
what point he was incredulous; unless it be, that in asking whether he could
fetch water out of the rock, he seems to reject as if it were impossible and
absurd what God had promised to do. And, in fact, he was so entirely taken up by
considerations of their contumacy, that he did not acknowledge the grace of God.
He inquires whether he shall fetch water out of the rock? whereas he ought to
have recollected that this had already been permitted to him by God. It became
him, then, confidently to assert that God had again promised the same thing,
rather than to speak with hesitation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others
think that he sinned, because he was not contented with a single blow, but smote
the rock twice. And this perhaps did arise from distrust. But the origin of the
fault was that he did not simply embrace God's promise, and strenuously
discharge the duty assigned to him as an evidence of his faith. Although,
therefore, his smiting the rock twice might have been a token of his want of
confidence, still it was only an aggravation of the evil, and not its origin or
cause. Thus, then, we must always come back to this, that Moses did not give God
the glory, because he rather considered what the people had deserved, than
estimated the power of God according to His word. And this, too, has previous
reprimand denotes, when, in accusing the Israelites of rebellion, he shows,
indeed, that he was inflamed with holy zeal; yet, at the same time, he does not
bestir himself with suitable confidence in order to their conviction; nay, in a
manner he confesses that the power of God fails beneath their wickedness. Thus
it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A632&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">for the Prophet does not there excuse Moses; but
shows that in consequence of the wickedness of the people, he was carried away
by inconsiderate fervor, so as to deny that what God had promised should take
place. Hence let us learn that, when we are angered by the sins of others, we
should beware lest a temptation of an opposite kind should take possession of
our minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses and
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God here both sets forth their
crime, and pronounces its punishment. Now, whilst unbelief is in itself a gross
and detestable evil, God aggravates its guilt by declaring its consequence,
viz., that He was defrauded of His glory, when Moses and Aaron, who ought to
have been the proclaimers of the miracle, lay as it were confounded with shame.
For, whereas their confidence, by exciting attention, would have sanctified
God's name, so by their mistrust it came to pass that all were led to think that
there was nothing to be hoped from His
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When Moses not only ingenuously
confesses his guilt, but also relates how he was condemned by God, and, in order
that his disgrace may be more complete, introduces Him speaking as from His
judgment-seat, this does not a little tend to establish the truth of his
doctrine. For what human being, unless he had renounced all carnal affections,
would voluntarily endure to declare himself guilty before all the world? His
angelic virtues were sufficient to exempt him from all suspicion. Having erred
in one particular only, he proclaims the disgrace which he might have concealed,
and does not hesitate to disparage himself, in order to magnify the goodness of
God. And surely it is obvious from the passage that, whenever God had before
pardoned the people at the request of Moses, the pardon was no less gratuitous
than as if he had not interceded for them. For the intercession of Moses ceases
on this occasion, yet God does nod; fail to deal kindly with them in their
unworthiness, according to His wont.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

transfers to them the guilt of unfaithfulness, which he had confessed for
himself; but, since he had only fallen in consequence of being overwhelmed by
their obstinate wickedness, he justly reproaches them with the fact that God was
wroth with him on account of their sin. If under this pretext he had attempted
to extenuate his guilt before God, or to substitute their criminality for his
own, he would have done nothing else than double the evil: but, in reproving the
people, he rightly and appropriately complained that the cause of his sin had
arisen from them. As if he had said that they were so perverse that even he had
been corrupted by them, and drawn into association with their guilt and its
punishment. He here, however, adds respecting Joshua what he had before passed
over in silence. His appointment as successor to Moses served to encourage the

His people that they were to leave a country, which was close to them,
untouched, and to seek a more distant place of abode. But God restrains their
impatience for a twofold reason; first, because it was unjust and by no means
humane to assail their kindred; and both these nations were descended from
Isaac, and their original ancestors were twin brothers. Circumcision, too, was
common to them both, a mark of their being' of the same origin, and a bond of
fraternal connection. But the other reason ought to have had more weight in
restraining them, because it was unlawful to cast the children of Esau out of
the possession, which they had obtained by a similar right as that whereby the
land of Canaan had been promised to the posterity of Jacob. If, therefore, they
desired to enjoy their own inheritance, the decree was not to be violated which
God had pronounced by the mouth of Isaac,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012739&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

fixed his home in Mount Seir by the secret inspiration of God, and to that place
had his posterity beck confined. God, therefore, now admonishes them that it
would have been an act of sacrilegious audacity, if the Israelites should

when they presented their request in a friendly manner, they would have a
legitimate cause of war, if Edom should reject their demands. But this further
condition might appear altogether intolerable that they were to do nothing

however, it more fully appears how the Israelites were gradually, and by various
kinds of chastisement, subdued to obedience, whereas they would otherwise have
fiercely and petulantly exclaimed that they had been dealt with unkindly by God;
since thus their condition would be worse than the universal law of nations
allowed. In this matter, then, their wanderings, for eight and thirty years, had
much efficacy in bringing them back to the right
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Numbers 20:14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou knowest all the travel
that hath befallen us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This preface was
well calculated to conciliate favor, when the sons of Jacob, descended from the
same blood, familiarly approached the Edomites: for their connection ought to
have rendered them hospitable. But there are two principal points whereby Moses
endeavored to influence the mind of the king of Edom, so that he should grant
them a passage through his dominions. The first is derived from the ordinary
feelings of humanity; for nature dictates that aid should be extended to the
wretched, who are unjustly oppressed. In this view, he says, that the
afflictions which they had endured were notorious; viz., that as sojourners in
Egypt they had been tyrannically harassed and oppressed. In saying that "the
Egyptians vexed us and our fathers," although they were not, at that time,
endowed with capacity for estimating the injuries inflicted upon them 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f114</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet it is not without reason that they complain that these injuries had been
inflicted on themselves, which affected their whole body and name, especially
since the final act of cruelty directly concerned them, when Pharaoh commanded
all the male infants to be destroyed. The second argument is more effective:
since nothing can be less in accordance with propriety than to deny our
assistance to those whoso welfare God recommends to us by His own example. In
order, then, that they may obtain help from their brethren, they make mention of
the grace of God, which at that time might have been everywhere celebrated.
When, therefore, this message is given to their ambassadors, We cried unto the
Lord, who hath heard us, their design was to exhort the Edomites to be imitators
of God, who had been merciful in delivering His people. If any should object
that the cry of the people had not been praiseworthy, as not having arisen from
a true and sincere faith, nor from a serious feeling of the heart, the reply is
easy. that the Israelites were not here boasting of any merit of their own, as
if they had prayed duly and perfectly, but that they were simply professing
their innocence, since they could not have had recourse to God, unless they had
been unjustly oppressed. The fact, then, that God had heard them, had the effect
of commending their cause. They prove, however, from the result, that God was
their deliverer: because their exodus had been incredible; although this point
is but lightly touched upon.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Their notion is a
poor one, who understand Moses by "the angel:" since by this name they
unquestionably magnify the miracles which God had wrought.

Now, although the angels encamp around the servants of God &#8212; and it is
certain that many angels had been the ministers of the people's safety &#8212;
still they especially designate, as the angel, Him who had been often before
called Jehovah, and in whom the, majesty of God perfectly shone forth. Paul,
however, teaches that he was Christ.

the ambassadors were sent a second time, in order to remove all unjust
suspicions, and to appease the ferocity (of the Edomites.) It is probable,
however, that we have the relation of what was done in one and the same
expedition. The sum is, that the Israelites tried every means, in order that a
free and unmolested passage might be accorded them by the Edomites: whence their
repulse might appear the more harsh and intolerable. But God, by this test,
would prove the obedience of His people. As regards the Edomites, although by
rashly taking up arms they would have drawn upon themselves just destruction,
still God spared them for a time; not by freely pardoning them, but by deferring
their punishment, as He is wont to do, until its due
season.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Deuteronomy 2:7</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord thy God hath

the people should be grieved at spending their money, of which they had not
much, in buying meat and drink. There are, however, two clauses; first, that
they were so enriched by God's bounty, that they were fully supplied with the
means of buying food; and, secondly, that they must not doubt but that He would
relieve their necessity, if it were required, since He had thus far provided for
them, and had not suffered them to want anything. He, therefore, encourages them
to hope, in consideration of their past experience; because God would take care
of them, as tie had before been accustomed to
do.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question, however, arises, how God could
say, that He had blessed the work of their hands, when they had had no commerce
with other nations, so as to make the smallest gains whatever. But I thus
understand it, viz., that although they were gratuitously sustained in the
wilderness, and had not expended a single penny in buying even shoelatchets,
still their cattle had increased, and, besides, they had made some profits by
their daily labor; not by receiving, indeed, daily wages, but by providing for
themselves furniture and other necessaries.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spoke unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>First of all, in the death of
Aaron, we must consider the execution of the sentence, whereby he had been
condemned; for God wished to show that He had not threatened either him or Moses
in vain, with what then occurred, as children are wont to be threatened. If
Aaron had died without any such prediction, since he might have seemed from his
extreme age to have but discharged the debt of nature, as it is called, the
people might have been so overcome by their grief, as to have no inclination to
proceed. But now, when, in the death of one man, the condemnation of their
public and common guilt is clearly manifested, such great severity on God's part
against the high-priest, who had before propitiated God towards them all by his
intercession, must have been a very sharp spur to them all. For it must needs
have suggested itself to them, that God was no longer to be trifled with, before
whom not even this sacred dignity could escape punishment. This was the reason
why Aaron was called forth to die in the sight of all, that the survivors might
learn to live to God, inasmuch as He instructed them to obey by this notable
example. For the rebuke is added not so much for the sake of Moses and Aaron,
viz., that they should not enter the land, because they had been rebellious
against God's word, as that the people might perceive that they deserved to
perish ten times over; since, by their contumacy, they had exasperated the holy
men, so that in the excess of their zeal they had almost fallen away from the
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take Aaron and Eleazar his
son.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Aaron's successor was to be
designated whilst he was himself still living; first of all, that the perpetuity
of the priesthood might be secured; and, secondly, lest the people, with their
usual temerity, should take upon themselves the election in a matter depending
on the will of God, alone. For, unless Eleazar had been appointed priest whilst
his father was yet alive, the office itself might fall into disesteem, since the
high dignity of any individua! is often odious. Lest, therefore, their perverse
envy might impel them to repudiate the priesthood, God anticipates them, and
provides that religion, which ought to be perpetual, should not perish together
with the men. Again, we know how great was the audacity of this people in
innovation; lest, then, they should, at their own caprice, take to themselves a
priest from another tribe, it was well that he of whom God approved, should be
firmly established, so as to be received without controversy as the true and
lawful one. In this matter an external symbol was made use of, in that Eleazar
was invested with the sacred garments; nor does this refer to the shirt, or the
slippers, but to the sacerdotal ornaments. The effect, therefore, of this
ceremony was as if Aaron should resign the office, which he had discharged till
that day, to his son. Moreover, it is worthy of observation that Aaron not only
voluntarily cedes his dignity, but his life also. By this proof his faith was
confirmed, for had he not been persuaded that an inheritance was laid up for him
in heaven, he would not have so calmly migrated from the world. Since, however,
he composes himself to die, just as if he were but lying down on his bed, it is
altogether beyond a doubt that his mind was lifted up to the hope of a blessed
resurrection, from whence arises a cheerful readiness to die. And it is probable
that his faith was elevated and strengthened when he saw that the testimony of
God's grace, on which the safety of the people depended, was made to rest upon
the person of his son. For it was exactly as if the image of the Mediator were
set visibly before his eyes. This consolation, then, being of no ordinary
character, rendered him superior to the terrors of death. Meanwhile, Eleazar
succeeded, in the presence of the people, so that his authority might not
hereafter be exposed to their
murmurs.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when all the congregation
saw.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This has been an error common to
almost all nations and ages, but which reigned peculiarly amongst the people of
Israel &#8212; to pay due honor to God's holy servants, rather after their
deaths than in their lives. They had frequently wished to stone Aaron; they had
raised great tumults, in order to cast him down from the dignity in which God
had placed him; now, forgetting their malignity and envy, they lament for him
when dead.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question, however, occurs,
whether the mourning for a month, which is here recorded, was praiseworthy or
not? But it could not be otherwise than improper, inasmuch as it was a means of
aggravating their grief; for men are naturally only too much inclined to
excessive grief, even although they do not indulge it; and besides, the hope of
a better life avails to mitigate sorrow. Hence we infer, that those are endued
with scarcely any taste of eternal salvation, who give way to immoderate grief.
But, since believers have another cause for mourning, i.e., to exercise
themselves both in the fear of God, and in the hope and desire of the future
resurrection, this solemn mourning has not been unreasonably received as a
general custom. Since death is a mirror of God's curse upon the whole human
race, it is profitable for us, whenever any of our belongings dies, to mourn our
common lot, so as to humble ourselves beneath God's hand. Besides, if mourning
is directed to its proper end, it in a manner unites the living with the dead;
so that in death itself the communion of the new and immortal life shines forth.
And further, the weakness of the ancient people had need of being propped and
supported by such aids as this; for, amidst their dark shadows, it would not
have been easy to rise above the world, unless they had been taught that the
dead still belonged to them, and that there remained some bond of connection
between them. But if the utility (of this custom) be corrupted by its abuse, it
is not just that what is right in itself should be blamed for the fault of
men.</font><br></div>

Moses to specify the stations here, as he does in Numbers 33, but only to mark
the place in which Aaron died, I have therefore thought fit to connect what we
read here with the preceding narrative. In the death of Aaron, they might
recognize the punishment of their own rebellion. But that Eleazar should be
substituted in his place, was a sign of the paternal grace of God, who did not
suffer them to be deprived of this blessing. This succession, too, was to be a
perpetual rule for the future, so that the sacerdotal dignity, according to
God's prescription, should remain in that
family.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He here specifies the names of certain
places, which he omits in the passage above cited; for he there states that the
Israelites went straight from Kadesh-barnea to Mount Hor; and then makes them
pass on to Zalmonah and Punon, perhaps because the places had different names,
or because they did not pitch their camp in Gudgodah, or Jotbath; although the
advantages of the spot might have invited them to stop in a well-watered valley,
for it is called "the land of torrents," through which an abundance of water
flowed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I do not advert to what every reader

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when king Arad the
Canaanite.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not altogether agreed
among commentators who this king Arad was. Some think that he was an Amalekite,
but this error is refuted by the fact that the Amalekites had already attempted
in vain to interrupt the journey of the people. Nor is it credible that after so
great a slaughter, they would have endeavored to do so again, especially since
their territories remained untouched. Besides, it would have been absurd to call
the Amalekites Canaanites, since they derived their origin not from Canaan but
from Esau, and thus were connected with the Israelites by a common descent from
Shem. We shall, however, rightly understand this as referring to the Amorites,
who were certainly reckoned among the Canaanites, as being of the same race; as
Moses tells us in his first book,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
10:16, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:21;) nay, he elsewhere designates all the people of Canaan by the name of
Amorites. Moreover, in the thirty-fourth chapter of this book, we shall see that
their boundaries reached to mount Hor and Kadesh-barnea. Since, then, the
Amorites were in this neighborhood towards the south, the name will suit them
very well. That king Arad, however, alone made war upon them, arose from the
paternal providence of God, who wished to accustom His people to the conquest of
their enemies by degrees. If all these nations had united their forces, and made
a combined attack upon an unwarlike people, it would have succumbed in
astonishment and fear. But it was easier for them to defend themselves against a
single nation. And yet, in the first combat, God permitted the Israelites to be
routed, so that the victorious Canaanite took some booty, or led away some
captives. And this also was useful to the Israelites, in order that, mistrusting
their own strength, they might humbly betake themselves to the succor of God;
for it behooved them to learn that, unless they were aided from on high, they
would be altogether insufficient, when they had to resist many powerful nations,
since they had not been able to withstand even a single
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect to "the way of the spies,"
some understand that, as the people had been taught by Joshua and Caleb, they
followed the footsteps of those who had been sent to explore the land; but,
inasmuch as it appears that the course was a different one, I know not whether
this opinion is very tenable. Thus, some take the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;rd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>derek, to </i>mean "after the manner of," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f116</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which appears to be harsh and constrained. Thus, then, I explain it, Since they
had to advance through unknown regions, spies were sent on, according to custom,
to direct the whole march; and hence king Arad knew that his territory was to be
invaded, before the army had proceeded so
far.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel vowed a vow unto the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This was a manifestation of piety,
when they had sustained a loss, not to cast away hope, nor to murmur against
God; but to encourage themselves by entreating His aid. To this slate of
submissiveness they had been subdued by the chastisements of God, although the
continuance of their obedience, as we shall presently see, was not of long
duration. Any one at first sight would say that there was something absurd in
this vow; but we gather from the result, that it was lawful and approved by God;
for the sign of His approbation was that tie hearkened to the vows and cry of
the people. I admit, indeed, that God sometimes answers defective prayers, but
there is no doubt whatever but that Moses here commends their piety in the vow.
We must consider, then, how it was lawful for them to offer the destruction of
cities and the wasting of lands to God as a sacrifice of sweet savor; and the
reply to this question will be easy, if we bear in mind that the vow did not
originate in inconsiderate zeal, but rather in the command of God. It seems
cruel to destroy an entire nation; but God had not only decreed its destruction,
but had appointed the Israelites to execute His sentence. Hence the vow, of
which we are now treating, was not idly spoken, being founded on God's word,
which is the first rule for vowing rightly. It was, indeed, allowable for them
to spare the cities, in order to possess them themselves; but it was also
allowable to devote them as an offering <i>(in anathema)</i>of<i>
</i>first-fruits to God, as we are elsewhere told of the city of Jericho. This
at any rate we must conclude, that although God had not openly and expressly
commanded the cities to be utterly destroyed, still this vow was dictated by the
Holy Spirit, lest the people should yield to sloth, and set themselves<i>
</i>down in a single corner, but that, having desolated and wasted this region,
they might encourage themselves the more to further progress. The vero
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>charam, </i>which Moses employs, signifies, indeed, <i>to destroy, </i>and
from it is derived the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmrj</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>chormah, </i>or <i>Hormah, </i>which implies a species of anathema, as if
they devoted the land to the curse of God. Moses, however, adds, that the people
performed the vow, under the obligation of which they had laid themselves; and
praiseworthy indeed was their magnanimity, in refusing to avail themselves of a
comfortable home by destroying the cities, which they had acquired by the right
of war.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We know not whether the cities were
destroyed immediately after the victory over their enemies; indeed, I rather
conjecture that there was some interval of time, because the people did not
straightway enter the boundaries of the promised land. And this more clearly
appears from chapter 33, where, after this battle was fought, certain stations
are enumerated, which are in another direction. It is probable, therefore, that
they fought outside the boundaries of the Canaanites, and that, when the people
came here soon afterwards, the land was finally put to the
sword.</font><br></div>

a remedy. Nothing, then, could be more unfair than odiously to recall to memory
a past evil, in which they had experienced the special aid of God. But their

But, inasmuch as Moses had nothing separate from God, no one could enter into a
contest with him without warring also against God Himself. Here, however, as I
have said, their insolence proceeded still further, so as not only to rail
against the minister, but to vomit forth also their wicked blasphemy against God
Himself, as if He had injured them most grossly by their
deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord sent fiery
serpents.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Their ingratitude was justly
and profitably chastised by this punishment; for they were practically taught
that it was only through God's paternal care that they had been previously free
from innumerable evils, and that He was possessed of manifold forms of
punishment, whereby to take vengeance on the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although deserts are full of many
poisonous animals, still it is probable that these serpents suddenly arose, and
were created for this special purpose; as if God, in His determination to
correct the people's pride, should call into being new enemies to trouble them.
For they were made to feel how great their folly was to rebel against God, when
they were not able to cope with the serpents. This, then, was an admirable plan
for humbling them, contemptuously to bring these serpents into the field against
them, and thus to convince them of their weakness. Consequently, they both
confess their guilt and acknowledge that there was no other remedy for them
except to obtain pardon from God. These two things, as we are aware, are
necessary in order to appease God, first, that the sinner should be dissatisfied
with himself and self-condemned; and, secondly, that he should seek to be
reconciled to God. The people seem faithfully to fulfill both of these
conditions, when they of their own accord acknowledge their guilt, and humbly
have recourse to God's mercy. It is through the influence of terror that they
implore the prayers of Moses, since they count themselves unworthy of favor,
unless an advocate <i>(patronus) </i>should intercede for them. This would,
indeed, be erroneous, that those who are conscience-struck should invite an
intercessor to stand between them and God, unless they, too, should unite their
own prayers with his; for nothing is more contrary to faith than such a state of
alarm as prevents us from calling upon God. Still the kindness of Moses, and his
accustomed gentleness is perceived by this, that he is so readily disposed to
listen to these wicked ones; and God also, on His part, shews that the prayer of
a righteous man is not unavailing, when He heals the wound He had inflicted.

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thee a fiery
serpent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Nothing would, at first sight,
appear more unreasonable than that a brazen serpent should be made, the sight of
which should extirpate the deadly poison; but this apparent absurdity was far
better suited to render the grace of God conspicuous than as if there had been
anything natural in the remedy. If the serpents had been immediately removed,
they would have deemed it to be an accidental occurrence, and that the evil had
vanished by natural means. If, in the aid afforded, anything had been applied,
bearing an affinity to fit and appropriate remedies, then also the power and
goodness of God would have been thrown into the shade. In order, therefore, that
they might perceive themselves to be rescued from death by the mere grace of God
alone, a mode of preservation was chosen so discordant with human reason, as to
be almost a subject for laughter. At the same time it had the effect of trying
the obedience of the people, to prescribe a mode of seeking preservation,
whichbrought all their senses into subjection and captivity. It was a foolish
thing to turn the eyes to a serpent of brass, to prevent the ill effects of a
poisonous bite; for what, according to man's judgment, could a lifeless statue,
lifted up on high, profit? But it is the peculiar virtue of faith, that we
should willingly be fools, in order that we may learn to be wise only from the
mouth of God. This afterwards more clearly appeared in the substance of this
type: for, when Christ compares Himself to this serpent which Moses lifted up in
the wilderness,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:14,) it was not a mere common similitude which He employs, but He teaches us,
that what had been shewn forth in this dark shadow, was completed in Himself.
And, surely, unless the brazen serpent had been a symbol of spiritual grace, it
would not have been laid up like a precious treasure, and diligently preserved
for many ages in God's sanctuary. The analogy, also, is very perfect; since
Christ, in order to rescue us from death, put on our flesh, not, indeed, subject
to sin, but representing "the likeness of sinful flesh," as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:3.) hence follows, what I have above adverted to, that since "the world by
wisdom knew not God,"<i> </i>He was manifested in the foolishness of the cross.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:21.) If, then, we desire to obtain salvation, let us not be
ashamed to seek it from the curse of Christ, which was typified in the image of
the serpent.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Its lifting up is poorly and
incorrectly, in my opinion, explained by some, as foreshadowing the crucifixion,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f122</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whereas it ought rather to be referred to the preaching of the Gospel: for Moses
was commanded to set up the serpent on high, that it might be conspicuous on
every side. And the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
nes, </i>is used both for a standard, and the mast of a ship, or any other high
pole: which is in accordance with the prophecy of Isaiah, where he says that
Christ should be "for<i> </i>an ensign" to all nations,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:10) which we know to have been the case, by the spreading of the doctrine of
the Gospel through the whole world, with which the look of faith corresponds.
For, just as no healing was conveyed from the serpent to any who did not turn
their eyes towards it, when set up on high, so the look of faith only causes the
death of Christ to bring salvation to us. Although, therefore, God would give
relief to their actual distress, it is still unquestionable that He even then
admonished all believers that the venomous bites of the devil could only be
cured by their directing their minds and senses by faith on
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The brazen serpent is, furthermore, a
proof to us how inclined to superstition the human race is, since posterity
worshipped it as an idol, until it was reduced<i> </i>to powder by the holy king
Hezekiah.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Israel set
forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses does not here enumerate all
the stations, which will be mentioned hereafter, when he recapitulates them all
separately and in order: for, in hastening to record certain memorable
circumstances, he passes over those of minor importance, which, however, he does
not omit elsewhere; since the account of their circuitous course, when they were
turning away from the Edomites, was of some moment. For it was, as we have
observed, no ordinary proof of obedience, when God had forbidden them to attack
the Edomites, that they should undertake a difficult and rugged march. Still in
this place Moses deemed it sufficient to mark the principal places in which they
stopped. Meanwhile, what I have stated appears to be the case, that he hastens
onwards to relate circumstances of much importance, for, when they came to
Arnon, he highly magnifies the power of God, with which He succoured His
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From thence they removed, and
pitched.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I will presently add, what
Moses relates in Deuteronomy respecting the Moabites and Ammonites. Since here
he only briefly touches upon the main facts, he only specifies that the people
came to the borders of their enemies, where it was necessary to give battle,
because there was no means of entering the land of Canaan, except by force of
arms. Here, then, was the end of their journeying, for, when the Amorites were
conquered, they began to inhabit their cities. He, therefore, immediately adds,
that this place would be memorable in all ages, because in it God again exerted
His power, by putting to flight their enemies. Still translators appear to me to
be mistaken as to the meaning of the words. Almost all of them render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rps</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sepher,</i> "the book;" and afterwards eagerly discuss what book it is,
without coming to any satisfactory conclusion. I rather understand it to mean
<i>"narration;" </i>as if Moses had said, that when the wars of Jehovah shall be
recounted, the memory of this place would be celebrated; as David, when he is
recounting, and magnifying God's mercies, expressly mentions that king Sihon and
Og were conquered.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is also another
ambiguity in the following words: for some suppose <i>Vaheb </i>to be the proper
name of a city, and <i>Suphah </i>a noun common, which they translate "in<i>
</i>a whirlwind;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f123</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but, since the shore of the Red Sea was not habitable, I do not see how mention
could be suitably made of any city situated there. But if they think it was a
city near Arnon, it is surprising that it should never be spoken of elsewhere,
and yet here referred to, as if it were well known. I therefore rather incline
to their opinion, who explain it as a vero, and suppose that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(vau) </i>is used for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino"><i>(yod,)
</i>so that the sense should be; As God had begun to fight gloriously for the
Israelites at the Red Sea, so also He continued the same grace at Arnon. I
admit, that if the points be scrupulously insisted upon, this meaning would not
be altogether accordant with grammar; but I prefer eliciting a probable meaning
at the cost of a single point, than to go out of the way in search of poor
conjectures, as they do who imagine <i>Vaheb </i>to be the proper name of a
place. Appropriately, indeed, does Moses compare Arnon with the Red Sea, in
order to shew that God's grace, at its end, is thoroughly in accordance with its
commencement. He had mightily fought against the Egyptians, and had destroyed
the army of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, but small would have been the fruit of this
deliverance, unless, with equal efficacy, He had succoured His people when they
had to contend with the Canaanitish nations: for the question here is not as to
God's blessings in general, but only as to the victories, wherein it was
manifested that the Israelites did not fight without the approval and guidance
of God. Moses, therefore, does not recount the miracles performed in the desert:
but only says, that in the history of the wars of God the name of Arnon would be
equally renowned with that of the Red Sea. Still, in the word Arnon it must be
observed that there is a <i>synecdoche; </i>forMoses comprehends in it all the
subsequent battles. Since, therefore, from the time that the people arrived at
Arnon, where their enemies came forth to meet them, God again lifted up His
standard, and gloriously honored His people by continued victories &#8212; hence
the special celebrity of the place arose. There is a poetical repetition in the
verse, where, for the torrents, the stream of the torrents 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f124</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is spoken of, which <i>descends </i>to Ar, and reposes in the border of
Moab.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And from thence they went to
Beer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that a circumstance<i>
</i>is here narrated, which had never been mentioned before, since a song is
recorded, which we do not find elsewhere. But since Moses repeats the same words
which he had used before, and speaks as of a very<i> </i>notorious matter, that
he was there commanded to assemble the people, to partake of the water which God
had given, it appears probable to me that the name was given to the place,
whereby both God's goodness and the people's ingratitude might be testified to
posterity. I do not, however, contend that this is the same place, from
whence<i> </i>we previously read that water was extracted: for it was not there
only that the people was satisfied by drinking it, but it flowed forth beside
them wherever they went. In which sense Paul writes that "the Rock followed
them,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:4; ) not that the rock was torn from its roots, but because God
miraculously drew on the water which flowed from it, so that it should accompany
them, and thus continually supply them with drink. And this we gather also from
the next verse, where Moses says, that the people "sang this song, Ascend,
Beer." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f125</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For when they saw that, contrary to nature, the water rose into higher levels
from the source which was recently called into existence, so as to supply them
with drink in dry places, they began to pay more attention to the miracle, and
to celebrate the grace of God. Still it might be the case that the water did not
flow down like a river, but bubbled up from the open veins of the earth,
whenever it was required. At any rate, by its ascent he indicates an
extraordinary effect produced by God. When it is said, that "the princes digged
the well," there is, in my opinion, an implied contrast between a few persons,
and those but little fitted for manual labors, and a great body of engineers.
Whenever armies have need of water, the soldiers dig wells with much labor; here
quite another mode of proceeding is expressed, viz., that the leaders of the
people, together with Moses, dug the well, not by artificial or mechanical<i>
</i>means, but by the simple touch of a staff. Moses, indeed, speaks of
"staves,"<i> </i>in the plural nmnber, because mention of the princes is made;
but I have no doubt but that the rod of Moses is contrasted with all other
implements, in order to exalt the power and grace of God. I think, too, that the
name of Beer was given to the place, where that water forsook the Israelites;
since they had come to well-watered regions, which would supply water in
abundance without miraculous interference. Let us, however, learn from this
canticle, that, although the people had at first impiously rebelled against God,
still, by long experience of the blessing, they were at length induced to
gratitude, so as to burst forth into praise of God. Hence we gather, that they
were not obstinate in their senselessness.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto me,
Distress not the Moabites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had
previously forbidden them to enter the land of Edom, unless consent were
obtained. A similar prohibition is now added with respect to the Moabites,
because God had allotted to them the territory which they inhabited. As I have
said, this was painful and burdensome, that they should cherish kindness and
fraternal good-will towards those who treated them with hostility; but God
desired in this respect also to prove the obedience of His people. He did not,
then, take into consideration what this nation had dcserved; but, inasmuch as
they were the descendants of Lot, and consequently of the race of Abraham, He
desired to treat them with special favor. For the division of the whole world
appertains to Him, so as to distribute to its various peoples whatever part He
chooses, and to fix the bounds wherein they should confine themselves. If any
object that the people of Canaan had also their limits assigned to them, and
ought not, therefore, to have been expelled from the lands in which their
forefathers had for many ages inhabited, the reply is easy, viz., that God is
always free to take away what He has given, and to readjust the boundaries
imposed by His will, when the sins of men deserve that this should be done.
When, therefore, He declares that He had given their land to the Moabites, it is
not according to the ordinary force of the expression, but by a fixed decree
that their habitation should remain sure and
undisturbed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Emims dwelt therein in times
past.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a confirmation of the
foregoing declaration, which is, however, inserted by way of parenthesis by
Moses himself; for the ninth verse, which I have just expounded, is followed
regularly by the thirteenth, "Now rise up," etc.<i> </i>For, after God had
turned away the people from the borders of Moab, He shews them in what direction
they must pass over; but Moses, interrupting the address of God, explains how
the Moabites had obtained that territow, though they were strangers, and had no
land of their own on which they might set their foot;. For Lot was no less an
alien than Abraham; Moses, therefore, states how by special privilege the
posterity of Lot became masters of that land which giants had previously
possessed. For it was not by human means that, having driven out the giants, who
were formidable to all men, they had obtained the peaceful occupation, and even
the dominion of that land, which might have seemed to be invincible, from the
valor and strength of its inhabitants. He says, therefore, that the giants dwelt
there, as also in Mount Seir; and that both were overcome and destroyed, not so
much by the hand and arms of men as by the power of God, so that their land
might be cleared for possession as well for the children of Esau as for those of
Lot. Now, since God elsewhere declares that He had given Mount Seir to Esau as
an inheritance, according as He had promised to his father Isaac, it follows
that the Moabites had obtained their land also by the same Divine authority. The
comparison which is made between Edom and the Israelites does not hold good in
all respects; for, although Esau was sustained by this consolation, that his
inheritance should be of "the fatness of the earth,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012739&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
27:39,) it might still be the case that with regard to himself and his
posterity, their possession should not be legitimate; whereas God so promised
the land of Canaan to the race of Abraham, that the Israelites received the
dominion over it, as if from His own hand, as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
136:21. In this respect, too, there was a difference, because the land of Canaan
was chosen as that in which God should gather His Church, in which He should be
purely worshipped, and which should be an earnest, to the faithful of the
heavenly and eternal rest. But, as elsewhere, the distinction between the sons
of Esau and Jacob is marked, so now Moses

God should open the way before them, and thus they should follow Him as their
leader, and not make a passage for themselves at their own
discretion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He afterwards specifies the period
of delay which they had been compelled by God to pass in the desert, after they
had once reached the borders of the promised land. He says, then, that after
thirty-eight years they had at length returned to the land from whence they had
been obliged to retire; and briefly reminds them how long the course of their
deliverance had been interrupted through their own fault, since they had gone
forth to enjoy the promised land. He calls those "warlike men," or, in the
Hebrew, "men of war," whose age entitled them to bear arms, <i>i.e., </i>who had
exceeded<i> </i>their twentieth year.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When
mention is elsewhere made of forty years, the two years are then included which
were spent both in Mount Sinai and in other places; and with good reason,
because, during that time also, their sins prevented them from passing to the
enjoyment of their inheritance immediately after the promulgation of the
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when thou comest nigh
over against the children ofAmmon.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God
now makes provision as to the Ammonites, since their condition was the same as
that of the Moabites, inasmuch as they were descended from the two daughters of
Lot. It might, indeed, seem wonderful that, since the memory of their origin was
detestable, these two nations should have been so dear to God. Ammon and Moab
had been born of an incestuous connection. It was, therefore, more reasonable
that this tragical circumstance should have been buried by their destruction,
than that they should have been distinguished by God's favor from the common lot
of other nations, as if their nobility rendered them superior to others. But let
us learn from hence, that since God's judgments, like a deep abyss, are beyond
our apprehension, they should be regarded with reverence. Lot's distinguished
piety is expressly declared. The disgraceful crime, which he committed when
drunk, it pleased God so to mark with perpetual infamy, as still to impress upon
it some signs of His mercy, although this was done especially for the sake of
Abraham himself. It is unquestionable, however, that God recommends the
posterity of Lot to the Israelites on this ground, that they may more willingly
exercise kindness towards them, and abstain from all injury, when they had to do
with two nations whom they see to be cared for by God Himself, for the sake of
their common relationship to
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, by the same argument
whereby he had before proved that both Edomites and Moabites, relying on God's
help, had occupied the lands over which they had dominion, he now establishes
that the land which the Ammonites possessed had been granted them by God, viz.,
because in their conquest and overthrow of the giants they had surpassed the
limits of human bravery, and thus God had given a proof of His special and
unusual favor towards them. For neither by the ordinary course of nature could
two men increase to so great a multitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now,
although the Hebrew call the Cappadocians <i>Caphthorim,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we do not know whether the giants, whose country was taken possession of by
the Ammonites, sprung from them. But, if this be admitted, they had a long
journey, attended by many dangers, after they left their country; and again,
since they must have passed through rich and fertile regions, it is strange that
they should have penetrated to those mountains. It might, however, be the case,
that, making forays as robbers, they nowhere found a quiet resting-place until a
less cultivated region presented itself.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Numbers 21:21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel sent
messengers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The second narration, which
I have subjoined from Deuteronomy, is the fuller; nevertheless, a question
arises from it, for what reason this embassy was sent to king Sihon, whose
kingdom was already devoted to the Israelites: for it seems to be altogether
inconsistent to offer conditions of peace when war is decreed. God commands His
people to take up arms: He declares that they shall be victorious, so as to
occupy the land of Sihon by right of war; what, then, can be more absurd than to
request of him that they might pass through his land in peace? If this attempt
were made by Moses without the command of God, such an excess of kindness was
not devoid of guilt, inasmuch as it was an act of much temerity to promise what
God had appointed otherwise. But, if we should say that the messengers went with
the authority, and at the command of God, under what pretext shall the
deceptiveness of the act be excused? for it is very improper to flatter with
soothing words and promises those whom you have destined to destruction. The
conclusion I come to is, that although the event was not unknown to God, still
the embassy was sent, nevertheless, by his command and decree, in order to lay
open the obstinate ferocity of the nation. But, since the secret judgments of
God far surmount our senses, let us learn to reverence their height; and let
this sober view restrain our boldness like a rein, viz., that although the
reason for the works of God be unknown to us, still it always exists with Him.
God knew that the messengers would speak to the deaf, and yet it is not in vain
that He bids them go; for, since the kingdom of Sihon was not properly included
in the promised land, it was not lawful for the children of Israel to make war
upon it until they had been provoked by an unjust refusal. Thus, then, I connect
the history. Before they had been assured at God's command of the event, and the
victory, they sent the messengers, who demanded that a pacific passage should be
accorded to them; and that then the permission to have recourse to arms was
granted. If any prefer to think that, before Moses attempted to preserve peace,
he had been made acquainted with all that would occur, I will not contend the
point; but I deem it more probable that he had expectations of the peace which
he sought, because the judgment of God had not yet been declared. If, therefore,
Sihon had allowed himself to be propitiated, Moses would never have dared to
deal with him as an enemy; but, he rather simply and honestly promised peace,
which he intended to preserve; God, however, had otherwise appointed, as the
event presently shewed. Still He was not inconsistent with Himself, or variable,
in sending the messengers to an irreclaimable and obstinately perverse man; for
thus was all excuse taken away when he had voluntarily provoked to war a people
who were ready and willing to maintain peace and equity. But rather may we see
in this history, as in a glass, that, whilst God earnestly invites the reprobate
to repentance and the hope of salvation, He has no other object than that they
may be rendered inexcusable by the detection of their impiety. Hence is their
ignorance refuted, who gather from this that it is free for all promiscuously to
embrace God's grace, because its promulgation <i>(doctrina) </i>is common, and
directed to all without exception; as if God was not aware of what Sihon would
answer when He would have him attracted to equity by friendly and peaceful
words; or as if, on his free will, the purpose of God was suspended as to the
war, which was soon after carried forward by His
decree.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But inasmuch as what is here briefly
recorded, would be obscure in itself, we must explain it by the other narrative,
where it is thus written, &#8212;
</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Deuteronomy 2:24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rise ye up, take your
journey.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have lately said that the
order is here inverted, for what soon after follows, "And<i> </i>I sent
messengers out of the wilderness," etc., ver. 26, Moses, in my opinion, has
inserted by way of parenthesis: it will, therefore, be suitably rendered in the
pluperfect tense, "But<i> </i>I had sent," etc. Thus there will be no ambiguity
in the sense that, when the messengers had returned without effecting their
purpose, God sustained the weariness of the people by this consolation, as
though he had said, Sihon has not, with impunity, repudiated the peace offered
to him, since it will now be permitted you to assail him in lawful war. And
assuredly this signal for the expedition to advance depends on the declaration
which is subjoined in ver. 30, as we may readily gather from the context; for
Moses there repeats what we here read respecting their passage in somewhat
different words; and again does God testify that He has given Sihon into the
hands of the people, and exhorts Moses to go down boldly to the battle.
Moreover, the cause is there specified why (Sihon) had been so arrogant and
contemptuous in his rejection of the embassy, viz., because God had "hardened<i>
</i>his spirit, and made his heart obstinate." From whence again it appears how
poor is the sophistry of those who imagine that God idly regards from heaven
what men are about to do. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f128</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They dare not, indeed, despoil Him of foreknowledge; but what can be more absurd
than that He foreknows nothing except what men please? But Scripture, as we see,
has not placed God in a watch-tower, from which He may behold at a distance what
things are about to be; but teaches that He is the director <i>(moderatorem)
</i>of all things; and that He subjects to His will, not only the events of
things, but the designs and affections of men also. As, therefore, we have
before seen how the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, so now Moses ascribes to God
the obstinacy of king Sihon. How base a subterfuge is the exception which some
make as to His <i>permission, </i>sufficiently appears from the end which Moses
points out. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f129</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For why did God harden the heart of Sihon? thalt "He<i> </i>might deliver him
into the hand" of His people to be slain; because He willed that he should
perish, and had destined his land for the Israelites. If God only permitted
Sihon to grow hardened, this decree was either nought, or mutable, and
evanescent, since it depended on the changeable will of man. Putting aside,
then, all childish trifling, we must conclude that God by His secret inspiration
moves, forms, governs, and draws men's hearts, so that even by the wicked He
executes whatever He has decreed. At the same time it is to be observed that the
wicked are not impelled to hardness of heart by extrinsic force, but that they
voluntarily harden themselves; so that in this same hardness of heart God may be
seen to be a just judge, however incomprehensible His counsel may be, and
however the impiety of men may betray itself, who are their own instigators, and
the authors of their own sin. Emphatically does Moses inculcate the same thing
twice over, viz., that the spirt of Sihon was hardened by God, and his heart
made obstinate, in order that God's paternal favor towards His chosen people
might be more conspicuous; because from the obstinacy of the blinded king He
afforded them a just cause for war, and an opportunity for
victory.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Numbers 21:25<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel took all these
cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As if speaking of something
present, he uses the demonstrative pronoun, and says, "these<i> </i>cities,"
just as if he were pointing them out to the eyes of his readers. The word which
we have rendered "towns" <i>(oppida,) </i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>others translate "country-houses" <i>(villas,) </i>or "hamlets"
<i>(viculos.) </i>In the Hebrew, Moses calls by the name of "daughters"<i>
</i>all the villages and lesser towns, whose mother-city <i>(metropolis) </i>was
Heshbon. By these words, however, Moses indicates that, by the right of war, all
these places had fallen into the hands of the Israelites, as the lot of their
inheritance; for, as I have lately said, God had not yet openly declared that
they should be masters of this part of the country. They would consequently have
over-passed their boundaries, unless these had been added to the land of Canaan.
This is the reason why God openly declares that they possessed them by His
authority. But when he says that the cities were destroyed, and all their
inhabitants exterminated, so that neither women nor children were spared, let us
understand that they dealt not thus cruelly of their own impulse, or in heedless
violence, but that whatsoever was on the other side of Jordan was devoted to
destruction by God, that they might always have their minds fixed on the
promised land, and might never give way to listlessness, which would have been
the case if an easy occupation of it had invited them to repose. Although,
therefore, God delivered over the land to them hereafter, and suffered them to
enrich themselves with its booty and spoils, yet He would not have it retained
as a place of residence, and therefore commanded them to destroy its cities and
villages, in order that they might seek their rest elsewhere. In fine, since
they were abundantly disposed to be slothful, it was expedient that all snares
should be removed, and that by the very desolation they might be urged forward
whither God called them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Heshbon was the city of
Sihon.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without cause that
Moses relates how the country near Heshbon had passed into the hands of the
Amorites, because a long time afterwards this was sought for as a pretext for
war by the Ammonites, when they saw that the people were brought into a low
estate. In the time of Jephthah, therefore, having collected a great army, an
irruption was made by them; and they made this their excuse, that they took up
arms to recover what was their own, from Arnon as far as Jabbok, and as far as
Jordan. Consequently, God would have it testified in the sacred records, as
Jephthah then replied to the Ammonites, that this part of the land was taken
from king Sihon, when the children of Israel were marching peacefully through
the borders of the Ammonites. Designedly, then, did Moses, in order to sanction
the right of the people, insert in these authentic registers, as it were, what
had formerly occurred, namely, that the Amorites had had the dominion over that
part of the country, without interference from the Ammonites; nor was there any
question that the Amorites had secure and peaceful possession of it. Hence it
follows that it passed to the Israelites, so that there were no grounds why,
three hundred years afterwards, the Ammonites should reclaim what had so long
been lost and abandoned by them. And, in order that posterity might know that
there was then no obscurity about the matter, he records an ancient canticle,
from which it appears that the Ammonites were so completely overcome, that their
enemies triumphed magnificently over them, and cut off all hope of their
restoration. Here, however, the question arises, why the king of Ammon, rather
than the king of Moab, set on foot that war; for we clearly gather from the
song, that the land was taken from the Moabites. But for men who are bent on
rapine and robbery, it is sufficient to allege any trivial pretext, and often to
glory in the rights of others. There doubtless remained a report that the
Amorites had been driven out of their territories, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f131</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which they had obtained by force of arms. The Ammonites pass over in silence
what had been forgotten in the lapse of many ages, and set up this false title,
that, although the Israelites had conquered the Amorites, still their victory
conferred upon them no right to occupy what the Amorites unjustly and forcibly
held. With this object Moses inserted the account he here
gives.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, they that speak in
proverbs.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That is, an old saying, or
proverbial sentence remains, and is well known. The song, however, appears to
have been composed in the character of those who, when prepared to engage in
war, mutually exhorted each other, "Come into Heshbon," i.e., run to the
standard of king Sihon; hasten to his home, and his chief place of abode, in
order that we may thence go forth to battle. These expressions, "build<i>
</i>and prepare," I interpret as being used for enlarge, adorn, and enrich; for
it is probable that this city was not overthrown, but they foretell that the
city would be renovated, when a larger dominion had been gained. And this is
more fully confirmed by what immediately follows, when it is said that "a<i>
</i>fire had gone forth from Heshbon," which consumed Ar of Moab, and all its
neighborhood. As to the "lords of the high places of Arnon," some understand the
priests who presided in the temples; others extend them to all the inhabitants
in general; but, in my opinion, it will not be unsuitable to refer them to the
idols themselves, since it appears from the next verse that the conquerors were
so insolently elated, as not only to despise the men themselves, but their gods
also; for when they say, "Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh," there is no
doubt but that they mockingly reproach them with the fact that they had been
badly defended by the gods whom they worshipped. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f132</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And, in point of fact, ungodly men, when in prosperity, uplift their horns to
heaven, as if they would assail the divinity which was opposed to them. They,
therefore, deride Chemosh, because he made "his<i> </i>sons" or worshippers to
be fugitives or captives.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the word <i>lantern
</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he makes use of a common metaphor. Some follow the Chaldee interpreter, and
render it <i>kingdom; </i>but it has a wider signification; for it includes all
the component parts of a happy and prosperous state. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f134</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The meaning, therefore, is, that their glory and all their wealth was
annihilated. The cities of Dibon and Medeba are situated on the extreme borders,
near the river Arnon, so that by these he designates all the intermediate

people described, wherein they again experienced the continued favor of God, in
order that they may be aroused to greater alacrity, and courageously prepare
themselves for farther progress; for they might confidently expect that, with
God for their leader, all things would succeed prosperously with them. The
region of Bashan, as Scripture informs us in many places, was fertile, and
famous for its rich pastures; but Moses here also testifies to its great extent.
It was, then, no ordinary proof of God's favor and aid, that they should take it
in a moment, as it were. It is not, therefore, without cause, that, in the
Psalm, God's power and goodness is magnified in reference to these victories;
because He</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"slew mighty kings,
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and gave their land for a
heritage, a heritage unto his people."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
135:10-12.):</font><br><font face="Palatino">For, although the Israelites were
superior in numbers, yet there is no doubt but that, when this king dared to go
forth to battle, he trusted in his forces, and deemed himself equal to
resistance. Hence did God's grace shine forth the more conspicuously; and,
indeed, in order that he may extol its greatness the more, Moses afterwards also
relates that sixty cities were taken.

people to confidence. He then commands that the men as well as the cities and
villages should be destroyed, so that nothing should be preserved except the
booty. he indeed addresses Moses only, but his injunctions are directed to all,
because Moses, who was already sufficiently energetic, had not so much need of
being spurred on as the others. God, however, had regard to the future also,
lest the recollection of the blessing should be lost through the ingratitude of
the people. In promising them victory, therefore, he desired to have the praise
of it bestowed upon Himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have already
shewn why He commanded the cities to be overthrown, and all the houses utterly
destroyed, namely, lest convenient habitations should tempt the people to
torpor, when they were required to hasten onwards to the promised rest; for
those who had been ready in the wilderness to retire, and to go back into Egypt,
would have eagerly taken possession of this fertile land, and reposed themselves
as in a delightful nest. By its desolation, therefore, they were compelled to
abandon it. Its possession, indeed, was afterwards granted to the tribes of
Reuben, and Gad, and half of Manasseh; but on condition that they should leave
their herds there, and accompany their brethren through the whole expedition,
not deserting them till the Canaanitish nations were destroyed.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we took all the
cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here more fully relates what
He had brieflytouched upon in Numbers. He says that sixty, <i>well-fortified
cities </i>were taken, besides the villages. Hence we infer both the extent of
the country, and also the special power of God in the aid He afforded them, in
that they took, in so short a time, so many cities well closed in, and begirt
with high walls; as if they were merely travelling, through a peaceful land in
security, and with nothing to do.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After the
eighth verse, lie repeats connectedly what he had separately related respecting
the two kingdoms; and in order that the places might be more certainly
identified, he mentions two other names for mount Hermon, stating that it was
called Sirion by the Sidonians, and Shenir by the Amorites. Finally, he adds
that Og, king of Bashan, was a giant, and the only survivorof that race. As a
memorialof his lofty stature, he alleges his iron bedstead, the length of which
was as much as nine cubits, according to the common measure of that period. By
this circumstance he again magnifies the marvellous help of God, in that he was
overcome by the children of Israel, who might, by his stature, have singly
terrified a whole army.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The enormous stature of
the giants is apparent from this passage. Herodotus records, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f136</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the body of Orestes, disinterred by command of the oracle, was seven cubits
in length. Pliny, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f137</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
although he does not cite his authority, subscribes to this testimony. Gellius 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f138</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
thinks that this was fabulous, as also what Homer 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f139</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
writes with respect to the diminution of men's height in process of time; but
his erroneous view is confuted by almost universal consent. What Pliny 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f140</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
himself relates is indeed incredible, that in Crete a body was discovered, by an
opening of the earth, forty-six cubits long, which some thought to be the body
of Orion, and others of Etion. But if we believe that there were giants, (which
is not only affirmd by the sacred Scriptures, but also recorded by almost all
ancient writers,) we need not be surprised if they were more than eight cubits
in height. Although, however, the race of giants began to disappear in the time
of Moses, still, in after ages, there existed persons who approached to this
ancient stature, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f141</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as in the time of Augustus and Claudius there was one man about ten feet in
height, and another nine feet nine inches. Moses, therefore, intimates nothing
more than that this monstrous race of men gradually died out, so that the
enormous height of Og, king of Bashan, was an unusual sight.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children, of Israel
set forward.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This narrative contains
many circumstances worthy of record: First, it shews that there is no stone
which Satan does not turn for the destruction of the Church, and that, after he
has assailed her in vain by force of arms, he attacks her by snares and secret
artifices, whilst the ungodly also work under his impulse, as far as they are
able, to overthrow her by deceit, and to make the promises of God, and His
unchangeable decree for the preservation of the Church which He has chosen, of
none effect. But God shews, on the other hand, that He so watches over His own,
as to turn to their salvation whatever plots their enemies may devise for their
destruction. He likewise represents as in a mirror how foolish and vain are
their attempts who endeavor to undermine the grace of God; and especially He
demonstrates that God's truth will always be so completely victorious as to
receive the testimony even of its professed enemies; just as Balaam was made to
proclaim it. These and other observations, however, will be better made in their
several places.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have already seen that there
was no reason why Balak should devise any evil against God's people, since he
had no inconvenience to fear from them. Their faith had been voluntarily
pledged; security had been promised him, and a treaty proposed. When, therefore,
he and all the Moabites prepare themselves, and arouse their neighbors for
resistance, they were ungrateful to God as well as men. In his very alarm we see
the truth of what Scripture declares, viz., that the reprobate are always
agitated by groundless terrors; and this is the just reward of those who seek
not peace with God, that they should be constantly harassed by wretched
disquietude. By special privilege God had exempted the Moabites from being at
all interfered with; but they invent for themselves causes of anxiety, because
they see that God's people had overcome great and powerful kings. For as the
brightness of the sun is painful and injurious to those who have weak eyes, so
the blessings which God bestows upon the Church, in token of His paternal favor,
torment the reprobate and stir them up to envy. If the Moabites had prudently
considered their own advantage, they might have easily so arranged with their
old connections as to provide for their own tranquillity; but now, by provoking
their ill-will, they make the worst bargain possible for themselves. Nor is it
the unwise alarm of Balak only which is described, but that of the whole nation
of Moab. At first, indeed, the king's name is introduced alone, but immediately
afterwards Moses includes them all without exception, hence it is plain that
this error was universal, by the contagion of which they presently corrupt
others also. For they invite the Midianites to associate themselves with them in
the work of repulsing the Israelites. The pretext alleged is, that as oxen
consume the grass of the field, so there was imminent danger lest if the people
of Israel were not resisted, they should as it were lick up and devour all the
nations; whereas they had experienced quite the reverse, for the people had
turned aside of their own accord into circuitous paths, in order to avoid doing
them injury. This forbearance would have delivered them from all anxiety, unless
their own malignity had taught them to entertain foul suspicions; for why had
not the Israelites made a direct aggression upon their territories, except
because they were desirous to leave them safe and intact? Otherwise they would
have boldly made a way for themselves by force of
arms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He sent messengers therefore
unto Balaam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage shews us, like
many others, that the errors wherein Satan entangles unbelievers are derived
from good principles. The modesty of king Balak appears to be worthy of praise,
in that, conscious of his own weakness, and placing no confidence in human aid,
he sets about imploring the help of God. For this is our only safe refuge,
although earthly aids may fail us, still to maintain our courage, and to rely
upon God, who is all-sufficient in Himself, and independent of external means.
Thus far, then, Balak acts rightly, for he seeks nothing more than to conciliate
God's favor, nor places his confidence of victory in anything but God's
good-will; but, when he seeks for God amiss by circuitous ways, he departs far
from Him. And this is a common error with all hypocrites and unbelievers, that,
whilst they aspire after God, they wander into indirect paths of their own.
Balak desires Divine deliverance from his danger; but the means are of his own
device, when he would purchase incantations from a mercenary prophet; thus it
is, that he binds down God, and subjects Him to his own inventions. He knows, he
says, that the power of blessing and cursing appertained to Balaam; but, whence
arose this persuasion, unless, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f142</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by catching at the more empty name of Prophet, he separates God from Himself? He
ought first to have inquired what the will of God was, and to have addressed
prayer in earnest faith to Him, in order to propitiate Him; whereas, omitting
the main thing, he is satisfied with a mere venal blessing. We gather,
therefore, from his anxiety to obtain peace and pardon from God, that there was
some seed of religion implanted in his mind. The reverence which he pays to the
Prophet is also a sign of his piety. But that he desires to win over God by his
own vain inventions is a proof of foolish superstition; and that he seeks to lay
Him under obligation to himself, of impious pride. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f143</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">I
know not how it came into the mind of the Chaldee interpreter to suppose that
Pether was on the banks of the Euphrates; nor is it probable that (Balaam) was
fetched from so great a distance. Neither would his celebrity have extended from
so distant a place to these nations. I am persuaded that it is the proper name
of a place, because the termination of the word <i>Petorah </i>does not admit of
its being an epithet, such as "the soothsayer," as Jerome has rendered it.
Although, however, the country is not specified, it is probably gathered from
the context that Balaam was a Midianite; and for this reason I conceive the
Midianites were sought in alliance, in order that they might gain over their
fellow-countrymen.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is a poor exposition of
what follows in verse 7, that they had "the<i> </i>divinations in their hand," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f144</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to refer it to the art of divination, or even that they were accompanied by
those who were skillful in the same science. It is more simple to interpret it
of their commission, as though Moses said that the messengers were instructed as
to what they sought of Balaam, viz., that he should curse the people of Israel,
for there is no absurdity in supposing that Moses again repeats what he had
related in the preceding verse. Still, I am not indisposed to accept the view
which others take, viz., that they took with them the reward or price of
divination, for there have been in all ages hireling prophets who made a sale of
their revelations; and since even amongst the Israelites many impostors thus set
themselves up for hire, this abuse had much vogue (among them.) Hence it was
that Saul and his servant hesitated to go to Samuel, because they had not any
gift at hand to offer him, until the servant replied that he had the fourth part
of a shekel of silver, as if Samuel set up his prophecies for sale, as was
commonly the case.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 9:7, 8.) Ezekiel, indeed, charges the false prophets with this, that they
sold themselves for a trifling
bribe.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said unto them, Lodge
here this night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Inasmuch as he waits
for a revelation from the true God, it is probable that he was not a magician or
sorcerer, whose only power to divine arose from superstition or evil arts. We
shall, indeed, see hereafter, that he was accustomed to use many impostures and
deceptions; but it will be plain, from the evidence of facts, that he was
furnished with the gift of prophecy. Not that he is to be reckoned among the
true prophets whom God set over His Church, because neither was the perpetual
office of prophesying conferred upon him, nor was it conjoined with that of
teaching. For those servants of His, to whom God intrusted the office of
prophesying, He so directed by His Spirit, that they never spoke except out of
His mouth. And although they did not foresee all that was to happen, but only
according to the measure of their revelation, still He concealed nothing from
them which it was profitable for them to know. Hence the expression of
Amos,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Surely<i> </i>the Lord
God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the
prophets."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
3:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, they were the organs of the Holy Spirit
for all necessary predictions; and the credit due to their prophecies was of an
equable and constant character, so that they never spoke absurdly or in vain.
Besides, they were endowed with the power of adapting their prophecies to a just
object and use. Thus, after the Law was promulgated, they were its interpreters.
In prosperity they bore witness to the grace of God; in adversity, to His
judgments. In fine, their business was to ratify God's covenant, whereby He
reconciles men to Himself through Christ. Far different was the case with
Balaam, and such like, who were only endued with a particular gift, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f145</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that they truly foretold some things, and were mistaken in others; and,
indeed, they only uttered bare revelations without any admixture of doctrine.
God willed, indeed, that such should exist even among heathen nations, so that
some sparks of light should shine amidst their darkness, and thus the excuse of
ignorance should be taken away. Indeed, all those who have dared to delude the
world by their impostures have usurped the name of prophet; and although the
word <i>divination </i>is honorable and sacred, it has been improperly applied
to the art of deception, and the liberty to lie, as it is the custom of the
devil to profane God's name by its impious abuse. Still, there were some among
the Gentiles who occasionally predicted future events by divine inspiration; and
this was especially the case before the Law was given, inasmuch as God had not
then distinguished His elect people from others by this mark. At this time, it
is true, the promise had been given,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The<i> </i>Lord thy God
will raise up unto thee prophets,"</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f146</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
etc,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
18:15.);</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but it was not yet generally known, and therefore God
was unwilling that the nations should be deprived of their soothsayers, who
still were very different from those true prophets, whose call was clear and
legitimate.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have said thus much briefly with
reference to Balaam, whom God addresses in a vision by night, or dream, no less
familiarly than any of His own servants; but only on a particular point. By the
inquiry, "What<i> </i>men are these with thee?" Hie indirectly reproves his
improper desires. At first sight he pretends a holy anxiety to obey, when he
dares to attempt nothing without God's permission, and refuses to stir a foot,
until he shall have received His answer. Yet secret covetousness influences him
to obtain from God, by bargaining as it were, what he still feels not to be
right. God glances at this astuteness, when He inquires respecting the men; as
much as to say, that there was no reason why he should detain them a moment,
since their demand should have been peremptorily refused. And, assuredly, if he
had been free, he would have hastened at once to obey the wishes of king Balak,
even contrary to the will of God. He now requests that permission should be
given him; as if he desired to have the reins, which withheld him from his evil
purposes, slackened, when he would have willingly shaken them off altogether, if
he were not well aware that he could do nothing further than God would permit.
Nor, indeed, does he regard what is lawful and right; but only seeks that his
mouth may be opened to curse with
impunity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not go with
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If there were any room for doubt,
God peremptorily removes it, and confirms the prohibition; because it was
unlawful to curse, those whom He had blessed. For nothing more is permitted to
prophets than that they should be the witnesses, or ambassadors
<i>(internuntii,) </i>or heralds of the grace which God freely deigns to bestow
at His own pleasure upon whom He will. Moreover, God is said to <i>bless
</i>those whom He has embraced with His favor, and to whom He experimentally
declares Himself to be propitious, when He displays His liberality towards them.
Of this <i>blessing </i>He willed that the prophets should be His ministers in
such a manner that the power should still remain altogether in His own hands.
If, therefore, they usurp to themselves the prerogative of blessing without His
commission, their act is not merely frivolous and inefficacious, but even
blasphemous. Justly, then, does Ezekiel convict of falsehood and deception those
false prophets, who, by their flatteries, encourage the souls which were doomed
to die; whilst they slay by their terrors and threats those to whom God had
promised life.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
13:2 and 22.) Hence we gather, how vain it is for hypocrites, as they are wont
to do, to purchase pardon from men in order to propitiate God; and also that we
need not be afraid of those degenerate ministers, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who desire to domineer tyrannically in virtue of their office, although they
launch their fulminations against the
innocent.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is plain, however, that Balaam's
obedience to God's command does not proceed from the heart. His words, indeed,
might deceive the simple, from their appearance of humility; "I<i> </i>will not
go, because God forbids it; "but there is no doubt but that, led as he was to
gratify them by ambition and by avarice, he indicates that he would be disposed
to undertake the journey, unless he were forbidden by God. If his heart had been
sincere, the honest reply he should have given was obvious, viz., that it was
vain to send either for himself or any one else, in order that Balak might
resist the inviolable decree of God. If he had thus heartily and unequivocally
given glory to God, another embassy would not have been sent to him; but by his
faltering excuse he appeared to inflame the desire of the foolish king, in order
to sell his curse at a higher price; for we know that this is the usual way with
impostors, that they obtain higher pay for themselves in proportion to the
difficulty of the matter. Still, however, if we compare the mercenary prophets
of the Pope with Balaam, his servile and enforced submission will deserve no
little praise by the side of their detestable and indomitable folly, who, in
despite of God, hesitate not to burst forth in impious curses. The truth, which
they oppugn, is conspicuous: that terrible judgment, which (God) denounces by
the mouth of Isaiah, rings in their ears, "Woe unto them that put darkness for
light, and light for darkness,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:20;) nevertheless they proceed, and in their brutal madness vomit forth their
blasphemies not only to the destruction of the Church, but, if it were possible,
to the extinction of all religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balak sent yet again
princes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we see that, however
humbly ungodly men implore God's grace, still they do not lay aside their pride;
as if their grandeur could avail to dazzle the eyes of God. In order, therefore,
to make Him comply with their wishes, they think it enough to display their
magnificent ceremonies; and, indeed, whatever modesty superstition may pretend,
it always swells with secret confidence<i>. </i>Thus Balak, in order to obtain
favor, makes a show of his dignity and power, and deems that Balaam will be thus
at his service. Although, however, the impostor shews much more spirit in this
his second reply than before, still his hypocrisy is soon discovered, and he
betrays the duplicity of his mind. It is, indeed, a noble speech,<i> </i>and
indicative of much magnanimity, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver
and gold, I will not disobey the command of God:" but why does he not instantly
banish from him altogether these unholy traffickers, who are instigating him to
transgression? We<i> </i>see, then, that he speaks rather in a spirit of
boasting, than to ascribe to God the glory due to Him; for his desire was to
acquire for himself the title and credit of a holy Prophet by this parade of
obedience. In the meantime, when he begs that a season of delay should be
granted him for the purpose of inquiring what God's pleasure was, he is
convicted of impious rebellion. He does not dare openly, and in flagrant
contempt of God, to put himself forward for the purpose of cursing God's people:
and so far well: but why does he not acquiesce in the Divine decision? why, when
he has been assured whether a matter was lawful or not, does he still doubtingly
inquire? For thus does he deliberate, and question whether that which God has
once prescribed ought to be certain and unchangeable; nay, he endeavors to force
God to alter His determination. From the time that he had heard, "Thou shalt not
go,"<i> </i>upon what pretense<i> </i>was it permissible to continue the
controversy? This, then, is the object of Balaam's endeavor, that God, by
withdrawing the decision which He had pronounced, should deny Himself; and this
was an act of most blasphemous impiety. Still many such persons will be found
now-a-days, who, though fully assured of the will of God, cease not nevertheless
to countermine it, so that they may at length attain the end, towards which they
are hurried by their lawless cupidity. At the outset, it is anything but their
desire to know what is right; or, when they know it, to follow it: but ambition
instigates some, lust inflames others, and others are urged forward by avarice:
in a word, evil affections preside over every deliberation. Straightway God
interposes some obstacle, and compels them, whether they will or no, to
understand what they ought to do. They proceed, however, notwithstanding; and,
inasmuch as the way is closed, they endeavor by subterfuges, by crooked paths or
evasions, to elude the sure word of God; and, although they appear to do this
modestly, because they hesitate until permission shall have been obtained from
God, yet herein does their impudence betray itself, that they do not cease to
importune God and His prophets, until they have extorted what they have already
heard to be unlawful. It is plain, therefore, that all those are disciples of
Balaam, who try the indulgence, of God, that He may at length permit them to
attempt what; He has once refused.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God came to Balaam at,
night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although God is far from being
deceitful, still hypocrites with their quibbles deserve that He should delude
their craft. If we more closely consider the desire of Balaam, it was that God
should belie Himself. For, if he was persuaded that He was truthful, what else
was there to be hoped except that he should ratify His reply ten times over?
Nevertheless, he wickedly lies to God, when he asks for a permission to go,
which would convict God Himself of capriciousness and inconstancy. God,
therefore, ironically permits what He had before forbidden. If any should deem
it to be absurd that God, who is truth itself, should speak deceptively, the
answer is easily found, viz., that God was guilty of no falsehood, but that He
loosed the reins to a man obstinate in his own perverseness, just as a person
might emancipate a wayward and grossly immoral son, because he will not suffer
himself to be ruled. For had not his ungodly covetousness blinded Balaam, the
meaning of this ironical permission was not difficult to be understood. Hence,
then, let hypocrites learn, that they profit nothing by their vain pretences,
although God may indulge them for a time, since He at length taketh the wily in
their own craftiness; wherefore, nothing is better than, in pure and simple
teachableness, to inquire what He would have us do, that we may instantly
succumb, nor try to alter a word or a syllable as soon as He shall have deigned
to open His holy mouth to instruct us. For to call in question what has been
decided by Him, what is it but to compel Him by our importunity to bend Himself
to our wishes? </font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God's anger was kindled
because he went.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>How is it consistent
that God should be angry when Balaam had attempted nothing, thus far, contrary
to His command? But we must bear in mind, what I have lately hinted, that God
apparently permits much which He does not approve. He allowed the people in the
wilderness to eat flesh: He permitted men to give a writing of divorce to their
wives, and even to marry several at once; still it was not right for them to eat
the flesh, nor were divorce and polygamy free from culpability. At any rate,
Balaam sinned by pertinaciously urging what was sinful, and thus deserved the
punishment of death, though God was pleased to mitigate it. On this point it
behoves us also to be soberly wise, lest, when God's secret judgments differ
from our moral sense, we should cry out against Him. That prophet, who, having
faithfully delivered his message, tasted bread on his way back, and this at the
instigation of another prophet, so that he only fell through carelessness and
want of reflection, He punished with death, (1 Kings 13;) in this case, the
punishment which He inflicts upon an impostor and cheat, who 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f148</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
prostitutes his tongue for hire, is no harsher than to terrify him by threats.
Here the temerity of the flesh would willingly lay hold of the occasion to find
fault with God; but the fact was, that the punishment which awaited Balaam, and
from which he did not finally escape, was delayed for a certain period in order
to display more brightly the glory of God. Wherefore, if a doubt ever pervades
our minds, when the reason for any of God's works is not apparent, let us learn
at once to repress it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The external
manifestation of God's anger is afterwards described; <i>i.e., </i>that the
Angel meets him with a drawn sword; wherein we may observe that, to the great
disgrace of the Prophet, the glory of the Angel was first revealed to the ass.
For, although the Angel had assumed a body, by the sight of which a brute-animal
might be affected, how did it come to pass that the ass was terrified at this
alarm ing sight, whilst the eyes of the Prophet were closed against it, unless
because God wished to brand the stupidity of this faithless man with a mark of
ignominy? He had previously boasted of his extraordinary visions; a vision now
escapes him which was manifest to the eyes of a beast. Whence did such blindness
as this arise, except from avarice, by which he was so stupified as to prefer
filthy lucre to the holy calling of God? In a word, in him was fulfilled, what
Scripture so often denounces against the reprobate, that he was struck by a
spirit of dizziness and folly so as to be unable to perceive anything. I have
already said, that although angels are naturally invisible, yet that they assume
bodies whenever God so pleases, and act in the character of human beings. Who
supplied the Angel with a sword? Even He, who created<i> </i>all things out of
nothing. If any curious person should go further, and inquire of what material
the sword was made? it will be easy to reprove his folly by another question,
viz., Whether it is easier for mortal man or for God to apply iron and steel to
their various purposes? And it might be the case that a bright light shone from
the sword, as when the Cherubim were placed with swords to shut the entrance of
Paradise against Adam. In a word, God clothed His Angel in such a form as might
strike with terror both the brute-animal and the false prophet. But He began
with the ass, in order to put the stolidity of the wicked man more completely to
shame.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses proceeds to relate how the ass,
first of all, was turned aside out of the way, and then, when she was met in a
narrow place, how she tremblingly started back so as to crush her master's foot
against the wall, and at length how she fell down under him. Surely this
miserable impostor ought to have been awakened, if he had not been fascinated by
the devil. But Moses carefully details all these circumstances, in order to show
that he was not only deprived of common sense, but so utterly astounded, as to
pay no attention to a most illustrious
miracle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord opened the mouth of
the ass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Sceptical persons criticize
this passage, and ridicule it, as if Moses related an incredible fable. And,
indeed, their scoff appears to be plausible, when they object that there is a
great difference between the bray of all ass and all articulate voice; but,
however they may now indulge in such wanton observations, they will at length be
made to feel how seriously and reverently we ought to speak of the marvellous
works of God, by their jokes and trifling about which they seek to appear
facetious. Now, since their chattering is unworthy of a lengthened refutation,
let us be satisfied by the contempt into which it is thrown by a single
expression of Moses, when he says that God "opened<i> </i>the mouth of the ass."
For whence would men possess the faculty of speech, unless God had opened their
mouth at the first creation of the world? Whence comes it that magpies and
parrots imitate the human voice, unless it were the will of God to manifest in
them a specimen of a certain extraordinary power? Who is there, then, who shall
now impose a law upon the Maker of the world, to prevent Him from adapting the
mouth of a beast to the utterance of words? Unless perhaps they would suppose
Him to be bound irrevocably, because He has once appointed a certain order in
nature, to abstain from displaying His power by miracles. If the ass had been
changed into a man, we should have been bound to reverence this proof of God's
incomprehensible power; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
now, when we are told that merely a few words were drawn from it without
intelligence or judgment, as if a sound of any kind were diffused through the
air, shall the miracle be regarded as a fable? Moreover, if unclean spirits
utter words in spectral illusions, why shall God be unable to endow mute tongues
with the faculty of speech? Let us, then, learn to reverence with becoming
humility the sentence which God executed on the false prophet. He might have
chastised him directly by the words of the Angel; but, because the reproof would
not have been sufficiently severe if unattended by gross ignominy, He ordained
that a beast should instruct him. The voice of the Angel was, indeed, added
afterwards; but, since he had been so unteachable, he is treated according to
his desert, when, after having made some proficiency in the school of the ass,
he begins to listen to God. And, further, the ass convicts him of being dull,
and deluded in mind in this respect, that he was not aroused by this unusual
circumstance. For she says that she had never before been refractory. If,
therefore, there had been any spark of apprehension in the wretched man, he
ought to have reflected as to what was the meaning of this novel proceeding and
sudden change. Thus was he awakened from his lethargy, in order that he might
listen more attentively to what the Angel afterwards
spoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the Lord opened the eyes of
Balaam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage teaches us, that
whatever be the acuteness of our senses, it is not only implanted in us by God,
but also either sustained or extinguished by His secret inspiration. Balaam's
eyes are opened; consequently there was a veil before them previously, which
prevented him from seeing what was manifest. Thus God at His pleasure makes dull
the senses of those who seem to themselves to be very acute; since perception is
His special gift.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By this example we are shewn
as in a mirror how hypocrites fear God, viz., when they are influenced by His
presence; for as soon as they can withdraw themselves, they revel like fugitive
slaves. Balaam saw the angel threatening him with a drawn sword, and he hung
down his head, and adored; that is to say, because the vengeance of God was
impending. But this fear by no means induced him to true correction of himself,
he confesses, indeed, that he had sinned, and puts forth some fruit of
repentance in that he is ready to return home; but he betrays a servile and
compulsory fear, which only trembles at the thought of punishment. "I<i>
</i>knew not (he says) that thou stoodest in the way." Unless, therefore, the
Angel had been armed for his punishment, he was proceeding in security, as if
impunity were conceded to him. Another expression also discovers his craft and
perfidiousness, he is ready to return, if his proceeding should <i>displease
</i>God; as if he had not known before that it was by no means pleasing to God.
This, then, is a ridiculous condition, as if he were in doubt on a point which
was abundantly clear. If he really feared God, and in pure sincerity of heart,
he ought at once to have renounced an expedition which was wicked in itself, and
improperly undertaken. For what avail was it to say, "I have sinned," if he
thinks that he can prosecute the journey he had begun in opposition to God? Let
us, therefore, learn, when God's will is positively known, to have recourse to
no crooked subterfuges, whereby we may delay to perform
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Angel says: Unless the ass had
turned aside, that he should have slain Balaam without injuring her, he
intimates not only that, in accordance with God's justice and loving-kindness,
he would have spared the harmless animal, but that by the very sagacity of the
beast, &#8212; as though she had deprecated God's anger, &#8212; the life of her
master, who was else unworthy of mercy, had been
redeemed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the angel of the Lord
said unto Balaam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again this wicked man
is ironically permitted to do what could not be carried out without sin. But, as
I have said before, he was so conscious of his ungodly covetousness, that he
knowingly and wilfully deceived himself, instead of being deceived. At the same
time, we must observe that, as Paul calls God's wisdom "manifold,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:10,) so His will is declared in various ways, as if He were inconsistent with
Himself, though it always actually remains the same. Certain it is, that it was
a mere pretense of Balaam, that he went at the command or permission of God.
Nevertheless, this answer was given him, "Go," etc. God, indeed, cast derision
on the pertinacious folly of this wicked man, and did not approve as proper that
which, as far as words went, He permitted; meanwhile, these two things are
consistent with each other, that God did not approve what He condemned, and yet
chose that it should be done. For, even when He executes His purpose by means of
wicked men, He does not prescribe to them that they are to act thus. He willed
to require punishment of Solomon by the hands of Jeroboam, and that the impiety
of the house of Ahab should have vengeance inflicted upon it by Jehu; and still
it was not right of Jeroboam to upset what God had declared, <i>i.e., </i>that
the posterity of David should continue upon the throne; and Jehu also, although
he had been anointed by the Prophet, still was guilty of a criminal act in
seizing the kingdom: inasmuch as nothing but ambition impelled him to it. As far
as relates to the history before us, it was His will to prove by the mouth of
Balaam how effectual and unchangeable was His determination as to the adoption
of the people, whereby His truth and faithfulness might be more conspicuously
shewn forth. Nevertheless, Balaam sinned, in that he was attracted, like a
hound, by the scent of gain, to sell his curses for
money.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whenBalak heard that Balaam
was come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage admirably
represents to us the spirit of all those who are devoted to their various
superstitions without a sincere fear of God. They are cringing to their false
prophets; they meanly flatter them, and hardly stop short of worshipping them,
so that nothing more obsequious can be imagined; yet they inwardly cherish
pride, which breaks out when they by no means expect, it. The king goes forth to
meet the prophet, and to pay due honors to himself and his office. It is a great
condescension; for it is equivalent to laying his crown and sceptre at his feet:
but his dissimulation soon discovers itself, when, expostulating with Balaam, he
boasts of his power and riches, wherewith he was able to reward him. Now this is
precisely as if he should make the prophetical office subservient to money, and
claim the dominion over its revelations by means of his wealth. However great,
then, may be the servility with which superstitious persons flatter their idols
and priests, still they never lay aside their proud spirits. Such zeal we may
see in the Papists, who are as prodigal as possible of the reverence which they
parade towards their prelates and monks; but on this condition, that they will
be, on their part, complacent to their lusts. If, therefore, a priest,
<i>(sacrificus) </i>will not gratify his worshippers, they inveigh against him
with as much bitterness as if he were any
swine-herd.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The answer of Balaam at first sight
breathes nothing but piety: "I<i> </i>have come, (he says,) but I must needs
speak as God shall command." Whereby he signifies, that, as far as civility
required, and inasmuch as depended upon himself, he would have complied with the
wishes of the king; but that, in regard to his office as a prophet, he was not
at liberty to do this, inasmuch as he would disregard the favor of all mankind,
in order that he might obey the commands of God
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balaam went with
Balak.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses proceeds to relate how
honorably and sumptuously Balaam was received. And first, he records that he was
taken to the city of Huzoth; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f150</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which some would understand as a proper name, others as a noun appellative. In
whichever way you take it, it denotes the extent of the city, which was divided
into various streets. Secondly, Moses tells us that an abundance of animals were
slain in preparation for the feast, and that guests were invited to banquet with
Balaam himself. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f151</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The object of all this is, that Balaam was enticed by blandishments, in order
that he might be ashamed to refuse anything to so munificent a king, by whom he
had been treated not merely in a friendly, but in a liberal manner; just as if
Balaam stood in the place of God, or as if the grace of God Himself were
marketable. At length Moses adds that Balaam was brought up into the high places
of Baal, that from this elevation he might more conveniently see the camp of the
people. Moses, however, says that he only saw the extreme part of the camp;
because the whole country was mountainous, and the view was obstructed by
distance; still, in my opinion, the sanctity of the spot was the reason why it
was chosen by Balak. He, therefore, brought Balaam to a temple, as it were, in
order the more to conciliate God's favor. Hence, too, it is apparent that this
impostor had no fixed or solid views with regard to the service of God, but that
he worshipped idols promiscuously amongst the heathen, either because he was
involved in the same superstitions, or because he made no difficulty in
complying with any customs or rites, in order to curry favor. For there have
always been

trimmers in the world, who for flattery's sake have corrupted religion by
various devices, and have mingled heaven with earth.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Build me here seven
altars.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We more positively conclude from
hence that this degenerate prophet had been by no means wont to prophesy in
accordance with pure revelations from God, but that the art of divination, in
which he boasted, had some affinity to magical exorcisms, and was infected with
many errors and deceptions. Still this did not prevent him from being sometimes
a true prophet by the inspiration of God's Spirit; because, as has been already
said, whilst the world was plunged in darkness, it was God's will that some
little sparks of light should still shine, in order to render even the most
ignorant inexcusable. Since, therefore, Balaam was only endowed with a special
gift, he borrowed devices in various directions, which savored of nothing but
the illusions of the devil, and were utterly foreign to the true and legitimate
method of consulting (God.) Hence came the seven victims and the seven altars;
for, although God, by consecrating the seventh day unto Himself, as also in the
seven lamps, and other things, indicated that there was something of perfection
in that number; nevertheless, afterwards, many strange superstitions were
invented, and under this pretense Satan cunningly deluded wretched men, by
persuading them that secret virtues were contained in this number seven. This
frivolous subtlety prevailed also among profane writers, so that they sought the
confirmation of the error throughout all nature. Thus they allege the seven
planets, as many Pleiades, the <i>Septemtriones,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and as many circles or zones; and again, that infants do not come into the
world alive till the seventh month. Many such things they heap together in order
to prove that some hidden mystery is implied in the number seven. This contagion
reached the Christians also: for on this point the ancients 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
sometimes philosophize too refinedly, and have in general preferred to corrupt
(Scripture) rather than not to restrict the gifts of the Spirit to this number,
and to establish the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost. It is plain that Balaam
was infected by this fanciful notion, when he endeavours to draw down God by
seven altars, and twice seven sacrifices. Let us, however, learn from Balak's
prompt compliance, that the superstitious neither spare expense, nor refuse
anything which is demanded by the masters of their errors. Wherefore we must
beware lest we be rashly credulous; whilst at the same time we take care lest,
when it is clear what we ought to do, we should be withheld by discreditable
supineness, when unbelievers hasten so eagerly and speedily to their own
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balaam said unto
Balak.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this respect, also, he
imitates the true servants of God: for he seeks retirement, because God has
almost always appeared unto His servants when they have been separated from the
company of men. You would say that he was another Moses, when he exhorts the
king to persevering prayer, and, in order that he may be more earnest in
supplication, bids him remain perfectly still by the altars. Meanwhile he
withdraws himself from the crowd, and the eyes of the witnesses, so that he may
be more ready to receive the revelation. Since, however, there was no sincerity
in him, we may probably conclude, that in vain ostentation he imitated the
servants of God, that, like one of God's councillors, he might bring forth the
secrets from the shrines of heaven. I know not why some render the word

passages confirm. The impostor, therefore, retired into a higher place, or
summit, in order that he might come forth from thence more surely established as
a prophet by his familiar intercourse with
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God met
Balaam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is wonderful that God should
have determined to have anything in common with the pollutions of Balaam; since
there is no communion between light and darkness, and He detests all association
with demons; but, however hateful to God the impiety of Balaam was, this did not
prevent Him from making use of him in this particular act. This <i>meeting
</i>him, then, was by no means a proof of His favor, as if he approved of the
seven altars, and sanctioned these superstitions; but as He well knows how to
apply corrupt instruments to His use, so by the mouth of this false prophet, He
promulgated the covenant, which He had made with Abraham, to foreign and heathen
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In truth, he boasts of his seven
altars, as if he had duly propitiated God. Thus do hypocrites arrogantly trust
that they deserve well of God, when they do but provoke His anger. God, however,
passes over this corrupt worship, and proceeds with what He had determined; for
He sends Balaam to be a proclaimer and witness of the sureness of His grace
towards His chosen people. He supplies, indeed, His servants with what they
speak, and controls their tongues; for neither would they be sufficient to think
anything, unless the ability were bestowed by Him; and no one can say that Jesus
is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Still the holy Prophets were in suchwise
organs of the Spirit, that they gave forth from the heart the treasures which
God had deposited with them. In this view, Jeremiah says that he "did eat the
words of God,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:16; ) and Ezekiel, that he ate the roll on which his prophecies were written.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;260301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:1.) For we must not conceive an inspiration
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejnqousiasmo&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>such as that by which the heathens supposed their diviners to be carried
away, so that the heavenly <i>afflatus </i>transported them, or threw them into
ecstasies; but rather did that take place in them, which David declares of
himself: "I<i> </i>believed, therefore have I spoken,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:10:) and God illuminated their senses before He guided their tongues. The
case of Balaam was different, whose mind was alienated while he delivered the
words which were put into his mouth. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f156</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he took up his parable
and said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mashal, </i>signifies all weighty and notable sayings, especially when
expressed in exalted language. The meaning, therefore, is, that Balaam began to
speak eloquently, and in no ordinary strain. Nor can it be doubted but that he
aroused Balak's attention by this grandeur of language through God's secret
influence; that the wretched man might acknowledge that Balaam now spoke in no
mortal fashion, but that there was something of divine inspiration in his words,
so that his mind might be the more deeply affected by the revelation. The sum of
what he said was to this effect, that there was not merely perversity and folly
in Balak's design to curse the people, but that whatever he attempted would be
vain and useless, since he was fighting against God. At the same time, he
renounces for himself that power, which Balak was persuaded that he eminently
possessed: for Moses has already recorded the words of Balak before spoken, "I
know that he whom thou cursest is cursed," as if the power of God were
transferred to him, so that he might exercise it according to his will. But what
was this, but to depose God from His supremacy? Consequently this abominable
imagination is refuted by the mouth of Balaam, when he attributes the right of
blessing to God alone. "How (he says) should I curse except according to God's
command?" not that God always restrains the wicked from declaring what is
opposed to His truth: for we know that they often prate at random, vomit forth
their blasphemies by the mouthful, obscure the light by their falsehoods, and
endeavor, as far as in them lies, to overthrow the faithfulness of God. But
inasmuch as Balaam was compelled to play a different part, viz., to proclaim the
revelation suggested to him by God, he confesses that his tongue was tied, so
that he could not utter a single syllable against God's
command.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since mention is made of Syria, some
have supposed that Balaam was fetched from Mesopotamia; and some color was given
to this mistake, because the art of divination had its rise amongst the
Chaldeans. But, as has been said before, it is not credible that the fame of the
man should have extended so far; and again, in the short time during which the
people remained there, how could an embassy have been twice sent to a distant
country? for they would have occupied at least six months. Besides, we shall
soon see that he was slain among the Midianites. But it is very probable that
the country was included under the name of Aram or Syria, which even profane
authors describe as contiguous to Arabia, towards the Red Sea. Now, since, in
reference to the land of Moab, Midian was to the eastward, and, moreover, was
high and mountainous, it is rightly added that he was called "from the mountains
of the east;" and thus does he designate a place well known to the Moabites, on
account of its neighborhood to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b><i>

meaning is that, although he only beheld the people from afar, so that he could
not accurately perceive their power from so high and distant a spot, still they
portended to him something great and formidable. A closer view generally
intimidates men; besides, a body of twenty thousand men then dazzles our sight,
as if the number were five times as great: whilst the real extent of a thing is
also more accurately ascertained. But Balaam declares, in the spirit of
prophecy, that he sees far more in the people of God than their distance from
him would allow; for, posted as he was on a high eminence, he would have only
belleld them as dwarfs with the ordinary vision of men. He says, that "the<i>

said of the people, therefore, that they shall dwell in such a manner as to be
content with their own condition, neither desiring the wealth or power of
others, nor seeking their aid. The fact that the people had recourse at one time
to the Egyptians, at another to the Assyrians, and entangled themselves in
improper alliances, is not repugnant to this prophecy, in which the question is
not as to the virtue of the people, but only as to the blessing of God, which is
again celebrated in the same words in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
33:28.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, that "they<i> </i>shall not
be reckoned among the nations," must not be understood in depreciation of them,
as if it were said that they should be of no credit or position; but the elect
people is exalted above all others in dignity and excellence, as though he had
said that there should be no nation under heaven equal to or comparable with
them. And, although there were other kingdoms more illustrious for the
flourishing condition of their people, and superior both in the number of their
inhabitants, and in all kinds of prosperity, still this people never forfeited
their pre-eminence, since they were distinguished, not so much by wealth and
external endowments, as by the adoption of God. Thus, Mount Sion is called noble
above all other mountains, because God had there chosen to make His abode.
Others explain it that the people should be alone, so as not to be brought into
comparison with the Gentiles, inasmuch as its religion should be separate from
the whole world, and unmingled with heathen corruptions. The exposition which I
have given is, however, more simple.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who can count the dust of
Jacob?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it is plain that what
Balaam was to say was suggested to him by God, since he quotes the words of
God's solemn promise, wherein the seed of Abraham is compared to the dust of the
earth. Still, we must bear in mind what I have just adverted to, that, although
that multitude was reduced to a small number by the sin of the people,
nevertheless this was not declared in vain, inasmuch as that little body at
length expanded itself so as to fill the whole world. Speaking by <i>hyperbole,
</i>then, he says that their offspring would be infinite, since the fourth part
will be<i> </i>almost innumerable. His aspiration at the conclusion is more
emphatic than a simple affirmation. "I would (he says) that I might share with
them their last end!" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f157</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For, in the first place, every one longs for what is most for his good; and
again, Balaam confesses himself unworthy to be reckoned among the elect people
of God. Hence it might be easily inferred how foolishly Balak trusted to his
curse. Further, in these words he refers to everlasting felicity; as much as to
say that (Israel) would be blessed in death as in life. At the same time he is a
witness to our future immortality; not that he had reflected<i> </i>in himself
wherefore the death of the righteous would be desirable, but God extorted this
confession from an unholy man, so that, either unwillingly or thoughtlessly, he
exclaimed that God so persevered in the extension of His paternal favor towards
His people, that He did not cease to be gracious to them even in their death.
Hence it follows, that the grace of God extends beyond the bounds of this
perishing life. Wherefore this declaration contains a remarkable testimony to
our future immortality. For although Balaam, perhaps, did not thoroughly
consider what he desired, still, there is no doubt but that he truly professed
that he wished it for himself. Nevertheless, as hypocrites are wont to do, he
did but conceive an evanescent<i> </i>wish, for it was in no real seriousness
that he sought what he was convinced was best.

Behold how the reprobate seek God by crooked paths, and desire to have nothing
to do with Him, unless He yields to their improper wishes &#8212; in a word,
unless they render Him submissive to them. Balaam, therefore, is compelled to
repress this stupid arrogance, by pleading God's command, and declaring that
nothing more was allowed him than to announce what God prescribed. But we must
remember that this was only spoken in reference to a particular act, when, as
far as his words went, he acted the part of a true prophet, although his
feelings were altogether on the other
side.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balac said unto
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Balak did, as almost all
superstitious persons usually do; for, because with them nothing is certain or
established, they are carried about from one speculation to another, and try now
this and now that expedient. But especially do they imagine that there is some
magical power in the sight, as if the eyes contributed partly to the efficacy of
their incantations. It appears from profane writers that this was formerly a
commonly received opinion, that the gaze of the enchanter had much effect upon
his art. Balak, therefore, removes his sorcerer to another place, that there he
might the better exercise his divinations. There is some ambiguity in the words.
Some render them thus, "Come<i> </i>to another place, that thou mayest see from
thence, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f160</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
mayest see a part, and not the whole," as if Balak feared that the multitude
itself frightened Balaam, or diminished the power of his incantations. Their
opinion, however, is the more probable, who take the verb <i>see, </i>where it
is used the second time, in the perfect tense, so that the sense is, "Come to a
place where thou mayest behold them; for as yet thou hast not seen the whole,
but only a part;" for we know how common a thing with the Hebrews is such an
employment of one tense for another. With respect to the place to which Balaam
was taken, it little matters whether we believe

pis'gah, </i>to be nouns proper or appellative, since it is sufficiently clear
that, if they were given to the place, it was on account of its position; for it
is very likely that there was a level place upon the hill, which might justly be
called "The<i> </i>hill of the
spies."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he came to
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Balak inquires what God had
answered, although he had rejected the previous revelation. Thus do hypocrites
profess anxious solicitude in inquiring the will of God, whilst the knowledge of
it is intolerable to them. Therefore their extreme earnestness in inquiry is
nothing but mere dissimulation. Besides, Balak hunts, as it were, for the answer
of God by a distant divination, whereas a testimony to God's will was all the
time engraven upon his heart. But this is the just punishment of perverse
curiosity, when the wicked endeavor to impose a law upon God, that he may submit
to their wishes. Balak omits nothing in regard to outward ceremonies; he humbly
attends upon the altars for the purpose of propitiating God; but in the meantime
he would have Him obedient to himself, and cannot endure to listen to Him,
unless He speaks to him in flattering and deceptive
terms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he took up his parable and
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have already explained the
meaning of this expression, namely, to make use of glowing and elevated
language, in order the more to awaken the attention of the hearer. The same also
is the object of the preface, "Rise<i> </i>up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me,
thou son of Zippor;" for such repetitions are mostly emphatic, and indicate
something uncommon.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he declares that
"God<i> </i>cannot lie, because he is not like men," it is a severe kind of
censure, as much as to say, "Would<i> </i>you make God a liar? " for it became
requisite that the frantic eagerness of Balak should be repressed, and prevented
from proceeding any further. Hence, however, a lesson of supreme utility may be
extracted, namely, that men are altogether wrong when they form their estimate
of God from their own disposition and habits. Still, almost all men labor under
this mistake. For how comes it that we are so prone to waver, except because we
weigh God's promises in our own scale? In order, therefore, that we may learn to
lift up our minds above the world, whenever the faithfulness and certainty of
God's word are in question, it is well for us to reflect how great the distance
is between ourselves and God. Men are wont to lie, because they are fickle and
changeable in their plans, or because sometimes they are unable to aceomplish
what they have promised; but change of purpose arises either from levity or bad
faith, or because we repent of what we have spoken foolishly and
inconsiderately. But to God nothing of this sort occurs; for He is neither
deceived, nor does He deceitfully promise anything, nor, as James says, is there
with Him any "shadow<i> </i>of turning."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:7.) We now understand to what this dissimilitude between God and men refers,
namely, that we should not travesty God according to our own notions, but, in
our consideration of His nature, should remember that he is liable to no
changes, since He is far above all heavens. As to the meaning of the repentance
of God, of which mention is often made, let my readers seek it elsewhere in its
proper place. We must, however, at the same time, observe the application of the
lesson; for the words "God<i> </i>is true," would have no efficacy in
themselves, unless they are applied to their appropriate use, <i>i.e., </i>that
we should with unhesitating faith acquiesce in His promises, and seriously
tremble at His threats. For with the same object it is said that the word of God
is pure and perfect, and is compared with gold refined seven times in the fire;
and this also is the tendency of the conclusion, which is presently added:
"Shall<i> </i>He not fulfill what He has spoken?" Balak desired to have the
people cursed, whom God had adopted: Balaam declares that this is impossible,
because God is unchangeable in that which he has decreed. In a word, he teaches
us the same truth as Paul does, that the election of his people is "without
repentance," because it is founded on the gratuitous liberality of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29.) If, then, this saying was extorted from the hireling false prophet, how
inexcusable will be our stupidity, if our minds vary and waver in embracing
God's word, as if He Himself were
variable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I have received
commandment to bless.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i>
</i>signifies that a command to bless had been given him, antl a positive law
laid down for him. For, as has been said, he was not free and independent in
this matter; but God had bound him to exercise the prophetic office, even
against his own will. Hence he declares that it is not in his power to alter the
revelation, of which he is the minister and witness. But there is a remarkable
expression introduced in the midst of his declaration, viz., that God himself
had blessed; whereby he intimates that the lot of men, whether adverse or
prosperous, depends on the authority of God alone; and that no other commission
is given to the prophets, except to promulgate what God has appointed; as if he
had said, It belongs to God alone to decree<i> </i>what the condition of men is
to be; He has chosen me to proclaim His blessing; it is not in my power either
to reverse or withdraw it. Now, since Balaam here sustains the character of a
true Prophet, we may gather from his words that no other power of binding or
loosing is given to the ministers of the Word, except that they should
faithfully bring forward what they may have received from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>

which bring nothing but deadly labor and trouble to their worshippers; as if it
were said that Israel was pure and untainted by such offenses, in that they duly
served the one true God. But how will it be correct to say that God saw not
idolatry in the people, when they had so openly fallen into it? For, although
the golden calf was only made on one occasion, still their manifold and almost
constant rebellions were such as to forbid these wicked and perverse men from
being thus absolved. Since, however, these two words in connection signify all
sorts of iniquities, which tend to men's hurt, or to the infliction of harm and
loss, a more proper meaning will be, that such iniquity is not seen in Jacob as
to include him with the nations that are given to violence and crime.
Nevertheless, even if we take it thus, the former question still arises; for we
know that the Israelites were scarcely better than the worst of mankind. Some
reply feebly, that it was not seen, because God did not impute it; but, in my
opinion, nothing else is meant by these words but that the people were pleasing
to God, because He had sanctified them. If any object, that they were not
therefore any the more just or innocent, the answer is easy &#8212; that it is
not here declared what they were, but only God's grace is magnified, who deigned
to exalt them as a holy nation. In this way Jerusalem was the holy city and the
royal abode of God, though it was a den of thieves. On this ground Paul says
that the children of Abraham were "holy<i> </i>branches,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:16,) because they sprang from a holy root. In the same sense they are
everywhere called God's Children, however degenerate they might be. God,
therefore, is said to have seen no iniquity in them, with reference to His
adoption; not that they were worthy of such exalted praise, as if a distinction
were drawn between them and the other nations &#8212; not on account of their
deserts, but from the mere good pleasure of God. Thus Paul elsewhere, after he
has compared them with the Gentiles, and has shewn that they are their superiors
in no respect, at length adds, "What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit
is there of circumcision? Much (he says) every way; "and adduces a mark of
distinction which does not proceed from themselves, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:1.) In a word, because it had pleased God to choose that people, He rather
manifested His love towards Himself and His own grace, than towards their life
and conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others take this passage otherwise,
viz., that God did not behold iniquity, nor see perverseness in Jacob, because
He was not willing that he should be unrighteously grieved or afflicted; as if
it were said, If any one should wish unjustly to injure this people, God will
permit no violence or injustice to be done to them, but will rather defend them
as their shield. But if this sense be preferred, I should rather be disposed to
take the vero indefinitely, as if it were said, Perverseness shall not be seen
in Jacob; for when the Hebrews use the verb without a nominative, they extend
the matter in question into a general proposition, and then the verb in the
active voice may be suitably resolved into the passive. And thus the context
will run better, since it is added immediately afterwards, "The Lord his God is
with him," whereby the reason seems to be given why perverseness <i>(molestia)
</i>should not be seen <i>against </i>Jacob, viz., because God would be at hand
to render him aid. For we know that His infinite power suffices to defend the
safety of His Church, so that not even the gates of hell should prevail against
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows directly afterwards, "The shout
or the rejoicing of a king is among them," I understand to be that God will
always give them cause for triumph; for the word which the old interpreter
elsewhere renders rejoicing <i>(jubilationem,) </i>seems here to be used for
songs of rejoicing; but, since it also signifies the sound of a trumpet, it will
not be inappropriate to take it as that the people shall be terrible to their
enemies, because they shall boldly rush forward, or go down to the battle, as if
God sounded the trumpet.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God brouqht them out of
Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He assigns a reason for their
constant success, <i>i.e., </i>because God has once redeemed this people, He
will not forsake the work which He has begun. The argument is drawn from the
continued course of God's blessings; for, since they flow from an inexhaustible
fountain, their progress is incessant. This, however, specially refers to the
state of the Church, for He will never cease to be gracious to His children,
until He has led them to the very end of their course. Rightly, therefore, does
Balaam conclude that, because God has once redeemed His people, He will be the
perpetual guardian of their welfare. He afterwards teaches that the power
wherewith God defends His people shall be invincible, for this is the meaning of
the similitude of the unicorn.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely there is no
enchantment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage is commonly
expounded as an encomium on the people, because they are not given to
enchantments and magical superstitions, as God also had strictly enjoined upon
them in His law that they should not pollute themselves by such defilements.
Others thus explain it, The Israelites shall not want enchanters, because by the
Urim and Thummim, or by the Prophets, God would reveal to them whatever should
be profitable for them. Their opinion is more correct who thus interpret it, No
enchantment and no divination avails against the Israelites. Let us now proceed
to explain this more clearly. Balaam, in my judgment, confesses that there is no
room for His enchantments, or that his customary arts fail him now, because
their efficacy and power cannot affect the Israelites. And this confession
harmonizes with the words of Pharaoh's magicians, when they said, "This<i>
</i>is the finger of God,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020819&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
8:19;) after they had pertinaciously contended, until God compelled them to
yield. Thus now Balaam declares that the elect people were defended from on
high, so that his divinations were ineffectual, and his enchantments
vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The other clause of the verse appears to
me to be simply to this effect, that God would henceforth perform mighty works
for the defense of His people which should be related with admiration. The
translation which some give is constrained and far-fetched, "As<i> </i>at this
time it shall be said, What has God wrought in Israel?" for Balaam rather would
say, that great should be the progress of God's grace, the beginnings only of
which then appeared; and in short, he declares that henceforth memorable should
be the performances of God in behalf of His people, which should supply abundant
subjects for history.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the people shall rise
up as a great lion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This comparison is
not in every respect accurate; for it does not signify that the Israelites
should be cruel or rapacious, but merely bold and strong, and prompt in their
resistance if any should provoke them. In the next chapter, it will occur again
with a slight change in the words. What Balaam here predicates generally of the
whole people, is applied in the blessings of Jacob to the tribe of Judah alone,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:9,) because it especially excelled in bravery. The sum is, that however the
people of Israel might be attacked on every side, it should be endued with
invincible fortitude, to overcome all assaults, or to repel them vigorously. Let
us, finally, remember that this courage, wherewith Israel was to defend itself
against all its enemies, was counted amongst the gifts of God; as: if Balaam had
said that they should be preserved by the help of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balak said unto
Balaam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we may behold as in a
mirror how wretchedly unbelievers are driven to and fro, so as to alternate
between vain hopes and fears, though by their changes of purpose they are still
brought back to the same errors, as if their blind passion led them through a
labyrinth. When Balak sees that he is deceived in his opinion, he seeks at least
that the hireling prophet should neither profit nor injure. This, however, is
exactly as if he would have God to lie idle; but presently he recovers his
spirits, and endeavors to repurchase the curse, which in his penitence he had
abandoned. For this cause he drags Balaam to another place, although he had
already discovered that this was in vain. But thus pertinaciously do unbelievers
prosecute their wicked efforts: whilst, at the same time, the disquietude which
agitates them with doubts is the just reward of their
temerity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>

avert the odium and blame from himself, he would state that he was carried away
against his will by the Divine <i>afflatus. </i>At the same time he throws back
the blame on Balak himself, who, though warned in time, had still foolishly sent
to fetch him. The rest I have already expounded.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Balaam saw that it
pleased the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is evident that
Balaam, in order to gratify the wicked king for the sake of the reward,
endeavored by various shifts and expedients to obtain an answer in accordance
with his wishes. Thus do the wicked seek to propitiate God by delusive means,
just as we soothe children by coaxing. And God for some time allowed him 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to gloat upon his fallacious oracle. He now, however, lays closer constraint
upon him, and, breaking off all delay, dictates an answer, which He compels him
to deliver. For his obedience is not here praised as if, when he understood the
will of God, he yielded voluntarily and abandoned his monstrous cupidity; but,
because now there was no more room for subterfuge, he dared not stir his foot,
as if God had put forth His hand to retain him in his
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When it is said that "the Spirit of God
was upon him," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f164</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
after he turned his eyes "toward the wilderness" and beheld the camp of Israel,
how they were marshalled "according to their tribes," we must understand it
thus: not that he was influenced by a sincere feeling of good-will, so that the
sight itself suggested grounds for blessing; but that he was induced by the
inspiration of the same Spirit, who afterwards put forth His influence in the
prophecy itself. It is said, then, that the Spirit of God was upon him, not as
if it had begun to inspire him at that particular moment when he cast his eyes
upon the camp of Israel; but because it prompted him to look in that direction,
in order that the impulse of prophecy might be stronger in him, as respecting a
thing actually before his eyes. But after the Spirit had thus affected his
senses, or at any rate had prepared them to be fit instruments for the execution
of his office, it then also directed his tongue to prophesy; but in an
extraordinary manner, so that a divine majesty shone forth in the sudden change,
as if he were transformed into a new man. In a word, "the<i> </i>Spirit of God
was upon him," shewing by manifest token that He was the author of his address,
and that he did not speak of his own natural intelligence. To the same intent it
is said that "he<i> </i>took up his parable," because 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the character of his address was marked with unusual grandeur and magnificent
brilliancy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This preface has no other object
than to prove that he is a true prophet of God, and that he has received the
blessing, which he pronounces, from divine revelation; and indeed his boast was
true as regarded this special act, though it might be the case that pride and
ambition impelled him thus to vaunt. It is, however, probable that he prefaced
his prophecy in this way by the inspiration of the Spirit, in order to demand
more credit for what he said. From a consideration of this purpose we may the
better gather the meaning of his words. Balaam dignifies himself with titles, by
which he may claim for himself the prophetic office; whatever, therefore, he
predicates of himself, we may know to be the attributes of true prophets, whose
marks and distinctions he borrows. To this end he says that he is "hidden in his
eye," by which he means that he does not see in the ordinary manner, but that he
is endued with the power of secret vision. Interpreters agree that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;t&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>shethum, </i>is<i> </i>equivalent to
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ts</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
sethum, </i>which is <i>closed </i>or <i>hidden. </i>Thus some render it in the
pluperfect tense: The man who had his eyes closed; and this they refer to the
blindness of Balaam, since his ass saw more clearly than himself. Others, who
perceive this gloss to be too poor, expound it by <i>anti-phrasis, </i>Whose eye
was open; but, since this interpretation, too, is unnatural, I have no doubt but
that he says his eyes were hidden, because in their secret vision they have more
than human power. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For David makes use of the word to signify mysteries, when he
says:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou<i> </i>hast
manifested to me the hidden things</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f168</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
of wisdom."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
51:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Unless, perhaps, we may prefer that he was called the
man with hidden eyes, as despising all human things, and as one with whom there
is no respect of persons; the former interpretation, however, is the more
suitable. And assuredly, when he adds immediately afterwards, the hearer of "the
words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty," it must be taken
expositively. To the same effect is what is added in conclusion: "He<i> </i>who
falls 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f169</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and his eyes are opened;"<i> </i>for the exposition which some give, that his
mind was awake whilst he was asleep as regarded his body, is far-fetched; and
there is a tameness in the opinion of those who refer it to the previous
history, where it is recorded that, after Balaam had fallen under the ass, his
eyes were opened to see the angel (chap. 22:31.) Comparing himself, therefore,
to the prophets, he says that he fell down in order to receive his visions; for
we often read that the prophets were prostrated, or lost their strength, and lay
almost lifeless, when God revealed Himself to them; for thus did it please God
to cast down His servants as to the flesh, in order to lift them up above the
world, and to empty them of their own strength, in order to replenish them with
heavenly virtue.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How goodly are thy tents, O
Jacob!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The internal condition of
prosperity enjoyed by the people is described by various similitudes akin to
each other, and expressive of the same thing. He compares them to valleys and
well-watered gardens, and then to trees which were rendered succulent by
abundance of moisture, and finally to fields whose seeds imbibe fatness from the
waters. The word we translate "<i>valleys</i> spread forth," some prefer to
render "streams;"<i> </i>and the Hebrew word signifies both; but the course of
the metaphors requires that valleys should be rather understood. For the same
reason I have given the translation "aloe-trees;" for, although the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylha</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
ohelim, </i>often means "tabernacles,"I have no doubt but that it here refers to
trees, so as to correspond with what follows as to the cedars. They are called
trees "which the Lord hath planted," as surpassing the ordinary growth of nature
in their peculiar excellency, and exhibiting something more noble than the
effect of human labor and skill.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the
concluding similitude the interpreters have erred, in nay opinion. Some
translate it, "His<i> </i>seed (<i>is</i>) many waters;"<i> </i>others, "on many
waters;" but 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f170</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the literal translation which I have given runs far better, viz., that he is
like a rich and fertile field, whose seed is steeped in much
water.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus far Balaam has been speaking of
God's blessing, which shall enrich the people with an abundance of all good
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his king shall be higher
than Agag.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now begins to enlarge on
their outward prosperity, viz., that the people of Israel shall be powerful and
flourishing, and endowed with a warlike spirit to resist the assaults of their
enemies; for it would not be sufficient that they should abound with all
blessings, unless the ability to defend them should also be superadded. It is by
no means a probable conjecture that he speaks of Saul who made prisoner of their
king, Agag, in the battle with the Amalekites; but their opinion is the more
correct one, who suppose that this was a name common to all the kings of that
nation. It was, therefore, God's intention to declare the superiority of His
chosen people to the Amalekites; nor need we be surprised that they should be
thus brought into especial antagonism with them, not only because they were the
constant enemies of Israel, but because their power was then excessively great,
as we shall very soon see: "Amalek was the first of nations," etc. (verse
20.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although for a long time afterwards, there
was no king in Israel, still there is no absurdity in the fact that the
commonwealth should be designated by the name of <i>"king," </i>and
<i>"kingdom;" </i>especially since God had postponed the full accomplishment of
His grace until the time of the establishment of the kingdom. Hence, in this
prophecy, Balaam, however little he might have been aware of it, embraced the
time of David; and consequently he predicted things which were only accomplished
in Christ, on whom the adoption was
founded.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows has been already
expounded, viz, that God, in delivering His people, had made it plain that He
would have them remain in safety and perpetuity; and that He was able to bring
this to pass.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is he that blesseth
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This mode of expression signifies
that the Israelites were elected by God, on these terms, that He would account
as conferred upon Himself whatever injury or benefit they might receive. Nor is
there anything new in this, that God should declare that He would be an enemy to
the enemies of His Church; and, on the other hand, a friend to her friends,
which is a token of the high favor with which He regards her. Hence, however, we
are taught, that whatever good offices are performed towards the Church, are
conferred upon God Himself, who will recompense them faithfully: and, at the
same time, that believers cannot be injured, without His avenging them: even as
He says; "He<i> </i>that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
2:8.) If any should object that Balaam himself went unrewarded, although he
blessed the people, the reply is an easy one, that he was unworthy of any
praise, who was by no means disposed in the people's favor of his own accord,
and out of pure and generous feeling; but who was forcibly drawn in a direction
whither he was unwilling to go. Meanwhile, this point remains unshaken, that
whosoever have contributed their labors for the Chureh's welfare, and have been
her faithful helpers, shall be sure partakers of the blessing which is here
promised.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balak's anger was kindled
against Balaam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Inasmuch as the
obstinacy of the wicked is not overcome, so that they should submit themselves
to God, when He would bring their lusts under the yoke, it must needs be that,
when they are still further pressed, they are carried away into passion. Thus
now, Balak, after murmurings and expostulations, bursts forth into impetuous
wrath, and rejects, and drives away with reproaches from his presence Balaam,
whom he had hitherto been endeavoring to cajole. For, when he smites his hands
together, it is because he can no longer restrain himself. He is especially
indignant, because Balaam had not hesitated freely and openly to bear witness to
the blessing of the children of Israel, against whom he was so full of hatred.
For nothing is more galling to kings than when they see private individuals
regarding their presence at least without alarm. Since he determines to give no
reward to the untoward and ill-starred prophet, he throws the blame upon God,
lest he should himself incur discredit from this, as if he were illiberal. And,
indeed, what he says is true, that God had kept back Balaam from honor; yet
impiously, and, as it were, reproachfully, does he lay the blame upon God, and,
in fact, accuses Him of being the cause of the non-fulfillment of his
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Balaam said unto
Balak.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Balaam speaks the truth, indeed,
yet in a bad spirit, as we have seen: for he excuses himself with servility 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to Balak, that it did not depend on himself that he did not comply with his
wishes, but that God had stood in the way. For he grieves at the loss of his
reward; and however grandly he may declaim on the supremacy of God, he still
signifies that he has rather acted upon compulsion than willingly executed what
was enjoined upon him. By "the word <i>(sermonem) </i>of <i>Jehovah," </i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means not only His decree, but what had been dictated to him, and which
he would have still greatly desired to alter; but he indicates that he was bound
by the power of the Spirit to declare, even against his own will, whatever
revelation he received. Thus the word "do"<i> </i>refers to his tongue, or his
charge as a prophet; since he had not been hired by Balak to perform any manual
act, but only to injure the people by his words. The word "heart" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f173</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is contrasted with the revelation of the Spirit; for impostors are said to speak
out of their own heart, when they falsely make use of God's name to cover their
own inventions. He, therefore, declares that he was not at liberty to speak "of
his own heart," because he was the minister of the
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now, behold, I go unto my
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the counsel which he gave
is not here expressly mentioned, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f174</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is the opinion of some that his address is unfinished, and they suppose that
he referred to the cunning advice so destructive to the people, which will be
presently related; <i>i.e., </i>that the Moabitish women should prostitute
themselves. Others rather imagine that Balaam counselled Balak to rest quiet,
since the prosperity of the Israelites would do no harm to the Moabites in his
lifetime. I, however, take it simply for to teach, or to admonish what would be
for his advantage. Thus he commends his prophecy, in order that Balaam may
willingly submit to it. Still, when he speaks of the "latter days," he signifies
that there was no cause for Balak himself to fear or be anxious; since the
punishment of his nation would be deferred for a long time. In the meantime we
see what Balak had gained by his trouble; for, whereas he had hitherto only
heard the people of Israel blessed, he is not compelled to listen to what is
more painful still, viz., the ruin of his own nation. This is the reward of
those who strive against God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Balaam the son of Beor hath
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Inasmuch as he was preparing to
treat of most important matters, it is not without reason that he renews his
preface, in order to obtain more authority for his prophecy: and although it was
not without ambition that he proclaimed these magnificent titles, still we
cannot doubt but that God would ratify by them what he had determined to deliver
through the mouth of the prophet. It was requisite that this worthless man,
whose doctrine would otherwise have been contemptible: should be marked out by
Divine indications; and thus it was that he assumed a character that he did not
possess, and attributed to himself what only belongs to true prophets. I have
before explained how the open and the closed eye are spoken of in the same
sense, though for different reasons: forhe calls the eye "hidden,"<i> </i>as
perceiving the secret things of darkness, which are incomprehensible to the
human sense; but he claims for himself "open eyes," in that he beholds, by
prophetic vision, what he is about to say, as if he would deny that he was going
to speak of things which were obscure, and scarcely intelligible to
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall see him, but not
now.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f175</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Though the verbs are in the future tense, they are used for the present; and
again, the pronoun <i>him </i>designates some one who has not yet been
mentioned; and this is a tolerably common usage with the Hebrew, especially when
referring to Jerusalem, or God, or some very distinguished man. The relative is,
therefore, here put </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for the antecedent: and although
there can be no doubt but that he alluded to the people of Israel, it is still a
question whether he designates the head or the whole body; on which point I do
not make much contention, since it is substantially the same
thing.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The reason why Balaam postpones his
prophecies to a distant period, is in order to afford consolation to Balak, for,
as much as he possibly can, he seeks to avoid his ill-will, and therefore
assures him that, although he denounces evil, it was not to be feared at an
early period, since he treats of things which were as yet far
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The second clause must be unquestionably
restricted to the head of the people, called metaphorically "a<i> </i>Star," and
then expressly referred to without a figure; for this repetition is common with
the Hebrews, by which they particularize the same thing twice over. Assuredly he
means nothing else by "the<i> </i>Sceptre," except what he had indicated by the
"Star;" and thus he connects the prosperity of the people with the kingdom.
Hence we gather that its state was not perfect until it began to be governed by
the hand of a king. For, inasmuch as the adoption of the family of Abraham was
founded on Christ, only sparks of God's blessing shone forth until its completed
brightness was manifested in Christ. It must be observed, therefore, that when
Balaam begins to prophesy of God's grace towards the people of Israel, he
directs us at once to the scepter, as if it were the true and certain mirror of
God's favor. And, in fact, God never manifested Himself as the Father of this
people except by Christ. I admit, indeed, that some beginnings existed in the
person of David, but they were very far from exhibiting the fullness of the
reality: for the glory of his kingdom was not lasting, nay, its chief dignity
was speedily impaired by the rebellion of the ten tribes, and was finally
altogether extinguished; and when David's power was at its height, his dominion
never extended beyond the neighboring nations. The coming forth of the Star and
the Sceptre, therefore, of which Balaam speaks explicitly, refers to Christ; and
what we read in the Psalm corresponds with this prophecy;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord shall send the
sceptre</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
of thy strength out of Sion."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
110:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows that the blessing, of which Balaam
speaks, descends even to us; for, if the prosperity of the ancient people, their
rest, their well-ordered government, their dignity, safety, and glory, proceeded
from the scepter as its unmixed source, there is no doubt but that Christ by His
coming accomplished all these things more fully for
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The destruction of the nation of Moab is
added as an adjunct of the kingdom. And first, indeed, Balaam declares that "its
princes shall be transfixed." If any prefer to read its "corners," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f177</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the expression is metaphorical, implying that the Sceptre will break through its
munitions, or destroy what may seem to be strongest. I do not doubt but that the
same thing is confirmed in what is said of the children of Sheth;" for those who
take it generally for the whole human race, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f178</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
violently wrest the text by their gloss. Balaam is speaking of the neighboring
nations; and, when in the next verse he goes on to specify Edom, he adds Mount
Seir by way of explanation. Since the form of the two sentences is identical, it
is probable that none others than the Moabites are meant by the children of
Sheth. Still the question arises why Balaam attributes to a single nation what
was common to all, for all who were of the descendants of Sheth equally derived
their origin from Noah. Some think that they boasted of this descent in order to
conceal their shame, for we know that the founder of this nation sprang from an
incestuous connection. But another more satisfactory reason occurs to me, viz.,
that they boasted, like the Amalekites, of the extreme antiquity of their
race;<i> </i>since, therefore, they desired to be reckoned amongst the most
ancient nations, it will not be improbable that by this ironical appellation
their vain-glory was reproved. It may, however, have been the case that some one
amongst the descendants of Moab was distinguished by this name. Still, as I have
lately said, the Moabites as well as the Edomites were subdued by David, for
David thus justly celebrates his triumphs over them,</font><br></div>

here again ratified by Moses. Although the vengeance, which God was about to
take, lay dormant for many ages, it was at length experimentally proved that God
had not threatened in vain. But, whilst it is true that they were destroyed by
Saul, still we learn from the history that some still survived, and again
inhabited their land. In order, therefore, to arrive at the entire
accomplishment of this prophecy, we must come to Christ, whose kingdom is the
eternal destruction of all the wicked. Poor and unsatisfactory is the view of
some commentators 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f179</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who think that Amalek is called "the<i> </i>first of the nations," because they
first took up arms against Israel, and encountered them in order to prevent
their advance. Rather is the pride of Amalek indirectly rebuked, because they
claimed superiority for themselves over other nations, and this on the score of
their antiquity, as if they had been created together with the sun and moon.
There is then a pointed comparison between this noble origin, and the slaughter
which awaited them at their end.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>

sense in which Balaam is said to have <i>seen </i>the Kenites, as well as the
other nations; and now, also, I should refrain from doing so, if some did not
attribute it to prophetical vision, in which opinion I cannot agree: for Moses
relates as a matter of history that Balaam turned his face in the directions in
which they respectively lived: and, although he did not actually see the people
themselves, the sight of the place in which they dwelt was sufficient for the
purpose of prophecy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the Kenites I understand
the Midianites, who were contiguous to the Amalekites; for it is altogether
unreasonable to refer the name to the descendants of Jethro. Forty years had not
yet elapsed since Jethro had left his son with Moses; and his was only one small
family in the wilderness of Midian, whereas mention is here made of a people
already celebrated. Balaam, therefore, designates by <i>synecdoche </i>the
Midianites, and devotes them also to the punishment they well deserved. Of this
Gideon was in some measure the minister and executioner, when he routed their
immense army with three hundred men; and his victory is celebrated in

consent that it should be referred to the Israelites; yet they differ as to the
meaning of it, for some take it affirmatively, that the Kenites should be
wasted, until the Assyrians should conquer the Israelites and carry them away
captive; some, however, take it interrogatlvely, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f180</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if it were an abrupt exclamation, How long shall Asshur hold thee captive?
Thus they conceive the prolonged exile of the people is indicated. Undoubtedly
it was the purpose of the Spirit to shew, by way of correction, that their
prosperity, which had been previously mentioned, should be mixed with heavy
afflictions: for slavery is a bitter thing, and exile even worse. Hence we
gather that, though the Church is blessed by God, it is still in such a way as
that it shall not cease to be exposed to various calamities. The interrogation,
therefore, will be most
appropriate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ships shall come from the
coast of Chittim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is unquestionable
that the word Chittim is sometimes used for the Greeks. Some, indeed, imagine
that the Macedonians alone are strictly called by this name; it is, however,
plain that it is applied generally to the whole of Greece. But since the
countries beyond the sea were not so well known to the Jews as to allow of their
distinguishing them, Scripture sometimes transfers this same name to Italy.
Without doubt in Daniel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;271130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
11:30,) "the ships of Chittim" must be taken for those of Italy or Rome; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f181</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because the angel there predicts that the ships of Chittim would come, which
should overcome, and render frustrate the efforts of Antiochus; which was
plainly brought to pass by the mission of Popilius. With regard to the present
passage, first of all the Greeks under Alexander afflicted both Judea and
Assyria; and then another affliction followed at the hands of the Romans. Since,
however, Balaam has begun to prophesy of the kingdom of Christ, it is probable
that the Romans are included together with the Greeks. But from hence we more
clearly perceive, what I have lately adverted to, that the children of God are
not so exempted from common evils as not to be often involved in them
promiscuously with unelievers, as if their conditions were precisely identical.
Although the Hebrews are placed on a par with the Assyrians as their companions
in misfortune, still a consolation is added, <i>i.e., </i>that the Assyrians
also shall perish like Chittim, when they have persecuted the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What Moses adds in conclusion, viz.,
that Balaam returned to his people, and Balak also went to his place, tends to
the commendation of God's grace, since He dissipates the evil counsels of the
wicked like clouds, and overthrows their machinations; even as Moses
commemorates elsewhere this peculiar blessing of God.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel abode in
Shittim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this narrative we learn
assuredly that the people were no more able to bear prosperity than adversity.
Heretofore, either worn out by fatigue, or rendered impatient by abstinence and
famine, they had often rebelled against God; now, when they have entered a
habitable land, and are resting in the midst of fruitful fields, they are
incited by their more comfortable dwelling-places, and more pleasant mode of
life, to lasciviousness, and the indulgence of filthy lusts. Moses relates how,
when they had given way to their lust, they fell at the same time into whoredom
and idolatry. We shall presently see that this arose from the counsel of Balaam,
that the Moabites should prostitute their women to the Israelites, in order to
entice them by their blandishments to unholy worship. Balaam had learnt by
experience that God's favor was an invincible safeguard to protect the people
from all injury. He, therefore, invents a plan whereby they may destroy
themselves, by not only depriving themselves of God's protection, but also by
provoking His wrath against them. By this fan, then, Balaam stirred up the fire,
which impelled these poor wretches, inflamed by blind lechery, to another crime,
by which they might arouse against themselves the enmity of God. Consequently
Paul, referring to this history, informs us that the punishment, which will be
mentioned immediately, was inflicted upon them for fornication.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:8.) For, although it was God's design to avenge the violation of
His worship, still it is fitting to examine into the origin and source of the
evil. Just as, if a drunken man has killed a person, the murder will be imputed
to his drunkenness, so Paul, seeing the Israelites impelled by fornication to
idolatry, sets before us the punishment as a warning to deter us from
fornication, which was the primary cause of their chastisement, and the means of
their corruption. Since, then, the fall from one sin to another is so easy, let
us hence learn to be more watchful, lest Satan should entangle us in his snares.
Let us also observe that he creeps upon us by degrees in order to entrap us. The
Moabitish damsels did not straightway solicit the Israelites to worship their
idols, but first invite them to their banquets, and thus tempt them to idolatry;
for, if mention had been made at first of idol-worship, perhaps they might have
shuddered at the atrocity of the crime, to which they allowed themselves to be
beguiled by degrees. Now, to be present at a feast which was celebrated in honor
of false gods, was a kind of indirect renunciation of the true God; and when
they had been attracted thus far, they threw aside all shame, and abandoned
themselves to that extreme act whereby they transfer the honor due only to the
one true God, to false and imaginary
deities.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>AndIsrael joined himself to
Baal-peor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses amplifies their crime
by this expression, that they bound themselves to the idol in an impious
alliance; and thus he alludes to that holy union whereby God had connected
Himself with the people, and accuses them of broken faith and wicked rebellion.
Nevertheless, it is probable that the people were not impelled by superstition,
but enticed by the wiles of the women to offer worship to idols which they
despised. Yet we are told how God declared that they were "joined" to the idol,
which they merely pretended to worship, in order to comply with the ungodly
wishes of the women. Hence, therefore, this general instruction may be gathered,
that when we turn aside from pure religion, we in a manner connect ourselves
with idols, so as to coalesce in one body with them, and conspire to renounce
the true God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Baal was then the general name of
almost all idols; but all epithet is added to the idol of the Moabites, taken
from Mount Peor; nor does it appear that we need go in quest of any other
etymology, since the name of this mountain has recently been mentioned. It was
on the same principle as in Popery, when they name their Marys after particular
places, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f183</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
where the most famous statues are
worshipped.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have often seen before how God
executed<i> </i>His judgments by His own hand, as if He put it forth from
heaven; He now imposes this office on Moses, although it is evident from the
context that he was not appointed to execute it alone, but that the other judges
were associated with him; for it immediately follows that Moses intrusted the
same charge to them, and thus, what was obscure, on account of the brevity with
which it is recorded, is more clearly expressed. At any rate, it was a notable
judgment of God Himself, though He employed men as its ministers. Nor does Paul
in vain exhort 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f184</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
us by this example to beware of fornication.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
mode of the punishment, however, was diverse, for the lower orders were slain
(by pestilence,) but the leaders were hanged upon the gallows, that the sight
might awaken more terror; for by "the<i> </i>heads of the people" he means those
of the highest repute, whose ignominy must have been most notable, because the
eyes of all men are generally upon the great and noble. Hence, also, they
deservedly incur the heavier punishment, because obscure persons do less harm by
their example, nor are their acts so generally the objects of imitation. Let,
therefore, those who are held in esteem beware lest they provoke others to sin
by their evil deeds, for, in proportion to each man's pre-eminence, the less
excuse he deserves. Others interpret it differently, as if Moses were commanded
to fetch the princes to give their sentence against the criminals; thus by the
pronoun "them"<i> </i>they understood whosoever should be convictcd; but it is
hardly probable that so great a multitude were hanged, and therefore I do not
doubt but that reference is made to their peculiar
punishment:.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, behold, one of the
children of Israel came.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses here
relates a case which was foul and detestable beyond others. There is no doubt
but that many, in the midst of such gross licentiousness as had now for some
time generally prevailed, had filled the camp with various scandalous offenses;
but there was something peculiarly enormous in the atrocity of this act, in that
this impious despiser of God wantonly insulted both God and men amidst the tears
and lamentations of all, as if he were triumphing over all shame and modesty.
The multitude were weeping before the tabernacle, that is to say, all the pious
who trembled at the thought of approaching calamity, since they were fully
persuaded that this licentiousness, accompanied by idolatry and sacrilege, would
not be unpunished; meanwhile, this abandoned man rushes forward, and, in mockery
of their tears, leads his harlot in procession as it were. No wonder, therefore,
that God should have exercised such severity, when things had come to this
extremity. But it must be observed that the order of the history is inverted,
since it is not credible that, after the Judges had begun to perform their
office, such an iniquity should be committed. But this narrative is thus
inserted, in order that it may be more apparent how necessary it was to proceed
speedily to severe chastisement, since otherwise it would have been impossible
to apply a remedy in time to so desperate an
evil.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The courage of Phinehas is
celebrated, who, whilst the rest were hesitating, inflamed with holy zeal,
hastens forward to inflict punishment. The backwardness of others is therefore
condemned by implication, though their tears were praiseworthy; but, since they
were almost stupified by grief, their virtue was not dear from all defect. And
certainly, whilst the yet unbridled licentiousness of the people was foaming
like a tempestuous sea, we cannot wonder that the minds of the good were
altogether or partially disabled. Hence was the zeal of Phinehas the more
distinguished, when he did not hesitate to provoke so many worthless and wicked
persons infuriated by their lechery. If any object that he transgressed the
limits of his calling, when he laid hold of the sword with which God had not
armed him, to inflict capital punishment, the reply is obvious, that our calling
is not always confined to its ordinary office, inasmuch as God sometimes
requires new and unusual acts of His servants. As a priest, it was not the
office of Phinehas to punish crime, but he was called by the special inspiration
of God, so that, in his private capacity, he had the Holy Spirit as his guide.
These circumstances, indeed, ought not to be regarded as an example, so that a
general rule may be laid down from them; though, at the same time, God preserves
His free right to appoint His servants by privilege to act in His behalf as He
shall see fit. God's judgment of this case may be certainly inferred from its
approval, so that we may correctly argue that Phinehas was under His own
guidance, since He immediately afterwards declared that He was pleased with the
act, as is also stated in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A630&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:30, 31.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if any private person should in
his preposterous zeal take upon himself to punish a similar crime, in vain will
he boast that he is an imitator of Phinehas, unless he shall be thoroughly
assured of the command of God. Let the answer of Christ, therefore, always be
borne in mind by us, whereby he restrained His disciples, when they desired,
like Elijah, to pray that those who had not received them should be destroyed by
fire from heaven, "Ye<i> </i>know not what manner of spirit ye are of."<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420954&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
9:54, 55.)<i> </i>In order, therefore, that our zeal may be approved by God, it
must be tempered by spiritual prudence, and directed by His authority; in a
word, the Holy Spirit must go before and dictate what is
right.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And those that died in the
plague.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul, when he says that only
twenty-three thousand died, appears to differ from Moses; but we know that the
exact account of numbers is not always observed, and it is probable that
<i>about </i>twenty-four thousand were slain. Paul, therefore, subtracted one
thousand, and was content with the lesser number; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f185</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from which, however, we may perceive how severe and terrible was the punishment,
teaching us to beware of provoking God by fornication. For, as it is a monstrous
thing that so great a multitude should have been infected by this foul and
shameful sin, so God's fearful judgment against adulterers and fornicators is
set before us. We have already seen that, although they were guilty of a wicked
rebellion, still the punishment is justly ascribed to their lust, which impelled
them to idolatry.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words God makes it
appear that He was the author of the death (of Zimri and Cozbi; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f186</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) not only because He was thus propitiated towards the people, but because He
calls the zeal of Phinehas His own. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f187</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It will, however, accord equally well whether we take it actively or passively,
viz., either that Phinehas was inflamed with zeal to vindicate God's glory, or
that he took upon him the zeal of God Himself. Whichever be preferred, God
refers to Himself what was done by Phinehas. When He declares that He was
appeased by the punishment inflicted, let us not imagine that there was a
meritorious satisfaction, whereby the Papists feign that their punishments are
redeemed before God. For although the just chastisements of sin are sacrifices
of sweet savor, they are by no means expiations to reconcile God. Besides, there
is no question here of compensation, but what is meant is, that it was a means
of appeasing God, when the ungodliness of the people which had, as it were,
fanned up His wrath into a flame, was repressed by this severe correction. Thus,
in Psalm 106, the atonement is ascribed not to the act of Phinehas, but only to
his prayer, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f188</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, in right of his priesthood, he had humbly interceded for the people. At
the same time, the statement of Paul is true, that those are not judged by God
who voluntarily judge themselves,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:31,) since, by their penitence, they in a manner prevent this
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A perpetual priesthood is promised to
Phinehas as his reward. If any object, that he thus obtained nothing new, since,
in accordance with the rule of the law, he was the undoubted successor of his
father, I reply, that it is not un-common that what God had already freely
promised, He declares that He will give by way of reward. Thus, what had been
promised to Abraham before the birth of Isaac, is again repeated after he was
prepared to sacrifice him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:16:) "Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,"
therefore, "in blessing I will bless thee, and in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed."<i> </i>Besides, the privilege of a single individual
is not simply in question here, but it refers to a perpetual succession, as if
God had promised that his posterity should never fail. And assuredly, the change
which took place at the commencement of Solomon's reign, is not repugnant to
this promise, for it may be probably inferred that Zadoc, no less than Abiathar,
was of the race of Phinehas. This covenant is called a "covenant of peace,"
because it was to be surely established; consequently, it may be properly
rendered, "My<i> </i>covenant in peace." At any rate, it indicates prosperity,
as if He had said that Phinehas, together with his posterity, should
prosperously execute the sacerdotal
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>

just is blessed, so also it was equitable that the author of this foul sin
should be condemned to perpetual infamy. It appears, however, from the fact of a
part of the disgrace being thrown upon the whole tribe, how greatly displeasing
to God was this gross enormity. For although the tribe of Simeon is not here
actually involved in the charge of participating in the sin, yet are they all
branded with the common mark of ignominy for their humiliation, in order that
each one of them may learn severely to correct whomsoever amongst his relatives
he may see offending, and by no means to encourage their vices, if he desires to
do credit to the founder of his race.

It is recorded that both Zimri and the Midianitish woman were of noble and
principal families, not only that we may be taught that God's judgment is no
respecter of persons

in that it does not spare rank, but also that the higher a person may be in
position, the greater is the disgrace he is exposed to if he conduct himself
dishonorably, since their very dignity renders men's actions more
conspicuous.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Because the paternal house of the
harlot is said to have been in Midian, some conjecture that she was born in the
land of Moab, or, at any rate, brought up there among her maternal relatives;
but, as the matter is unimportant, I leave it
undecided.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Vex the Midianites, and smite
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Inasnmch as God constantly forbids
His people to take vengeance, it is surprising that the people of Israel should
now be instigated to do so; as if they were not already more than enough
disposed to it. We must bear in mind, however, that since God, who is the just
avenger of all wickedness, often makes use of men's instrumentality, and
constitutes them the lawful ministers for the exercise of his vengeance, it must
not be altogether condemned without exception, but only such vengeance as men
themselves are impelled to by carnal passions. If any one is injured,
straightway he is carried away to the desire of vengeance by the stimulus of his
own private injury; and this is manifestly wrong: but if a person is led to
inflict punishment by a just and well-regulated zeal towards God, it is not his
own cause, but that of God which he undertakes. God did not, therefore, desire
to give reins to His people's anger, so as to repay the Midianites as they had
deserved in the violence of its impulse; but He armed them with His own sword
for their punishment; as if He had declared that there was a just cause for
their war, and that they need not fear the charge of cruelty, if they
exterminated such obnoxious enemies. For, although Balaam alone had imagined
this snare, still the guilt is laid upon the whole people. In the meantime, the
punishment of the Moabites is delayed, although they had apparently inflicted
the grosser injury. Because no good reason here appears why God should
mercifully bear with the one nation, whilst He hastens speedily to the
punishment of the others, let us learn to regard His judgments with reverence,
and not to presume to discuss them further than is lawful. Let it be sufficient
for us to know that war was justly declared against the Midianites, because it
was not their fault that Israel was not ruined by their iniquitous impiety.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass after the
plague.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the second <i>census
</i>which we read of having been made by Moses; nevertheless it is easy to
perceive, from Exodus 38, that it was at least the third; although it is more
probable that either yearly, or at stated times, those who had arrived at the
age of twenty gave in their names. Still the number of the people could not be
thus obtained, unless there were also a comparison of the deaths. This, at any
rate, is incontrovertible, that those who had grown up to manhood were three
times numbered in the desert, for we gather thus much from the passage before
us, since it is said in the fourth verse that this enrolment was made "as<i>
</i>the Lord had commanded Moses, and the children of Israel, which went forth
out of the land of Egypt;" from whence it is plain not only that they followed
as their rule the custom established from the beginning, but that the <i>census
</i>of the people was again taken, as it had been in the wilderness of Sinai.
From hence again a probable conjecture may be made, that, from the time in which
they came out from thence, nothing similar had taken place in the interval. For
Moses there records how many talents were collected from the tribute of the
people, and mentions their number, viz., 603,550 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f191</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and he adds afterwards, when they moved their camp from Mount Sinai, how the
<i>census </i>was taken according to God's command; but I pass over this subject
the more cursorily, as having been already spoken of elsewhere. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f192</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Now
let us see with what object God desired to have His people numbered before He
led them into the possession of the promised land. In less than forty years the
whole generation of an age for military service had perished: many had been
carried off by premature deaths; nay, a single scourge had lately destroyed
24,000; who would not have thought that the people must have been diminished by
a fourth? We must then account it a remarkable miracle, that their numbers
should be found as great as they were before. It was a memorable proof of God's
anger that only two of the 603,000 still survived; but that by continued
generation the people were so renewed, as that, at the conclusion of the period,
their posterity equalled their former number, was the work of God's inestimable
grace. Thus, in that awful judgment wherewith God punished His sinful people,
the truth of His promise still shone forth. It had been said to
Abraham,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I<i> </i>will multiply
thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the
sea-shore,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
22:17;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and it was by no means fitting that this blessing
should be obscured at the time, when the other part of the promise was about to
be fulfilled: "Unto thy seed will I give this land."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:7;) For, whilst the people had been instructed by punishments to fear God,
still they were not to lose the savor of His paternal favor. And thus does God
always temper His judgments towards His Church, so as in the midst of His
indignation to remember mercy, as Habakkuk says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:2.) This was the reason why the people was numbered immediately after the
plague, in order that it might be more conspicuous that God had marvellously
provided lest any diminution should appear after the recent loss of so many
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sons of Pallu;
Eliab.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The curtailment which had
occurred in the superior line is here introduced, either in exaltation of God's
grace, because, notwithstanding so great a loss, the tribe of Reuben was still
numerous; or else to mark the cause of its diminution, for it might otherwise
have seemed strange that other tribes exceeded in numbers that one whose founder
and parent was Jacob's first-born. But when he has narrated how the two sons of
Eliab had been destroyed with their company, he briefly adverts to the clemency
of God towards the sons of Korah, in that He spared them. And surely this was no
common exercise of mercy not only to preserve them uninjured from the calamity,
but afterwards to raise up shoots from the accursed root, in whom His spiritual
riches might shine forth for the general advantage of the Church: for we know
what honorable mention is often made of this family; and it is probable that
certain of them were the authors of some of the Psalms, and thus were endued
with the Spirit of prophecy, when possibly at that time none of the priests was
possessed of this gift. This is that profound abyss in the various and unequal
judgments of God, which it becomes us to adore with sober humility. Meanwhile,
in a single word, Moses hints at the reason why he repeats this same history,
whereby the formidable mode of their death might be held up as a perpetual
example: for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nes, </i>which is primarily a standard 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f193</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or banner, is often used for some portentous thing, which strikes men's senses
with astonishment, and at the same time fills their minds with
fear.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sons of Judah were Er and
Onan.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the tribe of Judah was so
numerous, Moses magnifies the greatness of God's grace by this circumstance,
that of the three sons which he begat, two perished in the land of Canaan, by
whose loss he might have appeared to be condemned to perpetual sterility. But
the climax of God's unparalleled mercy was this, that although two of his
children were born of an incestuous connection, they grew up into so great a
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sons of Joseph after their
families.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The comparison of the two
tribes, which sprang from the same head, is worthy of notice. By the fact that
Manasseh was the father of only one son, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f194</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the prophecy of Jacob, when he declared that the first-born should be inferior
to his younger brother Ephraim, began already to receive its accomplishment.
Nevertheless, God's blessing extended far and wide for the increase of his
family, so that they exceeded<i> </i>the tribe of Reuben in number. But further,
though the larger number of children
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polutekni&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>in which the descendants of Ephraim were superior, was a kind of type of his
promised fecundity, still the excellency and dignity, of which Jacob prophesied,
was deferred to a distant period; since in this respect the tribe of Ephraim was
inferior by about a third, whereas a more numerous issue had been promised him.
Although, therefore, God had not spoken in vain, yet the fulfillment of His
promise did not immediately appear.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the tribe
of Dan, however, the incredible power of God was put forth. He was contemptible
among his brethren; and thence it was an extraordinary blessing accorded to him
in the shape of an honorable degree and name, when Jacob declares that "Dan<i>
</i>shall judge his people."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:16.) He is said to have begotten only one son; yet his posterity exceeds
64,000.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>51.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the numbered of the
children of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this sum total,
what I have above adverted to is more clearly shewn, that amidst so many losses,
and especially after the terrible vengeance which God had recently executed, the
race of Abraham was preserved in an incredible<i> </i>manner, so that the
fulfillment of the promise might not be brought about only towards a small body
of persons. Nature itself and reason would have suggested that a few only should
enjoy the promised land; but if the inheritance had been restricted to a small
number of men, God's promise would have lain, as it were, in obscurity and
concealment. Yet within thirty-eight years, during which more than 603,000 men
had fallen, God marvellously brought it to pass that the same number of persons
should still remain, some 2500 only excepted. Assuredly they must be blind four
times over, as it were, who do not behold in this bright mirror God's wonderful
providence, and the faithfulness of His gratuitous adoption, and His
steadfastness in keeping His promises. At the same time, that which I have
already referred to in Deuteronomy clearly appears, that those who survived,
were strikingly admonished by this great loss, that they should not fall away at
any time into superstition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>53.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto these the land shall be
divided.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This must have had great
influence towards encouraging believers, when they gave in their names before
God, and professed that they were heirs of the land; since it was exactly the
same as if they actually had it in their grasp, when God called them to its
certain possession; for the demonstrative pronoun is used emphatically, lest
they should suppose that they were to be put off any longer, and that what was
promised them was still to be kept in store for their posterity. The actual
fulfillment, therefore, and immediate presence of the thing is indicated, when
God prescribes that the land was to be divided to those who were just numbered,
and whose names appeared in the public registers. A proportionable mode of
division is then enjoined, so that their share should be distributed to every
tribe according to the number of their names. We now perceive that they were
registered, and, so to speak, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>lustrated, </i>in order that they might more earnestly bestir themselves to
take possession of the promised
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>57.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are they that were
numbered of the Levites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He treats
separately of the tribe of Levi, which God had dissevered from the rest of the
people; and of the sons of Levi, the last mentioned is Kohath, the founder of
the sacerdotal family. Hence we may probably conjecture that the law of
primogeniture was not regarded when God deigned to take the priests from thence.
But why Moses should expressly state the name of his mother, contrary to the
usual custom of Scripture, does not dearly appear; for it is not likely that he
did this as a distinction to his own family, because he at the same time shews
how he himself, as well as his children, was deprived of the honor (of the
priesthood,) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in which certainly there is no appearance of ambition. It is more probable, if
the word <i>daughter </i>is literally taken, that he did not conceal a
disgraceful circumstance, in order to extol more highly the indulgence of God;
for, in this case, Moses and Aaron sprang of an incestuous marriage, since
Amram, their father, must have married his aunt, which natural modesty forbade.
It will, then, be rather an ingenuous confession of family dishonor, than an
ambitious boast. If we inquire how this could have been tolerated, the answer
will readily suggest itself, that this license had so largely prevailed among
the oriental nations, that no one deemed that to be illicit which was in such
universal use. And this we shall presently see 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f197</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be expressly referred to, when God, by forbidding incestuous marriages,
distinguishes His people from other nations. It will be no matter of surprise,
then, that those who were not yet prohibited from doing so by the law of God,
had followed the general custom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>60.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And unto Aaron was born
Nadab.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since two of Aaron's four sons
were cut off by a sudden death, the dignity of the high-priesthood, which
depended on the life of two persons, appeared to be endangered. And with this
view Moses repeats the history already given, in order that God's wonderful
providence might be more clearly perceived in the preservation of this order,
with which the safety of the whole Church was connected. Unquestionably, unless
other families had been much more prolific, the whole tribe of Levi would have
consisted of very few persons; yet, if we come to compare them, their fecundity
will be incredible, inasmuch as 23,000 are numbered, whereas the sacerdotal race
issued from only two heads. But God exalts His Church to pre-eminence by ways
and means unknown to men, in order that His power may be magnified in this
weakness. Moreover, the cause of their death is again recorded, that the
priests, being admonished by this warning, may not only more diligently beware
of wilful sacrilege, but also of error and
negligence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>63.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are they that were
numbered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The former registration was
made by Aaron. The difference between the two <i>census </i>is therefore
specified, in order that Moses may take occasion to commemorate God's judgment,
which can never be sufficiently considered, that of 600,000, only two were found
who had survived to the term prescribed by God. If any should object that the
greater part would have died naturally, since they had arrived at their
thirtieth: fortieth, and even fiftieth year, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f198</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and thus would have been some eighty years old before the completion of the
forty years, I admit that such is the case; but many had not yet reached their
twenty-fourth year. Nor can we doubt but that not a few of them were younger
than Caleb and Joshua, whom we know to have been not only alive and well, but
even strong and vigorous for many years afterwards. At any rate, therefore, not
old age, but God's vengeance, cut off half of them by an untimely death, as if
he had openly put forth his hand from heaven and smitten them. It is not without
reason, then, that Moses states that they were dead, as God had pronounced; not
merely that by the punishment inflicted upon them he may inculcate upon us the
fear of God, but also that we may learn to be aroused in earnest by his
threats.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then came the daughters of
Zelophehad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A narrative is here
introduced respecting the daughters of Zelophehad, of the family of Machir, who
demanded to be admitted to a share of its inheritance; and the decision of this
question might have been difficult, unless all doubt had been removed by the
sentence of God Himself. For, since in the law no name is given to women, it
would seem that no account of them was to be taken in the division of the land.
And, in fact, God laid down this as the general rule; but a special exception is
here made, <i>i.e., </i>that whenever a family shall be destitute of male heirs,
females should succeed, for the preservation of the name. I am aware that this
is a point which is open to dispute, since there are obvious arguments both for
and against it, but let the decree that God pronounced suffice for
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although (the daughters of Zelophehad) plead
before Moses for their own private advantage, still the discussion arose from a
good principle; inasmuch as they would not have been so anxious about the
succession, if God's promise had not been just as much a matter of certainty to
them as if they were at this moment demanding to be put in possession of it.
They had not yet entered the land, nor were their enemies conquered; yet,
relying on the testimony of Moses, they prosecute their suit as if the tranquil
possession of their rights were to be accorded them that very day. And this must
have had the effect of confirming the expectations of the whole people, when
Moses consulted God as respecting a matter of importance, and pronounced by
revelation that which was just and right; for the discussion, being openly moved
before them all, must have given them encouragement, at least to imitate these
women.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our father died in the
wilderness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The plea they allege is no
contemptible one, <i>i.e., </i>that their father died after God had called His
people to the immediate possession of the promised land; for, if the question
had been carried back to an earlier period, it might have originated many
quarrels. This restriction with respect to time, therefore, aided their cause.
In the second place, they plead that their father had committed no crime whereby
he might have been excepted from the general allotment of the land; for in the
conspiracy of Dathan and Abiram, they include by <i>synecdoche, </i>in my
opinion, the other sins, whose punishment affected the posterity of the
criminals. His private sin is, therefore, contrasted with public ignominy; for
so I interpret what they say of his having "died in his own sin." And surely it
is mere childish nonsense which the Jews 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f199</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
affirm of his having been the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath-day, or one
of the number of those who were slain by the bite of the serpents; and it is
unnatural, too, to refer it to the curse under which the whole human race is
laid. They distinguish, then, his private sin from any public crime, which would
have caused him to deserve to be disinherited, lest the condition of their
father should be worse than that of any other person. At the same time, they
hold fast to the principle which is dictated to us by the common feelings of
religion, that death, as being the curse of God, is the wages of
sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses brought their cause
before the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable either
that there was a difference of opinion, or that the minds of the judges were in
doubt, as respecting an obscure and uncertain point. At any rate, it was
expedient that the law should be laid down by God, lest any future controversy
should arise; for, if a sentence had been pronounced by human judgment on the
matter before them, the obstinacy of many would not perhaps have been
sufficiently set at rest. It is worth while to remark the pious modesty of
Moses, who was not ashamed to confess his ignorance, until he had been
instructed by the mouth of God. Although he had promulgated the law forty years
before, still he was always ready to learn. Besides, there is no doubt but that
God impelled him to inquire of Himself, whenever any serious matters were in
question, until his doctrine was absolutely perfect. And, although God does not
now deliver from heaven what is to be done, nevertheless rulers are reminded
that they ought to have recourse to God in points of perplexity, in order that
He may instruct them by the Spirit of wisdom; and assuredly they will not be
without this, if they ask Him; since he is no less ready to listen to them, than
He here shewed Himself to be to
Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>

the occasion of the delivery of a law, which was to be a perpetual and general
rule as to the right of inheritance. But, although God prefers the daughters to
all other relatives, when there is no male issue, still, with this single
exception of the first degree, He admits none but males to the succession, and
thus preserves the usual order. And surely it would be very unjust to exclude a
man's (natural) heirs on account of their sex; but when it became necessary to
pass from his own children to other kindred, the prerogative of the male line
began to be established. I speak of the land of Canaan, in which not only the
name of Abraham but also that of the twelve tribes was to be preserved, in order
that the memory (of God's blessing)

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the chief fathers of the
families.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It might appear strange that
God had given an imperfect law with reference to succession, as if what will be
now stated had not occurred to His mind until Moses was reminded by the chief
men of the families (of Machir,) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f201</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that it was unjust that the inheritances should be alienated, which would have
been the case if the daughters of Zelophehad had married into other tribes,
whereas their portion had fallen in the lot of the tribe of Manasseh. For
whatever fell into the hands of those of another tribe, was a diminution of that
lot. As, therefore, God had lately made provision for preserving the rights of
individuals, He now treats of the general advantage or loss. What, then, can be
the meaning of the objection, that God only half considered what was right? In
my opinion, He so arranged His replies, that only when inquired of He assigned
to each one his rights. The daughters of Zelophehad come, and demand justice of
Moses and the elders, and God complies with their prayers. Now the heads of the
tribe come, and agitate the question respecting the loss they would incur by the
alienation of the inheritances; and it is then provided that other tribes should
not be enriched by their loss. In short, whereas God might have spontaneously
anticipated this, He preferred to grant it at the request of those who asked
nothing but what was just and equitable. For it cannot be said that in this case
it happened, as it often does, that, whilst every one pertinaciously maintains
his own cause, and is eager to advance his own interests, one question arises
out of another; for, when God has taken cognizance of the case, He pronounces
that both parties only demanded what was right. It follows, therefore, that God
designedly withheld His decisions until they naturally arose out of the
circumstances of the case. It is a common saying that the law makes no provision
for those things which rarely occur. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f202</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus it would have been commonly supposed that this law was superfluous; and
especially it would have detracted somewhat from the authority of his teaching,
if Moses had treated of this trifling matter, had not circumstances led to it.
In fine, God allowed Himself to be interrogated familiarly with respect to
doubtful points of no primary importance, in order that posterity might
recognize His reply as a proof of His fatherly indulgence. Meanwhile, let us
bear in mind that if heavenly things are the subject of as much anxiety to us,
as earthly things were to the children of Manasseh, the rule that we should
observe will always be made clear to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they said, The Lord
commanded my lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They here allege a
kind of discrepancy, in that the tribes had had the land allotted to them
agreeably to God's command, but now their lots would be thrown into confusion,
when the inheritance should pass over to another tribe. They assume it, however,
to be an acknowledged impossibility, that God should be inconsistent with
Himself: hence it was necessary that an interpretation should be delivered in
order to remove the legal contradiction
<i>(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajntinomi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
</i>The Law of God, say they, which ought to remain inviolable, enjoins that the
land should be distxibuted by lot; how, then, will it accord that women should
carry elsewhere the inheritance of their own tribe? Thus, in seeking a remedy
for this evil, they submit themselves to God's governance, and reverently accept
what He had prescribed. And further, they enlarge upon the absurdity which would
arisen from hence; viz., that in the fiftieth year, when they were to return to
their original lots, so much would be withdrawn from the portion of the tribe of
Manasseh as the daughters of Zelophehad had taken away with them. Reasonably,
therefore, do they demand that a decree should be given to reconcile the two
former laws, which otherwise appeared to be at variance with each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses commanded the
children of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The account here
given is not identical with the previous one, that Moses referred the matter to
God; yet the same thing is more briefly stated, viz., that Moses answered the
people out of the mouth of God, from whence we infer that God was consulted by
him. Moreover, God not only decides in favor of the children of Manasseh, but
approves of their appeal, in that they were contented with their allotment, and
claim for themselves what could not be alienated without the violation of the
Divine decree. From this particular occasion, a general law is laid down, that
no woman to whom an inheritance had fallen, was to marry out of her tribe,
because she would defraud her own relatives of her marriage portion. In this
way, however, a free permission to marry was accorded to females, provided they
renounced their paternal inheritance. The words, indeed, seem to be of wider
application, <i>i e., </i>that no man should marry a wife, except of his own
kindred; but the meaning of the law is to be sought from the cause which led to
its enactment. Moreover, there is no doubt but that promiscuous marriages are
here forbidden, in so far as they confound the order of hereditary
rights.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Amongst the other prerogatives which God
conferred upon His Church, this one is celebrated, that He armed the godly "to
execute vengeance upon the heathen, &#8212; to execute upon them the judgment
that is written,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
149:7-9) and although the Spirit declares that this should happen under the
kingdom of Christ, still He refers to ancient examples, one of which, well
worthy of remembrance, is here recorded. The Midianites had organized a wicked
conspiracy for the destruction of God's people: and God, in undertaking to
punish this cruel act of theirs, gave a striking proof of His paternal favor
towards the Israelites; whilst this grace is doubled by His constituting them
the ministers of his judgment. This passage, therefore, shews us how anxious God
was for the welfare of His elect people, when He so set Himself against their
enemies, as if He would make common cause in all respects with them. At the same
time we must observe this additional favor towards them, that although the
Israelites themselves were not without blame, He still deigned to appoint them
as judges of the Midianites. Inasmuch, however, as He everywhere prohibits His
people from indulging the lust of vengeance, we must not forget the distinction
between men's vengeance and His own. He would have His servants, by patiently
bearing injuries, overcome evil with good; while, at the same time, He by no
means abdicates His own power, but still reserves to Himself the right of
inflicting punishment. Nay, Paul, desiring to exhort believers to
long-suffering, recalls them to the principle, that God takes upon Himself the
office of avenging. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f203</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Since, then, God is at liberty to execute vengeance, not only by Himself, but
also by His ministers, as we have already seen, these two things are not
inconsistent with each other, that the passions of the godly are laid under
restraint by the Word, that they should not, when injured, seek for vengeance,
or retaliate the evils they have received, and still that they are the just and
legitimate executioners of God's vengeance, when the sword is put into their
hands. It remains, that whosoever is called to this office, should punish crime
with honest zeal, as the minister of God, and not as acting in his own private
cause. God here intrusted the office of vengeance upon His people, but by no
means in order that they might indulge the lust of their nature: for their
feeling ought to have been this, that they should have been ready to pardon the
Midianites, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f204</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and still that they should heartily bestir themselves to inflict punishment upon
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That, whilst God so severely judged the
Midianites, he spared the Moabites, was for the sake of Lot, who was the founder
of their race. But I have already frequently reminded my readers that, when
God's judgments surpass our understanding, we should, in sober humility, give
glory to His secret, and to us incomprehensible, wisdom: for those who, in this
respect, seek to know more than is fitting, elevate themselves too high, in
order to plunge with head-long audacity into a profound abyss, in which, at
length, all their senses must be overwhelmed. Why was He not at liberty to remit
the punishment of the Moabites, and at the same time to repay to the Midianites
the recompense which was their due? Besides, it was only for a time that he
pardoned the Moabites, until their obstinacy should render them inexcusable,
after they had not only abused his forbearance, but tyrannically afflicted their
brethren, by whom they had been treated with
kindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, God desired, whilst Moses
was still alive, again to testify by this final act His love towards His people,
in order that they might more cheerfully advance to the possession of the
promised land: for this was no feeble encouragement, when they saw that God
spontaneously put Himself forward to avenge them. At the same time it was
expedient for Moses that, at the very moment of his death, he should feel, by a
fresh instance, what care God took for the welfare of the people. For he was
able joyfully to leave them in God's keeping, whose hand he had so recently seen
put forth to fulfill to the utmost His gracious purposes towards them. To the
same effect were the words, "Thou<i> </i>shalt be gathered unto thy people,"
which were undoubtedly spoken as a consolation in death. It was also a reason
for making haste; for if the dearth of the holy Prophet had been waited for,
perhaps the Israelites would not have dared to attack, with arms in their hands,
a peaceful nation, from whom there was no peril or inconvenience impending. But
so great was the authority of Moses over them, that they were more ready to obey
his bidding than that of any other
person.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although it is said indifferently of the
reprobate as well as believers, that they are gathered or congregated to their
fathers by death, still this expression shews that men are born for immortality;
for it would not be appropriate to say this of the brute animals, whose death is
their final destruction, inasmuch as they are without the hope of another
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses spake unto the
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no doubt but that Moses
delivered the commands which he had received from God; although, therefore, it
is stated 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f205</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that only ten thousand went forth to the war, yet the facts themselves
demonstrate that the number, as well as the mode of warfare, was prescribed by
God. And assuredly it would have been inconsiderate of Moses to attack so great
a people with so small a band; and thus he would have deservedly incurred the
penalty of his rashness, if he had attempted it of his own accord; still, when
God's command had preceded, he happily concluded the matter, which had been
properly and rightly undertaken. Nor can it be questioned but that God desired
by this test to prove the faith of His people. For, according to human
apprehension, it was folly to endanger themselves without cause; and the
objection was obvious that it was by no means advisable, when six hundred
thousand men were at hand, to restrict to so few the office of waging such a
perilous war. Just, therefore, as God afterwards destroyed the great army of the
Midianites by only four hundred men under the guidance of Gideon, so also under
the hand of Moses He sent forth only a single thousand from every tribe for the
destruction of that nation. The tribe of Zebulon alone could have furnished five
times as many soldiers as God took from the whole people. Thus, then, they
proved their faith, when in reliance on the aid of God alone, they did not
hesitate boldly to rush forward against their enemies. And the event itself more
fully illustrated God's grace than as if they had fought with all their forces,
for then it would have been believed that the Midianites were overwhelmed by the
infinite multitude of men. As, therefore, the people testified their obedience
by prompt compliance, so they experienced in the result that there is nothing
better than to submit ourselves to God, and to leave the prospect of success so
completely in His hand, as that our confidence may depend solely upon
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Lest either of the tribes should boast
itself against the others, they were each of them commanded to give the same
number of soldiers. Moreover, Phinehas was sent with them, not so much that he
might engage personally with the enemy, or be their General, as that he might
rule and control their minds as God's messenger and interpreter. They were to be
kept in the fear of God, and to be elevated to the expectation of victory, and
therefore God's priest was their leader, so that the war might be a holy one;
and the same was the object of the silver trumpets, with which, in obedience to
the Lw, as we have elsewhere seen, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f206</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the Levites were accustomed to sound, that it might be manifest that their
battles were not fought without the will and authority of heaven. Amongst "the
holy instruments," some commentators, in my opinion rightly, include the Ark of
the Covenant.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they warred against the
Midianites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was a signal example of
obedience, that 12,000 men did not refuse to engage in a war which was full of
danger, when it was reasonable for them to object that it was not right for them
to be exposed to butchery, as it were, whilst the people sat idly in the camp,
who by their great numbers and with little trouble would have routed and
overcome the enemy. It was therefore no common proof of piety, that they obeyed
God's command, and sought for no pretext to cover their cowardice. God, too,
shewed by the result that He did not rashly expose His servants to danger; for
it is in His power to rescue those whom He takes under His protection, from a
hundred deaths. From hence also we are taught that there is no surer means of
safety than to follow whither He leads. What Moses afterwards adds, tends to
render praise to their perseverance, with one exception, they were right in
killing all the males, even to the kings, whom Moses relates to have been slain
in the general slaughter; and especially that they inflicted punishment on
Balaam, who by his cunning and his snares, had endeavored to destroy the people
of God. They were right, too, in spoiling the whole land; nor did they act with
less propriety and discretion in razing all the cities and towns, which might
have been a temptation to the timid and inactive to take up their abode there;
for, as we have seen before, all hindrances were to be taken away, so that the
people might advance freely and without incumbrance into the land of Canaan;
else, when there was an opportunity of repose, many would have willingly
foregone the promised inheritance. Hence the cities were consumed by fire, lest
they should afford any hold for those who were willing to stay. Thus far the
selected soldiers faithfully performed their duty: in one respect they failed,
in that, under the impulse either of avarice or lust, they preserved the women
alive: on which point we shall see more
presently.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they took all the
spoil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was a sign both of their
disinterestedness and modesty, that they brought the booty, which they had taken
in the ardor of battle, to Moses and Eleazar; nor was it a mere empty and
pompous ceremony, as many boastingly parade the wealth which they desire to keep
to themselves; but their intention was, to acquiesce in the determination of
Moses as to its distribution. For, when Moses soon afterwards allots half of it
to the people, they are so far from rebelling against his decision, that they do
not even murmur. It is clear, then, that in this respect they were no less
submissive than they had been when, at the outset, they took up arms, and boldly
went forth to battle, whilst the rest were quietly reposing out of the reach of
the darts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses was wroth with the
officers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A successful issue usually
obtains pardon for any errors in performance, nay, in a manner covers them, so
that they are not taken into account; but, although the army brought with it
many causes of congratulation, still Moses does not forbear from severely
reproving their single fault. By this example we are taught that, whilst we give
praise to virtuous actions, we are not to approve of anything which deserves
reprehension. The anger of Moses might appear to us inhumane, when he severely
reproves his soldiers because they had not treated the female sex with the
greatest cruelty; but it is not our business to canvass the judgments of God,
before whose tribunal we must all hereafter stand. Although, therefore, they may
be repugnant to our own feelings, still we must rest assured that, even where
they may seem to be excessive, He nevertheless tempers the most severe
punishments with the most perfect equity; yea, that although He may for a time
overlook, or at any rate not so severely punish, the same sin in the Moabites
which He sorely avenged upon the Midiantes, there is still a most just cause for
this distinction, although it may be hidden in His own breast. It is not our
part to murmur against Him, lest He should absolve Himself by condemning our
blasphemous audacity and temerity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
Israelites sinned, in that, when they were only the ministers of God's
vengeance, it rested not in their own discretion to relax any part of it. And
this is worthy of observation, that those who are armed with the sword, must not
go out of the way on either side one tittle, but faithfully execute whatever God
prescribes. By the praise which: is given to the anger of Moses, the imagination
of the Stoics is refuted, with whom indifference 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpa&gt;qeia</font><font face="Palatino">)
is the highest of virtues. But rather are we to labor that all our affections
should proceed from a good motive, and that they should be kept under such
restraint, that they may contain no ebullition of carnal passion, but that
spiritual zeal may preside in them. Moses, however, gives the reason why the
women were no more to be spared than the men, viz., because they had prostituted
themselves in order to lay deadly snares for the Israelites. As regards the
little ones, the same reasoa did not affect them, inasmuch as they were guilty
of no crime; yet is it not doubtful but that God justly desired that the very
name of this wicked and irrecoverable nation should be utterly blotted out; just
as He afterwards gave over to destruction the nations of Canaan, together with
their offspring. The question, however, arises by what means the women, who "had
not known a man," were to be distinguished from virgins. The Jews, according to
their custom, invent a fable 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f208</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in reply, whereas it is probable that the decision was only come to on the
ground of their age.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And do ye abide without the camp
seven days.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We<i> </i>have elsewhere
seen, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f209</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that, if any one had touched a dead body, he was accounted unclean. Moses, by
now extending the ceremony of expiation to lawful homicide, intimates how
carefully we ought to abstain from shedding human blood. It was required of the
Israelites that they should strenuously advance through the midst of carnage;
but, inasmuch as it is in a manner contrary to the order of nature that men
should be killed by men, as if they were raging against their own bowels, God
would have some vestiges of humanity preserved even in just punishments, so as
to put a restraint upon all cruelty in the abstract. Nor is it without cause
that Scripture, even in commending heroic bravery, uses this form of expression,
that "they<i> </i>have polluted their hands with blood," who have slain any of
their enemies, <i>i.e., </i>in order that we may abhor all acts of homicide, as
being repugnant to the preservation of the human race. Although, therefore, the
Israelites had slain the Midianites not only justly, but by God's command,
still, lest they should accustom themselves to the indiscriminate shedding of
blood, they are commanded to purify themselves on the third and the seventh day,
before they returned to the camp, so that their pollution should not infect the
people. The reason for purifying the booty was different, viz., because the
uncleanness of their vessels indicated how detestable was this people, whose
very utensils, until they were purified either by fire or water, defiled every
one by the mere touch. Lest, however, the soldiers should refuse to obey, or
should comply unwillingly, Eleazar reminds them that nothing more was required
of them than the observance of an old injunction. Nor is it to be doubted but
that Moses designedly resigned the office of teaching to his nephew, because the
interpretation of the law was hereafter to be sought from the mouth of the
priest</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A most equitable distribution of
the booty is here described, in which the law of proportion was so well observed
that, whilst the soldiers were not defrauded of the reward of their labor, at
the same time some advantage accrued to the rest of the people in whose name the
war was carried on. The share of the multitude was indeed small, for the same
proportion was awarded to the 12,000 as to the remaining 600,000. But, since the
booty had been already won by the soldiers in right of their victory, it ought
not to have been a cause of complaint to the people who had not borne arms, that
they received an honorary gift, although it might be of little value. And
assuredly it would have been a shame that those who remained in the camp should
be altogether without any part of the spoil, as if they had been convicted of
cowardice, whereas it did not depend on themselves that they had not taken part
with their brethren in the conquest of the enemy. For it was from no want of
courage that they had escaped the burden and the perils of war, but they had
modestly allowed the general glory to be appropriated by a few, because it had
so pleased God. But, whilst it was just that some of the fruits of the victory
should be communicated to all, so it. was no less right that the fuller and more
liberal reward should be received by those who had borne the whole brunt of the
war.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It appears to some that David pursued the
same rule, when he distributed the spoil equally amongst his followers who had
gone down to the battle, and those who had stood by the baggage.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;093024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 30:24.) In my opinion, however, what David then decided was very
different; for if the portion of those who remained with the baggage had been
equal with that of those who were actually engaged, it would have been far more
advantageous to remain out of the reach of the weapons. For, when a battle is
fought, only a few men out of a large army are generally left with the baggage,
and thus half the booty would have accrued to a few idlers. The partition,
therefore, which is there mentioned, must have been an equal distribution to
each individual; and very justly did David enjoin that those who remained
stationed in the camp should have a full share of the spoil, lest 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f210</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the condition of those should be dissimilar who were under the operation of the
same rule. But in this case the actual warriors are justly rewarded above those
who quietly attended to their own domestic
cares.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And levy a tribute unto the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God now requires a tribute, or
holy oblation, out of the spoil from both parties, but in unequal portions, the
people paying ten times more than the soldiers. There was a twofold reason and
object for this tribute; for it was not fair that the Levites alone should be
sent away empty, as if their condition were worse than that of the rest, because
they were occupied in the service of God, and in taking care of the holy things.
But the part which He assigns to them, God commands to be offered to Himself,
that men may not only regard equity amongst each other, but that religion may
stand in the foremost place; for nothing can be more unreasonable than that the
rights of men should be maintained inviolate, whilst God himself is overlooked.
In order, then, to testify their piety, the offering was enjoined, as if God
claimed for Himself the glory of the victory in taking this fiftieth and
five-hundredth portion. But, inasmuch as He has no want of anything, having full
satisfaction in Himself alone, the Levites are substituted in His stead, that
they may receive some reward for their
ministry.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, we perceive that God dealt more
liberally with the soldiers than with the rest of the multitude; nor is this a
matter of surprise, for, since He had laid a greater burden upon them, it was
just that they should be enriched by more fruits of the victory, for He heaps
blessings upon blessings according to His
pleasure.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this distribution we also gather
that it depends upon His ordinance that some should be richer than others; for,
if there were no such thing as property, there would be no test of justice and
integrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord's tribute of the
sheep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The greatness of the victory is
shewn by the result, since such an abundance of cattle could only have been
collected from a wide and populous country. It is probable that it was not very
fertile, and consequently only live stock, and not corn and wine, are enumerated
as amongst their wealth. Still, we may conjecture that it was famous for
pastures, since barren mountains could not have fed so many oxen, and goats, and
sheep, and camels; besides, it is most evident, from the number of young women,
that the men who were slain were more in number than their conquerors who had
been sent to the battle; for suppose they each of them had an unmarried
daughter, they would have almost three times outnumbered the 12,000 Israelites.
Hence, again, it is manifest that the victory was effected by Divine power. It
may, however, seem strange that, although the nation was almost destroyed,
nevertheless their posterity existed some little time afterwards, as if new
Midianites had been begotten from the ashes of their sires. For it was not a
very long time that elapsed between this slaughter and the time of Gideon, when
they again dared voluntarily to attack the Israelites, and in reliance on their
multitude, to rush into the very heart of Canaan; nay, they had already brought
all the neighboring nations into subjection. How this could have happened, since
the Scriptures do not inform us, it only remains for us to make the conjecture,
that many of them, as is often the case in a season of confusion, fled
elsewhere, and soon afterwards returned into the land, which was now unoccupied.
For the sudden irruption of the Israelites was like a storm which soon passed
away; nor was flight a difficult thing for this unsettled and wandering nation.
It might also have been the case, that many immigrants from various quarters
flowed into the land, when stripped of its inhabitants; or even that the
Israelites, having performed their work but slackly, sounded the recall sooner
than they ought, and that God afterwards punished their remissness. At any rate,
we are taught by this example that the wicked sprout up like foul and noxious
weeds, so that, though often cut down, they soon cover the ground
again.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>48.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the officers which were over
the thousands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have here an example
of signal gratitude, that the leaders of the army, when they saw that none of
their men were lost, consecrated their spoils of gold and silver to the Lord. By
the offering of the first-fruits, they had already sufficiently testified their
piety and obedience; nor, indeed, after they had faithfully complied with God's
command, could anything more have been expected from them; hence does their
liberality deserve so much the more praise, when they lay themselves under the
obligation of a new and extraordinary vow. At the same time, Moses magnifies
God's special blessing in bringing them all back safely to a man from this great
battle. Surely, since their spoils must have been driven from many villages, it
was strange that some few of them at least had not been slain in their very
passage from one place to another. Hence, therefore, it was more than ever
manifest that the war was thus successfully concluded under the guidance of God,
who had protected the 12,000 men. Hence the incredible goodness of God towards
his people is here celebrated, as well as the pious profession of the officers,
when it is expressly stated that, having mustered their forces, they had found
them all safe, so that there could be no doubt nor question about the grace of
God. In acknowledgment, therefore, of His wondrous power in the preservation of
the soldiers, they offer as the price of their redemption whatever gold and
silver they had taken among the spoils. Moses records the sum, so that it may
more clearly appear that, in the performance of this act of homage, it was no
trifling amount of gain that they despised, for its amount is more than 10,500
<i>livres </i>of French money. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f211</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">But
what becomes of the soldiers? whilst these vows are being paid for their safety,
they quietly enjoy their plunder: for there is an implied comparison here, when
Moses, after having praised the centurions and tribunes, presently adds the
exception,<i> </i>that "the spoil which each man had taken was his own." It is,
indeed, amazing that the soldiers, as if they had conquered by themselves, and
for themselves alone, should have been so ill-conditioned<i> </i>and mean, as
not to imitate this laudable example. And, in truth, it often happens, that the
multitude indulges its meanness without shame, as well because it is ignorant of
what true nobility is, as because the crowd conceals the disgrace. Meanwhile,
those in office are reminded to take care, that the higher the dignity may be to
which they are called, the more eminent should their virtues
be.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>51.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Eleazar the priest
took the gold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was fitting that this
should be added, lest any should suppose that Eleazar made a profit by the
liberality of others. Moses, therefore, relates, that whatever gold was offered,
was faithfully laid up as an ornament for the sanctuary. When it is said,
"for<i> </i>a memorial for the children of Israel," it may be taken either
actively or passively; viz., either that the gift may be a monument of their
gratitude, or that it might conciliate favor for the people in the eyes of God;
as if that offering of expiation brought before God, and represented, all those
who thus professed themselves to be preserved by His grace. I prefer the latter
sense myself, <i>i.e., </i>that this memorial was set before His eyes, in order
that God might hereafter also be favorable to His people.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the children of Reuben
and the children of Gad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this
narrative we behold, as in a glass, that whilst each individual is but too
attentive to his own private interests, he forgets what is just and right.
Those, indeed, who seek their own advantage, do not reflect that they are doing
injury to others; but it is impossible for them to avoid seeking more than is
their due, and preferring themselves to others; and thus they sin against that
rule of charity, that we should not seek our own. The sons of Gad and Reuben,
who had a great quantity of cattle, see a tract of rich and fertile land;
self-interest takes possession of them, so that it does not occur to them that
they were under an obligation to their brethren not to covet for themselves
anything peculiar, or separate from them. Nevertheless, there was a specious
pretext for this, whereby their eyes were blinded, viz., that nothing was taken
away from the others, but rather that so much addition was made; for by these
means the whole country on the other side of Jordan continued to be theirs; and,
besides, they were rather relieved of an inconvenience than exposed to a loss;
since the progress of their expedition would be less difficult, if the body of
persons, who were charged with the cattle, should stay there, and thus should
cease to be an incumbrance to the army, which would be in lighter condition for
advancing. Their association, however, for the war had been established by God,
and bound them by an indissoluble tie not to desert the rest of the people:
whilst it was also a solemn duty <i>(religio) </i>imposed upon them not to alter
the bounds of the inheritance promised by God. The land of Canaan was assigned
to the whole race of Abraham, in which they were to be enclosed, and to inhabit
it as a peculiar world, the tribes of Gad and Reuben now transgress those
limits, and, at the same time disunite themselves from the body of the Church,
as if they desired to be emancipated from God. Hence ought we to be the more on
our guard, lest we should go astray after our own lusts. And when Moses says,
that they <i>saw, </i>or considered, the land, let us learn to beware lest our
eyes, by unlawful looks, should lead us into snares, and blind our minds; and
thus that our senses should be so deceived by the envenomed sweetness, as that
reason and equity should be utterly
overthrown.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew word, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f212</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which we have rendered <i>peculium, </i>signifies not only cattle and herds, but
also flocks of sheep. Almost all the Israelites were indeed possessors of
cattle; but we gather from the words of Moses, that these two tribes were
especially rich in them; perhaps, because the district which they inhabited in
Egypt, being more suited for pasture, had invited them to apply themselves more
earnestly to that mode of life, which was common to all, and had been handed
down to them by their fathers; for it is not probable that they had thus
surpassed the rest in this respect, during the course of their
march.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The children of Gad and the
children of Reuben came.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Their request
was apparently a reasonable one, that, since God had driven out the inhabitants
of the land, and its fertility invited them to dwell there, the possession of
these empty and deserted fields should not be denied them. Their modesty also
was praiseworthy, in that they neither detach themselves from the people, nor
seditiously and violently seize upon the places which were so suitable for them;
but seek to obtain them by the permission of Moses and the elders, as if they
submitted their cause to their decision. But as I have just said, their private
interest had so laid hold of their minds, that the main point did not occur to
them, viz., that the land of Canaan was set before them all, in order that they
might dwell together there separate from heathen nations; and, again, that it
was unjust for them not only to enjoy repose, whilst the others were fighting,
but also to be settled in an assured and peaceable habitation, while the ten
tribes were still advancing to the conquest of the promised
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto the
children of Gad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>So sharp and severe a
reproof shews us the greatness of the wrong: for neither did inconsiderate
warmth carry away Moses into such violent anger, nor did he fall into error, so
as to deliver his opinion on a point which he did not well understand. He knew,
therefore, what the sons of Gad and Reuben asked; and hence he inveighed against
them thus vehemently, because they desired to lacerate the body of the Church by
this wicked severance. He begins by expostulating with them with regard to their
sinful and unreasonable covetousness, in that they sought to indulge in
idleness, when their brethren were about to march through a hostile land; for
they were possessed of no rightful superiority, so as to throw upon the others
all the labors, perils, and burdens of the war. Since, therefore, God had
imposed the same condition upon all, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f213</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it was not right that part of them should be exempted from it, as if by
privilege. More severely, however, is their ingratitude and perverseness towards
God chastised, than their injustice towards their brethren, whilst he alleges to
their reproach, that thus the hearts of the children of Israel would be broken, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f214</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus did your
fathers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He amplifies their crime by
reference to their continued perverseness: for so far is the imitation of
ungodly parents from being an excuse for their children, that it rather doubles
their guilt. Thus also does Stephen allege against the Jews of his days, their
persevering in the sins of their fathers; as if he had cried out against them,
that they were "the bad eggs of bad
birds."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ye stiff-necked (he says)

7:51.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">So also the Prophet, when he is exhorting
their posterity to obedience, recalls these same circumstances<i> </i>to their
memory:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Harden not your hearts, as
in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your
fathers tempted me. Forty years long was I grieved with this generation,"
etc.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
95:8-10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not without cause that Moses now
complains that there was no end or limit to their impiety, whilst the sons
inherited their fathers' iniquity, and ceased not to resist God: and, in order
that the similarity and affinity of their crime may be more apparent, he reviews
their history at some length. He does not, however compare the Reubenites and
Gadites to the whole people, but to the ten spies, from whom the sedition arose,
because, as far as in them lay, they turned aside the people from the right way.
Secondly, he connects with this the punishment which ensued, that, at least, he
might inspire them with terror, since it was hardly to be expected that they
would amend of their own accord. He reminds them, therefore, that, when God so
severely dealt with their fathers, He had given them a signal proof that their
descendants would not be unpunished, unless they were teachable and submissive.
The expression is remarkable, "Because they fulfilled not after me;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f215</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whereby he signifies that there is nothing praiseworthy in the most vigorous
course, unless men persevere even to the goal. And, although this had happened
forty years ago, still, inasmuch as the vengeance<i> </i>which God had
threatened had been before their eyes even to that day, it behoved them to be
just as much affected by it, as if they saw the hand of God still stretched<i>
</i>forth. For, whenever any died in the desert, so often did God set His seal
to His vengeance,<i> </i>lest it should be at any time buried in oblivion.  
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f216</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

in your fathers' stead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He signifies
that, by their evil doings, they were "filling up the measure" of their fathers,
as Jesus spoke of the Jews of His own time. In this sense he calls them an
addition <i>(accessio,) </i>which word I take to mean a climax <i>(cumulus.)

<i>tarbuth, </i>is literally an increase, or multiplication; and thus is applied
to usury. This passage, however, requires that it should be explained as a heap,
as much as to say that a new body of persons were springing up afresh, who
carried impiety to its very height. In a word, he intimates that fuel was added
to the fire which was now smouldering, whereby a new flame was excited: for he
says that they were furnishing materials for God's wrath, so that it should
burst forth more and more against the whole
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they came near tinto him, and
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that they returned
after having held a consultation: and now, &#8212; when they had considered<i>
</i>what they ought to do, before promising what they had not previously thought
of, &#8212; they assent to the decision of Moses, in accordance<i> </i>with
their general opinion. From their reply itself we gather how usefully the
severity of Moses had influenced their minds. If he had dealt with them with
greater mildness and gentleness, his kindness would perhaps have been received
with contempt. It was more profitable, therefore, that their stubborn hearts
should be smitten with shame and fear, in order that they might lay aside their
rebelliousness. Still, they do not altogether abandon their request, but devise
a middle course, whereby, whilst they do not forsake their brethren, they may
still occupy the land. They promise, then, to accompany them throughout the
whole expedition, and to unite with them in the war; nay, to be the first to
undergo danger, and expose themselves to the attacks of the enemy, provided a
settled abode should be granted them for their families and their herds. Thus
they would be exempt from guilt, since the rest would not be held back by their
bad example, nor the strength of the people for carrying on the war be
diminished; in one respect only they would have the advantage, that, by
depositing their wives and children in a peaceful spot, they would have the
opportunity of improving their domestic
finances.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses might seem to err on the
side of excessive<i> </i>good-nature, in that he extends the boundaries
prescribed by God, in complying with their wish. For, since their inheritance
had been promised them in the land of Canaan, they ought to have been contented
with that as their abode; nor was it allowable for Moses to make any alteration
in the Divine decree. There is also another thing no less inconsistent, that in
a point of so much perplexity, Moses does not, as usual, consult God, but gives
an immediate answer, which indirectly overthrows the previous ordinance of God.
And, in truth, their desire was by no means excusable, since it would have never
entered their minds, if they had borne in memory the covenant of God, and had
been satisfied with this goodness: since it cannot be but that the flesh should
be constantly running riot, unless kept under restraint by the calling of God.
But God, who knows how to bring light out of darkness, not only pardoned their
error, but takes occasion also to extend His liberality. Thus the land of
Bashan, and its neighborhood, were added to the former boundaries. At the same
time, however, He shewed on the other hand how much better it would have been
for them to have been kept together, so that they might have mutually protected
each other, and dwelt securely in their appointed habitation. And, after the
lapse of a long period, the Reubenites and Gadites learnt from experience that
they had been too hasty in wishing for the land which they obtained;
nevertheless, through God's indulgence, that which might justly have been
injurious to them, turned out for their
advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may gather, however, from the
result, that Moses was guilty of no rashness in his interference<i> </i>with the
ordinance, of God, both because he commands that which he now determines to be
ratified and maintained after his death; and when, in the book of Joshua, it is
recorded that the several tribes had their inheritance assigned to them, this
country beyond Jordan is excepted, as having been granted by Moses to the tribes
of Reuben and Gad and half of Manasseh. Hence it is evident that his decision
was approved by God. Moreover, since he is there often honored with the title of
"servant of God," we are taught that nothing was done by him in this matter
without the authority of God, and the guidance of His Spirit. Neither is it at
random that he here so often makes use of God's name, but rather does he thus
imply that whatever he does is suggested by
Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye will not do
so.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He makes a solemn protestation that
they will deal wickedly, if they break their promise:and at the same time
denounces punishment against them, as if he were summoning them before the
tribunal of God. But, although he speaks conditionally of that particular
engagement, whereby the two tribes had voluntarily bound themselves, still we
may derive from his words the general doctrine, that, unless we abide by our
promises, God will always be the avenger of fraud and treachery. The expression,
"Sin<i> </i>will find you out," is more emphatic than as if he had simply said,
You shall not escape God's hand; for the meaning of it is that vengeance<i>
</i>is so connected with sin, that it cannot be severed from it. Thus, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:7, it is said, "Sin lieth at the door," to lay hold at length of the guilty.
For, such is our propensity to sin, that we too often find from experience that
we are encouraged to audacity by God's forbearance, whilst we think that we have
escaped, if He makes as though He saw us not for a
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So concerning them Moses
commanded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses annexes these
conditions to his decision, lest, when the Reubenites and their companions had
performed their military tasks:, they should be falsely alleged to have passed
over Jordan for the purpose of seeking a new home; whilst at the same time, if
they should deceive the other tribes, he provided that their cowardice and
deceit should not profit them. In short, if they assisted their brethren in
pursuance of their agreement, he commands that the territory, which he now
grants them, should always remain theirs; but, if they departed from their
promise, he would have them forced against their will to participate in the
common allotment. For he does not assign them this portion in the midst of
Canaan as a reward for their inertness, in case they should stay behind; but
signifies that they should be forcibly and authoritatively carried onwards, so
as to be subject to their brethren under all circumstances; since it, was not
lawful for them to consult their own separate
interests.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In laying down rules for the division
of the land, as if it were soon to happen, he encourages the minds of all to
confidence, so that they should more cheerfully hasten to pass over; as if the
victory were not only already in their hands, but that the fruits of it were
soon to be enjoyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses gave unto them.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">We must understand that Moses <i>gave </i>it in
such sort, as that, relying on God's command, he laid down an inviolable law.
For, although it is not expressly stated that God interposed His authority,
still His subsequent approbation fully assures us of it. So also, although no
mention is made of Eleazar and the elders, still it is certain that they were
not passed over, but that they were united with him in the decision; especially
since the case<i> </i>had been brought before them by the sons of Gad and
Reuben, (ver. 2.) There is only an implied contrast between the old covenant
which God had made with Abraham, and this new and special privilege, wherewith
He condescended to enrich His people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At first
only the two tribes had been named; half the tribe of Manasseh is now added,

some give, as if they 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f218</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
had obtained these victories after Moses had permitted the Reubenites and
Gadites to inhabit this side of Jordan, does not appear to me suitable; but
rather the reason is given why that portion is excepted,<i> </i>which came to
the sons of Manasseh, viz., because they were not to be defrauded of the lands
which they had separately acquired. Nor is it probable, that, when the country
beyond Jordan had been given to others, they afterwards made their incursion so
as to appropriate what did not belong to them. The order of the narrative does
not make this necessary; for it is common with the Hebrews to transpose the
order of occurrences, especially when something before omitted is incidentally
added to give a reason for what is done. If, however, any should prefer to
believe that they were attracted by the advantage that presented itself, I will
not pertinaciously contend the point.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But how
does it accord that cities are said to be <i>built </i>which were still standing
undestroyed? for we have already seen that the people who had taken them, were
dwelling in them. I reply that, inasmuch as it seldom happens that cities are
taken without the walls being destroyed, it is not unreasonable that the
restoration of these should be called <i>building. </i>It was necessary that the
cities should be fortified lest the unarmed multitude 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f219</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
should be exposed to the assaults of every enemy. To this end they repaired what
had been thrown down, and thus in a manner renewed the cities which were a mass
of ruins.</font><br></div>

Moses confirms his decision, that the possession of the country beyond Jordan
should be insured to the Reubenites and Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
For, since it had fallen to them exceptionally, the matter might be brought into
controversy with posterity. Lest, then, any should disturb them, he again
declares that they were the rightful possessors of that district. Moreover,
inasmuch as the very gift of it might be called in question, since it was
situated outside the bounds of the inheritance promised by God, Moses
anticipates this objection also, asserting that God had not in vain given it to
be possessed by His people. Hence it follows that the right of inhabiting it was
conferred upon them. Lest, then, so unequal a partition should be made a subject
of contention, he marks out their boundaries on every<i> </i>side, as though he
set up the authority of God as a wall and rampart against any who should presume
to invade it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With reference to the names of the

I prefer, however, to take the word "outpourings" <i>(effusionum)

where the ground by a gentle descent seems in a manner to pour itself forth. We
shall presently see that Pisgah was one of the summits of Mount

the subjugation of the land of Canaan. He says, therefore, that he had given
them a place, not where they were at once to settle themselves, but where they

comply with God's command to its full extent, still he did not wait until the
three other cities could be added; but that, as far as circumstances permitted,
he discharged his duty. Hence let us learn that, even when we cannot at once
entirely carry out what God commands us to do, we are still to be by no means

various tortuous routes, in consequence of their own depravity and stubbornness,
until they had received the reward of their vile ingratitude. Whilst, at the
same time, they might reflect that God had so tempered the severity of their
punishment, that He still preserved and sustained the despisers of his grace,
notwithstanding their iniquity and unworthiness; and also that He carried on to
the children (of the transgressors) the covenant which He had made with
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not without reason that Moses
premises that "these were the journeys of the children of Israel;"<i> </i>for,
at the period when they came out of the land of Goshen, they were affected with
no ordinary fear and anxiety, when they saw themselves buried, as it were, in
the grave; for they were shut in on every side either by the sea or the defiles
of two mountains, or by the army of Pharaoh. Having entered the desert, they had
seven stations before they arrived at Mount Sinai, in which they must have
perished a hundred times over by hunger and thirst, and a dearth of everything,
unless God had marvellously succoured them. And although they might have
completed their whole journey in so many days, even then their obstinate
perversity began to subject them to delay. If the lack of bread and water beset
them, they ought to have been more effectually stirred up by it to have recourse
humbly to God. So little disposed, however, were they to that humility, which
might have taught them to ask of God by prayer and supplication a remedy for
their need, that they rather rebelled against Moses: and not only so, but they
petulantly assailed God Himself with their impious taunts, as if He were a cruel
executioner instead of their Redeemer. Hence, therefore, it came to pass that it
was not before the fortieth day that they were at length brought to Mount Sinai.
Scarcely had the Law been promulgated, and whilst the awful voice of God was
still ringing in their ears, whereby He had bound them to Himself as His people,
when, behold, suddenly a base, nay, a monstrous falling away into idolatry,
whence it was not their own fault that, having rejected God's grace, and as far
as depended upon themselves having annulled the promise, they did not perisist
miserably as they deserved. By this impediment they were again withheld from
further progress. With the same obstinacy they constantly raged against God,
and, though warned by many instances of punishment, never returned to a sound
mind. The climax of their insane contumacy was, that when arrived at the borders
of the promised land, they repudiated God's kindness, and exhorted each other to
return, as if God were adverse to them, and His inestimable deliverance, which
ought to have been a perpetual obligation to obedience, were utterly distasteful
to them. The stations, which then follow, express in a more, lively manner how,
&#8212; like a ship which is driven away from its port by a tempest, and whirled
round by various currents, &#8212; they were carried away from approaching the
land, and wandered by circuitous courses: as if they deserved that God should
thus lead them about in mockery. It will be well for us to keep our eyes on this
design of Moses, in order that we may read the chapter with
profit.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls the order of their marches
journeys <i>(profectiones,) </i>in contradistinction to their stations: for they
did not strike their camp unless the signal were given, <i>i.e., </i>when the
cloud left the sanctuary, and moved to another spot, as if God stretched forth
His hand from heaven to direct their way: and hence it was more clearly
apparent, that they were retained in the desert by this
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they departed from
Rameses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not approve of their
opinion, who think that the name of this city is used for the whole land of
Goshen: since it is not reasonable that they should have set forth at the same
time from various distant and remote places. And this would still less accord
with what presently follows, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f222</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they went forth in orderly array; though it might not be the case that they
all mustered together in the city, because it is hardly credible that so great a
multitude could be received within its walls, but that by the order of Moses and
Aaron, they were all assembled in the neighborhood of the city, so that they
might be organized, lest in the confusion of their hurried march they should
impede each other.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After having stated that they
went out by "the high hand" of God, for the purpose of extolling still more His
wonderful power, he adds that the Egyptians were witnesses and spectators of it:
whence we conclude that they had at last yielded to God, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f223</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or were so thoroughly subdued, as not to dare to lift up a finger. Another
circumstance is also added, viz., that the Egyptians were then burying all their
first-born; by which words Moses does not mean to indicate that they forbore
from hindering the departure of the Israelites, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f224</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because they were occupied with another matter; but rather signifies that,
although they were exasperated by grief at the loss of their sons, still they
lay stupified, as it were, since the power of God had enfeebled them, so that
they had lost the ability to offer
resistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When Moses says, that God "executed
judgments" upon the gods of the Egyptians, it is with the object of recommending
the true faith, lest the children of Israel should ever turn aside to the
superstitions of the Gentiles, which, at the time of the deliverance, they had
found to be mere delusions. For not only were Pharaoh and his troops overthrown,
but their gods also put to shame, when they pretended to be the protectors of
their land: and thus were all their superstitions refuted and convicted of error
and folly. It is a silly imagination, that all the idols of Egypt fell down of
themselves, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f225</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in order that the God of Israel might claim the glory of Deity for Himself
alone. It is enough that God triumphed over the idols, when He effectively
shewed that they had no power to aid their worshippers, and, at the same time,
discovered the trickeries of the magicians. To this Isaiah appears to allude,
when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Behold, the Lord shall
come into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
19:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for he signifies that God will give such proofs of
His power in Egypt, as shall demonstrate the vanity of all their errors, and
overthrow all the superstitious fictions whereby the Israelites had been
deceived.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they departed from before
Pi-hahiroth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>relates how the
people marched forwards for three days; not so much in praise of their
endurance, as in celebration of God's wonderful power, who sustained so great a
multitude without water. For we must bear in mind, what I have elsewhere shewn,
that from the passage of the Red Sea to Marah there was no water found; whence
the impiety of the people was the more detestable, since they there burst forth
into rebellion on account of the bitter taste of the water. On the other side,
the incomparable mercy of God shone forth, in that He condescended to refresh
these churlish and provoking men in a pleasant and delightful station; for from
their first encampment they were led on to Elim, where they found twelve
fountains and seventy palm-trees. Moses passes briefly over the wilderness of
Sin, as if nothing worthy of being recorded had occurred there; whereas the vile
impiety of the people there betrayed itself, and the place was ennobled by a
signal miracle, since the manna rained from heaven for the nourishment of the
people, so that, the windows of heaven being opened, mortal man "did eat angels'
food." He also briefly adverts to the want of water to drink at Rephidim: but he
deemed it sufficient here to enumerate the stations, which might recall the
various occurrences to the memory of the people. On the Graves of Concupiscence
a memorial of God's punishment was inscribed; but since he simply gives a list
of other places, without any record of events, we may gather, as I have above
stated, that he had no other design than to set before the eyes of the people
the peregrination in which they had been engaged for forty years. He, however,
cursorily mentions the death of Aaron; because his life had been prolonged, by
God's special blessing, for the good of the people, until the time approached
when they were about to enter the promised land; since his authority was a
useful and necessary restraint upon the ungovernable character of this
headstrong people. At the same time the punishment inflicted upon the holy man
should have reminded posterity that it was not without reason that their fathers
had been so severely chastised, since they had not ceased to add sin to sin,
when God had not spared even His own servant on account of a single
transgression.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he adds just afterwards,
that the Canaanite then first heard of the coming the children of Israel, he
indicates that God had put a veil over the eyes of their enemies, lest they
should oppose them at an earlier period. For God so mitigated the severity of
His judgment, that the exile of the Israelites was, at any rate, undisturbed,
and free from outward molestation, as long as they had to wander in the
desert.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The end and design of God in
willing that these nations should be expelled, I have elsewhere explained, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f226</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
viz, lest they should adulterate the pure worship of God by their admixtures,
should corrupt the people by their bad examples, and thus be pollutions to the
Holy Land. But Moses now refers to another point, for, when about to speak of
the division of the land, he begins by saying that it must be emptied of its
inhabitants, that its free and full enjoyment may remain for the children of
Israel. We must remark the connection here, for else this passage would have
been a supplement of the First Commandment, to which I have indeed appended the
latter part of the verse: but, since God declares connectedly, "Ye shall
dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein, for I have given you
the land to possess it," it<i> </i>would have been absurd that one clause should
be disjoined from the
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>54<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall divide the land
by lot.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The mode of division is also
stated, that each should possess what fell to him by lot; and this was the best
plan, for the several tribes would never have allowed themselves to be sent here
or there at the option of men: and even if the arrangement had been left to the
voices of the judges, they would rather have quarreled with each other than
determined what was right. But we must here take into consideration something
deeper; viz., that by this method God gave certain<i> </i>proof that the
children of Israel were the inheritors and masters of that land by His
liberality and special blessing. And, in the first place, we must remember that,
although men consider nothing more fortuitous than casting lots, still they are
governed by God, as Solomon says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
16:33.) God, therefore, commanded the people to cast lots, reserving to Himself
the judgment as to those to whom they should fall. For how came it to pass that
Zebulun obtained his portion on the sea-shore, except because it had been thus
predicted by the Patriarch Jacob? Why did a district productive of the best corn
fall to the tribe of Asher, unless because it had been pronounced by the same
lips, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Out of Asher his bread
should be fat;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and he should yield
royal dainties"?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
49:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the same prophecy the tribe of Judah obtained an
inheritance rich in vines, and abounding in the best of pastures. Thus the
division of the land, by lot, clearly showed that God had not formerly promised
that land to Abraham in vain; because the proclamation of the gift by the mouth
of Jacob was actually confirmed. The pious old man had been expelled from hence
by famine; he was but a sojourner in Egypt, and twice an exile, and yet he
assigns their portions to his descendants in the most authoritative manner, just
as the father of a family might divide his few acres of land among his heirs.
Yet God finally sealed what then might have seemed ridiculous. Hence it appears
that things which, in the feebleness of our senses, we imagine to move at the
blind impulse of chance, are directed by God's secret providence; and that His
counsel always proceeds in such a regular course, that the end corresponds with
the beginning. Again he recommends to them the law of proportion, so that,
according to their numbers, a greater or a less allotment should be given to the
several tribes. The allegory which some conceive to be indicated here, viz.,
that we obtain our heavenly inheritance by God's gratuitous good pleasure, as if
by lot, although at first sight plausible, is easily refuted. Hebron was a part
of the inheritance, but Caleb obtained it without casting lots: and a still more
decided exception appears in the case of the tribe of Reuben, Gad, and half
Manasseh, who, by the consent of the rest, and not by lot, acquired by
privilege, as it were, all the territory that had been won on the other side of
Jordan. Let my readers, therefore, learn to abstain from such conceits, lest
they should often be obliged to confess with shame, that they have caught at an
empty shadow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>55<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye will not drive
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have elsewhere seen why God's
wrath was so greatly aroused against those nations, that He desired them to be
exterminated. Even in Abraham's time gross indulgence of sin had begun to
prevail there, as we gather from God's word, when He said that "their<i>
</i>iniquity was not yet full." After they had abused the forbearance of God
Himself for 400 years, who will deny that their destruction was the just and
reasonable reward of their long obstinacy? Still, in cutting them off, God had
regard to His elect people, in order that they might be separated from the
heathen, and never turn aside to foreign superstitions. But the punishment which
is here threatened the Israelites deserved twice over by their remissness, for
they neither performed their duty in executing God's vengeance, and, as far as
in them lay, they detracted from His grace. He had conferred upon them no common
honor, when He appointed them to be His ministers for executing His judgments.
It was therefore base supineness in them to be remiss on this point. But again,
He had given them the whole land; when, then, they contented themselves with
part of it, and neglected the rest, their perverse ingratitude betrayed itself
by their indifference. Besides, they had willfully entangled themselves in
deadly nerds, by mixing with heathen nations, from whom they had been separated
by God, lest they should imitate their habits, and corrupt religious ceremonies.
God, therefore, threatens that these nations shall be as prickles to pierce
their eyes, and thorns in their sides. That this was fulfilled, the Book of
Judges affords the clearest and most ample testimony, although, even to the days
of David, this punishment was constantly in course of infliction upon their eyes
and sides. Thus, also, is their untamable headstrongness proved, since such a
solemn admonition had no effect in causing 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f227</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
them to go forwards, no less in the open punishment of iniquity, than in a

Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God here undertakes the office of
a prudent and careful father of a family, in fixing the boundaries of the land
on every side, lest their right to posses it should ever be called in question.
He begins on the southern side, where it must be observed that the district of
Bashan is included in it, and all that the Israelites had acquired before their
passage of the Jordan, so that this addition was approved of by God. He extends
this part as far as the wilderness of Sin, and the borders of Edom, and brings
it round from Kadesh-barnea to Addar, and the passage of Azmon, and, finally, to
the stream which washes 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f228</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the city of Rhinocorura, in the immediate vicinity of Egypt; for by "the river
of Egypt" the Nile is by no means to be understood, the course of which was not
at all in that direction. The southern boundary, therefore, was from the
Mediterranean Sea towards Arabia. On the western side the land was washed by the
Mediterranean Sea, which is here called "the Great Sea,"<i> </i>in comparison
with the Lake of Gennesareth, and the Salt Sea, by which name the <i>Lacus
Asphaltires </i>is here meant. The beginning of the northern boundary was the
promontory of Hor, for it would not accord to suppose that the mountain is here
referred to in which Aaron died, and which was far away, and situated on the
opposite side of the land. It extended from hence to Epiphania in Syria, which
is called Hamath; for I agree with Jerome in thinking that there were two cities
of this name, and it is undoubtedly probable that Antioch is called "Hamath the
great" by the Prophet Amos
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos

states, I leave undecided. It then passed on to Zedad and Ziphron, and its
extremity was the village of Enan. The eastern boundary passed from thence
through Shephan, Riblah, and Ain, until it reached the Lake of Gennesareth, a
lake sufficiently well known, and here called the Sea of Chinnereth. Thus the

exclude them from their part of the promised inheritance was if they were
disinherited, and therefore banished beyond the boundaries prescribed by God
&#8212; but only from being subject to the casting of lots, because they had by
special privilege obtained from their brethren what would else have been
included in the common inheritance. Not that this had been revealed from the
beginning, but because God in His indulgence had complied with their request,
whereby they enlarged the boundaries of the land. And assuredly it would have
been absurd that no place should be given them among their brethren in the
promised land, as if they were cast off from the family of Abraham. We have
lately seen that this part, which seemed to be separated from the others, was
included in the limits laid down by God. Moses, therefore, merely wished to
declare<i> </i>that what remained was to be divided by
lot.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The question here arises, if the
Israelites were to divide the land among themselves by lot, wherefore was the
authority of the judges required, as if there was anything for them to decide?
But if we consider what has been lately shown, that reference was to be had, in
the distribution of the land, to the numbers in every tribe, it was requisite
for two purposes, &#8212; first, that God might show by His decree the districts
respectively assigned to them; and, secondly, that their dimensions might be
proportionate to the number of their occupants. For the casting of lots was
still necessary, because many would have been averse to the sea-coast, or would
have preferred the center of the land to its extremities, or would have been
unwilling to be banished to the mountains; in short, they would have contended
with each other beyond measure in murmurings and strife. On this account the
lots were cast, by the decision of which God placed the several tribes in
whatever position He pleased, although the judges, together with the High Priest
and Joshua, had before divided the land into ten portions. But after it was
declared in what district the several tribes were to dwell, as if God had there
designated their abodes, the determination of men was again necessarily had
recourse to, as to how far, and in what direction, the boundaries of the greater
tribes were to extend; otherwise the lesser tribes would have refused to be
cooped up in a less convenient position. And although the supreme authority was
justly vested in Eleazar and Joshua, lest God should expose them to calumny and
ill-will, He associated with them a council, in which also there was a prudent
precaution against rivalry, for each of the twelve tribes contributed its judge
to preside over the distribution, so that none might complain of being
aggrieved. Moreover, inasmuch as it was of great importance that the possession,
once established, should be secured to posterity, first of all the names of the
princes are recorded, in order to give certainty to the history; and, secondly,
as had been stated at the beginning of the chapter, so also it is repeated at
the end that they were chosen by God, from whence the Israelites learnt that the
boundaries then fixed could not be altered without overthrowing the authority of
God Himself.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses went and spake
these words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the word <i>went </i>he
signifies that, having received the commands from God, he came to the people to
report them. Hence we gather that they were warned in good time to beware, if
they had been sensibly disposed. And it was necessary that the people should
hear from his own mouth these addresses, which were by no means gratifying, as
being full both of cruel threats and severe reproofs; for, if they had been
delivered after his death, they would have straightway all exclaimed that they
had been deceitfully devised by some one else, and thus that his name was
falsely attached to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the peculiar
time of their delivery did not a little avail to enhance their weight, so that
the people should not only submit themselves with meekness and teachableness to
his instruction at the moment, but also that it might remain hereafter deeply
impressed upon their hearts. We know with what attention the last words of the
dying are usually received;<i> </i>and Moses, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f230</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
now ready to meet death at God's command, addressed the people as if bidding
them finally farewell. To the credit and dignity belonging to his office as a
Prophet, there was consequently added all the force and authority of a
testamentary disposition.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As throughout his life
he had been incredibly anxious for the people's welfare, so he now carries his
more than paternal care<i> </i>still further. And assuredly it becomes all pious
teachers to provide, as far as in them lies, that the fruit of their labors
should survive them. Of this solicitude Peter sets himself before us as an
example:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I<i> </i>think it meet
(he says), as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in
remembrance; moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to
have these things always in remembrance."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;610113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Peter 1:13, 15)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said unto them, I am
an hundred and twenty years old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Although Moses had been often proudly and disdainfully rejected, it could
not but be the case, nevertheless, that his departure would both awaken the
deepest sorrow, and inspire them with much alarm. By setting before them his
age, therefore, he consoles their anxiety, and mitigates their grief; and also,
by another reason, he represses their lamentations, i.e.,<i> </i>that God had
fixed his term of life. He adduces it, then, as an alleviation, because both his
death was more than mature, and he was no longer fitted in his extreme old age
for enduring fatigue. Here, however, the question arises, why he should say that
he was failing, and broken in strength, when we shall see a little further on
that he retained his senses in their rigor even until his death? But the reply
is obvious, that he would not have been useless in his old age, because his eyes
were dim or his members tremulous, but because his age no longer allowed him to
perform his usual duties. For he had been marvelously and preternaturally
preserved up to that time; but, since he had now arrived at the end of his
course, it was necessary that he should suddenly sink, and be deprived of his
faculties.</font><br><font face="Palatino">"To go out, and come in," is
equivalent to performing the functions of life: thus it is said in the Psalm,
"Thou has known my going out and coming in." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f231</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
121:8.) And in this sense David is said to have gone out and come in, when he
performed the duty intrusted to him by Saul.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 18:5.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the latter clause, where he
refers to his exclusion from the land of Canaan, and his being prevented from
entering it, he indirectly rebukes the people, for whose offense God had been
wroth with himself and Aaron. Thus by this tacit reproof the Israelites were
admonished to bear patiently the penalty of their ingratitude. At the same
time., as he shows himself to be submissive to the divine decree, he bids them
also acquiesce<i> </i>in it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord thy God, he will go
over.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By no ordinary consolation does he
encourage their minds to renewed alacrity, because they should experience, even
when he was dead, the unceasing favor of God. Hence we gather a lesson of
especial usefulness, that whenever God raises up to us men endowed with
excellent<i> </i>gifts, He is wont so to make use of their labors for a time, as
still to retain others in His hand, and constantly to substitute others, unless
our sins stand in the way. Hence it follows that the power of God is not to be
tied to the illustrious qualities of men, as if their death was His destruction.
It is true, indeed, that eminent men are rarely succeeded by their equals, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f232</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because our wickedness stifles the light of spiritual gifts, and, as far as it
can, extinguishes them; still let this be deemed certain that, when God promotes
our welfare by ministers of special eminence, He gives us a taste of His
goodness, in order that we may expect its continuance; "because he forsakes not
the work of his own hands."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8.) Moses says, therefore, that although he may be taken away by death,
still God will undertake the office of their leader, or rather that He will
continue to be their leader, as the Israelites had before experienced Him to
be.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But h sustains their infirmity by another
consolation also, pointing out Joshua as his successor; otherwise the people
might have been ready to object that, if God was willing to go before them, why
did he not manifest it by the election of a representative, by whose hand He
might continue what He had begun by Moses. In this respect, therefore, he also
shows that God's favor was by no means obscure, since Joshua was already chosen
to sustain the care<i> </i>and burden of governing the people: for it is not by
his own authority that he obtrudes Joshua and sets him over them, but he
declares him to be called by God. Still, it is not a matter hitherto unknown
which he puts before them, but only bids them remember what God had long ago
revealed, as we have elsewhere
seen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord shall do unto
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He promises that, when they<i>
</i>shall come into the land of Canaan, they shall be conquerors of all its
nations: and this he confirms by experience; for, as God had delivered Sihon
king of the Arnorites, and Og king of Bashan, into their hands, so also He would
give them the same success in subduing their other enemies. The world is indeed
subject to many revolutions, but God still remains like Himself, not only
because His counsel is never changed, but because His power is never diminished.
By a <i>real </i>proof, therefore, as it is called, he encourages the
expectations of the people, and at the same time exhorts them resolutely to
execute God's command, viz., that they should purge the land of Canaan by the
destruction of all its inhabitants. In appearance, indeed, this was fierce and
cruel, to leave not even one alive; but, since God had justly devoted them to
extinction, it was not lawful for the Israelites to inquire what was to be done,
but to abandon all discussion, and to obey God's command. In that they spared
many, so much the worse was their remissness, since God had often prepared them
to execute<i> </i>the vengeance which He had
decreed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be strong and of good
courage.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After he had shown that God
would be with them, for their help, he exhorts the people to firmness and
magnanimity. And surely this is one means of confirming our courage, to be
assured that the assistance which God promises will suffice for us: so far is it
from being the case, that our zeal and energy in acting aright is impaired, by
our ascribing to the grace of God what foolish men attribute to their own free
will. For those who are aroused to strenuous action in reliance on their own
strength, do no more than cast themselves headlong in their senseless temerity
and pride. Let us understand, then, that all exhortations are fleeting and
ineffective, which are founded on anything else but simple confidence in the
grace of God. Thus Moses assumes, as his ground of exhortation, that God will
fight for the Israelites. It must, however, be observed that the people were
animated to the perseverance of hope, when God declares that He will be their
helper even to the end, by which lesson that impious hallucination is refuted,
whereby the Popish theologians have fascinated the world. They deny that
believers 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f233</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
can be certain of God's grace, except as to their present state. Thus do they
hold faith in suspense, so that we may only believe for a day, and even from
moment to moment, whilst we are in uncertainty as to what God will do with us on
the morrow. Whereas, if faith corresponds with God's promises, and is, as it
were, in harmony with them, it must needs extend itself to our whole life, nay,
even beyond death itself; for God removes all doubt as to the future by these
words, "I will not leave thee nor forsake
thee."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses called unto
Joshua.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It hence appears that those,
upon whom a public charge is conferred, have need of a twofold confirmation:
for, after having addressed a general instruction to the whole people, he
directs his discourse peculiarly to Joshua himself, as to one whose business it
was to set an example of bravery to others, and whom severe contests awaited.
Since, then, it is more difficult to lead all the rest than to follow a leader,
it is necessary that he, who is set over many, should far excel them. But,
inasmuch as no one call do anything of himself, we must seek of God whatever we
want. Wherefore that, which Moses had enjoined upon the whole people, he now
repeats to a single individual, because upon him the burden of ruling them was
thrown. And this must be more carefully observed, because, in proportion to the
degree of honor, in which a man is placed, so does he disdainfully look down
upon all admonitions; whence it is the case that those, who are eminent in the
world, carelessly reject the exhortations of God's servants. But Moses
thoroughly overthrows all such fastidiousness, when he shows that all, who are
in authority, should not only be instructed together with others, but even more
urgently dealt with.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When Moses, in this place
as well as above, forbids believers to give way to fear or dread, it must be
observed that. he would not have them so deprived of all feeling, as to be
hardened into indifference to every danger, or to suppose, as some madmen do,
that there is no such thing as bravery without stupidity, but only possessed of
such confidence as may overcome all fears, which impede the course of their
calling. Appropriately does the Apostle extend this lesson further, where he
wishes to correct avarice, which arises from over-anxiety, whilst wretched men
do not sufficiently reflect what it is to have God for their perpetual helper.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses
spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses here sets forth not only
God's providence in attending to the welfare of the people, but also his own
zeal for them. Hence it appears how paternal was his affection for them, in that
he not only performed his duty towards them faithfully and earnestly, and
shunned no pains that it cost him, even to the end of his life, but he also
makes provision for the future, and is anxious about a suitable successor, lest
the people should remain without one, like a headless body. We perceive also his
humility, when he does not arrogate the right of appointment to himself, nor on
his own authority submit the matter to the election of the people, but
establishes God as its sole arbiter. It was, indeed, permitted him to choose the
officers, and this was a part of the political constitution; but this was too
difficult a task, to find by man's judgment one who should suffice for its
performance; and, consequently, it behoved that the power should be intrusted to
God alone, who did not indeed refuse to undertake it. And this special reason
had much force in so difficult a point, viz., that the people should receive
their leader at His hand, in order that the supreme power should always remain
vested in Himself. As, therefore, He had chosen Moses in an extraordinary
manner, and had appointed him to be His representative, so He continued the same
grace in the case<i> </i>of Joshua. Already, indeed, had He designated him; but,
out of modesty, Moses omits his name, and simply prays that God would provide
for His people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The title, with which he honors
God, has reference to the matter in question. It is true, indeed, that God may
be often called "the God of the spirits of all flesh," and for another reason,
in chap. 16:22, Moses makes use of this expression; but he now alludes to this
attribute, as much as to say, that there must be some one ready, and as it were
in His hand, who should be appointed, since He has the making of all men
according to His own will. Men often are mistaken and deceived in their
opinions, and, even although the Spirit of God may enlighten them, they go no
further than to discern the peculiar endowment for which a person is eminent;
but God is not only the best judge of each man's ability and aptitude, nor does
He only penetrate to the inmost recesses of every heart; but He also fashions
and refashions the men whom He chooses as His ministers, and supplies them with
the faculties they require in order to be sufficient for bearing the burden. We
gather from hence a useful lesson, i.e.,<i> </i>that, when we are deprived of
good rulers, they should be sought from the Maker Himself, whose special gift
the power of good government is. And on this ground Moses calls Him not only the
Creator of men, but "of all flesh," and expressly refers to their
"spirits."</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he compares the people to
<i>sheep, </i>it is for the purpose of awakening compassion, so that God may be
more disposed to appoint them a
shepherd.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We here see that Joshua was given
in answer to the prayers of Moses, which is not stated elsewhere. But, in order
that he may obtain his dignity with the consent of all, he is honored with a
signal encomium: for, when God declares that the Spirit is in him, He does not
merely intimate that he has a soul, but that he excels in the necessary gifts,
such as intelligence. judgment, magnanimity, and skill in war: and the word
"spirit"<i> </i>is used, in a different sense from that which it has just above,
for that eminent and rare grace, which manifested itself in Joshua. For this
metonymy 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f234</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is a tolerably common figure in Scripture.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
solemn rite of his consecration by the imposition of hands follows, respecting
which I have treated so fully elsewhere, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f235</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that it is now superfluous to say much upon it. It was in use before the giving
of the Law, for thus the holy patriarchs blessed their sons. We have seen that
the priests were inaugurated in their office, and that victims were offered to
God, with this ceremony. The apostles followed this custom in the appointment of
pastors. Moses, therefore, in order to testify publicly that Joshua was no
longer his own master, but dedicated to God, and no longer to be regarded as a
private individual, since he was called by God to the supreme command, laid his
hands upon his head.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There was also another
reason, viz., that, according to the requirements of the office intrusted to
him, God would more and more enrich him (with His gifts;(Added from <i>Fr</i>.))
for there is nothing to prevent God from conferring richer endowments upon His
servants according to the nature of their vocation, although they may have
previously been eminent for spiritual gifts. Thus to Timothy, when he was
appointed a pastor, new grace was given by the imposition of the hands of Paul,
although he had before attained to no ordinary eminence.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:6.) To the same effect is what follows, that Moses should put some of
his glory 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f236</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
upon him, as if resigning his own dignity; for by the word <i>glory, </i>not
only external splendor, but rather spiritual honor is signified, whereby God
commands reverence towards His servants; not that he was stripped of his own
virtues by transferring them to Joshua, but because, without diminution of his
own gifts, he made the person who was about to be his successor his associate in
their possession.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was fitting that this
should be done before all the people, that all might willingly receive him as
presented to them by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The charge given to
him partly tended to confirm the authority of Joshua, and partly to bind him
more solemnly to discharge his duties; for, inasmuch as Moses commanded him what
he was to do in the name of God, he exempted himself from all suspicion of
temerity; and, on the other hand, by the introduction of this duly authorized
engagement, Joshua must have been more and more encouraged to faith and
diligence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>

time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He repeats what we have already
seen, that he exhorted Joshua together with the whole people to prepare
themselves to occupy the land with alacrity, relying as well upon God's promise,
as upon the numerous proofs of His assistance, which were so many pledges of the
future continuance of His
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23<i>.</i></b><i>

</i>Others have, "I besought;" but I have preferred using the pluperfect tense,
because, in my opinion, Moses interrupts himself to show why he had resigned his
office to another, and did not rather declare that he would be their leader, as
heretofore, and at the same time an example to the people of courage. He says,
therefore, that when he had prayed that he might be permitted to enter the land,
he received a refusal. For it is not probable that, after he had substituted
Joshua for himself, he straightway conceived a desire, which was in direct
opposition to it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The drift of the prayer is
that God, by granting him permission to enter the land, should thus fill up to
the full the measure of His grace towards him: for he enumerates the blessings
already vouchsafed to him, as the ground of his confidence in asking, and that
God, who is not wont to forsake the work of His own hands, might carry on to the
end the mercies He had begun. For this reason he says that the might of God had
been shown him; modestly hinting that it was natural to expect that he should be
a partaker of the crowning blessing, in order that the end might correspond with
the beginning. He also magnifies the power of God as proclaimed by the miracles;
that so magnificent a work might not be interrupted. On the other hand, he
speaks in commendation of the goodness of the land, and expressly shows that his
desire to see it springs from earnest piety; for I willingly subscribe to the
opinion of those who understand Sion by the "goodly<i> </i>mountain;" for, with
the exception of Lebanon, there was no other mountain so delectable in the land;
whereas Lebanon, as if next to it in rank, is mentioned in the second
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord was wroth with
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some imagine that God was offended
by such a longing as this; but Moses is rather giving the reason why he did not
obtain what he sought, viz., because he had been already excluded from it. For,
although he by no means enters into debate with God, as if he had been unjustly
condemned for the faults of others, still he indirectly reflects upon the
people, since it was well that they should be all reminded that the punishment
which had been inflicted upon God's distinguished servant was incurred by the
guilt of them all. We have elsewhere seen 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f240</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
how it was that the penalty of their common transgression was with justice
imposed upon Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Its mitigation then follows,
when God commands him to get up into the top of Mount Abarim, which is here
called Pisgah, and elsewhere Nebo, that he might nevertheless enjoy a sight of
the promised land.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In conclusion, he more
clearly explains why he exhorted Joshua, viz., because he was about to go over
before the people; and in the last verse he assigns the reason of their delay,
and why they remained so long in the valley near Mount Abarim; for it is
precisely as if he had said that they were retained by the extension of God's
hand, in order that they should not proceed any further until Joshua had been
installed as his successor.</font><br></div>

from the transgression of the people that he was not permitted to enter the

cruelty, as if he had been improperly and unjustly substituted as a criminal in
the place of others, but rather to magnify the goodness of God towards those
whom He had treated with so much indulgence. For we must observe the comparison,
that, whilst they were to enjoy the land, he was to be prevented from entering
it. "I must die (he says) in this land" of Moab, whilst to you it is given to
enjoy the promised inheritance. We perceive, therefore, that they are upbraided
with their guilt in such a way that all the bitterness of the reproof is
sweetened by the sense of God's mercy; nay, that by this sweetness they may be
ravished into admiration, when they understand how mercifully that pardon is

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Joshua is now substituted in the
place of Moses by a solemn ceremony, not only that he may be held in greater
reverence by men, but also that he may be presented before God, and thus may
acknowledge that he is dedicated to His service; for his being brought before
the door of the tabernacle was a kind of consecration; and God also declares
that He will give him a charge, which is equivalent to saying that He will
instruct him in the performance of his duties. The appearance also of the glory
of God in the cloud, was not less effectual for encouraging himself personally,
than for giving public distinction to his high office. For he would never have
been recognized as the successor of Moses, unless this visible approbation of
God had fastened the yoke upon the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, thou, shalt sleep with
thy fathers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In order that Moses may
labor more earnestly to retain the people in obedience to God, he is reminded of
their indomitable perverseness. He had already sufficiently, and more than
sufficiently, experienced how depraved and stubborn was the disposition of the
Israelites, and how disobedient and contumacious they had been; God now declares
that they will be no better after his death; nay, that they will indulge
themselves in greater license in <i>consequence </i>of his <i>absence </i>from
them. For it appears as if there was an antithesis implied between the words
"lie down," and "rise up;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f242</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if it were said, As soon as you have gone to rest, their insubordination
shall break forth, as if they were released from all laws. Not, indeed, that
this should take place immediately, for under Joshua they manifested some
humility and submissiveness; at any rate, the outward form of pure religion was
then maintained, but soon afterwards they relapsed into their old habits. And
perhaps this admonition was useful as a preventative, so that they should not
fall away so soon.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since now we understand the
general object which God had in view, it will be well briefly to consider the
words He employs. When it is said to Moses, "Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,"
first of all the condition of the human race is stated, that Moses may not think
it hard to depart from the world like all others, since he was born to this end.
At the same time, the difference is indicated between the death of men and of
the brute animals. Hence the best consolation is derived, for, if our death were
total annihilation, we should not be said to sleep with our
fathers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Why the Spirit designates idolatry by
the name of "whoring," we have seen elsewhere, as also why he calls all false
gods "strange," or "of the <i>strangers," </i>viz., because, as God chose to be
served alone in Israel, so he had distinguished Himself by this title, that He
was "the God of Israel." It is stated in aggravation of their crime, that they
would not only be led away into the superstitions which they<i> </i>had learnt
in Egypt, but would also pollute themselves with the defilements of Canaan, from
which God had willed that it should be purged by their hand. These words, then,
are to be read emphatically, The people shall go a whoring after the gods of the
land whither they go, and indeed in the midst of it; for it was far more
disgraceful to embrace those false gods, of which they were the conquerors and
judges, than to invent for themselves fresh
idols.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Another aggravation of their crime is,
also added, that they would desert the God by whom they had been adopted as
children, and wickedly depart from His covenant. For they could not pretend
ignorance, when they had been again and again so clearly and solemnly warned.
Meanwhile let us learn from this passage, that whosoever turn away to
superstitious worships are covenant breakers, and thus, that all their pretenses
are vain, who profess that they worship the supreme God together with
idols.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then my anger shall be
kindled against them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this
denunciation of punishment, God undoubtedly desired to put a restraint upon the
senselessness of the people; but since this was done without their profiting by
it, there was another advantage in this lesson, viz., that, after having been
seriously chastised according to their deserts, they should at length repent
though it might be late. Otherwise these punishments would have been inflicted
in vain; and it would have never suggested itself to their minds that they
received the just recompense of their ingratitude and perfidiousness. This is
indeed the first step of prudence, voluntarily to choose that which is right;
but the second is to beware, when we have listened to admonition, and to make a
stand against evil. But, if our minds are so blinded, that reproofs and threats
profit us nothing, there is still a third, i.e.,<i> </i>that those who have been
careless in prosperity should at length begin to perceive that they are smitten
by God's hand, and thus be driven to acknowledge<i> </i>their guilt. Although,
therefore, the simple admonition, as long as it was not followed by its
consequences, was despised by the Israelites; still, when they were further
instructed by its result, and by experience, it produced its fruit; and the same
is daily the case with ourselves. There is scarcely one in ten of the godly,
who, as long as God postpones His punishments, anticipates His judgment, but
those who are aroused from their torpor, seriously consider the threats which
they had hitherto passed over with indifference, and, being brought under
conviction, condemn themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ypa</font><font face="Palatino">,

<i>wrath</i>; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for the expression is more appropriate; and then he sets forth the effect of
His wrath, viz., that, being deprived of His aid, they shall be overtaken by all
sorts of evils, until they are consumed and perish. Moreover, He affirms that
they should be brought into such straits as should extort from them the
confession, that the miseries which they suffered were tokens of God's
alienation from them. But He adds, that He would not then listen to their
prayers. Hence are we taught that, as our happiness depends on God's paternal
favor, so there is nothing worse for us than to be forsaken by Him, as if He
regarded us with no further care; and the lesson we are to learn is, that there
is nothing more desirable for us than that He should honor us with His
countenance. We read respecting all His creatures, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A429&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:29, that they <i>are troubled </i>when He <i>hides His face; </i>but here it
is more clearly perceived that nothing can be imagined more miserable than we
are, when "our iniquities have separated between us and our God, and our sins
have hid his face from us, that he will not hear," as Isaiah says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
59:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have already stated, that the greatness
of their miseries is expressed, when the people shall confess that they are thus
grievously afflicted, because God is departed from them; for it was by no light
punishments that they would be brought to this state of feeling, especially
considering their great hardness of heart and blind obstinacy. It follows then,
that severe punishments are indicated, that should compel them, though
unwillingly, to reflect on God's anger, which they had previously taken no
account of. Still, this confession is not referred to as the fruit or sign of
sincere repentance; for, if the sinner sincerely flies to God, God will be sure
to meet him, since he is inclined to mercy. But in this place He declares that
He will not be favorable to them, but will suffer them to pine away in their
wretchedness, for God says of Himself that He will "hide<i> </i>His face from
them," in the 18th verse, with a deeper meaning than just before, in that He
will take no notice of their groans and lamentations, and by the very
continuance of their punishments will show how greatly wroth with them He
is.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>

words in vain into their deaf ears? Thus do proud and profane men mock at this
mode of dealing with them, as if God, throwing away His labor, were deluding
unhappy men. We must bear in mind, however, that the preaching of the word,
although it is a savior of death to them that perish, is still a sacrifice of
sweet savior to God; nor is it to be considered thrown away and ineffectual,
when it convicts the ungodly more and more, and renders them altogether
inexcusable. And God expressly declares that this would be the use of the song
as "a witness" against those, from whose mouth it should proceed. To some,
indeed, it was profitable unto salvation; for, when subdued by chastisement,
they at length learnt from it that their iniquities were the source and cause of
all their evils. For, however God may redouble the blows of His scourges,
unbelievers, who are without instruction, reap no advantage from them. Thus,
this song was the means of assisting the elect to seek after repentance, when
they were smitten by the hand of God. Still, although the word of God should do
nothing more than condemn its hearers to death, yet it would be enough that it
was a sweet savor to Himself. It seems by no means accordant with our reason
that God should have given this command to
Isaiah;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Go, and tell this people,
Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make
the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes,
lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
their heart, and convert, and be healed,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when I shall have brought
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In other words, God again enlarges
upon the atrociousness of their iniquity, in that, when He had dealt liberally
with the Israelites, they would turn His benefits into occasions of perversity,
since nothing can be more base than such ingratitude, he says, then, that He
will perform to them, unworthy as they are, that which he has sworn, so that He
might thus be faithful to His promises. He commends the fertility of the land,
since this striking pledge of His indulgence should have attracted them by its
sweetness to love so beneficent a Father in return. Hence, therefore, the
perverseness of their nature is demonstrated, inasmuch as, when full, they would
kick against Him, like horses which become intractable from high feeding. But,
after having complained of their future rebellion, He again says, that when they
shall have been brought into sore straits, and overwhelmed with miseries, this
song would be "as<i> </i>a witness," as if they should proclaim in it their own
condemnation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When He says that He knew their

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rxy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yetzer, </i>which is equivalent to figment, or imagination, and includes all
the thoughts and feelings,) it is apparent that He was by no means unaware how
in He was bestowing His benefits upon such unworthy persons, but that He thus
contended with their unworthiness, in order that His goodness might be the more
conspicuous; and also that He desired this instruction to be set before them,
ungodly and hopeless as they were, which He knew they would despise, so as to
render them all the more inexcusable by this test. But it may be objected, Why
then did He not turn their hearts to better things? for thus do ungodly railers
allow themselves to dispute with Him; but let us rather reflect on the words of
Paul, "Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Hath not the
potter power over the clay, to make" of it vessels according to his own will?

clauses are to be taken connectedly, that God foresees that nothing else is to
be expected from them, but that they would be carried away into sin by their
unbridled lust; and secondly, that it had already been sufficiently manifested
by their many iniquities how desperate was their
obstinacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he gave Joshua the son of
Nul, a charge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The more difficult was
the task of Joshua, the more needful was it that he should be encouraged to
exert himself, and to beware of failure. For this reason his charge is repeated,
although in his person all the others were at the same time confirmed. Moses
grounds it on the promise of God, which has been so often mentioned; and says
that Joshua had been chosen to complete the work of deliverance already begun;
for it was hardly credible that the disciple should be not only superior to his
master, but that a man of humble position should be elevated to the dignity from
which the sovereign Prophet, and God's chief minister, had been degraded, unless
this was done by the decree and ordinance of God. At the same time, however, he
makes him more confident of the result of his calling, by promising him that
God, who was the mover of this expedition, would be with him; for He has the
power to accomplish every work to which He has appointed any one of
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass, when
Moses had made an end.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By "the<i>
</i>words of this law," we must understand not only those which are embraced in
this book, but in the other three also; and there is an implied antithesis
between the two tables written by God's hand, and the exposition which was
afterwards added, lest there should be any obscurity respecting God's will on
account of the brevity with which it was delivered. At the very beginning,
indeed, God had set forth whatever it was useful for them to know, but it was
His will that what He had briefly comprehended in the Decalogue should be more
fully unfolded, and not only so, but that it should be also committed to
writing, lest it should be forgotten. We know how inclined to vanity is the mind
of man, nay, how willfully it is led away into error by its levity; whilst it
has other faults also, such as inquisitiveness, and audacity in invention, and
the love of novelty. Thus religion would have been corrupted in a thousand ways,
had not its rule been diligently written down for posterity. Moreover, since the
books of Moses were for a long time buried through the carelessness of the
people and the priests, what darkness of error would have overspread the minds
of all, if nothing had been written down! </font><br><font face="Palatino">Since
the two Tables were enclosed in the Ark of the Covenant, a place at the side was
assigned to the interpretation, so that they might have no doubt but that it
proceeded from the same Divine Author; and, since<i> </i>the Decalogue is
repeated in these books, it was not at all necessary that the Ark should be
opened; which was not lawful, because they might seek in the books of Moses the
instruction which was hidden in the Tables. This, indeed, we must remember, that
the volume was placed near the Ark in token of its dignity, so that, when it was
taken from thence by the Levites, it might be listened to with greater
reverence. When it is said, "That it may be there for a witness against thee,"
this is not addressed to the Levites alone, but relates generally to the whole
people, though the general statement is directed to them as one member of the
whole body. But further, although the application of its doctrine is manifold,
still one point only is adverted to; for the Law was not written with the single
object of being a witness to condemn the people, but to be the rule of a pious
and holy life, and a testimony of God's favor. But, since he had to do with hard
and proud minds, Moses declares that, whenever its doctrine shall be set forth,
it will render their perverseness
inexcusable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I know thy
rebellion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reason is given why he
passed over the utility of his doctrine, and only cited it as a witness against
the Israelites in terms of severity and reproach, viz., because he had found
them by experience to be of a "stiff<i> </i>neck," (of which expression I have
spoken elsewhere,) and has no confidence that they will be more tractable
hereafter. He argues from the less to the greater; for, if, while such a leader
as theirs was alive, they were rebellious, they were likely to assume greater
audacity when he was dead. For we know of what avail is the authority of a great
and excellent person to restrain the licentiousness of a people. At the same
time, Moses does not arrogate so much to himself as to say that the good
condition of the people depended upon his presence, but, pointing out their
danger, he seeks to render them more obedient after his
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gather to me all the elders of
your tribes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Special reference is here
made to the Song, which we gather from the last verse to have been alone
recited. Moses, indeed, appears to contradict himself when he commands the
elders and officers only to be called to listen, whereas he soon afterwards
records that he read it to the whole people. But these two things are easily
reconciled, when we remember the order which he was accustomed to observe in
gathering the multitude together; for it is manifest from many passages that
they were not called together promiscuously, but that the heads of tribes, and
the princes of the people, each of them led their band; so that the assembling
of the elders here mentioned, is so far from excluding the rest of the
multitude, that it rather indicates that the whole people were gathered together
by their tribes and classes. And this we may infer from the context, for
assuredly he did not "call heaven and earth to record against" the officers
only; and yet so he seems to signify. Under the leaders, therefore, the whole
multitude is included.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">The Song of
Moses</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was the perverse nature of the people which
extorted from Moses that unmixed bitterness with which he again addresses them.
Doubtless he would have desired to leave a pleasing and joyful recollection of
himself, and therefore would willingly have exhorted them to the performance of
their duties, either with blandness, or at any rate with placidity, but their
stubbornness compelled him to testify his indignation in the severity of his
address. Besides, he does not judge from conjecture what they would do, but
expressly declares that he knew it for certain, unquestionably because the
Spirit, in dictating the Song, had also informed him of it. He indicates their
revolt by two words, <i>corrupting, </i>and <i>turning aside from the way;
</i>but, inasmuch as in the first there is an ellipsis, for the active verb is
used without any word for it to govern, some supply "the way of the Lord." I
have, however, followed a different reading, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f245</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which seems more correct, for the signification of the word is rather passive
than transitive. He points out the manner of their corruption, declaring that
they will depart from the way which they had learned; for this was their perfect
soundness, to obey God, and to follow the way which he showed them. By forsaking
the Law, then, they were corrupted. Moreover, Moses indirectly reproves their
ingratitude, inasmuch as he had thrown away his labor upon such despisers of
pious instruction. Thus he desires that this song should be recited by them, in
order that, when afflicted and half-consumed by miseries, they might at last
learn that God is a just avenger. And the advantage of this assurance was, that
those, whose state was not altogether desperate, should at length return to
their senses; whilst the reprobate should be more and more
condemned.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have elsewhere seen what it is to

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give ear, O ye
heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses commences in a strain of
magnificence, lest the people should disdain this song with their usual pride,
or even reject it altogether, being exasperated by its severe censures and
reproaches. For we well know how the world naturally longs to be <i>flattered,
</i>and that no strain can be gratifying to it unless it tickles and soothes the
ear with praise. But Moses here not only inveighs bitterly against the vices of
the people, but with the utmost possible vehemence stigmatizes their perverse
nature, their utterly corrupt morals, their obstinate ingratitude, and
incorrigible contumacy. Moreover, he desired that these accusations, whereby he
rendered their name detestable, should daily echo<i> </i>from their tongues; and
thus they became still more offensive. It was, therefore, requisite that their
impatience should be bridled, as it were, in order that they might patiently and
humbly receive these just reproofs, however severe they might be. If,
therefore,<i> </i>they should repudiate this song, or should turn a deaf ear to
it, he declares at the outset that heaven and earth would be witnesses of their
prodigious obtuseness; nay, he turns and addresses himself to heaven<i> </i>and
earth, and thus signifies that it was worthy of the attention of all creatures,
even although they were without intelligence or feeling. For it is a
hyperbolical mode of expression, when he assigns the faculty of hearing, and
being instructed, to the senseless elements; just as Isaiah, when he would
intimate that he found none to give heed to him amongst the whole people, in
like manner appeals to the heavens and the earth, and even summons them to bear
witness to the prodigious iniquity, that there should be less of intelligence
amongst the whole people than in oxen and asses.

which is actually imparted to it by the Holy Spirit, than asks for it to be

have been by no means seasonable. He therefore compares his speech to rain or
dew, as if he had said that, if only the people were like the soil in a state of
softness and preparation, he would deliver doctrine to them which would irrigate
them unto abundant fruitfulness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although this
expression refers especially, and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat  j

men fruitful in good works, just as, by instilling succulency and vigor into the
earth by means of rain, He makes it fertile for the production of fruit. But,
like the rocks and stones, which imbibe no moisture from the most abundant
rains, so many are hindered by their own perversity from being fertilized by
spiritual irrigation. Wherefore Moses indirectly throws the blame upon the
Israelites, if the doctrine of this Song should drop upon them in

words that, if there were any spark of piety in the Israelites, it must be
manifested by their welcoming this address, wherein the majesty of God shines
forth. The first clause of the verse, therefore, stands last in order, since it
is an assignment of a reason for the other. For when he exhorts them that they
should ascribe to God the glory He deserves, he inculcates upon them obedience
and attention, as if he had said that, unless they reverently submit themselves
to his teaching, God would be defrauded of this due honor; and this he confirms
by adding as a reason that he will sincerely and faithfully publish the name of
God. For the word <i>invoke</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f250</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is not used here as in many other passages, but is equivalent to making a
profession of God. Moses, then, declares himself to be His proclaimer, in order
that, under cover of His most Holy name, he may awaken attention to his
words.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> ...<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His work is
perfect.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those who take these
expressions generally, and without particular reference to this passage, not
only obscure their meaning, but also lessen the force of the doctrine they
contain. Let us, then, understand that the perfection of God's works, the
rectitude of His ways, etc., are contrasted with the rebellion of the people;
for if there were anything 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f251</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in God's works imperfect and in arranged, if His mode of dealing were deficient
in rectitude, if His truth were doubtful; if, in a word, there were anything
wanting, then there would have been a natural excuse why the people should have
sought for something better than they found in Him, since the desire of
obtaining that which is best is deserving of no reprehension. Lest, then, the
Israelites should offer any such pretext, Moses anticipates them. Before he
begins to treat of the wicked ingratitude of the people, he lays down this
principle, that they were not induced to transfer their affections elsewhere by
any deficiency in God. The general statement is indeed true in itself, and may
be applied to various purposes; but we must consider what the object of Moses
here is, namely, to remove from the people every pretext for their impious and
perfidious rebellion, and this in order that their amazing folly may be more
apparent, when they forsake the fountain of living waters, and hew them out
cisterns with holes in them, as God himself complains in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:13. We perceive therefore, that every honorable distinction which is here
attributed to God, brands the people with a corresponding mark of ignominy, in
that they had knowingly and voluntarily deprived themselves of the plenitude of
all good things, which might have been enjoyed by them had they not alienated
themselves from God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God's work is spoken of,
not only with reference to the creation of the world, but to the whole course of
His providence; as if it were said that nothing could be discovered in God's
works which could be found fault with.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now this
perfection is not perceptible in every individual thing, for even vermin are
God's creatures; and amongst men some are blind, some lame, some deaf, and
others mutilated in one of their members; and many fruits also never arrive at
maturity. Yet we plainly see that it is foolish and misplaced to bring forward
such questions as these as objections to the perfection of God, here celebrated
by Moses, inasmuch as the very defects and blemishes of our bodies tend to this
object, that God's glory may be made manifest.

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f252</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>conveys a similar truth; for it is well known that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mishphat, </i>is used for <i>rectitude, </i>and <i>works </i>and <i>ways

is a confirmation of the former part, since Moses signifies in both that all who
censure God may be clearly convicted of petulant impiety, since supreme justice
shines forth in all His acts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The words I have
rendered, "God<i> </i>is truth," others construe with the genitive case, "a<i>
</i>God of truth." Either is true, and agreeable to the usage of Scripture; but
the apposition is more emphatic, which declares that God is not only true, but
the Truth itself. At any rate, this applies to the persons who pay entire
allegiance to the word of God, for their expectations shall never be frustrated.
Thus the people are indirectly reproved for their unbelief, in that they
deserted God, whose faithfulness was not only tried and proved, but who is the
very fountain of truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although what follows,
that there is no iniquity in God, seems to some to have but little force, it is
nevertheless of great importance; for we well know how often men are so absurd
in their subterfuges, as in a manner to arraign God instead of themselves; and
although they do not dare to accuse Him openly, still they do not hesitate to
acquit themselves, and thus to cast direct obloquy upon Him. Elsewhere,
therefore, God inquires by His Prophet, "what iniquity <i>the people </i>had
found in Him?"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

their hatred and abuse, as if He dealt unjustly with such sinners.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
18:2,5.) When, therefore, He vindicates Himself from such calumnies, it follows
that no blame attaches itself to Him, but that the wickedness of those who turn
away from Him is abundantly
condemned.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have corrupted
themselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now inveighs
unhesitatingly against the perfidy of the people, and gives loose to the most
unmeasured upbraidings; for if God be just and true, then it was plain enough
that the Israelites were a depraved and perverse nation. This perverse nation,
he says, has corrupted itself towards Him, namely Him, whom he has just lauded
for His perfect justice and faithfulness; and he accuses them of having basely
prostituted to every sort of sin the chastity which they had promised to God.
There is no doubt but that they were sorely wounded by these epithets, and would
have been transported with rage, had they not seen that God's incomparable
servant, when he had now been called upon to die by God's command, spoke as it
were from heaven. The voice, therefore, of the dying man restrained their pride,
so that they did not now dare to oppose him as a mortal; and afterwards, when
the condemnation had been assented to by public authority, and by general
accord, they were less at liberty to vent their madness against it. He
introduces, by way of anticipation, the statement that they were not His
children; for else they might obviously have made the objection that the sacred
race of Abraham, which God had adopted, should be dealt with less reproachfully.
Moses, therefore, declares that they are not children, because they are a
perverse nation. For although their adoption always stood firm, still its
efficacy was restricted to the elect part of them, so that God, without breaking
His covenant, might reject the general body. But to explain the matter more
clearly, it must be borne in mind that the Spirit, on different grounds, at one
time assigns the name of God's children to hypocrites, at another takes it away;
for sometimes it is an aggravation of their criminality, when they are called
the children of Abraham and Jacob as well as of God, an instance of which will
soon occur. Here, however, in order that they may cease to glory without cause,
they are said not to be children, because they are degenerate, and therefore
disinherited by God, so as no longer to retain their honorable position. In this
sense Moses declares that they are not children, as having cast off God from
being their Father. It is added this was done with their spot (or disgrace; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f253</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) unless it be thought preferable to take it that. they were corrupted by their
spots, or by their sins, to which I willingly assent; although I do not reject
the other sense, namely, that their alienation from God had rendered them
ignominious, or that they had <i>contracted </i>the stain of disgrace by their
faithlessness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do ye thus requite the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In order to expose the ingratitude
of the people to greater infamy, he now begins to commemorate the benefits
whereby God had laid them under obligation to Himself: for the more liberally
God deals with us, the more earnest ought to be the piety awakened in our
hearts; nay, His goodness, as soon as we have tasted of it, ought to draw us at
once to Him. Now God, although he has been always bountiful towards the whole
human race,<i> </i>had, in a peculiar manner showered down an immense abundance
of His bounty upon that people; this, then, Moses alleges, and shows how basely
ungrateful they had been. He first expostulates with them interrogatively,
asking them whether this was a fitting return for God's especial blessings; and
then proceeds to enumerate them. He inquires of them, then, whether God was not
their father, from the time when He had honored them with the distinction of His
adoption: and under this single head he comprehends many things, because from
this source proceeded whatever blessings God had conferred upon them. Not,
however, to examine every point with the accuracy it deserves, what more binding
obligation could be imagined than that God should have chosen one nation for
Himself out of the whole world, whose father He should be by special privilege?
For, although all human beings, since they were created in the image of God, are
sometimes called His children, still to be accounted His children was the
special privilege of the sons of Abraham. And, in order to prove that this was
not a natural, but an acquired dignity, Moses immediately afterwards explains in
what way God was their Father: viz., that he purchased, made, and prepared them.
The foundation and origin, then, was the gratuitous good pleasure of God, when
He took them to be His own peculiar people. Elsewhere, indeed, His second
purchase of them is mentioned, when He redeemed them from Egypt; here, however,
Moses goes back farther, viz., to the covenant made with Abraham, whereby they
were separated from other nations, as will presently more clearly appear. I
reject, as not in harmony with the context, the translation which some give of
the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kanah, </i>i.e., <i>to possess.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f254</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">In
the same sense it is added, that they were <i>made by </i>God: which does not.
refer to the general creation, but only to the privilege of adoption, whereby
they became God's new work, and in which another form was imparted to them; in
which sense also He is called their framer, or Maker. Elsewhere, also, when the
Prophet says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Know ye that the Lord he
is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
100:3,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he undoubtedly magnifies that special prerogative,
whereby God had distinguished the sons of Abraham above all other races. For,
since the fall of Adam had brought disgrace upon all his posterity, God restores
those, whom He separates as His own, so that their condition may be better than
that of all other nations. At the same time it must be remarked, that this grace
of renewal is effaced in many who have afterwards profaned it. Consequently the
Church is called God's work and creation, in two senses, i.e.,<i> </i>generally
with respect to its outward calling, and specially with respect to spiritual
regeneration, as far as regards the elect; for the covenant of grace is common
to hypocrites and true believers. On this ground all whom God gathers into His
Church, are indiscriminately said to be renewed and regenerated: but the
internal renovation belongs to believers only; whom Paul, therefore, calls God's
"workmanship, created unto good works, which God hath prepared,"<i> </i>etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:10.) The same is the tendency of the third word, which may, however, be taken
for to "establish;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f255</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
although I have preferred to follow the more received sense, viz, that God had
prepared His people, as the artificer fashions and fits his
work.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember the days of
old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is an explanation of the
preceding verse, for Moses again shows how God had acquired this people, viz.,
because he had chosen to separate them from other nations according to His own
good pleasure. But, since the Israelites might be inflated by their present
superiority, they are reminded of their origin, and Moses commands them not to
consider what they now are, but also from whence they had been taken, and with
this view he says, Remember the old times; ask the elders, etc. For we know how
men, when they do not reflect that whatever they have, proceeded from God, and
is held, as it were, at will, are blinded by their dignity, so as not only to
despise others, but also to exalt themselves against, the Author of all good
things. Moses, in order to subdue this arrogance, says that all peoples were
alike under the hand and power of God, and thus that their diversity was not in
their original nature, but derived from elsewhere, i.e.,<i> </i>from God's free
choice. In the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ljnhb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>behanchel, </i>there is some ambiguity: for some translate it, When the Most
High divided the earth to the nations; and, though I do not reject this, still I
have preferred the meaning more in accordance with the context; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f256</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for Moses says the same thing twice over, and the second clause is the
explanation of the first. He says, therefore, that God <i>distributed </i>the
nations, as an inheritance is divided; and then this is more clearly repeated,
when he mentions the separation of the sons of Adam. When, in the latter part of
the verse, it is said, that He set bounds to the nations according to the number
of the children of Israel, it is commonly explained that He set bounds to the
nations in such sort, that the habitation of the sons of Abraham was secured to
them. Some of the Hebrews take it in a more restricted sense, viz., that in the
distribution of the world, so much was given to the seven nations of Canaan as
should be sufficient for the children of Israel. In my opinion, however, his
meaning is, that in the whole arrangement of the world, the object which God had
in view was to provide for His elect people: for, although His bounty extended
to all, still He had such regard for His own, that, chiefly on their account,
His care also extended to others. The word <i>number </i>is expressly employed;
as if Moses had said, that, however small a portion of the human race the
posterity, of Abraham might be, nevertheless that number was before God's eyes,
when He ordered the state of the whole world; unless it be preferred to take the
word

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f257</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for a <i>ratio</i>;<i> </i>but it will not be unsuitable to the passage to
understand it that this small body was so precious to God, that he arranged the
whole distribution of the world with a view to their welfare. Some refer it to
the calling of the Gentiles, as if Moses had said that the empire of the whole
world was destined to the seed of Abraham, because it was to be propagated
through all the regions of the world; but this is altogether erroneous, for
nothing is here indicated but the distinction, formerly conferred upon one
nation.

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord's portion is his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the main point, that God
was moved by nothing but His own good pleasure to make so much of this people,
who had been derived from a common origin with all others: for when he says,
that Jacob was the portion of Jehovah, and the lot of His inheritance, he does
not mean that there was anything better in them than in others, but he assigns
the reason why God preferred this one nation to the rest of mankind; viz.,
because He took it to Himself as His hereditary portion, which dignity depends
upon His gratuitous election.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He found him in a desert
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the intention of Moses had been
to record all the instances of God's paternal kindness towards the people, he
must have commenced from the time of Abraham; like the prophet who, when
presenting a complete narrative in the Psalm, begins from that original
covenant, which God had made with the fathers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
105:8;) and also introduces the benefits which He had conferred upon them, when
they were but few in number, and strangers in the land, when they went from one
nation to another, yet he suffered no man to do them wrong, and reproved kings
for their sakes.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
105:14.) But Moses, studying brevity, deemed it sufficient to bring forward a
more recent and more notorious blessing; nay, he omits the early part of their
deliverance, and only makes mention of the desert, he says, then, that God
<i>found them in the desert</i>; not because He then first began to take pity
upon them, since they had been previously rescued from the tyranny of Pharaoh by
His marvelous power, and had passed the Red Sea dry-shod, but because it was
profitable for them to have set before their eyes how they had been extricated
from the deep abyss of death, in order that they might more readily acknowledge
this to have been, as it were, the beginning of their life. For what was that
waste and barren desert, in which not a crumb of bread, nor a drop of water was
to be found, but a grave to swallow up a thousand lives? and, therefore, it is
further called "the devastation of horror." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f259</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The suae is, that it was a kind of type of resurrection, not from one death
only, but from innumerable deaths, that the people should have escaped from it
in safety. That they should have done so, even had their march through it been
straight and speedy, could not have been the case without a miracle; but,
inasmuch as they wandered therein for forty years, our minds can hardly
comprehend a hundredth part of the miracles (which followed one upon the other. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f260</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
Thus the word "led about," is not superfluous, for God's power was far more
conspicuous than as if they had flown swiftly through the air. I apply the same
meaning to what follows, "he instructed him;" for some, in my opinion
improperly, refer it to the Law, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f261</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whereas it rather relates to the teaching of experience. For there was manifold,
and no ordinary instruction in all these acts of bounty and punishment, wherein
God, as it were, put forth His hand, and manifested His
glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Two similitudes follow, to express God's
love, mingled with solicitude more than paternal. First, he says, that God no
less anxiously protected them from all injury and annoyance<i> </i>than every
one is wont to protect the pupil of his eye, which is the most tender part of
the body, and against the injury of which the greatest precautions are taken.
And David also, when requesting that he may be kept safe under the special
guardianship of God, uses the same expression.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
17:8.) Secondly, God compares Himself to an eagle, which not only fosters her
young ones under her outspread wings, but also indulgently, and with maternal
tenderness tempts them to fly. It would be unseasonable to enter here into more
subtle philosophical discussions respecting the nature of the eagle. The Jews,
who are wont to trifle hazardously with things they do not understand, have
invented fables respecting this passage, which have no relation to the meaning
of Moses, who unquestionably spoke of the eagle as he might of any other bird.
Nor can it be doubted but that Christ, when He compares Himself to a hen,
desired to express the same sedulous
care.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"How often (he says) would I

here, what Aristotle writes respecting the eagle, I would not stand in his way:
although I do not think Moses had anything in his mind, beyond what the words
naturally express. And, surely that which at once occurs to us ought to be
sufficient for us, viz., that we ought to be ravished with just. admiration of
God's inestimable goodness and indulgence, when He condescends so to stoop to us
as to protect us with His wings, like a bird, and, hovering before us, to
instruct and accustom us to follow Him: in which latter words a more than
maternal anxiety to teach us is
represented.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So the Lord alone did lead

order to take away every pretext from the Israelites, provided they should seek,
according to their custom, to mingle their superstitions with the pure service
of God. For, when they were bringing in, from all quarters, gods of various
nations, this was the excuse they commonly made, that God was not thus despoiled
of His due honor: and hence it came to pass, that they permitted themselves to
heap together a multitude of false gods, whom they worshipped as their patrons.
But Moses anticipates them, and declares that God, as having no need of external
aid, had not associated with Himself any strange gods in His preservation of the
people. Hence it follows, that whatever gods the people introduced, they
transferred to them the honor due to the one true God. Let us then learn from
this passage, that, unless God be served without a rival, religion is altogether
perverted by the impious admixture.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

lambs," he undoubtedly means the plumpness of their flesh, because it was not
lawful to eat their actual fat; but it is not unusual to denote by this word any
kind of richness, as soon afterwards he calls the best meal or flour, from which
the more delicate kind of bread was made, "the fat of wheat." With respect to
the wine, he magnifies God's liberality by the use of a poetic figure, when he
says they <i>drank of the blood of the grape. </i>There is no doubt but that he
alludes to its color; yet he takes occasion to extol more highly the
<i>beneficence </i>of God, by intimating that, when the juice of the grapes is
expressed, it is just as if their blood flowed forth for the nutriment of men.

the people, because when filled with delicacies, they began to wax wanton
against God; for, according to the vulgar proverb, satiety breeds violence; but
this arises from men's detestable depravity, who ought rather to be inclined to
humility and gentleness by the loving-kindness of God, since the more abundantly
He supplies us with food, the more does He invite us to show forth the affection
that becomes children, inasmuch as He thus more closely and familiarly declares
Himself to be our Father. Intolerable, then, is the impiety of profane persons,
who increase in insolence against Him, when they have gorged themselves with an
abundance of all good things. They are here compared to restive horses, which,
if they are well fed, without exercise, kick<i> </i>under their rider, and are
rendered almost intractable. By using the word "upright"<i> </i>for Israel, he
ironically taunts them with having departed from rectitude, and, reminding them
of the high dignity conferred upon them, more severely reproves their sin of
unfaithfulness. For elsewhere 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f265</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Israel is honored with the same title without any evil imputation in respect to
their calling; but here Moses reproachfully shows them how far they had departed
from the pursuit of that piety, to the cultivation of which they had been
called.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They provoked him to
jealousy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is only figuratively that
jealousy is attributed to God, who is free from all passions; but, since men
never sufficiently reflect<i> </i>how great pollution they contract by their
idolatries, it is necessary that the grossness of the sin should <i>be
</i>expressed in such terms as this, implying that men do no less injury to God,
when they transfer to others the honor due to Him, and that the offense<i>
</i>is no lighter than as if a licentious woman should provoke her husband's
mind to jealousy, and inflict a wound upon him by running after adulterers. This
jealousy has reference<i> </i>to the sacred and spiritual marriage, whereby God
had bound His people to Himself. The suae is, that the Israelites were as
insulting to God by their superstitions as if they had designedly provoked
Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse an amplification follows,
viz., that they had transferred to devils the worship due to God alone. By the
general consent of all nations God ought to be worshipped by sacrifices; for,
although the Gentiles invented for themselves divers gods, still the persuasion
continued to prevail, that this service was the peculiar prerogative of Deity.
Nothing, then, could be more disgraceful or detestable than to rob God of His
honor, and to offer it to demons. This, indeed, would never have been admitted
by the Israelites, inasmuch as they pretended that their minor gods were their
advocates with the supreme and only Creator of the world, and did not hesitate
to account as rendered to Him whatever they shared among their idols. Here,
however, He first of all repudiates all such mixtures whereby His holy name is
unworthily profaned, and suffers Himself not to be associated with idols; and,
secondly, by whatever titles they may dignify their idols, He declares all false
gods to be demons. Hence it follows that the sacrifices made to them are
infected with sacrilege. Both of these points are worthy of careful remark,
viz., that God abominates all corruptions of His service; and also, that
whatever names the world may invent for its gods, they are so many masks, under
which the devil hides himself for the deception of the
simple.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, Moses reproves the folly of
the Israelites in having promiscuously devoted themselves to unknown gods; just
as an adulterous woman might prostitute herself indiscriminately to all comers.
When he says that they came <i>from near</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f266</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it has reference to time, and is equivalent to saying that they had lately
sprung up. Thirdly, it is said, that these gods were not honored by their
fathers; for thus their perverse love of novelty is proved against them,
inasmuch as they had not been even led by imitation of their fathers, but in
their restless innovation had procured for themselves new and unwonted gods. Not
that the law of piety is founded on antiquity alone, as if it were sufficient to
follow the customs handed down by our ancestors; for thus any of the religions
of the Gentiles might be proved true, but because the genuine and faithful
tradition of their<i> </i>fathers would be the sure and approved rule for the
worship of God. For Moses assumes a higher principle, viz., that their fathers
were truly and most unmistakably instructed who was the one and only God, in
whom alone they ought to trust. Yet a distinction is here to be drawn between
these holy fathers and the reprobate; for the imitation of their fathers, which
here seems to be deemed praiseworthy, is elsewhere severely condemned, because
the Jews were carried away, without discrimination, after the bad examples of
their fathers. Moses, therefore, here refers to no other fathers than those who
were in a position to hand down what they had learned from God Himself. The word
<i>fear </i>often comprises, by synecdoche, the whole service of God, and
sometimes is applied to outward ceremonies: the word

mentioned here, has reference to His forbearance in judgment: as if it were
said, that He does not act hastily, and is not alienated from His children,
without having duly weighed their case; in the same way as it is said elsewhere:
"Because<i> </i>the cry of Sodom is great, I will go down now and see
whether"<i> </i>it is so, and "I will know."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
18:20, 21) Assuredly God has no need to make any examination, since nothing
escapes His eyes, however hidden it may be; but this going down and inquiring is
contrasted with preposterous haste. Thus in this passage Moses shows that God
was wroth, when he saw His sons and His daughters drawn away so faithlessly
after their idols. Again, when he calls them God's children, he does not judge
them to be so on account of their merits, but in reference to God's adoption,
which, although it was canceled as regarded themselves, still had the effect of
aggravating the guilt of their ingratitude. And for the same reason that he had
just. said that God <i>saw </i>them, Moses introduces Him deliberating, as it
were, that the time for punishing them might be perceived to be fully come. But
we must notice the degrees; for God does not at once break forth into extreme
severity, but is said to <i>hide His face, </i>that He might secretly consider
what they would do: since this is a middle course between the manifest
exhibition of His grace and favor, and the tokens of His wrath. God is, indeed,
elsewhere said, in many passages, to hide His face, when He rejects men's
prayers, and withdraws His aid; but here He assumes the character of a man who,
when he sees that he produces no effect by acting, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f269</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
goes aside to some place, from whence he may quietly contemplate the result, And
thus God's weariness of them is expressed; for when He at length saw that His
efforts to control them were thrown away, He abandoned the care of them. It is a
false inference, which some draw from hence, that men, when forsaken by God,
recover themselves by the exercise of their own free-will; as if God sat calmly
and inactively in a watch-tower expecting what they may do; inasmuch as this
<i>hiding </i>of Himself has reference only to the outward manifestation of His
grace. In a word, it is a similitude taken from the conduct of men, whereby God
signifies that He is overcome with weariness, and will no more be the leader and
guardian of the people, until it shall effectually appear that they are
altogether intractable. And this is gathered from the reason, which is presently
added, wherein He censures their forward nature and want of faith, as much as to
say, that, after long trial, nothing remained for Him but to abandon
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have moved me to
jealousy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now proceeds further, viz.,
that God, after having withdrawn Himself for a time, would, at length be the
open enemy of the people, so as to repay them in kind. And he points out the
mode of this retaliation, that as they had insultingly brought into antagonism
with God empty phantoms and vanities, so on His part, He would exalt against
them barbarous and worthless nations. This similitude is also taken from jealous
husbands, who, when they perceive themselves to be despised by their adulterous
wives, avenge themselves by their own amours. Why God should attribute to
Himself the feeling of jealousy has been explained under the Second Commandment;
Moses now only shows that it would be a most equitable mode of revenge, that God
should insult, by means of despised and ignoble nations, those apostates, who
had made to themselves idols in disparagement of
Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The fulfillment of this sentence was
manifested from time to time, when they were tyrannically oppressed by the
neighboring nations. It is true, indeed, that the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and
the Chaldeans were included among those people of nought and foolish nations,
although they were preeminent in power and wealth, and famous for other splendid
endowments; but it is no matter of surprise that, in comparison with that
dignity which God had conferred upon the Israelites, all other nations should be
accounted but refuse. The suae is, that God's vengeance was ready whereby He
would punish the vanities of His people, inasmuch as He could create out of
nothing the enemies by whom they should be reduced to nothing. There is much
elegance in the allusion of Paul, in which he extends this sentence further,
inasmuch as, when God introduced the Gentiles into His Church, He stirred up the
Jews to jealousy, in order that they might be led to repentance by a sense of
their ignominy. Surely the calling of the Gentiles was exactly as if He created
shadows, whom he might prefer to His reprobate people.

penetrate to the deepest abysses, and should utterly consume their land, so as
not to spare the very roots of the mountains. This metaphor is, indeed, of
frequent occurrence; but here more is expressed by it than in other passages. In
the same sense also it is presently added, that God would spend all his scourges

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be burnt with

particular modes of punishment, not, indeed, to enumerate them all, but only to
adduce such specimens of them as to inspire the people with greater terror,
inasmuch as mere generalities would not have sufficiently affected them. He
mentions three especial scourges, pestilence, famine, and the sword, on which
the prophets constantly dilate, when their object was to apply the Law to the
actual use of the people, from whence it arose that they familiarly employ many
of the expressions used by Moses. He introduces indeed other punishments, which
the prophets also mention; but the sum of what he says is this, that the
Israelites should feel that God was armed with all the punishments which were
only too well known by experience, and by them would utterly destroy
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First., he says, that they should be dried
up, or rather roasted with hunger.

<i>beasts </i>and <i>serpents, </i>so that on the one hand, open violence should
assail them, and, on the other, secret wiles. Amos has also imitated this
figure:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The day of the Lord (he
says) is darkness and not light: as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met
him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit

adds another evil, viz., <i>terror</i>:<i> </i>and this is, indeed, an
aggravation worse than death itself, when we tremble within with terror, for it
would be better to be slain ten times over bravely fighting in battle, than to
be consumed with constant fear, as by a lingering death. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f272</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Let
us learn, then, from this passage, that, whatever perils surround us, and
whatever adversities, they are God's weapons, and that they do not occur by
chance to this or that person, but are directed by His hand. Thus it is the case
that He not; only stirs up enemies against us, but fierce and noisome beasts
also; that He shuts up the heaven and the earth; that He infects the atmosphere
with deadly disease; that, in a word, he draws forth from all the elements
manifold means of destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But if it be the
fact, that the godly are involved in similar punishments, since they suffer from
hunger and want, and are not exempt from any evil; for even Paul acknowledges
that he had himself experienced what God here denounces against those that
wickedly despise Him, for he says that he was <i>troubled without </i>with
<i>fightings, </i>and <i>within </i>with<i> fears,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:5;) we must bear in mind that all adversities are in themselves
signs of God's wrath, since they derive their origin from sin; but that through
God's marvelous provision it comes to pass, that to believers they are exercises
of their faith and proofs of their patience. Hence we often see God's children
afflicted in common with the ungodly, but to a different end; though
nevertheless all adversities are proofs of God's wrath against the reprobate. On
this point I have spoken at greater length in treating of the curses of the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I said, I would scatter
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God again represents Himself in
the character of a man, as if He were meditating opposite determinations, and
restrained His vehemence in consideration of the impediments He encountered.
What it amounts to, however, is this, that God suspended His final judgment upon
them for no other reason but because He had regard to His own glory, which would
else have been subjected to the taunts of the Gentiles. Hence the Jews were
reminded that, whereas they had deserved certain destruction, they were
preserved on no other grounds but because God was unwilling to give the reins to
the insolence of the Gentiles. The expression <i>wrath, </i>is here used for
arrogant boasting, because in their prosperity ungodly and profane men burst
forth into cruelty; unless it be preferred to render it simply
<i>irritation,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f273</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in which sense it is used in 2 Kings 23. Immediately afterwards it is
explained, "lest the adversaries should behave themselves strangely."
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rkn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nacar, </i>signifies sometimes to be strange, sometimes to put on a different
face, sometimes to acknowledge. Thus I do not doubt but that Moses meant to
express the arrogance of those who in a manner transform themselves that they
may dazzle the eyes of the simple by their pomp and empty exaltation. If any
approve of a different sense, i.e.,<i> </i>lest they should separate themselves
from God, and arrogate to themselves what belongs to Him alone, I make no
objection: and this, indeed, seems to agree with what follows, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f274</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"Our high hand, and not the Lord, has done this:" for when men indulge in such
unbridled license, they go so far astray as to have nothing in common with God.
Thus the judgment of God, which should have been conspicuous in these
punishments, would have been put out of sight, when the enemies appropriated to
themselves the glory of the people's destruction. Nevertheless the ungodly did
not cease to pride themselves on their victories, (as God complains by Isaiah,
and Habakkuk confirms;) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f275</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

some remnants of the elect people preserved. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f276</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">It
is only figuratively that God says, he feared this insolence, which He might
have easily remedied and restrained: but I have already stated, that He speaks
after the manner of men, to show the Israelites that they escaped rather on
account of their enemies, than by their own merits. The question, however,
arises, how such a consultation as this could have taken place after God had
determined to <i>consume </i>them with the fire of His wrath; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f277</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I reply, that the <i>consump</i>tion there indicated was not such as totally to
annihilate the nation, so that no ruins should remain as witnesses of their
former state; whereas He now speaks of the destruction, which should altogether
blot out the name of the nation, as if it had never been chosen by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they are a nation void of

had almost blotted out altogether the memory of the people, viz., because their
faculty was incurable: for He does not merely indicate that their conduct was
rash and inconsiderate, because they lacked reason mid discretion: but that they
could be by no means brought to their senses, and, in fact, that not one drop of
sagacity existed in them. The proof of this immediately follows, viz., that the
tokens of God's wrath were too clearly set before their eyes to escape their
notice, unless they were utterly blind and stupid. The word

be properly translated, "Oh<i>, </i>if they understood,"

</i>their exceeding stupidity is censured: since not even by many and long
experiences were they aroused to reflect on the causes of their calamities;
whereas length of time extorts some sense at last from the very dullest, and
almost idiotic persons. It was, therefore, a sign of desperate stupidity that
they were still without understanding after so many years; as if by experience
itself they had grown callous, when they ought to have shaken off their
lethargy, and to have bestirred themselves to earnest inquiry. Justly, then,
does Moses reproach them with not having considered even at the latter end; for
not once only, nor in a single year, but by constant inflictions of punishment
during a long series of years, had they been instructed without
profit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How should one chase a
thousand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Of all the many tokens of
God's wrath, he selects one which was peculiarly striking; for as long as God
was on their side, they had put to flight mighty armies, nor had they been
supported by any multitude of forces. Now, when, though in great numbers, they
are conquered by a few, this change plainly shows that they are deprived of
God's aid, especially when a thousand, who were wont before, with a little band,
to rout the greatest armies, gave way before ten men. Moses, therefore, condemns
the stupidity of the people, in that it does not occur to their minds that they
are rejected by God, when they are so easily overcome by a few enemies, whom
they far exceed in numbers. Moses, however, goes still further, and says, that
they were <i>sold </i>and <i>betrayed</i>; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f279</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>inasmuch as God, having so often found them to be unworthy of His aid, not
only deserted them, but made them subject to heathen nations, and, as it were,
sold them to be their slaves. This threat is often repeated by the prophets: and
Isaiah, desiring to awake in them a hope of deliverance, tells them that God
would redeem the people whom He had sold. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f280</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But, in case any should object that it was no matter of wonder, if the uncertain
chance of war should confer on others the victory which often, as a profane poet
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"Hovers</i>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f281</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moses anticipates the objection by declaring that,
unless the people should be deprived of God's aid, they could not be otherwise
than successful. A comparison is therefore instituted between the true God and
false gods: as though Moses had said that, where the God of hosts presides, the
issue of war can never be doubtful. Hence it follows, that God's elect and
peculiar people are exempted from the ordinary condition of nations, except in
so far as it deserves to be rejected on the score of its ingratitude. He calls
the unbelievers themselves to be the arbiters and witnesses of this, inasmuch as
they had often experienced the formidable power of God, and knew assuredly that
the God of Israel was unlike their idols. It is, then, just as if he had said,
that this was conspicuous even to the blind, or were to cite as witnesses those
who are blessed with no light from on high. In thus inviting unbelievers to be
judges, it is not as if he supposed that they would pronounce what was true, and
thoroughly understood by them, but because they must needs be convinced by
experience: for, if any one had asked the heathen whether the supreme government
and power of heaven and earth were in the hands of the One God of Israel, they
never would have confessed that their idols were mere vanity. Still, however
malignantly they might detract from God's glory, Moses does not hesitate to
boast, even themselves being judges, that God had magnificently exerted His
unconquered might; although he refers rather to the experience<i> </i>of facts
themselves, than to their feelings. Other commentators extract a different
meaning, viz., that although unbelievers might be victorious, still God remained
unaffected by it: neither was his arm broken, because he permitted them to
afflict the apostate Israelites: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f282</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the former exposition, however, is the more appropriate
one.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For their vine is of the vine of
Sodom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I think it was far from the
intention of Moses, as some make it to be, to refer to the punishment which the
Israelites deserved; but that he rather inveighs against their corrupted morals,
and obstinate disposition. But metaphorically he calls them an offshoot from the
vine of Sodom and Gomorrah, inasmuch as they resemble in their nature both those
nations, as much as if they had sprung from them, just as grafts of the vine
produce fruits similar to the stocks from which they are taken. God complains by
Isaiah that, when he looked for good and sweet grapes from His vineyard,
<i>it</i> <i>brought forth wild grapes.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:22;) but Moses goes further here, that the people was not merely a degenerate
vine, bun poisonous, and producing nothing but what was deadly; and therefore he
adds, not only that <i>their clusters </i>were <i>bitter, </i>but that their
wine was <i>the poison of dragons and asps; </i>whereby he signifies that
nothing worse or more abominable than that nation could be
imagined.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not this laid up in store
with me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although some explain this
verse as relating to their punishments, as if God asserted that various kinds of
them were laid up with Him, which He could produce whenever He pleased, it is
more correct to understand it of their crimes. We are well aware that the
ungodly, when God stays His severity, promise themselves impunity, as if His
forbearance were a kind of connivance. Unless, therefore, He straightway lifts
up His hand to chastise them, they imagine that all recollection of their crimes
has vanished from before Him; and consequently the prophets often remind
hypocrites of the day of visitation, in order that they may not suppose that
they have gained anything by the delay. For this reason Jeremiah says
that</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Moses employs a different figure, that, although God
may not appear as an immediate avenger, still their sins are stored up in his
treasures, and will be brought to light by Him at the fitting season. Hence we
gather the profitable lesson, that although God may make as though He saw not
<i>(dissimulet) </i>for a time, still He does not forget the iniquities, the
memory of which wretched men foolishly imagine to be blotted out, unless they
are pursued by God's immediate
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To me belongeth
vengeance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage is quoted to
different purposes by Paul, and by the author 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f283</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:19;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581030&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:30;) for Paul, with a view of persuading believers to bear injuries
patiently, admonishes them to "give place unto wrath," inasmuch as God declares
vengeance to be His; but the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, proclaiming
that God will be the avenger of impiety, confirms his declaration by this
testimony. Hence it is that part of the commentators suppose that punishment is
here denounced against heathen nations because they have cruelly afflicted God's
elect people. And, indeed, this appears to be the meaning of Paul's words, that
injuries should be patiently endured, since God claims for Himself the office of
Avenger; but there is nothing to prevent the same statement from being
accommodated to different uses, and therefore Paul did not irrelevantly confirm
his exhortation by this saying of Moses, although it literally refers to the
internal chastisements of the Church. Besides, the apostles are not in the habit
of quoting every word from the testimonies which they adduce, but briefly remind
their readers to examine more closely the passages quoted. But, since God here
joins the two things together, that He will punish the sins of His people, and
at the same time be the avenger of their oppressions, there will be nothing
absurd in saying that Paul, as it were, points his finger at this passage; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f284</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
still, the simple explanation will be, that the general declaration is
accommodated to a special case, in order that believers should bear their
injuries patiently, and leave to God the office which He pronounces to appertain
to Himself. In my judgment, indeed, these words are connected with the preceding
verse; for God pertinently confirms His statement, that he takes account of the
number of men's sins, and has them stored among His treasures, by adding that
the power and office of judging rests with Himself; inasmuch as these two things
are contrary to each other, that He should be cognizant of whatever is done
unrighteously and amiss, and still leave it unpunished. Not that it is opposed
to God's justice to pardon sinners when they repent, but because this principle
always continues firm, that God is the judge of the world, for the punishment of
all iniquities. Thus the confidence of hypocrites is destroyed, who flatter
themselves with the hope of impunity, unless they are overtaken by immediate
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The clause which follows some
interpreters pervert by supplying the relative, "in the time in <i>which
</i>their foot shall slide;"<i> </i>whereas Moses simply concludes<i> </i>that
they will fall in their due time, or that, although they may think they stand,
their ruin or fall was not far off; and this is further confirmed by what he
adds, viz., that their day of calamity was at hand. This statement, as I have
before said, often occurs in the Prophets, that there is with God a fit time, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f285</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in which to punish the sins which He has appeared to overlook, and therefore His
long-suffering detracts nothing from the judgment which He delays. In this
doctrine there is a twofold moral; first, that those whom God spares for a time,
should not give way to self-indulgence; and, secondly, that the prosperity of
the wicked should not disturb the minds of believers, but that they should allow
God to decide the time and the place of executing vengeance. Inasmuch, however,
as God's delay renders hypocrites secure, so that they lull themselves to sleep
in their vices, and, although they hear that they will have to render account of
them, thoughtlessly indulge themselves during 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f286</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their period of enjoyment, Moses declares that <i>the day is near</i>,<i>
</i>and <i>makes haste</i>;<i> </i>for, if God does not openly alarm them, and
reduce them to straits, they exult in their immunity. Hence those blasphemous
sayings recorded by Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:19,) "Let him make speed, and hasten his work that we may see it; and let the
counsel of the Holy One draw nigh and come, that we may know it! "Meanwhile we
must bear in mind the words of Habakkuk,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:3,) "Though <i>the prophecy </i>tarry, wait for it; because it will surely
come, it will not tarry."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord shall judge his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some connect this sentence with
what precedes it, and thus take the word <i>judge </i>for <i>to punish, </i>and
the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews, seems to support their opinion,
inasmuch as he proves by this testimony how fearful a thing it is "to fall into
the hands of the living God." (Hebrews10:30, 31.) But there is no reason why the
Apostle should not have accommodated to a different purpose what was set forth
by Moses for the consolation of the godly, in order that believers might be the
more heedful, the nearer they saw God to show Himself as the Judge of His
Church; unless it be perhaps preferred to construe the words of Moses thus:
Although God should judge His people, yet at length He will be propitiated, or
touched with repentance, so as to temper the vehemence of His anger. Whichever
way we understand them will be of little difference in the main; for, after
Moses has threatened the despisers of God, and the apostates, who desire to be
accounted members of His household the Church, he now turns to the strangers and
denounces against them that the cruelty which they have exercised towards the
Israelites shall not be unpunished, because God will at length be mindful of His
covenant, and will pardon His elect people. If you take the word <i>judge
</i>for to <i>govern, </i>or to <i>undertake their cause, </i>the particle
<i>for </i>must be rendered adversatively, as though it were said
<i>nevertheless </i>or <i>but; </i>if we prefer the other sense, it will be
equivalent to <i>although, </i>or <i>even though. </i>Doubtless the object of
Moses is to encourage the hopes of the pious, who have profited by God's
chastisement, by showing that He will mitigate His severity towards His elect
people, and <i>in </i>His <i>wrath </i>will <i>remember mercy.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk

clearly unfolded to David:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If

the rod of man,... nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not take away from

therefore, the ills which we suffer tempt us to despair, let this lesson recur
to our minds, that the punishments, wherewith God chastises His children, are
temporary, since His promise will never fail that "his anger endureth but a
moment,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">He here calls them His <i>servants, </i>not because
they had deserved His pardon by their obedience, but because He condescends to
acknowledge them as His own; for this honor has reference to His gratuitous

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:16,) he assuredly arrogates nothing peculiar to himself; but only boasts
that he from the womb had been of God's family, just as slaves are born in the
house of their masters. At the same time we must observe that, whenever God
declares that He will be merciful to His servants, he only refers to those who
heartily seek for reconciliation, and not to the reprobate, who are carried away
to destruction by their desperate obstinacy. In short, to the end that God
should repent of His severity, repentance is required on the part of sinners; as
he teaches elsewhere:</font><br></div>

used for <i>vigor;</i>

</i>as though it were said that God would be by no means content with a light
chastisement, and consequently would not be appeased until they should have come
to extremities. This circumstance is well worthy of notice, so flint our hopes
may not fail us even in the most severe afflictions of the Church; but that we
may be assured that although all may be in the worst state possible, still the
due season of reparation will come even
yet.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That none should remain behind, or <i>shut
up or left, </i>is almost a proverbial phrase in Hebrew; as when it is said,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;111410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 14:10,) "I will cut off from Jeroboam,... him that is shut up and left in
Israel," i.e.,<i> </i>as well in the city as in the country, or at home as
abroad. And this is again repeated respecting the posterity of Ahab.
(<i>Ibid</i>. 21:21.) And hence it is plain that they are mistaken 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f291</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who explain this as referring to riches shut up in treasure-houses, and cattle
dispersed through the fields. And this will be still more apparent from another
passage in which the Prophet unquestionably referred to this, "The<i> </i>Lord
saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was not any
shut up, nor any left," and inasmuch as He had not determined to <i>blot out
</i>His people," he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam;" as much as to say, that
God, as He had promised, had pity upon His people in their extreme destitution.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 14:26, 27.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall say, Where are their
gods?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Commentators are here at issue,
for some continue the paragraph, as if Moses were reporting the boastings and
insults of their enemies in the afflicted state of the Church; whilst others
consider it to be a pious exultation, wherein the faithful will celebrate the
deliverance of the Church. If we suppose the enemies to be here speaking, it
will be inconsistent that the word "gods"<i> </i>should be used in the plural
number: besides, what follows will proceed from their mistake and ignorance,
that the Israelites "did eat the fat,"<i> </i>which was not lawful for them even
in their common food, and much less in the sacrifices wherein the fat was burnt.
The other exposition, however, is that which I rather approve of, viz., that
when the tables were turned, and God should have shown Himself as the avenger of
the unbelievers cruel injustice, &#8212; God's children would be at liberty to
upbraid them. The word "he shall say," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f292</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is used indefinitely for "It shall be said by any or all of God's children."
Just, then, as unbelievers, when they see the saints afflicted, impudently
ridicule their faith, so on the other side Moses, when God comes to the help of
His Church, introduces the saints derisively inquiring, where are the gods of
the Gentiles, and where are all their patrons? since all of them, as is well
known, had their tutelary gods. Thus their impure and spurious sacrifices are
satirized in which they ate the fat, and drank the libations of wine. In short,
Moses intimates that, when God succors His people, their mouth is opened to sing
the song of triumph to the glory of the true God, and to upbraid unbelievers
with the false confidence whereby they are
deceived.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See now that 1, even I, am
he.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those who attribute the preceding
verses to the unbelievers, now introduce God speaking, as it were, abruptly, and
asserting His glory, in rebuke of their blasphemies. But it is rather a
confirmation of that holy boasting which He has just dictated to the believers,
when God not only bids His people lift up their voices against the idols, but
Himself comes forward to condemn the senselessness of the Gentiles; although the
context clearly shows that He addresses Himself to the faithful, After,
therefore, He has exhorted His people to despise the idols, He now adds that He
supplies them with ample grounds of confidence in Himself. For when He bids them
"look,"<i> </i>He signifies that no obscure manifestation of His power is before
their eyes, if they will only pay attention to it. The repetition of the pronoun
I is emphatic, both to arouse the people from their sluggishness, and to keep
their minds steadfast, lest they should waver as if in doubt. For we know that
men's minds can hardly be drawn to the true knowledge of God, because they wind
about by circuitous courses, so as not to direct themselves straight to Him. And
again, when they do apprehend God, we are aware how easily they are drawn away
from Him; since the vicissitudes of things becloud them, so that they wander
hither and thither in uncertainly. For this reason, when God has overthrown all
fictitious deities, He declares that He always remains the same, whether he
kills or makes alive, so that in the thick darkness of affliction believers may
not cease to look to Him. Let us learn from this passage that God is defrauded
of His right, unless He alone is preeminent, all idols being reduced to nothing;
and also that our faith is then truly fixed in Him, and has firm roots, if,
amidst the various changes which occur, it does not stagger or waver, but
surmounts such obstacles, so as not to cease to hope in Him even when He seems
to "slay" us, as Job says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;181315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
13:15.) And surely nothing is more unreasonable than that our faith should look
round upon all events so as to depend upon them; since God would have His
promises to quicken us in death itself. The close of the verse may fitly be
referred to their enemies, inasmuch as God declares that none can deliver them
out of His hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.</b>

have lifted up my hand," and read it connectedly with the foregoing verse, that
God's power in destroying and preserving will be manifest, if He raises up His
hand to heaven. I do not doubt, however, but that it is the beginning of a new
sentence, and that God thus commences, in order to affirm more strongly what He
immediately adds respecting the future destruction of their enemies. If,
however, any prefer the adverb of time "when," I have no great objection to
offer, provided these clauses are connected, "As soon as I shall have lifted up
my hand to heaven, I will put to confusion the enemies of my
Church."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To lift up the

suppose it to be a manifestation of power, as men are wont, by the uplifting of
their hand, to glow, when they are confident in their strength, and despise
their enemies. Others, however, more correctly state it to be a form of
adjuration God, who is exalted above all heavens, cannot, indeed, be literally
said to lift His hand; but it is no new thing for Him to borrow modes of
expression taken from men's common habits and customs, especially when He
suddenly rises again to sublimity, after having appeared for a while to sink
below the level of His greatness. Certainly the words which follow contain in
them an oath, "I live for ever;" and hence it is probable 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f294</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the elevation of His hand was expressive of His taking the
oath.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God swears by His life in a very different
sense from men. Sometimes, indeed, He adopts our common modes of speaking, as
when He is said to swear by His soul; but here, "I live," is tantamount to His
swearing by Himself, or by His eternal
essence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41<i>.</i></b><i>

sword.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The conditional particle does not
leave the matter doubtful, or in suspense, but must be resolved into an adverb
of time; as though He had said, As soon as He should take up arms, the
destruction of the enemies would be certain; not indeed that God wants arms for
the overthrow of His enemies; just as when He adds directly afterwards, "When my
hand shall have taken hold of judgment," He does not mean that it ever is taken
away from Him, or escapes Him, but He thus designates its present and manifest
operation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f295</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Since, therefore, God, when He spares His enemies, seems, as it were, to have
thrown aside His weapons, and to be at rest, having ceased to execute the office
of judge, He declares that His arms shall be ready wherewith to destroy His
enemies; and again, that then He will once more take upon Him the judgment which
He had seemed to lay aside; in which words He indirectly animadverts upon the
foolish security of those who conceive that His power is annihilated, unless He
openly exerts it, and that the judgment which He postpones is altogether
extinct.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42<i>.</i></b><i>

the Israelites, or led them away captive, should be cut off by God. But I do not
see why the same word should be expounded in two different senses; and I have no
doubt but that it is a repetition of the same thing, that God will make His
"arrows drunk with blood;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f297</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but He says, "the<i> </i>blood both of the slain and of the captives," since,
when an army is put to the sword, some fall in the battle itself, whilst others,
maimed and wounded, make an effort to
escape.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The conclusion of the verse is twisted
into various senses; some expound the word "head" by change of number,
"heads,"<i> </i>as though it were said, "I<i> </i>will cut off the heads of the
enemies;" it would, however, be more plausible to apply it metaphorically to the
leaders. But others translate it more correctly, "the beginning," not, indeed,
with reference to time, but as though it were said, the flower, or best of the
multitude, according to the common phrase, "from the first to the last." My
interpretation of "the revenges of the enemy" is, not those which God will
inflict upon His enemies, but such as are capital, or deadly, as though He had
said that He would deal as an enemy with the wicked, so that there should be no
place for mercy.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice, O ye nations, with his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The appositive reading, which
some prefer, "Praise him, O nations, His people," supplying the word "God,"<i>
</i>is constrained. For there is no incongruity in the notion that the Gentiles
should celebrate the benefits which God has conferred upon His people; at any
rate, it is more simple to take it thus, that so conspicuous was the favor of
God towards the Israelites, that the knowledge and favor of it should diffuse
itself far and wide, and be renowned even among the Gentiles. For Scripture thus
magnifies some of the more memorable exertions of God's power, especially when
reference is made to the redemption of the elect people, and commands His praise
to be proclaimed among the nations, since it would be by no means fitting that
it should be confined within the narrow limits of Judea. A question, however,
occurs, because Paul seems to quote this passage differently; for he says,
"Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:10;) and undoubtedly the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;qn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nakam, </i>which Moses uses, also signifies to rejoice. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f299</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If we admit that Paul took this sentence from Moses, the same Spirit, who spoke
both by Moses and Paul, is the best interpreter of His own words; nor will it be
inconsistent that the Gentiles should rejoice at the felicity of God's people.
But it may have been the case that Paul did not take this testimony from any
particular place, but from the general teaching of Scripture. At any rate, the
dignity of the people is celebrated on the ground that God esteems their blood
precious, and will deem their persecutors His own
adversaries.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word

reject the former meaning. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rpk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
caphar, </i>signifies that an expiation is made with sacrifice to appease God;
and it is probable that Moses alludes to the legal mode of reconciliation;
nevertheless, in my judgment, he means that God will restore His land and people
to His favor.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses came and
spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without reason that
Moses again records that he repeated this Song before the people; because it
thence appears how far from all ambition he was, in that he did not fear, at the
very close of his life, to irritate all their minds, so as to render the memory
of his name hateful; and besides, his authority was sanctioned by the silence
and submissiveness of the people, when they suffered themselves to be thus
severely dealt with. For, such was their general refractoriness, that they never
would have listened to him, had not the secret inspiration of the Spirit
interposed to subdue them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He associates with
himself Joshua, whom he undoubtedly desired to furnish with equal authority,
and, what is worthy of observation, he bids them be attentive to the
threatenings and reprehensions, in order to obtain reverence for the law. For we
often see that bare doctrine is cold and nerveless, unless the sluggishness,
which as it were stifles men's minds, is sharply stimulated; lest, then, the
teaching of the Law should be despised or forgotten, or, from being but
languidly received, should gradually be obliterated from their minds, he as it
were spurs them up by the vehemence of this Song, and commands that their
posterity should be instructed in it, in order that their attention may be
aroused by its menaces. In the next verse (47) he recommends to them zeal in the
observance of the Law on the score of its profitableness; for translators render
it improperly, as it seems to me, "Lest it should be an empty word to you," or,
"It<i> </i>is not an empty word, such as you should despise." Jerome's
translation is better &#8212; "The precepts are not given you in vain;" for
Moses simply intimates that the Law was not given in vain, so as to end in
fruitlessness; and consequently they were to beware lest they should frustrate
God's purpose, who desired to do them good.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rek, </i>therefore, is used as the converse of "fruitful," as more clearly
appears from the confirmation immediately added, that they "might prolong their
days in the promised land." The Law, then, is said not to be vain, because it is
fruitful unto salvation. In what way it is also deadly, and has no inherent
efficacy, I have already shown. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f300</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is indeed true that the Law, as being the sure rule of righteousness, does
not deceptively promise salvation to men; but, since there is no one who
actually performs what God requires, through the <i>accidental </i>guilt of men,
life is turned into death; but, when all are plunged beneath the curse, a new
remedy supervenes, and by God's gratuitous pardon they are so reconciled to Him,
as that their obedience, such as it is, becomes
acceptable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>48.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We infer that this is not
recorded in its regular order, because it is certain that Moses was warned of
his approaching death before the Song was composed; and this the second passage,
which I have here appended, expressly confirms; for he says that, before he
substituted Joshua for himself, the place was pointed out to him in which he was
to die. It is, however, by no means unusual for the order of narration to be
inverted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We<i> </i>may here perceive a singular
specimen of faith and obedience. All naturally fly from death, so that no one
hastens towards it of his own accord. He would never, therefore, have
voluntarily entered the tomb, unless relying on the hope of a better life. We
have already seen a similar instance in the case of Aaron: although the
resurrection was not then so clearly revealed as it now is by the Gospel, nor
had Christ appeared, who is the first-fruits of them that rise again. Wherefore,
though our carnal sense may be averse from death, let our faith prevail to
overcome all its terrors: even as Paul teaches that God's children, although
they desire not "to be unclothed," still long to be "clothed upon, that
mortality may be swallowed up of life." (2 Corinthians 5:4.) This, however, was
remarkable obedience, to prepare himself no less willingly for death than as if
he had been invited to some joyful banquet. Thus it is plain that these holy men
had so consecrated<i> </i>themselves to God, that they were ready to live or to
die, according to His pleasure. </font><br><font face="Palatino">Mount Abarim
seems to have obtained its name from its angles or sides, because it was divided
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f301</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
into many hills; as it is called also Nebo in this place, and elsewhere by
divers other names. Others think it is named from a <i>passage; </i>but the
other opinion is more probable, since it is called in the plural number Abarim,
that is, heights, or summits, or interstices, which were situated on opposite
heights.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although we shall presently see that
there was another reason why God desired to withdraw His servant from the sight
of men, still we must take notice of the consolation, which is here referred to,
that the pain of his death was alleviated by the permission to behold the land
of Canaan. For this reason he is commanded to get up into the top of the
mountain; for, although he would have been satisfied with the mere promise of
God, even had he been deprived of this blessing, still it had no slight
additional effect in enabling him more cheerfully to leave the people on the
threshold of their inheritance. For faith does not altogether deprive God's
children of human feelings; but our heavenly Father in His indulgence has
compassion on their infirmity. Thus, as it was a cause of sorrow to Moses to be
withheld from entering the land, he was supported by a seasonable remedy, that
he might not be hindered in his course by this
impediment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>51.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because ye trespassed against
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We perceive from his punishment how
necessary to Moses was such a token of favor. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f302</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For death in itself would not have been so bitter, but the cause, which is again
alleged, grievously wounded the mind of the holy man, in that he saw himself to
be excluded in God's just vengeance from the common inheritance on account of
his own guilt, which is more afflictive to the pious than a hundred, nay,
innumerable deaths. Hence those mournful complaints of David and Hezekiah, and
others elsewhere, when their life is taken from them by all angry
God:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the grave cannot praise thee,
death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy
truth."

for them to die, but that they would have calmly and cheerfully departed from
the world when their time came; but what they deprecated was the awful judgment
of God, at the thoughts of which they were alarmed. The same grief might have
overwhelmed the mind of Moses, had it not been
alleviated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But since none, however eminent,
have been altogether exempt from temporal punishments, let us learn to bear them
patiently. God did not spare Moses; what wonder if our condition is no better
than his? Moreover, in the opinion of men it was a trifling offense, for the
sake of which he was so severely chastised; for, carried away by indignation, he
had been so irritated against the people that he had attributed less power to
God that was due to Him. Now, those errors, into which we fall through
thoughtless impetuosity, are more easily pardoned; but hence it is manifest; how
precious to God is His glory, when He does not suffer it to be obscured with
impunity even by inadvertence. At the same time, also, we are taught that
nothing is more irrational than to assume to ourselves the judgment respecting
sins, and to weigh them in our own balance, when God is their only legitimate
assessor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But, although He declares that Moses
and Aaron revolted, and were rebellious "to<i> </i>His mouth," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f303</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
still, lest it should be thought that they studiously refused credence to God's
word, a kind of qualification is added, viz., that they did not <i>sanctify
</i>God in the midst, or <i>before the eyes, </i>of the children of Israel.
Hence it. is plain that they were only condemned for the excessive violence of
their passion, whereby they did not uphold God's glory before the people with
sufficient energy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the rest, it may be

as it were, by this palliative, wherein Moses left a testimony with respect to
God's future and perpetual grace, as if depositing an inestimable treasure in
the hands of the people. For, as God, after the deliverance of His people, and
the giving of the Law, renewed the covenant which Jacob had testified of and
proclaimed, so Moses was, as it were, their second father, to ratify anew its
blessings, lest the memory of them should ever be
lost.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order to beget confidence<i> </i>in his
benedictions, he commences by magnifying his vocation before he proceeds to
them; for, although the word <i>benediction </i>is equivalent to a prayer for
success, yet must it be borne in mind that Moses does not here pray in the
ordinary manner, like a private person, in such a way as fathers are wont to
offer supplications for their children; but that, in the spirit of prophecy, he
sets forth the blessings which were to be expected from God. This, then, is the
reason why he extols the dignity and glory of his office as ruler in such lofty
terms, viz., that the twelve tribes of Israel may be thoroughly assured that God
is the author of these blessings. For the same reason he calls himself "the man
of God:" that the people may receive what he is about to say as if it. proceeded
from God, whose undoubted minister he is. Nor is the circumstance of time
without its weight &#8212; "before his death," or, "in<i> </i>his death," which
adds to the prophecy the force of a
testament.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b><i>

</i>In these words he reminds them that he is setting before them, a
confirmation of the covenant, which God had made with them in this Law<i>,

exceeding efficacy in establishing the certainty of the blessings, provided only
the Law was duly honored; for nothing was better adapted to confirm the grace of
God than the majesty which was displayed in the promulgation of the Law. Some,
as I conceive improperly, translate it, &#8212; "God comes to Sinai," whereas
Moses rather means that he came from thence, when His brightness was made
manifest. By way of ornament, the same thing is repeated with respect to Seir
and Paran; and, since these three words are synonymous<i>, </i>therefore to
<i>go forth, </i>to <i>rise up, </i>and to <i>come, </i>also represent the same
thing, viz., that manifestation of the divine glory which should have ravished
into admiration the minds of all; as though he had said that his blessings were
to be received with the same reverence, as that which God had procured for His
Law, when His face was conspicuously displayed on Mount Sinai. The Prophet
Habakkuk
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:3) has imitated this figure, though with a different object, viz., that, the
people might confidently rely upon his power, which had formerly been manifested
to the fathers in visible brightness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By "ten

I do not understand, as many do, the faithful, but the angels, by whom God was
accompanied as by a royal retinue; for God also commanded the ark to be placed

So in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

thousand." It is probable that both Paul and Stephen derived from this passage
their statement that the Law was "ordained by Angels in the hand of a mediator,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians

The Law is called <i>fiery, </i>in order to inspire terror and to enforce
humility upon them all; although I am not adverse to the opinion that Moses
alludes in this epithet to the outward signs of fire and flame, of which he
spoke in Exodus 20. But, since the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">td</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>dath, </i>means any statute or edict, some restrict it to the prohibition
that none should more closely approach the mountain. In my own mind, however,
there is no doubt but that it designates all the doctrine whereby God's dominion
is maintained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

</i>If it be preferred to apply this to the Gentiles, the sentence must be thus
resolved, "Although He loves all human beings, still His saints are honored with
His peculiar favor, in that He watches over their safety;" but it is more
correct to expound it as referring only to the children of Abraham, whom He
calls "peoples," because, on account of the multitude into which they had grown,
in their several tribes, they might be reckoned as so many nations. And since

</i>signifies prolongation of time, like <i>adhuc </i>in Latin, the following
sense will be very satisfactory, that, Although the descendants of Abraham were
divided into various races, and might therefore seem to be no longer a single
family, nevertheless God still continued to regard them all with affection, and
their numbers and divisions did not prevent Him from accounting them to be a
single body. The sum is, that God's favor towards them was not extinguished,
either by the progress of time, or the increase of the people; but that it was
constantly extended to the race of Abraham, however far or widely it might be
spread.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It must, however, be observed, that in
proof of His love, it is presently added, that they were <i>in the hand </i>of
God. Hence we infer that, from the time that God has embraced us with His favor,
He is the sure guardian of our safety; whence also arises the firm assurance of
eternal life. The change of person, from the third to the second, throws no
obscurity on the meaning. Since many hypocrites were mixed up with the faithful

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f310</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; Moses restricts this special grace of God to those who willingly submit
themselves to Him, and with pious teachableness embrace this instruction, by
which sign he distinguishes between the true children of God, and those spurious
or degenerate ones, who falsely assume the name. Where my translation is, "They
cleaved to thy feet," others render the words, "They<i> </i>were struck at thy
feet," but in my judgment constrainedly. Others extract from it a useful piece
of instruction, that "they were subdued by God's chastisements, so as to render
Him obedience;"<i> </i>but the metaphor is rather taken from disciples, who,
according to the common usage of the Hebrew language, are said to sit at their
master's feet, in order to attend more diligently. And this is confirmed by the
context, for the faithful are said to have attached themselves to God's feet,
that they might <i>receive of this words, </i>i.e.,<i> </i>profit by His
instruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses commanded us a
law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What he had declared respecting the
glory of God, and the excellency of the Law, he now applies to his own person,
since it was his purpose, as I have said, to establish the authority of his own
ministry. In order, therefore, to prove the certainty of his mission, he boasts
that he was appointed by<i> </i>God to be the teacher of the people, and that
not for a brief period, but throughout all ages; for by the word "inheritance,"
the perpetuity of the Law is signified. He then claims for himself the royal
supremacy, not because he had ruled after the manner of kings, but that the
dignity of this high office might add weight to his words. He says that "the<i>
</i>heads of the people and the tribes were gathered together," with reference
to their unhappy disorganization, which was tending to their destruction, as
much as to say that, under his guidance, rind by his exertions, the state of the
people was reestablished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He begins with Reuben,
the first-born, and so far removes or mitigates the ignominy of that
condemnation wherewith he had been branded by his father Jacob, as only to stop
short of restoring him to his place of honor. For the holy Patriarch had
pronounced a severe sentence, namely, that Reuben should be "as unstable as
water, and should not excel."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:4.) Lest, therefore, the whole of his posterity should be discouraged, or
should be rejected by the other tribes, he abates the severity of his
disinheritance, as if to pardon the condemned. In short, he assigns to the
family of Reuben a place among the sons of Jacob, lest despair should drive them
to headlong ruin. The second clause admits of two contrary meanings. Literally
it is, "Let him be small in number;" and, in fact, this tribe was not of the
more numerous ones. Since, however, it occupied a middle place, and surpassed
several of the others, some repeat the negative, "Let him not die, nor let him
be few in number." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f311</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But it appears more probable that an abatement is made from the rank to which
his primogeniture entitled the family of Reuben, and thus that some remainder of
dishonor was introduced into the promise of grace. And, in fact, not only the
tribe of Judah, but those of Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphthali,
surpassed it in size. Thus the qualification will be by no means inappropriate,
that, although Reuben was to be reckoned among the people of God, still he
should not altogether recover his
dignity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the blessing of
Judah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f312</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Jerome has faithfully given the sense, "This is the blessing," although it
is not actually expressed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It might at first
sight appear inconsistent that some abatement should be made from the splendid
and abundant blessings which had been promised to the tribe of Judah. This,
however, is by no means the case; for the inviolable decree respecting the
supremacy of Judah is not thus altered; but Moses merely reminds them how
difficult of accomplishment it would be. Jacob<i> </i>had declared, as if
speaking of a peaceful dominion, that his "brethren should praise" him, that his
"father's children should bow down before" him; that "the scepter should not
depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:8, 10;) but, inasmuch as this dignity lay dormant for a long time, and it was
necessary that it should contend with many tedious obstacles before it finally
manifested itself, Moses consequently speaks in more limited terms. Still, he
seems to have referred not merely to the earlier period, but to the various
calamities whereby the kingdom of David was not only apparently diminished, but
destroyed; and especially to the melancholy interruption of it which arose from
the Babylonish captivity. The sum is, that the prosperity of which Jacob
prophesied was not to be so conspicuous in the tribe of Judah, as that all
things were to be expected to be joyous and successful, but rather that those,
to whom the supreme power as well as wealth was promised, would be exposed to
many evils, so that they should be reduced to extremities, and be greatly in
want of the help of God. He therefore betakes himself to prayer, and by his
example admonishes not that tribe only, but the others also, to implore the
faithfulness of God in their overwhelming difficulties. And this lesson applies
to ourselves also, in order that we may be<i> </i>the more aroused to prayer and
supplication, the more Satan is urgent for the destruction of Christ's kingdom.
At the same time, what I have stated must be observed, namely, that the promise
remains firm, since it is not in vain that Moses places all the tribes under the
dominion of Judah, when he petitions that he may be <i>brought unto his people,
</i>nor promises in vain that God will be at hand to help him, so that he may
prevail against his enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of Levi he
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This qualification, or
modification of the harsher sentence of Jacob was introduced not only for the
sake of the tribe of Levi, but rather of the whole people. Jacob had
said,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Simeon and Levi are
brethren: instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul, come not
thou into their secret; unto their assembly, my

49:5, 6.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Assuredly their descendants might have
been discouraged, or at least might have been regarded contemptuously, when a
patriarch, and the founder of their race, had thus abominated them. God,
however, afterwards consecrated this tribe to Himself, so that their sanctity
might be communicated to the other tribes; which could not be the case unless
their previous opprobrium were removed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But if
any contentious person had objected to this blessing, as if Moses were too much
disposed to favor his own tribe, such a suspicion could not justly be harbored
against him; first, because he, who now makes such honorable mention of the
tribe of Levi, was also the proclaimer of their ignominy; and on many other
occasions had not spared his own family, but, whenever it was requisite, had
freely inveighed against their vices; and, secondly, he now commends nothing in
the Levites except the new dignity, which it had pleased God to confer upon
them. On this point, indeed, he ought to have been least of all suspected,
inasmuch as he had degraded his own sons, and had exalted the posterity of Aaron
alone to the highest place of honor. Now, therefore, he has no other object but
that the dignity of the priesthood should not be depreciated on account of the
sins of men, and thus their religion itself be despised. For we all know how
disposed people are to lay charges against the persons of men which may derogate
from the sacredness of their office. Assuredly, if Levi had not been purged from
that disgrace which he had incurred, the priesthood would have been altogether
deprived of reverence; and thus God's worship would have been very lightly
esteemed. Now, however, when God sanctifies this family to himself, he, as it
were, restores it entirely; and hence it is apparent that its punishment was
only temporary, since Moses had no intention of retracting what the Spirit had
dictated to holy Jacob. Nor does he, indeed, advance anything of himself; but
the same Spirit removes the ignominy, which might have disgraced the tribe of
Levi, inasmuch as it had only been imposed upon it for a time. We have already
seen elsewhere that what Jacob prophesied respecting the dispersion of this
family, resulted in its honor; since God posted the Levites in all directions
like sentinels, that through their means purity of doctrine might be fostered
amongst the whole people. They were, therefore, scattered in such a manner as
that their punishment might be productive of benefit. We must, therefore,
conclude, that Moses spoke not to gratify his brethren, but made honorable
mention of the priesthood, lest those, whom God had chosen as this ministers,
should be treated with contempt. And, doubtless, the subsequent grace of their
calling should have blotted out the recollection of their previous infamy. Thus
Christ, when He would restore Peter to the office of an apostle, cancels his
triple denial, by thrice setting him over His sheep.

applied to God; for some translate it improperly, "The Urim and Thummim shall be

hesitated to translate them as common nouns: for it is unquestionable that by
these symbols were denoted, <i>the knowledge of the Law </i>which is the only
light of our souls, and <i>integrity of life. </i>The sum, however, is that the
honor of the priesthood was deposited with Aaron, whom he calls
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the man of God's

good."</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, viz., that God tried him at
Massah, I conceive to be added by way of exception;<i> </i>for I have no doubt
but that Moses magnifies God's mercy by this allusion, in that He had dignified
Aaron with so great an honor, notwithstanding his having been overcome by
impatience, and having fallen. Still it must be remarked that, in reference to
the people, the zeal of Aaron is recorded as praiseworthy; as much as to say,
that the sin of Aaron flowed from the fountain of virtue, since it was from holy
indignation that he fell into the passion of impatience, when he could not
endure that the people should rebel against God. Unless perhaps it be preferred
to understand these words by way of apostrophe to the people, "Thou<i> </i>didst
try, thou didst provoke him to contention, or didst quarrel with him." But the
context will run better, if we understand that God then had a controversy with
Aaron; inasmuch as, although overcome by the trial, he still gave no despicable
proof of his piety, and from that time forward did not cease to execute his
office with sedulity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>

example is set before all the Levites for their imitation. And, first, he is
said to have renounced his own flesh and blood, in order that he might be more
disencumbered for obeying God; and in fact it is necessary that all the pastors
of the Church should put off their earthly affections, which would otherwise
often keep them back from devoting themselves entirely to God. Aaron, then, is
said to have bid farewell to all his family, that he might be at liberty to lay
himself out for God. Christ now requires the same thing of His disciples, that
sons should forget their fathers, and fathers their sons, and husbands their
wives, lest anything should retard their course, and prevent them from earnestly
advancing through life and death to the end to which they are called.

10:37.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses afterwards, by using the plural
number, embraces the whole Levitical order; and hence we may infer that what had
preceded is not to be confined in its application to a single individual. But
when he says that they "guarded<i> (custodisse) </i>the word of God, and kept
his covenant," he does not refer to mere ordinary obedience, but to the peculiar
care of preserving that which was intrusted to their charge. It is true that in
like manner all believers are said to keep the Law, when they zealously devote
themselves to live a holy life; but special allusion is here made to the office
of teaching. The Levites, therefore, are called guardians of the Law, and
keepers of it, as being
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fu&gt;lakev</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>since with them was deposited the treasure of Divine instruction, as is more
clearly set forth in the next verse, "They shall teach Jacob, etc." If any
should prefer that this observing of the Law should be understood of their life
and habits, as though it were said, that the Levites should surpass others in
the examples they gave, I do not contend the point, though it seems to me that
the second clause is explanatory, and that it more familiarly sets forth what
was spoken with some little obscurity, pointing out the way in which the Law is
to be observed, viz., by their being the teachers and masters of the people. We
must, however, remark the method they are to adopt in teaching; for they are not
permitted to introduce their own inventions, or to frame a rule of life out of
their own heads; but they are commanded to seek in the Law itself what they are
to teach, and to interpret it honestly and faithfully. And this condition was
inserted in order that whosoever should desire to be successors in the honor
should be mindful of their vocation, and faithfully devote themselves to the
office of teaching. Thus, when in a corrupt state of the Church, priests, who
had nothing of this sort about them, paraded their mere empty title; their silly
vaunt is refuted by Malachi:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"My<i>
</i>covenant (he says) was with Levi of life and peace;.... <i>for </i>the law
of truth was in his mouth, and the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they
should seek the law at his mouth, but ye have corrupted <i>my</i> covenant,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Malachi
2:5, 6, 7, 8.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us learn, then, from this
passage, that whosoever claims for himself the primacy in the Church must be
repudiated, unless he manifests himself to be a faithful
teacher.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The third part of the priest's office
follows, viz., that he should apply himself to the performance of the religious
services; for God had disencumbered them from the labors of agriculture and
other earthly business, that they might be more entirely at liberty for the
duties of teaching and sacrifice; and, although this latter might appear to be
but an humble occupation, still, if we regard it aright, it was no common honor
that they should be mediators and intercessors for the reconciliation of the
people to God; for even the very least of the Levites had something to do with
making atonement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Under the words "incense and
whole burnt-sacrifice," the entire legal service is comprehended; and the
incense is said to be put before the nose of God; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f316</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because the odor of this offering was grateful, and, as it were, sweet-smelling
to Him, as we have elsewhere seen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bless, Lord, his
substance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This supplication appears to
have been intended tacitly to provide against the poverty which awaited the
Levites, if God had not supplied them with food from some other source besides
the produce of the soil; for they were deprived of a share in the general
inheritance, and God alone was their property. Lest, therefore, their condition
should be painful to them, Moses offers them consolation, and bids them expect
from God abundance for their support, whilst he promises that His blessing shall
stand them in stead of the most redundant produce; as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:15, "I will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her <i>priests</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with bread."</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, that "the<i>
</i>work of his hands may be acceptable to God," may be either explained
generally of the labor which is bestowed for the purpose of obtaining food, or
of the service and ministry of the tabernacle; but, inasmuch as God engaged the
Levites in sacred occupations, it seems indirectly to promise them that such
exercises would be no less profitable to them than as if they were altogether
occupied in the pursuit of gain. It was allowable for the rest to employ their
industry for the advancement of their domestic interests, whilst the Levites, in
order properly to perform their duties, were obliged to neglect their private
affairs. Lest, then, they should be afraid of destitution, Moses reminds them
that they might expect from God an earthly reward also for their spiritual
labors.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The third point appears to be purposely
introduced, that "God would smite through or transfix their enemies," because
pious teachers are very much exposed to envy, and ill-will, and persecution; for
the complaint which is made by Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:10,) that he was "a<i> </i>man of strife," is applicable to all the prophets
and ministers of God; since the world can hardly bear its affections to be slain
by the spiritual sword of God's word, and hence many contentions arise. Besides,
Satan, in order to render their: doctrine contemptible, does not cease to harass
them by whatever means he can, and to arm his bands to war against them; so that
the pastors of the Church have need of God's special aid. This point, then, is
peculiarly worthy of observation that, although many adversaries always threaten
God's servants, besiege them, provoke them to conflict, in a word, are always
plotting their destruction, still God's succor will be at hand, whereby they may
be rendered invincible; as it was said to Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"They shall fight against
thee,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but they shall not prevail

<div><font face="Palatino">The words I have translated "lest they rise again,"
others render "lest<i> </i>they rise against them;"<i> </i>and, although I do
not reject this, still it seems to be less appropriate; for Moses did not wish
to exempt the Levites from the annoyances of combat, but only to promise them
victory, inasmuch as God would overwhelm and destroy their enemies.

therefore, God assigned them a dwelling-place, in which He in a manner protected
them, and cherished them beneath His wings, they are not without reason called

closely to the words of the Patriarch. And, although the family of Joseph was
already divided into two tribes or nations, still he begins by the head itself,
and at the conclusion declares that what had been given to their fathers
pertains to Ephraim and Manasseh. First, he celebrates the exceeding fertility

approve of their translation, who render it <i>fruits, </i>although I know not
whether Moses speaks of the excellency of the climate, or commends the
beneficence of God; the latter, however, accords best with the context, in which
he makes mention of the external means of fertility, viz., the dew, and the
deep, by which word I understand the depth of the soil itself. In the next verse
I admit that by the word

translate the word

ge<i>resh, </i>"influence." It literally means <i>thrusting out; </i>and is used
metaphorically for the fruit, which arises and breaks forth from the earth. But
it is not very clear to me what fruits he speaks of respectively as "of the sun,
and the moon;" for I cannot tell whether there are any grounds for assigning, as
some do, to the sun the produce which springs from seed and the vintage; and to
the moon, cucumbers and gourds; nor do I attempt to decide whether their idea is
more correct who suppose the latter to be flowers or fruits which appear every
month.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>

the ancient mountains.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words he
shows that no part of the land would be barren. We know that the tops of
mountains are generally and uncultivated, or at any rate bear nothing but trees
that have no fruit. But Moses affirms that even there also there shall be the
richest produce, for which reason, at least in my opinion, he calls the
mountains <i>ancient, </i>and the hills <i>lasting, </i>as if being very highly
renowned; for their antiquity is not praised, as if they were created before the
rest of the world, but these mountains are honorably distinguished as the
first-born, because God's blessing eminently rests upon them. Thus in the
blessing of Jacob it is said, "unto<i> </i>the utmost bound of the everlasting
hills," as much as to say, that no corner of these most celebrated mountains
should be devoid of fertility.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:26.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse he extends generally
to the whole land what he had said of the
mountains.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those are wide of the meaning of
Moses, who translate what follows: "On<i> </i>account of the good-will of the
dweller in the bush the blessing shall come;" and <i>his </i>rendering is
altogether barbarous who gives it, "On account of the piety," etc. My opinion is
that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>retzon, </i>is in the nominative case; for it is quite in accordance with the
context that the "favor of God would come upon the head of Joseph;"<i> </i>for,
after Moses had magnified His bounty, he now points out its source or cause,
viz., that this extraordinary fertility was the result of God's gratuitous
favor. The words of Jacob, "by the God of thy father," and "by<i> </i>the
Almighty," exactly correspond with these; where also I have explained why Joseph
was called a Nazarene among his brethren. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f321</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">God
is called "the dweller in the bush" by <i>periphrasis, </i>with reference to the
vision which was presented to Moses on Mount Sinai; for God then appeared a
second time as the Redeemer and Father of His people; after having made His
covenant with Abraham and Jacob. And this serves by way of confirmation; as if
it were said, that the same God who had formerly blessed Joseph by the mouth of
His servant Jacob, now repeated the same prophecy, in order to give fuller
assurance of its truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His glory is like the
firstling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Translators obscure the
meaning by translating the word <i>firstling </i>in the nominative case. I have
no doubt, however, but that he compares the glory of Joseph to the size of a
very fine bullock, as if He had said, "His beauty is as of the most choice
bullocks in his herds." At least it is very consistent that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>firstling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>should be used for <i>pre-eminent. </i>He says, then, that no more
magnificent or glorious bullocks should be found in the land of Joseph than the
people itself would be. And to beauty he adds strength and vigor, so that they
should be victorious over all their enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At
the end of the verse (as I have before stated,) he declares that what he had
prophesied of Joseph should be common to the two families of Ephraim and
Manasseh. At the same time he confirms the declaration of Jacob, whereby he had
preferred Ephraim the younger to the elder. Manasseh, therefore, only reckons
his thousands, but Ephraim his tell thousands, a proof of which fact God had
given in the census which has been already recorded, in which the tribe of
Ephraim was found to be the more
numerous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of Zebulun he
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>compares two tribes with
each other, which, although neighbors in position, were still very dissimilar;
for the one being devoted to mercantile pursuits, went forth frequently in
various directions; the other took more delight in quietude and repose; and this
their great variety of condition is indicated, when he bids Zebulun rejoice in
its expeditions, and Issachar in its domestic repose. Moses thus confirms the
prophecy of Jacob, who said that Zebulun should "dwell<i> </i>at the haven of
the sea,"<i> </i>so as to make voyages of traffic; whilst Issachar, as
delighting more in repose, should be lazy and idle, so as to make no objections
against paying tribute, in order to purchase peace.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:13-15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows I suppose to be added,
as though Moses had said that their distant location should not prevent them
from going up with the others to Jerusalem, for the purpose of performing their
religious duties. For in that they were farther removed from the temple, their
zeal in the legal service might have grown cold. Although, then, they dwelt in
the utmost borders of the land, Moses says that they should nevertheless come to
offer sacrifices to God. By the <i>peoples </i>some understand the other tribes,
which does not appear at all consistent; and others, foreign nations, to which
their commercial intercourse gave them access. My interpretation, however, is
simply that, although the length of the journey should invite them to remain at
home, still they should mutually exhort each other to betake themselves in large
companies to the temple. The end of the verse may be the statement of a reason
for this, as if it were said, that they will be more attentive to the service of
God, because, being enriched by him, they will be desirous to offer Him the
praise. And assuredly it is a sign of gross ingratitude, when we are not
stimulated by God's blessings to strive more earnestly to render thanks to him,
in proportion as he deals more liberally with us. At the same time, Moses shows
that, in consideration of their great wealth, the expenses of the journey would
be by no means onerous to them; for, although their country was not very
fertile, still its position was most advantageous for the acquirement of riches.
Thus when it is here said, "they shall suck of the abundance of the seas," an
antithesis is to be understood between the fruits of the earth and the abundant
revenues derived from merchandise. To the same effect, "the treasures hid in the
sand" are spoken of. For the exposition given by some, that their treasures
should be so great as that they should hide them in the sand; and by others,
that the sands should there be so prolific in silver and gold; and by others,
that they should collect what the sea should throw up, is poor and vapid.
Whereas, therefore, others should grow rich from their lands, Moses says, by an
elegant figure, that the sands of Zebulun should be filled with hidden
treasures, on account of their foreign
traffic.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of Gad he
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the blessing of the tribe of
Gad, mention is only made of the hereditary portion, which it had obtained
without casting of lots. He therefore celebrates the blessing of God, because He
had accorded<i> </i>to the Gadites an ample dwelling-place; for the word
"enlargeth" refers to the extent of their possession. But inasmuch as in that
extremity of the land beyond Jordan, they were on a hostile border, he declares
that they would be warlike, and hence compares them to a lion, which tears its
prey sometimes from the head, and sometimes from the arm. Since, then, that
position would not be so peaceful as any other region in the midst of Canaan, he
declares that they should be safe and sound, through their own audacity. And
although it is not a very pleasant condition to be harassed by constant wars,
still, in such a disagreeable case, God's grace was not to be despised, which
made them formidable to their enemies, and of great valor, whereby they might
not only repel hostile invasions, but be willing of themselves to make predatory
expeditions. If any should object that license for rapine was quite unsuitable
for God's children, the solution is obvious, that reference is not here made to
what was lawful, or what was desirable and praiseworthy, but that a consolation
was offered them by way of protection against the incursions and annoyances of
their enemies. Besides, the lust for booty is not made permissible, but praise
is merely given to their courage in overcoming their
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he provided the first part
for himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f322</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Others translate it not badly, <i>the first-fruits. </i>Jerome's rendering,
<i>pre-eminence </i>(<i>principatum</i>,)<i> </i>however, is quite out of the
question. The word <i>beginning </i>(<i>principium</i>,<i>) </i>however, is very
suitable, for Moses thus signifies that the Gadites were beforehand in seeking a
dwelling-place for themselves; for before possession of the land was accorded to
the people, they asked for the kingdom of Sihon for themselves. It is afterwards
added, in what way they were provident in choosing their abode, namely, because
God suggested to them that Moses was at liberty to assign this portion to them.
For it is called the "portion<i> </i>of the lawgiver," as being that respecting
which Moses might lawfully decide, since he appropriated it to the Gadites, not
by hazard, nor otherwise than by God's command. It is called the <i>hidden
</i>portion, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f323</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as not having been included by God in His promise. The sum is, that although
God's will was not yet revealed, with respect to this addition to the land,
still they obtained it through His secret liberality. And Moses desires flint
his decision with regard to the Gadites remaining on this side Jordan should be
thus confirmed, since disputes might have otherwise arisen, inasmuch as God's
promise had assigned the boundaries of the whole people on the opposite bank.
Theirs is a poor exposition who explain it that Moses was buried there; and
those also violently wrest the words, who understand by "the<i> </i>lawgiver"
the chiefs of the Amorites, and render the words "hidden portion," <i>the ceiled
palaces;</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f324</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>nor would they have been thus extravagant in their notions, if the natural
meaning which I have given had occurred to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The other clause of the verse is added by
way of qualification; for Moses shows that this advantageous provision was made
for the children of Gad, on condition that they should accompany the other
tribes, and not return home until the land of Canaan was at peace, and their
enemies subdued. And we have already seen that, when they sought for themselves
this location outside the land, in the kingdom of the Amorites, they were
severely rebuked by Moses, until they promised that they would share the war
with their brethren until its conclusion. This is what Moses means by
"executing<i> </i>the justice of God, and his judgments with Israel;" not only
because it was but just that they should share the war with their brethren, and
assist them in obtaining possession of the land, but because God ordained that
His just vengeance should be executed upon those heathen and wicked nations by
the whole of Israel, and had chosen all the tribes generally to be the ministers
of His judgment; as it is said, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
149:7, 8, 9, that they were charged "to execute vengeance upon the heathen, . .
to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to
execute upon them the judgment written;" for it was no common honor to be
appointed to be, as it were, the judges of the ungodly, so as to destroy them
all, and thus to purify the land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of Dan he
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He foretells that the tribe of
Dan, like that of Gad, should be warlike, not so much from voluntary
disposition, as from necessity; for their love of war was not to be deemed
praiseworthy, inasmuch as it is altogether contrary to humanity; but because the
unscrupulousness of the enemies, by which that tribe was infested, compelled
them to take up arms. He compares it to a lion impetuously leaping from Mount
Bashan; and the particle of comparison must be understood here, for Mount Bashan
was not situated in the territory of this tribe. But Moses means to say that
they should be as ready for the combat as a lion, which, after it has issued
from its den into the open plains, makes an attack upon every one that it
meets.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of Naphtali he
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He predicts that God would deal
bountifully towards these two tribes; for to the first a fertile district would
be allotted towards "the west and the south." What he declares respecting the
tribe of Asher is not free from ambiguity; for he is said to be blessed,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynbm</font><font face="Palatino">,

</i>is celebrated, as though it were said, Asher shall be blessed with a
numerous progeny. There may, however, be a comparison between this tribe and the
others; and this might justly be made to its advantage, because it had a very
fertile district allotted to it, and abounding in wheat of the best quality, as
the blessing of Jacob testifies,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Out of Asher shall bread

<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that "Asher shall be acceptable<i> </i>to his
brethren;" from whence we gather that his tribe should be of a placid
disposition: and afterwards figuratively celebrates the abundance of his oil,
and iron, and brass. For to "dip his foot in oil," is as much as to say that he
should collect an abundant supply of oil; and that "his shoes should be iron and
brass," is nothing more than that he should tread upon a soil full of these
metals. It is to be readily inferred from hence, as from preceding passages,
that the blessings, which are now mentioned, are not so much wishes or prayers,
as prophecies; since without the spirit of prophecy Moses could never have
divined what, or what sort of, territory was to be bestowed on the several
tribes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Commentators vary as to the latter
words; for some render the word

letters, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and thus restrict the meaning of the word "days" to youth; but others more
correctly suppose, that Asher was to be strong and vigorous through the whole
course of his life. Since, therefore, years gradually debilitate men, Moses
promises to the posterity of Asher that their rigor should be retained to the
very end of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is none like unto the
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses proceeds from the parts to
the whole, and now comes to speak of the whole body, which consisted of the
twelve families. All that he says tends to the same end, viz., that the people
of Israel were happy as being taken by God under this faithful guardianship: for
nothing is more to be desired with regard to our best interests, than that our
welfare should be intrusted to the hand of God. But, since this inestimable
blessing of being protected by the care of God is often but lightly prized,
Moses exclaims in admiration, that there is none to be compared to the God of
Israel. We know that all nations had their tutelary gods or patrons, and
foolishly gloried in their respective idols; although they often found from
experience, that whatever confidence they placed in them was vain and frivolous.
Moses, therefore, separates from this imaginary multitude of false gods the God
of Israel, like whom, he says, none can be anywhere found. He also extols His
power, because He rides gloriously on the heavens and clouds, which is
tantamount to all high things being subject to His dominion. But, whereas it
would be of little profit to reflect on his infinite power except; in its
connection with ourselves, Moses expressly reminds us that God is not strong for
Himself, but in order that He may help His
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The eternal God is thy
refuge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is just as if he had said
that the Israelites were protected from above by the help of God, and also
based, as it were, upon Him. The beginning of the prayer corresponds with that
other in

90:1, "Lord<i>, </i>thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations." The
sum is, that although the Israelites might be exposed to many injuries, still
there was secure repose for them under the shadow of God's wings; and assuredly
unless the hand of God had been like a roof to protect them, they would have
perished a thousand times over. But, inasmuch as it would not be sufficient for
our heads to be in safety, the other point is also added, viz., that God's arms
should be stretched forth to sustain them from beneath. He calls them
"everlasting," because the security of the pious, who rely upon God, is never
shaken: it is, therefore, just as though he represented God to be at the same
time the foundation, and the roof, of their abode. Others translate it less
correctly, "Thou shalt live under the arms of the Everlasting;"<i> </i>for an
elegant distinction is drawn, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

other there is allusion to the future; as if he had said of God, that He was

above statements, inasmuch as God had 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f327</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
miraculously destroyed the enemies of His people; at the same time he specifies
the manner in which this was done, viz., that He had said, Destroy, or blot out,
or dissipate. And by this word he signifies that, although God had made use of
the agency of the Israelites, still He only was the conqueror; since the
Israelites prevailed not except at His bidding, and by His
will.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>

to the elect people what all have naturally a great desire for, viz., peace or
tranquillity; for he is said to <i>dwell </i>confidently<i> alone, </i>who:
fears no danger, whom no care harasses, and who needs no garrison, or defense.
This, indeed, God never vouchsafed altogether to the Israelites, that they
should inhabit their land in security and without the fear of enemies, inasmuch
as their ingratitude did not allow of it; and therefore the prophets, in
enumerating the blessings of Christ's kingdom, declare<i> </i>that every one

said, that the quiet and peaceful habitation referred to was to be expected by
the people from the vision of their father Jacob. Others, however, more
correctly read the words "fountain of Jacob," in apposition (with Israel,)
inasmuch as all the tribes derived their origin from that one father. In this
way the "fountain" will not be only the actual source; but the rivulet, or
stream, which flows down from it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In conclusion,

happiness; for unless we ascend to the first cause of Salvation, all salvations,
so to speak, are but transitory. And, since God had honored the Israelites alone
with this privilege, their condition is here distinguished from the common lot
of the whole human race. By the words <i>shield </i>and <i>sword </i>is meant a

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses went. up from the
plains of Moab. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is not certain who wrote
this chapter; unless we admit the probable conjecture of the ancients, that
Joshua was its author. But since Eleazar the priest might have performed this
office, it will be better to leave a matter of no very great importance
undecided.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have elsewhere said, that one part
of mount Abarim was called Nebo, as another was called Pisgah, because they were
distinct summits.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, the ascent of Moses was
equivalent to a voluntary going forth to death: for he was not ignorant of what
was to happen, but being called by God to die, he went to meet death of his own
accord. Such willing submission proceeded from no other source than faith in
God's grace, whereby alone all terror is mitigated, and set at rest, and the
bitterness of death is sweetened. Doubtless to Moses, as to every one else, it
must have been naturally an awful thing to die; but inasmuch as the testimony of
God's grace is interposed, he does not hesitate to offer himself without alarm;
and Because he was firmly persuaded that the inheritance of the people would be
there set before his eyes, he cheerfully ascended to the place from which he was
to behold it. Already, indeed, by faith had he beheld the land, and the promise
of God had been, as it were, a lively representation of it; but; since some
remaining infirmities of the flesh still environ even the most holy persons, an
ocular view of it was no slight consolation, in order to mitigate the bitterness
of his punishment, when he knew that he was prevented from actually entering it
by the just sentence of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When it is said,
that God "showed<i> </i>him all the land," it could not have been the case
without a miracle. For, although history records that some have been endued with
incredible powers of vision, so as to have been able to see further than the
whole length of Canaan; there is still a peculiarity to be remarked in this
case, that Moses distinctly examined every portion of it, as if he had been
really on the spot. I allow, indeed, that Naphtali, and Ephraim, and Manasseh
are mentioned by anticipation, but, nevertheless, the Holy Spirit would express
that <i>every </i>part was shown to Moses, as if they were close beneath his
feet. Else the vision would have been but unsatisfactory and useless, if he had
not been allowed to behold the future habitation of the people. And to the same
effect<i> </i>is also what is afterwards added, that it was the land, which God
sware to give unto His servants; for otherwise the desire of Moses would not
have been satisfied, unless he had seen what a pleasant, fertile, and wealthy
region the sons of Abraham were about to
inhabit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So Moses the servant of the
Lord died.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since it was mark of ignominy
to die without the borders of the Holy Land, Moses is honored with high eulogy,
in order that the Israelites might learn the more to tremble at the judgment of
God, who did not spare even his most illustrious servant. And it is expressly
added, "according to the word (or mouth) of the Lord," lest they should despise
the threatenings which were accomplished in so memorable a manner. For, if God
spared not His own distinguished Prophet, but at length executed upon him what
He had threatened, how should the ordinary multitude escape?
</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, "he buried him,"<i> </i>some
render passively, "he was buried;"<i> </i>and others transitively, "he buried
himself;" but in both cases improperly; for, whilst they are afraid to assign
this office to God, they labor to avoid an absurdity which does not exist; since
it may be gathered from the end of the verse, that Moses was buried by divine
means, for it is said that his sepulcher is unknown. It is likely that an effort
to discover it was not omitted, or neglected to be made by the people; since it
would have been barbarous for them not to discharge the last offices of humanity
towards such, and so great a man. Since, therefore, no signs of his funeral, nor
his body itself, were anywhere to be found, it might be inferred that he was
hidden by God's determinate counsel; whilst it is superfluous to discuss in what
manner God buried him, inasmuch as all the elements are under His control. It
was enough, therefore, for Him to signify <i>(annuere) to </i>the earth, that it
was to receive the body of the holy man into its bosom: nor was there any
necessity to call in the assistance of angels, as some think, since the earth
would have instantly obeyed the command of its Creator. From the Epistle of Jude
(Jude 9) we learn that it was a matter of no slight importance that the
sepulcher of Moses should be concealed from the eyes of men, for he informs us
that a dispute arose respecting it. between Michael the archangel, and Satan:
and, although the cause of its concealment is not stated, still it appears to
have been God's intention to prevent superstition; for it was usual with the
Jews, and it is a custom for which Christ reproves them, to kill the prophets,
and then to pay reverence to their tombs.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421147&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
11:47.) It would have, therefore, been probable that, in order to blot out the
recollection of their ingratitude, they would have paid superstitious veneration
to the holy prophet, and so have carried his corpse into the land, from which
the sentence of God had excluded it. Timely precaution, then, was taken, lest in
their inconsiderate zeal the people should attempt to subvert the decree of
heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses was an hundred and
twenty years old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again he celebrates a
special favor of God, viz., that all the senses of Moses remained unimpaired to
extreme old age, in order that he might be fit for the performance of his
duties: for thus it was manifested how dear to God was the welfare of the
people, for which He so carefully provided. Some, indeed, though very few, are
found, who are capable of public government, even to their hundredth year.
Already, however, at that period, the rigor of the whole human race had so
diminished that, after their seventieth year, they dragged on their life in
"labor and sorrow," as Moses himself bears witness.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:10.) It was, consequently a conspicuous sign of the paternal favour wherewith
God regarded His people, that Moses should have been thus unusually preserved in
rigor and strength. If the powers of Moses had failed him long before their
entrance of the<i> </i>promised land, his debility would have been very
inconvenient to the<i> </i>people: yet naturally he would not have been so long
sufficient for the performance of his onerous duties. It follows, then, that
when God did not suffer him to fail, He showed wonderful consideration for the
people's welfare. Mention is specially made of his eyes, by <i>synecdoche,
</i>yet the sum of the matter is this, that he was neither imbecile nor feeble,
for neither were the faculties of his mind exhausted, nor his body dried
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It needs not that I expound at any length,
what is added respecting the solemn mourning, because I have elsewhere shown, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the ancients were particular in their attention to the performance of
funeral rites, on account of their faith not being as yet so elevated from the
measure of revelation they had received, as to be easily able to forego those
external aids to it, for which there is not the same necessity under the Gospel.
It is natural to man to mourn for the dead; and, besides, this mourning was
justly instituted in consequence of the loss which the Church had sustained; but
a ceremony is here recorded, which was brought to an end with the fulfillment of
the shadows of the Law. Our dead are, therefore, now to be buried in such a
manner as that our grief may be restrained by the hope of resurrection so
clearly revealed by the coming of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua the son of
Nun.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is again shown how perseveringly
God provided for the welfare of the people. We have already seen how, at the
request of Moses, Joshua was chosen to succeed him. Now, when he is about to
take upon him his office, "the<i> </i>spirit of wisdom" was imparted to him,
that it might be effectually manifested that he was appointed by God. He had
been, indeed, previously endowed with excellent gifts, but he was now much more
splendidly adorned with the ensigns of dignity, in order that his calling by God
might be more certainly proved; for thus is God wont to furnish those, whom He
calls, with capacity for action. The imposition of hands was also subjoined,
which was no empty symbol of God's grace. But inasmuch as I have already fully
spoken of these things, I now only lightly touch upon
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there arose not a
prophet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This eulogy seems to have been
added, that the children of Abraham might place dependence on Moses until the
manifestation of Christ; for although prophets were from time to time raised up,
still it was fitting that the superiority should remain with Moses, lest they
should decline in the smallest degree from the rule of the Law. It must be
concluded, therefore, that Moses was here placed in a position of supremacy, so
as to be superior to all the prophets; as also Malachi
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:4) exhorts the ancient people, in order that they may continue obedient to the
law of Moses. Two signs of his excellency are here recorded, namely, his
familiar acquaintance with God, and the glory of his miracles. We have elsewhere
seen that, by this prerogative, Moses was distinguished from the other prophets,
that God spake to him face to face. For, although Jacob makes the same
declaration respecting himself, still we know that God was more intimately
revealed afterwards to Moses; not indeed that He beheld His glory in its
perfection, but because<i>, </i>in comparison with others, he went beyond them
all. As regards miracles, though they were wrought by others, still none of them
came near to Moses in their performance.</font><br></div>

Thus, De Lyra; "It is not to be understood that anything was taken away from
Moses and given to the others, but they were illuminated without any- diminution
of the grace of Moses; thus, by the light of one candle others are lighted,
without any diminution of its own light." Ainsworth thus traces the gloss of De
Lyra to its source: "Neither<i> </i>was Moses' spirit hereby diminished; for as
Sol. Jarchi says, 'Moses in that hour was like unto the lamp that was left
(burning) in the candlestick (in the Sanctuary) from which all the other lamps
were lighted, yet the light thereof was not lessened any whit.'" So also St.
Augustine, "We understand that God would signify nothing more than that they
also would have assistance from the same Spirit of grace, as Moses had; that
they also should have as much as God pleased, not that Moses would therefore
have less. Quest. in Numbers 18. <i>Edit. Bened., tom. </i>3. P. 1. p. 535.

"Wherefore a people which obeyeth the precepts of the Lord, and feareth God,
ought to separate itself from a Prelate who is a sinner, nor mingle itself up
with the sacrifices of a sacrilegious priest, especially since it has itself the
power either of choosing worthy priests, or rejecting the unworthy. This, too,
we see to be derived from divine authority, that a priest should be chosen in
presence of the people, in sight of all, and be approved worthy and fit by
public sentence and testimony; as in Numbers, the Lord commanded Moses, saying,
<i>Take Aaron thy brother, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up into the
mount, before all the congregation: and strip Aaron of his garments, and put
them upon Eleazar his son, and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and

that is, He instructs and shows us, that the ordinations of priests ought only
to be solemnized with the knowledge of the people standing by, that so by their
presence either the crimes of the wicked may be detected, or the merits of the
good proclaimed, and so the ordination be right and lawful, as having been

Josephus (Antiq. 2:10) has led some to suppose that she was Tharbis, daughter of
the king of Ethiopia. Augustin, however, <i>(Quaest. in Numbers 20</i>.,) and
the great majority of commentators, agree with <i>C.</i> in believing that she
was Zipporah, and not a second wife, as contended by Rosenmuller, Michaelis, and
others, The main difficulty arises from her being called a <i>Cushite, </i>which
our translators have followed 70. and <i>V.</i> in rendering "the Ethiopian."
Bochart endeavors to prove that the Cushites and Midianites were the same

Hengstenberg (Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch, vol. 2. p.
344,) discusses this point, in opposition to Vater and De Wette, though he
reminds us that "the discrepancy is no new discovery, but has been thoroughly
canvassed; compare Gerhard on Deut., p. 53." "That the contradiction is only
apparent (he says) is clear from

with the persons who sent out the spies, it appears from this passage that. not
merely Moses and Aaron, but also the congregation, had a share in giving the
commission. The author, therefore, cannot intend to <i>deny </i>this, when, in
verse 1 and 2, he refers the matter to God." "The sending out of the spies (he
further argues) was a part of God's plan, and hence was expressly commanded by
Him, as soon as its indispensable condition, the proposal on the part of the
people, had taken place. For one thing, it would insure to the well-disposed a
strengthening of their weak faith; on the other hand, it formed a part of God's
design, that the evil-disposed should take occasion by this undertaking to
manifest their unbelief, and be ripened by it for judgment, This design we learn
from the result, which can never be contrary to the design. If the divine
purpose was the essential point, and the proposal of the people the mere
<i>conditio sine qua non </i>of its being carried into effect, it will be easily
understood how the latter might be passed over in the Book of Numbers, although,
as we have already seen, it is pre-supposed. After what has been remarked,
Calvin's view of the mutual relation of the two passages will clearly appear to
be the correct
one."</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

11:28, which, as Hengstenberg remarks, was a topic of discussion as early as the
times of Justin Martyr. Hengstenberg reviews the three modes of meeting the
difficulty proposed, viz., 1. That he was so called in the earlier passages by
<i>prolepsis. </i>2. That Moses now only renewed the name. 3. That a statement
is here made of what had taken place a considerable time before. To this view he
himself inclines, and says, "That the author here first mentioned that he, whom
he had originally called simply Joshua, originally bore the name of Hoshea, was
not without good reason. What had been hitherto related of Joshua, belonged to
him as a servant of God; the sacred name was, therefore, properly employed. But
here Hoshea must stand; for he went to spy out the land, not as a servant of
Moses, but as one of the heads of the children of' Israel,' &#8212; one of the

days after the return of the spies, as ye had remained there before their
return. Again, the Hebrews themselves, in <i>Sealer Olam, </i>thus explain it,
Ye remained in Kadesh-barnea as many days as ye afterwards remained in all your
other stations together, viz., 19 years: for twice 19 make 38, to which if you
add the two years that had elapsed before they came to Kadesh-barnea, you will
have the forty years of their journeyings in the desert. Nothing like this,
however, can be gathered from our version, nor from the Hebrew either; for the
expression, 'according to the days that ye abode,' is merely a Hebrew form of
repetition, explanatory of what had preceded, and meaning ' for a long time.'

commentators respecting this word. Holden says, "There is nothing in the Hebrew
answering to the word <i>men, </i>and the verb is in the singular number; the
received version, therefore, can scarcely be correct. The most easy and natural
construction of the original is, 'And Korah took (i.e., won over, or drew into a

Corn. a Lapide has a curious note on "the death of the righteous," contrasting
the happy deaths of some, whom he deemed righteous, with those of others, whom
he counted enemies of the Church. Amongst the latter he refers to Calvin
himself. "Calvin, excruciated, according to Beza, by divers diseases, was in
addition preyed upon by lice, as Jerome Bolsec, a physician of Lyons, and
formerly his disciple, reports in his Life, ch. 22. Hence observe, that those
who persecute the Church, were, by God's just judgment, eaten by worms. Such was
the case with Huneric, Herod, Antiochus, the emperors Maximinianus and
Arnulphus, and
Calvin."</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft158</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

This word has occasioned much discussion among the commentators.<i> A. V.</i>
subjoins in the margin: "<i>Heb.</i> who had his eyes shut, <i>but now</i>
opened." Ainsworth says: <i>"Shethum</i>, the original word, is of contrary
significance to <i>Sethum, </i>that is, <i>closed </i>or <i>shut up;
</i>however, some take it to be of the same meaning, which may then be explained
thus, <i>The man </i>who had his <i>eye</i> <i>shut, </i>but now open. And
<i>eye</i> is put for <i>eyes, </i>understanding the eyes of his mind opened by
the spirit of prophecy; though some of the Hebrews (as Jarchi here observeth)
have from hence conjectured that Balaam was blind of one eye!" Dathe, in
accordance with the most ancient interpreters, (<i>LXX.</i> Onkelos, and the
Syriac,) agrees with the text of <i>A.
V.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft168</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>A. V.</i>  "And in the hidden<i> part </i>thou shalt make me to know wisdom."
<i>C.'s </i>exposition <i>in loco </i>appears rather to agree with. <i>A. V.</i>
than with his citation in this place. "Some interpret

<i>besathum, </i>as if he here declared that God had discovered secret mysteries
to him, or things hidden from the human understanding. He seems rather to mean
that wisdom had been discovered to his mind in a secret and intimate manner."

reconcile them, as it is no unusual thing, when it is not intended to number

among the Romans there were those that received the name of <i>ceatumviri,
</i>(the <i>hundred,) </i>while in reality there were two above the hundred. As
there were, therefore, about twenty-four thousand that were overthrown by the
Lord's hand &#8212; that is, above twenty-three thousand, Moses has set down the

There has been much discussion amongst the commentators on this point. The
conclusion to which Dr. Kitto comes, after due examination of the opposite
theory, is, that "the river of Egypt," when mentioned as a boundary, cannot mean
the Nile. "The present 'river of Egypt' (he adds) probably denotes a stream
which formed the extreme boundary of the country eastward of the Nile, which
Egypt, even in these early times, professed to claim, and which derived its name
from that circumstance. It was probably not far from El-Arish, to which, under
the name of Rhinocorura, it is expressly referred by the Septuagint. That it was
a stream somewhere between the southern frontier of Palestine and the Nile we
are deeply convinced." &#8212; Illustr. Com., <i>in</i>
