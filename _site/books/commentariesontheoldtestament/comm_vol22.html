PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">AN INTEREST of no ordinary kind is excited in the
mind of the Biblical Student by the mention of&#8221; CALVIN&#8217;S LECTURES ON
EZEKIEL.&#8221; The last Work which a great man leaves unfinished, because
arrested by the hand of death, becomes at once an heirloom to posterity. After
the lapse of nearly three hundred years, we read this affecting sentence with a
tear and a sigh: &#8220;When this last Lecture was completed, that most
illustrious man JOHN CALVIN, who had previously been weakened by sickness, then
became so much worse that he was compelled to lie on his couch, and could not
proceed further in his explanation of Ezekiel: This is the reason why he stopped
at the end of the twentieth chapter, and did not complete the work so happily
begun.&#8221; Afflicted as CALVIN was for the last few years of his life, the
wonder is that he accomplished so much in preaching, lecturing, and dictating;
and although we have still to mourn over so much unfinished, we are filled with
astonishment at the labors he achieved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The vigor of his mind and the stores of his learning
are amply displayed in his COMMENTARY ON EZEKIEL. And that the modern reader may
enter fully into those valuable explanations of the text which he will find in
the ensuing pages, it will be desirable to furnish him with a slight sketch of
the times in which this Prophet lived. We shall then add such critical remarks
as may illustrate our Author&#8217;s exposition of the Sacred
Text.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Thy sons shall be eunuchs in the palace of the
king of Babylon,&#8221; were the ominous words of ISAIAH to a king of Judah, and
after the lapse of a century they were fulfilled to the letter. Kings, and
priests, and nobles, and people were all swept away by the remorseless monarch,
and planted here and there along the lenny banks of the river Chebar. There
EZEKIEL pined in misery among three thousand captives of rank, who, according to
JOSEPHUS, graced the triumph of NEBUCHADNEZZAR. Either a priest or the son of a
priest, (for the sense is doubtful,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
1:4,) here he was compelled to linger during twenty-two years of his life, while
he was wrapt in prophetic vision, and carried on the wings of the soul to the
city of his fathers. Here he tarried in body, while his spirit was at home with
the Cherubim within the Temple, among their wings and wheels, and burning
movements, and mysterious brightness. Here he often gazed upwards into the
firmament above him, and in the clear azure of an eastern sky beheld the
sapphire throne, and the appearance of the glory of JEHOVAH resting majestically
upon it! Here he experienced the prophetic inspiration, and was strengthened to
proclaim in JEHOVAH&#8217;S Name the mysteries of punishments and desolation. He
was permitted to enunciate the great truths of GOD&#8217;S moral government of
his ancient ones &#8212; to proclaim the eternal connection between obedience
and happiness, transgression and ruin. Nor was he alone in his declarations of
vengeance against every man &#8220;that setteth up his idols in his
heart.&#8221; When he entered on his office, Jeremiah had completed the
thirty-fourth year of his apostleship, and was contemporary with him for at
least eight years. Amidst insult, obloquy, and scorn, he proclaimed before the
faithless king the coming hosts of the Chaldeans; while ZEPHANIAH was still
prophesying in JUDAEA, and DANIEL proclaiming the power of holiness in the land
of BABYLON.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">EZEKIEL is remarkably silent as to his personal
history, so that we are unable to ascertain his age, at either the commencement
or the close of his mission. JOSEPHUS supposes him to have been but a youth when
hurried from the land of his fathers, but HAVERNICK remarks with justice, that
he displays so fully the matured character of a priest in his intimate
acquaintance with the details of the Temple service, that he may well be
supposed to have attained the age of thirty before his removal.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f1</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The death of his wife is the only personal
event to which he refers, in the ninth year of the Captivity,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;262418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
24:18,) and it seems probable that he spent the whole of his remaining life on
the banks of the Chebar. He had evidently acquired a commanding influence over
his fellow-prisoners, as their elders frequently came to enquire concerning
GOD&#8217;S message at his lips. (Ezekiel 8; Ezekiel 19; Ezekiel 20; Ezekiel 23)
The traditions respecting his death are various, but as they rest on no solid
foundation, they may be permitted to die out in the obscurity of intentional
silence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before we can enter with satisfaction into any views
of the style and interpretation of an ancient author, it is desirable to
ascertain the genuineness and authenticity of the writing on which we are about
to comment. And as Biblical Criticism has made great pretensions to advancement
since the time of CALVIN, it becomes necessary for his modern Editor to be in
some degree acquainted with its progress, to be prepared to state some definite
conclusions for the guidance of less instructed enquirers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the GENUINENESS OF EZEKIEL&#8217;S WRITINGS, it
has never been seriously called in question by the learned, either Jew or
Christian. Some self-sufficient Critics have impugned the last nine chapters:
Their valueless arguments will be found, by those who wish to search for such
unsatisfactory materials, in ROSENMULLER, while their refutation is completed by
JAHN, in his Introduction to the Sacred Books of the Old Testament, and is
rendered accessible to the mere English reader by HARTWELL HORNE
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So little weight, however, is attached to such opinions, that even GESENIUS
allows a &#8220;oneness of tone&#8221; to be so conspicuous throughout
EZEKIEL&#8217;S Prophecies, as to forbid the suspicion that any portions of them
are not genuine. This Book formed part of the Canon in the Catalogues of MELITO
and ORIGEN, of JEROME and of the TALMUD. JOSEPHUS, indeed, refers to two Books
of EZEKIEL, probably dividing his <i>prophecies </i>into two parts. His
language<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F3</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">has necessarily given rise to some
discussion, which EICHHORN has set at rest as satisfactorily as the data will
allow.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE VARIOUS PREDICTIONS has been
the subject of a variety of opinions. Some have supposed that Chronological
Order has been interfered with, and that different collections of the separate
Prophecies might be made with advantage. But HAVERNICK, in his valuable
Commentary, published as late as 1843, maintains that the present arrangement is
correct. It proceeds, he asserts, in the order of time, and connects,<i> </i>as
it ought to do, the Prophecies against foreign nations with those against Israel
and Judah. Hence he divides the Book into the following nine Sections:
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The Call to the Prophetic Office. (Ezekiel 1-3:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The Symbolical Representations foretelling the destruction of Judah and
Jerusalem.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
4:16 through Ezekiel 7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino"> A
Series of Visions, a year and two months later than the former. In these he is
shown the Temple polluted by the worship of Adonis, the consequent vengeance on
the priests and people, and the prospect of happier times and a purer worship.
(Ezekiel 8-11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino"> A
Series of Reproofs and Warnings against the prevailing sins and prejudices of
his day. (Ezekiel 12-19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
Another Series of Warnings, one year later, still announcing the coming
judgments. (Ezekiel 20-23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
Predictions, two years and five months later, announcing the very day of the
SIEGE OF JERUSALEM, and assuring the captives of its complete overthrow.
(Ezekiel 24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
Predictions against Foreign Nations. (Ezekiel 25-32.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
After the Destruction of the City, The Future Triumph of The Kingdom of God on
Earth. (Ezekiel 33-39.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
Symbolic Representations of THE TIMES OF MESSIAH, and the prosperity of the
Kingdom of God. (Ezekiel 40-48.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a negative merit in CALVIN&#8217;S LECTURES,
which has not been imitated by some later Commentators. He never makes those
observations on EZEKIEL&#8217;S STYLE AND DICTION which would reduce him to the
level of a merely human writer. GROTIUS and EICHHORN, LOWTH and MICHAELIS dwell
on his erudition and genius, and assign him the same rank among the Hebrews
which AESCHYLUS holds among the Greeks. They praise his knowledge of
architecture, and his skill in oratory. They call him bold, vehement, tragical;
&#8220;in his sentiments elevated, warm, bitter, indignant; in his images
fertile, magnificent, harsh, and sometimes almost deformed; in his diction
grand, weighty, austere, rough, and sometimes uncultivated; abounding in
repetition, not for the sake of ornament and gracefulness, but through
indignation and violence.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f5</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such language as this clearly implies a very
different view of the Prophet&#8217;s character and mission from that taken by
CALVIN. He looked upon him as a grand instrument in the hands of THE MOST HIGH,
and would have instinctively felt it to be profane thus to reduce him to the
level of the Poets and Seers of heathenism. In this feeling we ought to concur.
The modern method of criticizing the style and matter of THE HEBREW PROPHETS
deserves our warmest reprobation. They are too often treated as if their
thoughts and their language were only of human origin. Their visions, their
metaphors, and their parables, are submitted to the crucible of a worldly
alchemy, in entire forgetfulness that these men were the special messengers of
GOD. To them it was commanded &#8212; &#8220;The word that I shall say unto
thee, that shalt thou speak.&#8221; &#8220;Thou canst not go beyond the word of
THE LORD,<i> </i>to say less or more.&#8221; It is not for us to speak, as
Bishop Lowth does, of a &#8220;remarkable instance of that exaggeration which is
deservedly esteemed the characteristic of this poet.&#8221; And again, of
&#8220;an image, suggested by the former part of this Prophecy, happily
introduced and well pursued.&#8221; All such language as this, whether in praise
or blame of the imagery and expressions of the Prophets of the Old Testament, is
highly irreverent. It is scarcely consistent with simple and confiding views of
Divine inspiration. They assume principles of interpretation, and of exegesis,
totally at variance with that implicit confidence in the plenary inspiration of
the Prophets, with which the early reformers were imbued.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And what have we gained by listening to the teachers
of MODERN GERMANY, and passing by as antiquated the giant expounders of GENEVA?
The question is an important one, and the answer to it implies much laborious
reading and much patient thought. It requires some acquaintance with the writers
on Biblical hermeneutics from CALVIN&#8217;S time to our own &#8212; some
symmetry of mind to pass a judicial sentence with candor and precision. This, at
least, the casual reader may perceive, viz., a striking difference between the
modern Neologian and the ancient Genevan tone in treating these sublime
subjects; and the question will recur, what shall we gain by deserting CALVIN
and taking up with EICHHORN? That we may present the readers with some data for
estimating fairly our defense of CALVIN, we will make a few extracts from this
well-known writer, selecting him simply as an average specimen from many others
of even greater celebrity. In the 545th section of his introduction to the Old
Testament,<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F6</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">he speaks of his &#8220;originality,&#8221;
of &#8220;the lively fiction of his inexhaustible imagination,&#8221; and of his
&#8220;gathering materials for his poems.&#8221; In a few sections afterwards he
adds, that his poems are &#8220;inventions,&#8221; and &#8220;a work&#8221; of
art,<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F7</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and &#8220;manifest the wild shoots of a
heated imagination.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F8</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If this be the result of the elaborate researches of
modern times, then we may surely throw ourselves back into the arms of older and
sounder Commentators. They never delight in banishing THE ALMIGHTY from his own
Word: they never treat him as a stranger in his own land. His agency is with
them no intermitting tide, carrying a shifting wave of glory from strand to
strand, and leaving only a dreary waste of centuries between, strewed only with
the wrecks of his broken workmanship. The long line of Hebrew Seers were either
inspired of GOD, or their writings are deceptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Men of CALVIN&#8217;S faith and devotion believed
that beneath the surface of their imagery, and parables, and oriental diction,
lay concealed a living power which energized all this glowing machinery, which
marshaled the thoughts within the speaker&#8217;s mind, and then clothed them in
the burning words and the glowing phrases which spoke alternately either joy or
sadness to the hearer&#8217;s soul. If the proverb of the Royal Sage is true
&#8212; &#8220;Death and life are in the power of the tongue,&#8221; then the
Master-mind of the Divine Artist touched EZEKIEL&#8217;S tongue with living
flame, and gave his language more elevation, dignity, and majesty, than the most
exalted genius, or the richest imagination could accomplish. And if these views
be comforting and refreshing to the soul, we &#8220;gain a loss&#8221; by
passing away from GENEVA, as it was to Neology as it is. For where are we to
stop in our downward course? When we allow ourselves to speak of the traditional
creation-week of MOSES, or the rocks on which EZEKIEL stranded, we are hastening
on the high road to the myths of STRAUSS, or the pantheism of EMERSON and
PARKER.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The voice of an Apostle should still sound in our
ears.&#8221; Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy or vain
deceit,&#8221; when we find M. COMTE, in his remarkable work
<i>&#8220;</i>Cours<i> </i>de Philosophic Positive,&#8221; speaking of a radical
incompatibility between Theology and positive Philosophy &#8212; treating as
chimerical all attempts to reconcile Modern <i>Science </i>with Divine
Revelation, and in reliance on the irresistible tendency of our present
scientific speculations, entertaining the hope of getting rid of the
&#8220;Hypothesis of a God.&#8221; (Tome 4:51. Lecon.) Our wisdom lies in
resisting the first temptation to this downward progress. If we allow Exchhorn
and Gesenius to lead us into discussions about the Prophet&#8217;s &#8220;polite
genius&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
instead of his divine inspiration, and to attribute his language to the temper
and talent of the man instead of to the guiding power of GOD&#8217;S HOLY
SPIRIT, then there is no step of skepticism and infidelity which we may not
ultimately reach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This warning proceeds from no blind admirer of
antiquated error, and from no thoughtless despiser of modern science. Let us
have the freest and fullest right of search into all the language of Ancient
Prophecy: we claim and we court the minutest investigations, while an experience
of no limited extent leads us to reject the haughty boastings of the last new
skeptics over the writings of men, within the fringes of whose shadow the
present generation are not worthy to tread.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may now fairly <i>be </i>enquired, how far
CALVIN&#8217;S INTERPRETATIONS OF THE VISIONS OF EZEKIEL have been superseded by
the <i>researches </i>of modern times? And it may also be asked, whether the
speculations of modern German divines &#8212; the children of the Reformation
&#8212; have set aside the Biblical hermeneutics of their great forerunner?
Those questions are worthy of our attentive replies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The general principle of CALVIN&#8217;S
Interpretation of The Visions of EZEKIEL is an immediate appeal to the
miraculous interposition of GOD. He saw in them GOD acting directly and
powerfully on the Prophet&#8217;s mind, and through him on the people. He did
not consider them as merely illustrating GOD&#8217;S general Providence and
government of the world, or as portraying any ordinary operations of his grace
in the souls of the people; he looked upon them as representing a miraculous and
visible <i>interference </i>with the ordinary laws of the Nation&#8217;s
discipline. His perception of the obstinacy, ingratitude and perverseness of the
<i>Jews </i>was so great, that he <i>considered </i>their remarkable idolatry
and profaneness justified any breach of the laws of nature, with the view of
restoring them to <i>obedience, </i>and securing their salvation. The moral end
to be attained always appeared to him to justify the physical disturbance of the
laws which regulate our outward existence. The inestimable value of the soul,
when compared with anything earthly, rendered no miracle improbable to his mind,
if it only tended to that ultimate result.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Comparing the Interpretations of CALVIN with those of
modern Continental Divines, we have no reason to conclude that the views of the
great Reformer have been superseded. The progress of Biblical Criticism during
the last 800 years has indeed been accompanied with some clearer views of the
details, but the fundamental principles of these LECTURES ON EZEKIEL have never
been successfully impugned. The MIRACLES of the Old Testament have been boldly
assailed, both at home and abroad, and no slight outpouring of infidel wrath has
fallen upon the CALVIN interpretation of those of EZEKIEL. GERMANY, the
birthplace of the REFORMATION, has been also the seed-bed of spurious
Rationalism. The novelty of any opinion on Biblical subjects has now become a
sufficient atonement for its absurdity, and he receives the greatest applause
from the many, who casts farthest from him whatsoever has commanded the
veneration of ages. The direct interposition of JEHOVAH&#8217;S power in the
affairs of men, as related in the writings of the Hebrews, has lately exercised
the ingenuity of German skeptics to an almost incredible extent. The mysticism
of the School of SCHELLING has rivaled the extravagancies of the theory of
accommodation proposed by the celebrated SEMLER.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Professors of theology in various celebrated
Universities have arisen, who have rejected with contempt whatever portion of
the Old Testament they could not reconcile with their own individual reason, and
who have rested their instruct, ions on gratuitous assertions and groundless
hypotheses, which make a larger demand on our credulity than the Miracles do on
our faith. EICHHORN, BONSDORF, ROSENMULLER, and WEGSCHEIDER, are names with
which the reader of Foreign Theology has become too familiar. Their theories
have now given place to many a later development, including the speculative
Christology of SCHLEIERMACHER, and the fanciful myths of STRAUSS. Highly as we
value some of the grammatical and philosophical labors of this School of
Hebraists, we cannot but deem them morally incompetent to be our guides in
Scriptural interpretation. Far from despising the showy guesses of genius, or
the solid treasures of learning, we would pause before we tender the homage of
our admiration to those who profess to reconcile the study of Divinity with what
they term The Enquiring Spirit of the Age. Our reverence must not be withdrawn
from the piety and simplicity of a CALVIN, to be prostituted to the praise of a
paradoxical erudition, or a perverted ingenuity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is our view of CALVIN as a COMMENTATOR
overstated, in the opinion of one of the giants of orthodoxy of modern Germany.
HENGSTENBERG, who has earned undying repute by parrying the deadly thrusts of
the heroes of Rationalism, DR. WETTE VON BOHLEN, VATKE and HITZIG, characterizes
CALVIN by saying &#8212; &#8220;This man stands still farther above his
followers than above his predecessors. One cannot sufficiently wonder how such a
leader could have had such followers . . . . It is impossible for any man who
had carefully studied the Commentaries of CALVIN to become so thoroughly and
consistently superficial, as all of them show themselves to be.&#8221; For
instance both VON BOHLEN and VATKE have asserted that there is no trace of the
existence of the PENTATEUCH in the Older Prophets, and hence they have invented
an <i>argumentum a silentio, </i>on which they lay it down as an axiom, that the
Older Prophets knew nothing of the Pentateuch, and that the Law was for the
first time committed to writing about the times of EZEKIEL!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Doctrines such as these have been industriously
propagated by three critics of great influence, viz., SPENCER, LE CLERC, and J.
D. MICHAELIS. The labors of SPENCER in his work <i>De</i> <i>Legibus Hebraeorum
Ritualibus, </i>have, in recent times, found a kindred spirit in the virulent
hostility of STRAUSS. In both there is the same icy coldness, the same religious
weakness, the same attempt to destroy that sense of GOD&#8217;S presence, so
conspicuously honored in CALVIN&#8217;S COMMENTS on this Prophet and the others.
SPENCER denies all spiritual meaning to the Visions of GOD&#8217;S agents, and
to the appearances of the Cherubim, allowing, indeed, at times, a <i>ratio
mystica et typica, </i>but retracting it immediately on spiritual meaning being
alluded to. The grossness of his idea of GOD, and the lowness of his views of
symbolical interpretation, may be judged of from the following passage: &#8212;
&#8220;Deus interim, ut superstirtoni quovis pacto irefur obviam, ritus non
paneos, mulforum annorum et gentiurn usu cohonestatos, quos ineptias norat esse
tolerabiles in sacrorum suorum numerum adoptavit.&#8221; This shallow and
shortsighted system spread rapidly among those who boasted themselves to be
disciples of the early Reformation, because they no longer appreciated the
spiritual nature of the Prophetic symbols, as so ably explained by CALVIN in his
Lectures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After SPENCER we have LE CLERC, who is as superficial
and as unsatisfying as most Arminians of his School. Whatever indicates a living
GOD &#8212; taking interest in the punishment or the consolation of the Hebrews,
sending them Prophets to warn and to threaten &#8212; he calls anthropomorphism.
He only plays with the husk, and finds no kernel. He had a kind of horror of any
superhuman interposition: Miracle and Prophecy were alike rejected; everything
beyond the operation of merely natural causes was put out of sight and artfully
explained away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At length MICHAELIS, in his <i>Mosaisches Recht,
</i>Mosaic Jurisprudence, and in his Annotations for the Unlearned, labored most
assiduously to unsettle the foundations of the Biblical Writings as
inspired.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Modern School, who look down contemptuously upon
THE CREDULITY OF THE EARLY REFORMERS, and fancy themselves emancipated from the
trammels of their narrow systems, boasts in its skill of detecting truth by
means of INTERNAL EVIDENCE. This is a weapon of two-edged power; and if used in
the spirit of an earnest and sober criticism, may be used successfully in
support, of the integrity of the Ancient Scriptures. Let the reader, in turning
over these Lectures on EZEKIEL, endeavor to discover traces of the previous
existence of The Pentateuch: let him do for this Prophet what HAVERNICK has done
with reference to HOSEA and AMOS &#8212; scrutinizing their writings line by
line, and tracing such expressions and idioms as prove them to have been
familiar with The Mosaic Writings, and he will become familiar with the true use
of this important instrument of Biblical Exegesis. Let him afterwards consult
with diligence and apply with discretion the principles of HENGSTENBERG&#8217;S
<i>Christologie des Alter Testaments. </i>He will find it profoundly learned and
unweariedly laborious, illustrating fully the intimations of Ancient Prophecy
respecting Messiah&#8217;s Kingdom. The reader, who has set himself at the feet
of CALVIN, will discover it to be a most satisfactory exposition of these
Predictions. Its candor, and honesty, and accomplished philology, stand out in
strong contrast with the arrogance of the Rationalists, and rebukes by its
enlightened orthodoxy the reckless skepticism of their system.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor are such cautions without their use among
ourselves. The inferences from supposed Internal Evidence have, even in our own
country, been most wild and baseless. What must be our own danger, when an
intimate friend of SOUTHEY, COLERIDGE, and MACKINTOSH, whose writings produced
some influence on the literature of the day, could gravely put forward the
following expose of his views: <i>&#8220;I </i>have attained the inference that
<i>the feast of Purlin </i>is the Magophonia of DARIUS; the 31st EZEKIEL an
elegy on the death of CYRUS killed by the Massagetae; and the 14th Isaiah an
elegy on the death of CAMBYSES, both by the same author; whom, on the ground of
internal evidence, I am venturing to separate from among the different Prophets,
and to call DANIEL, and who is, I think, the finest ode writer in the world.
Nay, DANIEL is to claim of EZEKIEL 25 to 32, and EZEKIEL 35 to 39; of JEREMIAH
46 to 51; and of ISAIAH 13 to 23, and ISAIAH 11 to 13; but of this last
allotment I am doubtful.&#8221; Here we have a fair specimen of the manner in
which every unsound opinion may be propagated under the specious plea of
respecting the Internal Evidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another extract from the correspondence of this
writer will fully justify the warning which we have sounded against the
influence of such sophistical comments. &#8220;I am busied now in Theology, and
have actually drawn up a paper, &#8216; Who wrote the Wisdom of Solomon?&#8217;
which has for its object to prove that Jesus Christ wrote it: partly from the
Internal Evidence of passages descriptive of him, partly from the External
Evidence of the extreme veneration in which the Book was held by the Apostolic
characters.&#8221; These verily are the men of our day &#8212; the enlightened
teachers of a liberal Theology &#8212; the despisers of antiquated credulity
&#8212; and the authors of a new and improved method of interpreting the Oracles
of our God!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The charge of credulity may be answered by showing
that even some of the chiefs of the Rationalist School have not been free From
Its Influence. The Scholars Of Europe Have Not Yet Forgotten That GESENIUS was
imposed upon by the clumsy forgery of WAGENFELD, who pretended to have
discovered a Oreck Translation of the lost Books of Sanchuniatho in a Portuguese
monastery.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Had he relied a little more on External than Internal Evidence, had he demanded
a sight of the Greek Manuscript, and also of the alleged Phoenician stone, he
would have saved the discredit of the discovery that a <i>patois </i>of Arabic,
Maltese, and Italian was palmed upon him for Phoenician, and that the celebrated
<i>Lapis Lydius </i>of VOLNEY will ever after serve as a landmark to indicate
the credulity of this self-satisfied septic.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How painfully interesting it has become to the reader
of CALVIN to be made acquainted with the manner in which his views of Prophetic
Interpretation have been received and adopted by later Biblical Scholars of the
Continent. Three hundred years have allowed ample time for the refutation or
elucidation of his Comments. The Christian Scholar who still holds fast the form
of sound words received through the earliest Reformers, must grievously lament
the sad degeneracy of Continental Theology. And it may here be desirable to take
a slight review of the growth and progress of theories totally opposite to those
of CALVIN, that, by comparison, the soundness of this illustrious Expounder may
become most conspicuous. For the opportunity of doing so, concisely and
accurately, we are indebted to a small treatise of DR. THOLUCK&#8217;S,
<i>Vermischte Schriften grosstentheils Apologetischen Inhalts.
</i>(Miscellaneous writings for the most part Apologetical in their
import.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After the more stirring times of THE REFORMATION had
subsided into a peaceful calm, both the LUTHERANISM OF GERMANY, and the
CALVINISM OF SWITZERLAND and FRANCE, were subject to gradual yet powerful
changes. The pietism of SPENER and FRANCKE began to lose its hold over the minds
of succeeding generations of students. A new race arose, who were destitute of
their predecessors&#8217; deep and scriptural piety. INFIDELITY entered GERMANY
through its learned universities, not as it assailed FRANCE through wit and
mockery. The SCEPTICS soon rivaled the PIETISTS in the depth and variety of
their Hebrew scholarship, and in their anxiety to spread abroad their new
teaching. First came the philosophy of WOLF, who, after banishment from Halle,
by Frederick William 1st, returned again with renewed spirit to his labors, and
made many disciples. In Theology S. J. BAUMGARTEN became his most successful
follower. &#8220;It<i> </i>is incredible,&#8221; says THOLUCK, &#8220;with<i>
</i>what enthusiasm this teacher of the Theology of his time was listened to.
Above four hundred theologians, and seven jurists and physicians, sat at the
feet of the venerated man, and took down every, even the minutest, word that
fell from his lips. Scarcely another class could meet when BAUMGARTEN was
holding his! And, now, let any one compare his printed Prelections, as they have
come down to us, what dead schematism? what dry<sub> </sub>tablemaking! and the
whole dictated in the most longwinded style!&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next came the great apostle of Rationalism in Geneva.
the well known SEMLER, a scholar of Baumgarten&#8217;s &#8212; &#8220; a man
who, without founding any school of his own, yet carried the torch from which
the sparks darted upon the tinder which, on every hand, was scattered among his
contemporaries, and kindled a blaze which continues to the present moment. His
principle of criticism is thus stated by himself: &#8220;The only proof of the
Divine authority of a book arises from the internal conviction produced by the
truths therein contained; that is, <i>the fides divina, </i>which people, for
brevity&#8217;s sake, and also to have the advantage of a biblical, though
somewhat obscure mode of speech, have called the Testimony of the Holy Spirit in
the mind of the reader.&#8221; Hence, with regard to The Pentateuch, he adopts
the fragmentary hypothesis of SIMON and VITRINGA, &#8212; dismisses from the
Canon some of the Historical Books, and throws doubts upon others, which are
equally destructive in their tendency. Having set up his own standard of moral
improvement to be derived from any book, he sets aside DANIEL and THE
APOCALYPSE, as peculiarly unsuited to his views; while THE NEW TESTAMENT is
scarcely more acceptable to him in its integrity than the OLD. He treats both as
merely temporary and local in their character, as filled with accommodations and
modes of speaking adapted to the times, but not permanent for all time. His
principles, then, robbed the Scriptures of everything positive, and destroyed
the very basis on which objective and eternal truths must rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The most surprising portion of the narrative is the
unhappy influence of such Biblical views over others. There must have been a
preparation in the GERMAN mind, as well as in that of SWITZERLAND, before such
principles could be received. Had they been put forth in ENGLAND or in SCOTLAND,
they would have died an easy and a hasty death. The spark would never have been
raised to a flame, because the touchwood was happily absent. But melancholy is
the list., as given by THOLUCK, of the Universities and of eminent individuals
who gave the whole weight of their countenance to these pernicious doctrines.
Happily this learned writer, in companionship with NEANDER, OLSHAUSEN and
HENGSTENBERG, are permitted to witness the turn of the tide in favor of the long
despised Evangelism which so thoroughly pervades these LECTURES OF CALVIN ON
EZEKIEL.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In reviewing the manner in which CALVIN has lectured
on the single words and separate phrases of EZEKIEL, the mind is naturally led
to contemplate his theory of the Theopneustia of the Prophets. No question in
Theology has been more fruitful in discussion than that of THE INSPIRATION OF
THE HEBREW PROPHETS: it could hardly be otherwise, as their position, as the
chief heralds of the future Christianity, forms a preliminary part of The
Evidences of The Christian Faith. However lofty and sublime may be the Writings
of the Prophets, yet their Divine Authority cannot be fully impressed, without
we are persuaded that they are inspired. But a question has always arisen, what
is that supernatural and infallible guidance which we understand by <i>, </i>or
inspiration? Does it extend to every word that is uttered by the Prophet, or
simply to the material and spirit of his message? CALVIN, and The Early
Reformers, from the very<sub> </sub>necessity of their position, contended for
the Verbal Inspiration of the entire Scriptures. On these, and these alone, they
took their stand against The Corruptions of Rome, and they were necessarily
compelled to strengthen their position by every imaginable effort, to uphold the
authority of the Written Letter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In these days, this is too often called an
&#8220;antiquated hypothesis,&#8221;<i> </i>and treated as an &#8220;exploded<i>
</i>theory;<i>&#8221; </i>but it is important to observe that the wisest and
most learned Christian Commentators have adhered to it, though not, perhaps,
with the strictness of CALVIN&#8217;S literal views. M. TWESTEN in Germany, and
M. TURRETIN, J. F. STOPFER, and B. PICTET of Switzerland, men eminent for their
piety and usefulness, have upheld the Existence, Universality, and Plenitude of
Inspiration, though their views involve a slight modification of the sentiments
of the Early Reformers. A few references to their Works may here be appropriate,
as they are not easily accessible to the English reader. The writings of
HENDERSON, PYE SMITH, DICK, and WILSON, are too accessible to need quotation
here, but it may be desirable to know what the Modern Pietists of the Continent,
who are foremost in the struggle with Neology, feel to be truth on these
important points.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">M. TWESTEN, in his <i>Vorlesung uber die Dogmatik,
</i>extends the idea of Inspiration to all parts of the Bible, but not in an
equal degree to every portion.<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f11</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This inequality of Inspiration is held as
accompanied with the admission of verbal errors, which the lapse of time now
renders irremediable. But it is by no means unconnected with clear views of
evangelical truth, calmness of thought, and sagacity of discrimination, though
not altogether free from the speculative tendencies of the German
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">M. TURRETIN, a well known divine of that land which
was formerly adorned with the graces and piety of the masterspirits of the Swiss
Reformation, in his <i>Institutio Theologiae Elementicae, </i>shows how
Scripture proves itself Divine, not only by an authoritative appeal to
testimony, but by undoubted proofs of its Divinity. &#8220;But,&#8221;<i> </i>he
afterwards adds, &#8220;it must not be supposed that these tokens of Divinity
shine forth alike and in the same degree in all the Books of Scripture; for as
one star differs from another star in brightness, so some Books emit fuller and
more dazzling rays of light, and others fewer and feebler, according as they are
more or less necessary to the Church, and contain doctrines of more or less
moment: so that the Gospels and The Pauline Epistles glow with far richer
splendor than the Book of Ruth or Esther.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The language of John FRID. STOPFER is in some degree
similar. He distinguishes &#8220;The things written in Scripture by the
immediate Inspiration of the Holy Spirit from those which are committed to
writing only by the Direction of the Holy Spirit. To the former class belong all
The Peculiar Doctrines of Salvation, which as they could not be discovered by
the principles of reason, could not be made known but by Revelation: to the
latter class belong&#8217; all those Truths which, though previously known,
required to be inculcated on man, both to arouse him to a sense of his duty and
to convince him of his need of a Revealed Salvation. The same class also
includes the Historical Facts connected with the illustration and proof of
Revealed Doctrines, and pointing out the various steps of Revelation, in the
bestowments of grace and in the ministrations of the Church, all of which
require to be known, for the fuller explanation of Divine Truth.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>Christian Theology </i>of M. B. PICTET we
find the following passage:<i> &#8212; &#8220;</i>I1 n&#8217;est pas necessaire
de supposer que l&#8217;Esprit de Dieu a toujours diete aux prophetes et aux
apotres tousles mots dont ils se sont servis, et qu&#8217;il leur a appris tout
ce qu&#8217;ils ecrivoient. Il suffit qu&#8217;ils n&#8217;ont rien ecrit, que
par la direction immediate do l&#8217;Esprit de Dieu en sorte que cot Esprit
n&#8217;a jamais permis, qu&#8217;ils aient erre dans ce qu&#8217;ils out ecrit.
Agobard, auteur du 9 siecle, dans sa reponse a Fredigise, dit, que c&#8217;est
une absurdite de croire que le Sainct Esprit ait inspire les termes et les
mots... Cependant c&#8217;etoit l&#8217;Esprit qui les empechoit de tomber dans
aucune erreur, non pas meme dans les moindres cheses.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Theopneustia of M. GAUSSEN is SO well known,
through the English Translation,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f15 
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that it is only necessary to say, that his
view of the Plenary Inspiration of Scripture is more stringent than that of our
own Writers, DODDRIDGE, DICK, PYE SMITH, and HENDERSON. He contends for
&#8220;the existence, universality, and plenitude of Theopneustia,&#8221; and
condemns the theories of those English Divines who &#8220;have<i> </i>gone so
far as to specify four degrees of Divine Inspiration.&#8221; All these
distinctions are in his view &#8220;chimerical: The Bible itself does not
authorize them: the Church during the first eight centuries of the Christian era
knew nothing of them; and we believe them to be erroneous and fraught with
evil.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having thus glanced at a few of the views of the
successors of CALVIN among his own countrymen, it will not be necessary to
advert to the subject at greater length. It will be enough to refer the reader
of CALVIN ON EZEKIEL to DR. HENDERSON&#8217;S able work on Divine Inspiration,
being the fourth series of the Congregational Lectures delivered during 1836. He
will there find the difficult questions connected with the subject ably,
judiciously, and satisfactorily discussed. It is only necessary to mention so
accessible a volume to induce the student of CALVIN to apply to it for guidance
and instruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another boast in which the Rationalists indulge over
the early Reformers, consists in their more extensive use of Rabbinical
Literature. Hence it becomes necessary to investigate their claim to superior
talent and research in turning to account these stores of Cabalistic tradition.
We cannot thoroughly estimate the comparative value of the Commentaries of the
old and new Reformers, without being well-versed in the contents of the TARGUMS
and the follies of the GEMANA. POCOCKE and LIGHTFOOT, GROTIUS AND BOCHART,
ERNESTI AND KEIL have all made Rabbinical and Oriental Learning subservient to
the interpretation of the Hebrew Prophets; and in doing so have thrown great
light upon modes of expression, grammatical usages, and peculiar customs of the
Jews. And thus far we are greatly indebted to them. They have unlocked these
precious treasures of Eastern tradition with a learned and a liberal hand; they
have solved philological difficulties which did not yield to the perseverance
and ingenuity of CALVIN.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are not to be led away by the abuse of this
species of learning, in which some of the depreciators of orthodoxy have
indulged. Let the reader, for instance, turn to the Christology of the Jews, as
illustrated by BERTHOLDT of Erlangen; let him observe how he mingles the later
Hebrew Prophets, the Apocryphal Books, and the works of PHILO and JOSEPHUS, and
treats them as if on the same level of authority and value. The baseless
speculations of &#8220;The BOOK or ZOHAR,&#8221; and the extravagant conceits of
the &#8220;NEZACH ISRAEL,&#8221; are gravely used as the basis of philosophical
explanations, which are to supersede the plain, spiritual, and literal
interpretations of the holy men of old. The progress of Sacred Criticism, they
tell us, in the three centuries which have elapsed since the Reformation, calls
upon us to reject the errors of the Schoolmen at Geneva, but still we hesitate
to bow down to the dicta of these visionary theorists. We protest against the
improper use which they make of the unauthorized comments of foolish and
infatuated Jews. These perverters of the sense of Holy Scripture were utterly
ignorant of its Spirit. They are the very blindest leaders of the blind. They
are the most unspiritual guides, the most puerile corrupters of the Truth, the
most contemptible inventors of falsehood. And yet they are upheld as the very
authorities on which we are to receive philosophical novelties, and to throw
away the joys, and consolations, and blessings of the inspiration of Hebrew
Prophecy.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Again and again must we repeat the protest., and maintain the eternal principles
of childlike faith, and holy zeal, and persevering godliness which adorned and
consecrated the valuable labors of the calumniated TEACHER OF
SWITZERLAND.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In closing our notice of Foreign Theology, we are by
no means anxious to foster any undiscerning prejudice against German divinity.
We would discriminate between the tares and the wheat, while we protest against
the dreamy speculations, the unsound principles, the shallow reasoning, the
ostentatious and perverted scholarship, and the irreverent levity with which the
Neologians have violated every law of literary evidence, and shocked every
feeling of serious piety. On the other hand, we by no means desire to uphold any
cramped or exploded interpretation, or to justify any details in CALVIN&#8217;S
COMMENT ON EZEKIEL which are inconsistent with the real improvements in Hebrew
philology. Let but a spirit of disciplined humility prevail, and then our later
Churches may hope to rival the elder ones in the wisdom which is from above. The
patient and devout use of these additional means which are now within our reach,
will lead us to comprehend &#8220;the mind of the Spirit,&#8221; and enable the
Christian Commentator to east the living seed into the stream of time, in the
fullest confidence that a fruitful harvest of believers shall spring up, uniting
the docility of children with the intelligence of men and. the constancy of
martyrs. But to this end, the spirit of the Early Reformers must be cultivated:
the spirit of skeptical criticism must be abhorred. LORD BACON&#8217;S adage is,
alas, too often verified: &#8220;Certain there be that delight in giddiness, and
count it a bondage to fix a belief:&#8221; for in the discursive reading? which
we have found necessary for illustrating Calvin&#8217;s EZEKIEL, how often have
we met with writings on the Old Testament flippant and irreverent,
oscillating&#8217; for ever between fact and falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Holy page is still undefaced &#8212; it is the
eye of the self-sufficient Commentator which willingly gathers over it the misty
film: the balance of truth remains what it ever was, accurate and sensible: it
is the palsied hand which agitates the scales in ceaseless
alternation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While, however, we thus strenuously uphold the
general principles of Prophetic Inspiration which CALVIN taught, we are willing
to concede that many of his attempts to explain the text are unsatisfactory.
Thus, for instance, an exception may fairly be made against the conclusiveness
of his explanation of the appearance of the cherubim in the tenth chapter of
this Prophecy. He accounts for the appearance of the heads of an ox and a man, a
lion and an eagle on the same living creature, by asserting that it represents
the energizing power of GOD throughout animated nature. Not content with this
general and probably correct exposition, he goes on to derive the motion of all
living creatures from that of angels. &#8220;Now, when the Lion either roars or
exercises his strength, he seems to move by his own inherent power, and so it
may be said of other living creatures: but GOD here says that living beings are
in some sense parts of Angels, although not of the same
substance.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Instead of explaining how Angels are the powers
<i>(virtutes) </i>of GOD<i>, </i>and how he proves any &#8220;inseparable
connection&#8221; between angelic and creative motion, he draws this conclusion
from the mysterious emblems of the Cherubim: &#8220;Let<i> </i>us understand,
then, that while men move about and apply themselves to their various pursuits,
and when even wild beasts do the same, yet Angelic motions are underneath, so
that neither men nor animals move themselves, but their whole rigor depends on
this secret inspiration.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One is surprised that the acute and welltrained mind
of CALVIN did not perceive that this assertion only shifts the difficulty one
step farther back, and that it does not unfold one single law of either the life
or motion of animated nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The student of Theology, however, must not expect to
find in CALVIN the correct expositions of the laws of natural phenomena, &#8212;
the discoveries of the three last Centuries have thrown a flood of light on
physical and psychological science. Let the reader distinguish between the
theological and scientific explanations of these LECTURES; and while he allows
the latter to be capable of improvement through the gradual progress of human
knowledge, he will value the former as defending and upholding &#8220;the<i>
</i>truth of GOD.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It becomes necessary also to caution the reader that
he will find these LECTURES at times liable to the charge of <i>overexplanation.
</i>The Lecturer searches with microscopic scrutiny into the hidden meaning of
every minute portion of a sentence, and it sometimes occurs in his explanation
of Visions, Symbols, and Emblems, that he carries out his method of minute
subdivision and verbal comment too far. This concession will readily be made by
all who have perused the valuable treatise of GOTTLOB CH. STORR on Parabolic
Illustration, interspersed as it is with valuable References to LUTHER and
CHRYSOSTOM, ERNESTI and LESSING, COCCEIUS and PFAFF, WEMYSS and
BECKHAUS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must not be considered that CALVIN is depreciated,
because he is not idolized as infallible. It is now so customary for an Editor
to treat his author as a model of perfection, that it requires some degree of
moral courage to assert that CALVIN could possibly be indiscreet. The daily
experience of life, however, convinces us that the wisest, the holiest, and the
best are always fallible, and at times inconsiderate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may now be desirable to furnish the general reader
with a few facts concerning the celebrated GASPARD DE COLIGNY, to whom BEZA
dedicates these Lectures of his Master. To have been Grand Admiral of France
gives him no title to admiration in the eyes of those who seek for divine, and
heavenly, and soulsatisfying truth &#8212; but to have been a burning and
shining light in Christ&#8217;s Holy Church in the days of its struggles and
persecution, this may afford us an apology for introducing here a short account
of his Christian life, and his awful martyrdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He was born of a noble family which had been
connected with the Government of France for about three hundred years, and was
the second of three brothers, all eminent for their devotion to GOD&#8217;S
saving truth. The eldest became a Cardinal, and Gaspard consequently took
possession of the paternal estate as Seigneur of Chatillon. After serving his
country both by land and sea., and arriving at the high offices of both General
and Admiral, he retired for a while from the distractions of public life to his
residence at Chatillon, about the age of forty-three. Here both he and his
excellent wife, CHARLOTTE DE LA VAL, study together the Word of GOD, and grow
gradually stronger in the faith and hopes of the Gospel. Being&#8217; fully
aware of the suffering&#8217;s they must undergo, and the sacrifices they must
make, and in defiance of all the edicts of persecution which they saw daily
enforced around them, they persevere in reading the Writings of the Reformers,
and opening&#8217; their minds without reserve to the beams of the New Light,
they resolve both to do and to suffer GOD&#8217;S will, as soon as they shall
learn it. At length this Christian pair are joined by his brothers &#8212; ODET,
the Cardinal, and FRANCIS, the Colonel &#8212; and thenceforth they become a
noble brotherhood of searchers for Divine guidance, of one mind and of one
spirit, each equally earnest to be found after the image of their
Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">About five years before BEZA addressed him in the
following dedication, the QUEEN MOTHER OF FRANCE had sent for COLIGNY to give
his advice respecting the proper remedies for the discontent of the people. He
boldly assigned Persecution for Religion as its cause, and advised the passing
of an Edict of Toleration, in opposition to the arbitrary injustice of the House
of Guise. He next stands by the PRINCE. OR CODE, who is seized, imprisoned, and.
condemned to death, but rescued from the scaffold by the decease of the king.
But in a short period the enmity of the DUKE OF GUISE against the HUGONOTS
became deadly, and 3000 Protestants, according to BEZA, are &#8220;stabbed,
stoned, beheaded, strangled, burned, buried alive, starved, drowned,
suffocated.&#8221; Fearful wars and dreadful massacres arise, and after the
assassination of the DUKE OF GUISE, on the 18th February 1563, COLIGNY retired
to Chatillon, and was probably living in retirement there, when BEZA announced
to him the decease of CALVIN.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The remainder of his history is most melancholy. The
DUKE OF ALVA, a most inveterate persecutor of the Reformers, now gained an
ascendancy over the mind of the QUEEN and her Council. Civil war again rages
between the Romish and the Protestant parties. The ADMIRAL is again forced into
the field, the battle of Moncontour is fought and lost on the 1st of October
1569, and COLIGNY is wounded severely in the face. Massacre and murder rage more
fiercely than ever, till at length, in the very Palace of the King, at Paris,
COLIGNY is shot at, and seriously wounded in two places. His days are now
numbered. Although both the King and Queen pay him visits of condolence, after
the fingers of his right hand are cut off, he soon falls a victim to the
vengeance of his foes. The fatal ST. BARTHOLOMEW MASSACRE is planned, and the
Duke of Guise declares it to be the kings pleasure that COLIGNY should be the
first victim. The King relents, but it is too late; the Duke is gone to the
Admiral&#8217;s hotel. His slaughterers stab their way to the Admiral&#8217;s
presence, and find him prepared to die. The sword is thrust through his body,
and his corpse, dishonored by the Duke, is given up to the insults of the mob.
For seven long&#8217; days and nights the streets of Paris run with blood, and
its river is choked with corpses. The King and his family, and many of his
nobles, went to pray in public, and to offer thanksgiving to GOD for the success
of these measures, as if resulting in his glory. And after a while they proceed
to decree that the body of the SIEUR DE COLIGNY should be dragged through the
streets, and then hung&#8217; up on Montfaucon, to the execration of the people;
that his Castle at Chatillon should be leveled to the ground, and all his estate
laid waste; that his children should be unable to hold property; and that for
all future time this infamous transaction should be annually handed down to
posterity by Public Prayers and Processions throughout the capital of France.

<div><font face="Palatino">The blood of the faithful at Paris was not
sufficient: Throughout the cities of the provinces similar butcheries took
place. The head of the Romish Church exulted also: The Pope and the Cardinals
proceeded in solemn pomp to offer public thanksgiving before the altar; the
ramparts of St. Angelo resounded with the thundering of artillery, while the
Cardinal Lorraine celebrated solemn service in the Church of St. Louis, and
attributed the slaughter of the heretics to the inspiration of GOD, in the
presence of the sovereign Pontiff &#8212; an awful leaf in the history of
Europe, which must be turned over again and again, that our children&#8217;s
children may be familiar with these dreadful deeds of Anti-christ.<sup>

<div><font face="Palatino">On one occasion, BEZA, the writer of this address to
COLIGNY came in close contact with this CARDINAL LORRAINE; for on the 9th of
September 1561, a remarkable meeting was held at Poissy, near Paris, called a
Colloquy, for the public discussion of the Reformed and the Unreformed
doctrines. The Letter which the mother of Charles IX. wrote to Pope Pius IV.,
with reference to this meeting, is very characteristic of those times. It states
that the Reformed had become so powerful and so numerous, that the measure was
both salutary and needful. The Pope replies most mildly, and foreseeing that it.
would lead to the accomplishment of his long wished for desire &#8212; the
recognition of</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Legate in France &#8212; leaves all to his faithful
Cardinal of Lorraine. Safe-conduct was given to many leading Reformers, among
whom were THEODORE BEZA and PETER MARTYR. BEZA asked permission to open the
Conference by prayer, and obtained it; and such a prayer the majority of the
debaters had never heard before. He then spoke boldly, ably, and like a thorough
Christian. The Cardinal replied, with great plausibility and policy; and, after
many meetings, no practical objects seemed to be gained. The PRINCE OF CONDE,
COLIGNY, and the CHANCELLOR L&#8217;HOPITAL, were the leading Politicians; and
in the following January the Assembly of Notables was assembled at St. Germains.
An Edict of Toleration was passed, which it was hoped would prove the Magna
Charta of the spiritual liberties of France. But Providence ordered it
otherwise, and mysteriously allowed the sacred bands of CALVIN, BEZA, and
MARTYR, to be laid low by the ax and the sword, and the progress of the
Reformation to be arrested, just as it was about to burst forth as a SPIRITUAL
REFORMATION FOR EUROPE.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now only remains to observe, that this TRANSLATION
has been made by a careful comparison of the Latin with the French Editions;
that those of Geneva, published in 1617 and 1565, have been adopted as the
basis, while the reprints of 1563, 1565, 1583, and that at Amsterdam in 1667,
have been consulted. No license whatever has been taken with the text, the
Translation being&#8217; uniformly as close and literal as the English idiom
will admit. The Translator has carefully avoided all expression of private
opinion on doctrinal and speculative points; he has not softened off any of the
occasional roughness of the original views of his Author, nor has he encumbered
his pages with long footnotes, either to rectify or elucidate the criticisms of
the text. His object has been, not to present his readers with the views and
expositions of other Commentators, but to present CALVIN, with all his
excellencies and defects, before the English reader, in language as clear and
simple as the various difficulties of the subject will allow, tie has not
introduced quotations from other Divines, who have ably and impartially treated
similar subjects, but, at certain intervals, (as for instance at the close of
Ezekiel 10,) he has pointed out the Authors from whose Works much valuable
information may be obtained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Translator may venture here to express his
opinion, once for all, that CALVIN&#8217;S Hebrew philology is not always
correct: his critical exposition of the meaning and derivation of Hebrew words
should seldom be received as the best possible. The labors of GESENIUS and
ROSENMULLER have thrown great light upon this department of Sacred scholarship,
and the results of such modern labors will be found ably condensed and adapted
to the wants of the ordinary reader, in the Notes to BISHOP NEWCOME&#8217;S
<i>&#8220;Literal Translation of the Prophets,&#8221; </i>rendered very
accessible in Tegg&#8217;s Edition of 1836. This work is very valuable for
conciseness, accuracy, and the intelligible application of real
learning.</font><br></div>

and <i>spirited facsimile </i>of a very rare PORTRAIT OF CALVIN, which the
monogram shows to have been engraved by HENRY HONDIUS, or DE HONDT the elder, an
artist of considerable eminence, who was born at Duffel, in Brabant, about 1573,
and died at La Haye in 1610. Among other works, he engraved Portraits of John
Wickliffe, Philip Melancthon, John Bugenhagen, John Knox, and Jerome
Savonarola.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be worth noticing, that Jodocus Hondius, or de
Hondt, (who is also called Henry Hondius the younger,) was the son of Jodocus
Hondius, or de Hondt Jost, a Flemish engraver, born at Ghendt in 1563, and
probably a brother of Henry the elder, who fled to England in consequence of the
troubles in the Low Countries. He engraved maps and portraits, constructed
mathematical instruments, founded printing types, etc. Henry the younger studied
the art of engraving under his uncle, Henry the elder, and finished many of his
father&#8217;s plates after his death. He engraved a number of portraits in a
very neat style, which are still highly esteemed.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><i>Grand Admiral Of France, Theodore
Beza, Minister Of The Church Of Geneva, Wishes Health And Peace From The
Lord.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ALTHOUGH I am sure, most Noble Sire, that you are
accustomed to profit much by the other writings of that great and truly
excellent servant of God, JOHN CALVIN, and that you will also fully enjoy this
last swanlike song&#8217; of his, yet I do not doubt that the same feelings will
affect you when reading, as they do me while writing, namely, that at the name
of such a man, that recent grief, which we felt so severely at his death, will
break out again with the heaviest sense of our loss. And truly this sorrow is
the more just and necessary, since it neither can nor ought to be hastily put
away from us, so that I think it quite lawful for us to indulge
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the tempests which, of late years, God&#8217;s
Church has sustained,, no one can be ignorant of them, since they have shaken
the whole world, so that we can now use that expression<i> &#8212;
</i>&#8220;What region of the World is not full of our
sufferings?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But many have not sufficiently taken notice,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with what defenders our Religion has been protected. The Lord has raised you up
like GIDEONS and SAMSONS, not only in GERMANY, but in ENGLAND and SCOTLAND; and
also lately, under the auspices of the most illustrious PRINCE or CONDE, in our
FRANCE, who, when your own life was in danger, through a variety of perils,
turned away the swords of certain opponents from the necks of the pious. And, in
truth, the chief enemies of the Church are not flesh and blood, since these can
only injure the &#8216;body. Therefore, although that is in reality a most
excellent gift of God, and your praise is very great, even before the angels of
God, because at a most seasonable crisis so formidable an attack was averted by
your prowess; yet with far other enemies, and with far other weapons, must we
make war, and even now do we contend; and this contest, although not so
formidable in appearance, yet is really more dangerous, because it involves the
ruin of the whole family of God. I speak of spiritual wickedness, by which Satan
endeavors to infect the doctrine, and to corrupt the morals; and if these are
lost, the Church must not only be injured, but perish entirely. In carrying on
this war, there are doubtless those leaders whom God has appointed Pastors,
Teachers, and Presbyters of his Church, for this very purpose, that, by
teaching, convincing, and praying, they may administer the kingdom of the Son of
God; for these are the arms by which hostile forces are to be overcome. If you
judge by names alone, you will find them numerous enough; if by reality, you
will find them but few. Yet this our age has many of this kind, of whose
constancy and labors we ourselves are the fruit and the harvest. But that the
world is unworthy of such, this fact declares, that within three years, at a
most unsuitable juncture, we have lost the very best and bravest; so that
indeed, out of those mighty heroes who, in our time, so bravely and so
successfully have thrown down Antichrist from his seat, we now behold but very
few surviving, as HENRY BULLINGER, by God&#8217;s goodness, lately preserved to
us from the pestilence, WILLIAM FARREL, that old man of invincible strength, and
PETER VIRET, even up to this time contending in the Church at Lyons with
success, even in the very front of the battle. PHILIP MELANCTHON was the first
who fell in this last slaughter; next to him fell PETER the MARTYR, when he had
returned to his charge at Zurich, after the Assembly at Poissy. After him
followed WOLFGANG MUSCULUS, and then ANDREW HYPERIUS, as if the hand of the
smiting Deity turned itself from north to south; for MELANCTHON died in Saxony,
HYPERIUS in Hesse, and the two others in Switzerland. Alas! what great men, and
how dearly beloved!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet, while JOHN CALVIN was alive, all these
calamities were lightened; for that great man, far superior to others, while he
was safe, made all other losses, however great, seem but light. And behold, our
sins have snatched him also away from us last year, and no one can estimate the
loss which THE CHURCH has suffered, unless those who were eyewitnesses of his
labors. For what did that man not achieve? Who was to be compared with him in
Meetings, in Lecturing, and in Writings. Who was shorter in teaching, and yet
more solid &#8212; more happy in solving difficulties, more vehement in
reproving, sweeter in consoling, and more correct in confuting errors? I know
that, on the one hand, there are some Epicureans who laugh at what I say, (for
will they not deride the servant when they mock at his Load?) and, on the other
hand, that stupid and foolish men, to whom ignorance is the highest wisdom,
despise it. Yet., I know this, that there is none among the more cunning enemies
of God who does not silently think of him the same as I do. Each faction among
the followers of Antichrist has and praises its own patron, and that, too, not
without depreciating others. But may that stupid and profane ambition be far
from us! We boast of neither CEPHAS, nor PAUL, nor APOLLOS. Our language of
Canaan is one! we have one Lord, by whom we swear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But since there are different offices for the limbs
of the same body, we prefer eyes to hands and feet; and since there are so many
eyes of so large a body, we feel some more efficacious than others; but we
praise and adore GOD in each part of this body. May this praise be offered
entirely to our GOD and LORD; and he who does not perceive that we owe thanks
for CALVIN in a peculiar sense, has no judgment! But to what purpose are these
remarks? There is this sweetness in these celestial goods, that by their
recollection alone they most singularly profit and delight us. Hence the benefit
of examples in both ways; nor is there any other end and scope of Sacred
History, than that we should be affected while reading it, just as if we beheld
the events themselves. So in that grief, with which all pious and good men ought
&#8216;to be affected by the death of so great a man, and especially those who
received daily almost incredible advantages from his presence, by his remarkable
teaching and his wonderful prudence, two things ought chiefly to console us:
One, that we are in no slight degree assisted by his recent and most beautiful
examples of both sayings and doings, until also we ourselves, when the course of
our navigation is finished, may be conveyed to the same port. The other, that no
one has existed within our memory to whom it has been permitted to leave so many
and such exact monuments of his doctrine; for, if God had granted to us for
another year or two the enjoyment of so great a light, I do not see what could
be wanting to the perfect understanding of the Books of either Covenant! There
remain the Books called Historical, except JOSHUA, also JOB and the two Books of
SOLOMON, which he has not illustrated by his COMMENTARIES; although his
Discourses on JOB, SAMUEL, and the First Book of Kilos, will partly supply this
want to the French, as they were received from his mouth. For this great man
obtained from the Load this gift also, that he spoke not much otherwise than he
wrote. Of the Prophets, he illustrated ISAIAH with complete Commentaries: his
Lectures on the remaining Prophets are extant, edited with the greatest
diligence and fidelity by two of his disciples, endued with learning and piety,
JOHN BUDE, son of the great BUDE, and CHARLES DE JONVILLER. But his premature
death prevented him from completing EZEKIEL, which is the more to be lamented by
the Church, because this Prophet, especially towards the last, is the most
obscure of all, and I know not who will ever arise to complete this picture
commenced by such an Apelles!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We think that we have little reason to render an
account why we have determined to edit this imperfect work. If any one should
chance to ask, Why I have dedicated it to you rather than to any one else? I
plainly tell him, that CALVIN is responsible for it, on the principle of every
one deciding as he pleases in things which concern himself, and that for most
just and important reasons I have purposely done the very same that he also
wished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why, then, should I not assent to his judgment, who
in your absence admired and plainly perceived those surprising endowments of
both body and mind, of which I was myself an eyewitness during twenty months,
both in peace and war. But he said that in the Preface to his Works he trod in
the footsteps of PAUL, who salutes some persons by name in his EPISTLES with
this special intention, that he might set before the Churches certain chosen men
to be looked at by the rest., by whose examples they might be excited to true
piety and to other virtues. As to the truth of his judgment concerning you, how
many and what certain testimonies can be offered, if either your modesty would
allow you to be praised to your <i>face, </i>or if it were proper to seek them,
as if it were a matter of doubt? But there will be another opportunity, and I
hope a more suitable one, of discussing these things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now prefer treating another point more pleasing to
you, a man of exalted station, and yet the least ambitious of all. I had rather
exhort you, most Noble Sire, with all diligence, to do what you are already
doing, and have most successfully begun &#8212; not only to read, hear, and
meditate upon these sacred things continually, and to use them really; but also,
that you apply yourself to defend and preserve the Churches by all just means
consistent with your dignity and fortitude of mind. Your mortal enemies, and
those of all pious men, do not disguise the fact that you are especially aimed
at by those who think that they themselves cannot exist if Religion is
preserved. But I do not know you, if these very dangers do not rather sharpen
than relax your courage. You yourself have most strikingly felt and experienced
GOD&#8217;S care in defending his own. Your innocence and integrity sufficiently
defend you against all accusations. You possess, if any of your rank does, that
inward and invincible guard within the breast, which profane men call a wall of
brass &#8212; I mean a good conscience, in reliance upon which, believe me, you
will easily surpass all your adversaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In these contests nothing will strengthen you so much
as a diligent comparison of the Prophetic with the Historic Writings. For here
the events of the future are not falsely conjectured, as mankind are accustomed
to do, from an observation of past events. Here no doubtful counsels are taken,
no events are obstructed by a chance coincidence of second causes; but you
enter, as it were, into the very plans of the Almighty; you behold the true
causes, beginning, progress, and end of all changes; and those, too, plainly and
clearly declared. For although the Prophets have their enigmas, yet to those who
carefully compare all things among themselves, and are acquainted with the
idioms of the Prophets, and thus compare their predictions with the events
themselves, all things become so plain, that you seem to look down from above
upon all human things, especially while relying upon that faithful Leader, who
can lead you through a sure path in the midst of impassable and inaccessible
places. Nor is there any cause why these things should be despised, as already
spread abroad; or be neglected, as the relation of things long ago obsolete, as
certain little wits of this day esteem them. For the Prophets do not treat of
small and plebeian things, as some who are unskilled in these matters suppose,
but concerning the greatest Monarchies, far surpassing any of these days; about
the state of the greatest Kings and Princes; about the great GOD of Hosts
sitting in judgment on the preservation and destruction of the greatest States
&#8212; such are the contents of these Books. For in those times, the Kings,
although profane and impious, never did what many do now, who are so ashamed of
asking counsel of GOD speaking&#8217; through his servants, that they are
utterly careless of that; and dare to accuse of ambition the faithful servants
of God, while discharging their duty. Indeed, there was not at that time any
Nation, as all Sacred and Profane Historians testify, which decided on measures
of importance, without first consulting its Prophets. And while I say this, I
would not place the Ministers of the Word on the throne of Kings or Princes, or
any other Magistrates, nor would I favor the ambition of any; but I state what
is a fact, and what experience itself has lately proved, as I remember that you,
most noble Sire, both perceived and expressed in good time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, while I am saying something about the times,
their fashion changes, I confess; but there is the same LORD, the same
Providence, the same mercy towards the righteous, the same indignation towards
the ungodly. But there are those perpetual and invariable, and, therefore,
firmer laws of development,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than are found in even Mathematics themselves; since, if there is any firmness
and consistency in events of any kind, it all depends upon the nature and will
of GOD. We shall find the clearest declarations of these principles, not only
generally as in the Law, but also particularly, in the Prophetic Writings, if we
only compare past times with our own, and with the objects of our daily inquiry.
Do you want an example? It is just four years ago since, at the Council at
Poissy, THE FRENCH CHURCHES promised themselves the greatest peace and
tranquillity, and their adversaries did not know where to turn themselves; but
thus our man of GOD, at that time dedicating his LECTURES ON DANIEL to those
Churches, broke forth into these words: &#8220;But, if we must fight any longer,
(as I announce to you that severer contests than ye think for are in store for
you,) with whatsoever madness the rage of the impious may burst forth, so as to
rouse up the very depths themselves, remember that your course is determined by
the celestial Master of the race; whose laws ye ought to obey with the greater
alacrity, because he supplies strength to his own even unto the end.&#8221; That
he denounced this in a spirit truly prophetic, while the majority were
anticipating the contrary, the numberless calamities which immediately followed
declare; and of these no end even yet appears. ]Do you ask, whence came that
prediction? Certainly not from that most deceptive and profane divination of
Astrology, which he of all others used to condemn from GOD&#8217;S Word, but
from those very Prophetic Books which he was then interpreting. Since,
therefore, he saw the same evils prevalent in France, on account of which GOD
was accustomed to chastise His people most severely, and to take vengeance on
his enemies with just penalties, why should he not pronounce float the same
inflictions hung over the impenitent?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In like manner, LUTHER foresaw and predicted THE LATE
SLAUGHTERS IN GERMANY, through contempt of GOD&#8217;S Word; and I wish that he
had noticed better their principal causes. So also, at this very time, it is not
difficult to perceive that throughout FRANCE,<i> </i>and especially among those
who ought to know better, not only are notorious superstitions and manifest
idolatries defended, but even open Epicureanism and horrible blasphemies,
unheard of in all former times, are tolerated by all men hearing and laughing,
since at length no place is left for justice and equity, and edicts and laws are
enacted in vain. Who, then, is so blind that he cannot see horrible punishments
hanging over the authors and defenders of these crimes, and possibly even over
the whole kingdom? And in this instance I wish I may be a false prophet! For
surely heaven and earth shall pass away, before GOD will permit these things to
remain unrevenged &#8212; things which would horrify even the Turks! &#8212; and
the longer their punishment is delayed, the heavier it will appear when it does
come. I know that some will deride these things, as even NOAH himself was
derided: some also will vehemently accuse them, as JEREMIAH was esteemed a man
of strife. But, nevertheless, the truth of GOD will stand firm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I pray GOD, therefore, most noble Sire, first, that
He would specially endue his Majesty the King with all holy virtues, which,
since it is already partly accomplished, all hope and wish may be continued.
Next, I pray GOD to grant him many Counselors like thee and a few others,
endowed &#8212; I say it without flattery &#8212; with the sacred prudence of
His Spirit, and zeal for piety and justice, which is the symbol of Royal
Majesty, by whose counsels so many faults may be seriously corrected, and a holy
and just government happily instituted by the Sacred Word of GOD and the
authority of the Royal Majesty. Lastly, I pray that GOD would happily establish
and preserve you, with your truly Christian wife and children, and your most
noble brothers and their holy families, and, lastly, all the assembly of the
pious, who, after GOD and the King, look up to the most illustrious PRINCE OF
CONDE, concerning whom I hope to have another opportunity of speaking, and to
thee, and to the rest of the pious and religious Nobility throughout
France.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>TO ALL TRULY CHRISTIAN READERS.
HEALTH.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ALTHOUGH our most accomplished and faithful Pastor
THEODORE BEZA, with his singular dexterity and happy tact, seems not to have
omitted anything in his DEDICATION of these LECTURES to that most noble hero,
and most pious ADMIRAL or FRANCS, yet those who attentively peruse my remarks,
and look upon them with a candid mind, will not judge my few observations
superfluous; but I trust they will admit them to be rather grateful and useful
to all the pious. And, first of all, no words can sufficiently express how
severe a loss THE CHURCH OF GOD has suffered, in the summons from this life to
eternal rest, which that illustrious and really divine man, our parent, JOHN
CALVIN, has received; whether you look at the perpetual consistency of his life,
or at his remarkable learning, combined with his exalted piety. For who ever
surpassed him in sanctity of morals, in incredible suavity, in unbroken
magnanimity, in singular tolerance, nay even in the highest virtues? And as to
his wonderful erudition, his multitudinous Writings plainly bear witness to it;
some of these being already published, and the rest, with GOD&#8217;S
permission, will shortly see the light, to the manifest advantage of the pious.
For many of his productions are extant, either as extracted from his discourses
or preserved by his friends, as those Letters, in both French and Latin, sent to
all classes of men, from which it is very evident with what an acute and happy
wit he was endued, and with what a clear and sound judgment he was gifted. But I
will here say no more on this subject, lest I should seem to dwell upon what is
out of place. It will be enough just to touch on a few things which belong
especially to these LECTURES.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the 20th of January 1563, when JOHN CALVIN began
to interpret EZEKIEL, in the Public School, although he was continually
afflicted by various severe diseases, so that he was often carried to his duties
in a chair or on horseback, in consequence of the weakness of his declining
health; neither during the whole year did the violence of his maladies prevent
his discharging the duty of preaching and reading. At length, about the first of
February in the following year, he had advanced as far as the end of the
twentieth chapter, with the exception of four verses, and then he was compelled
to remain at home, and to confine himself almost always to his bed. In the
meantime, during his illness, he was continually meditating, or dictating, or
even writing something: so that during the time of his confinement to the house,
through ill health, it is scarcely credible how much he accomplished. Among
other things, he yew diligently revised the greater part of these LECTURES, as
is evident by the copy corrected with his own hand, which I have carefully
preserved with the rest.</font><br></div>

the Church of GOD. How desirable, then, that they should have been illustrated
by such a man! That this loss may be in some degree remedied, in deference to
the wishes of some persons of great weight and learning, that it would be more
satisfactory to publish these LECTURES at once, than to suppress them any

JOHN BUDS, and myself, have willingly undertaken the duty, relying on their
judgment. We have spared neither expense, nor trouble, nor labor, in publishing
the LECTURES as soon as possible; and, GOD willing, we will shortly take care to
translate them into French, for the benefit of our people, as our French Version
of the LECTURES ON JEREMIAH, put to press nine months ago, is now just finished;
so that, unless I am mistaken, our people, who do not understand Latin, will
reap great profit. And that nothing should be omitted in this Latin edition, we
have taken care that whatever <i>errata </i>had occurred in printing, they are
noticed at the end. And since in this book a very great treasure is included, a
very copious INDEX has been compiled by a learned man, through whose guidance
its inexhaustible riches may be readily obtained, without any trouble. Another
INDEX is added, of those places of Scripture which are quoted and
explained.</font><br></div>

industry, diligence, and fidelity, which we exercised in the others already
published. There is no necessity for my explaining more at length what I have
previously made known with sufficient clearness, as to the manner in which we
have retained what are received from CALVIN&#8217;S extemporary

you now enjoy the labors of so great a man, and acknowledge whatever fruit you

<div><font face="Palatino">We see that the Prophet was called to the office of a
Teacher in the fifth year after Jehoiachin had voluntarily surrendered himself
to the king of Babylon,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 24:15); and had been dragged into exile, together with his mother: for it
was, says he, &#8220;in the thirtieth year.&#8221; The greater part of the
Commentators follow the Chaldee Paraphrast, and understand him to date from the
finding of the Book of the Law. It is quite clear, flint this year was the
eighteenth of king Josiah; but in my computation, I do not subscribe to the
opinion of those who adopt this date. For this phrase &#8212; &#8220;the
thirtieth year,&#8221; would then appear too obscure and &#8216;forced. We
nowhere read that succeeding writers adopted this date as a standard. Besides,
there is no doubt that the usual method among the Jews was to begin to reckon
from a Jubilee. For this was a point of starting for the future. I therefore do
not doubt that this</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> thirtieth
year</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is reckoned from. the Jubilee. Nor
is my opinion a new one; for Jerome makes mention of it, although he altogether
rejects it, through being deceived by an opposite opinion. But since it is
certain that the Jews used this method of computation, and made a beginning from
<i>Jobel, </i>that is, the Jubilee, this best
explains</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the thirtieth
year</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If any one should object, that we
do not read that this eighteenth year of king Josiah was the usual year in which
every one returned to his own lands, (Leviticus 25) and liberty was given to the
slaves, and the entire restoration of the whole people took place, yet the
answer is easy, although we cannot ascertain in what year the <i>Jobel </i>fell,
it is sufficient for us to assign the Jubilee to this year, because the Jews
followed the custom of numbering their years from this institution. As, then,
the s had their Olympiads, the Romans their Consuls, and thence their
computation of annals; so also the Hebrews were accustomed to begin from the
year <i>Jobel, </i>when they counted their years on to the next restoration,
which I have just mentioned. It is therefore probable that this was a Jubilee
year &#8212; it is probable, then, that this was <i>the Jubilee. </i>For it is
said that Josiah celebrated the passover with such magnificent pomp and
splendor, that there had been nothing like it since the time of Samuel.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;143518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 35:18.) The conjecture which best explains this is, not that he
celebrated the passover every with such magnificence, but that he was induced to
do so by the peculiar occasion, when the people were restored and returned to
their possessions, and the slaves were set free. Since, then, this was the
Jubilee, the pious king was induced to celebrate the passover with far greater
splendor than was usual &#8212; nay, even to surpass David and Solomon. Again,
although he reigned thirteen years afterwards, we do not read that he celebrated
any passover with remarkable splendor. We do not doubt as to his yearly
celebration; for this was customary.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 23:23.) From this we conclude that the celebration before us was
extraordinary, and that the year was <i>Jobel. </i>But though it is not
expressed in Scripture, it is sufficient for us that the Prophet reckoned the
years according to the accustomed manner of the people. For he says, that this
was &#8220;the<i> </i>fifth year of king Jehoiachin&#8217;s captivity<i>:&#8221;
</i>who is called also Jehoiakim; for Jehoiakim succeeded Josiah, and reigned
eleven years. The thirteen years which remain of Josiah&#8217;s reign and these
eleven, make twenty-four.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122336&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 23:36.) Now, &#8220;his successor,&#8221;<i> </i>Jehoiachin, passed
immediately into the hands of king Nebuchadnezzar, and was taken captive at the
beginning of his reign, and reigned only three or four months.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 24:8.) After that, the last king, Zedekiah, was set up by the will of the
king of Babylon. We see, therefore, that nine years are made up: add the space
of the reign of Jehoiachin: so it is no longer doubtful as to the reckoning of
&#8220;the thirtieth year&#8221; from the eighteenth of king Josiah. It is true
that the Law of God was found during this year,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;143414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 34:14,) but the Prophet here accommodates himself to the received
rule and custom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now come to the intention of God in
appointing Ezekiel as his Prophet. For thirty-five years Jeremiah had not ceased
to cry aloud, but to little purpose. When, therefore, this Prophet Jeremiah was
so occupied, God wished to give him a coadjutor. Nor was it but a slight relief
when at Jerusalem Jeremiah became aware that the Holy Spirit was speaking
through another mouth in harmony with himself; for by this means the truth of
his teaching was confirmed. In the thirteenth year of Josiah, Jeremiah undertook
the prophetic office:
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:2:) eighteen years remain: add the eleven years of Jehoiakim, and it will make
twenty.-nine: then add another year, and five more, and we shall have
thirty-five years. This then was his hard province, to cry aloud continually for
thirty-five years, to the deaf, nay, even to the insane. God, therefore, that he
might succor his servant, gave him an ally who should teach the same things at
Babylon which Jeremiah had not desisted from proclaiming at Jerusalem. He
profited not only the captives, but also the rest of the people who still
remained in the city and the land. As far as the captives were concerned, this
confirmation was necessary for them: for they had false Prophets there, as we
learn from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242921&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:21; there was Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah; they
proudly boasted that they were endued with the Spirit of revelation; they
promised the people marvels, they derided the softness of those who had left
their country, they said that they were determined to fight to the very last,
and to run the risk of their lives rather than voluntarily give up the
inheritance of divine promise. In this way they insulted the captives. After
this there was Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:24,) who wrote to the high priest Zephaniah, and reproached him for being
careless and <i>neglectful, because </i>he did not severely punish Jeremiah as
an impostor and a fanatic, and a false intruder into the prophetic office.
Since, therefore, the Devil had his busy agents there, God stationed his Prophet
there, and hence we see how useful, nay, how necessary it was, that Ezekiel
should discharge his prophetic office there. But the utility of his instructions
extended much further, since those at Jerusalem were compelled to listen to the
prophecies which Ezekiel uttered in Chaldea. When they saw that his prophecies
agreed with those of Jeremiah, it necessarily happened that they would at least
enquire into the cause of this <i>coincidence. </i>For it is not natural that
one Prophet at Jerusalem, and another in Chaldea, should utter their prophecies,
as if. were, in the same key, just as two singers unite their voices in
accordance with each other. For no melody can be devised more perfectly complete
than that which appears between these two servants of God. Now we see the
meaning of what our Prophet says concerning &#8220;the years.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the thirtieth
year</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the fourth
month</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(the word month being&#8217;
understood,) and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the fifth day
of the month, as I was among the
captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before I proceed any farther, I will briefly touch on
the subjects which Ezekiel treats. He has all things in common with Jeremiah, as
I have said, with this peculiarity, that he denounces the last slaughter against
the people, because they ceased not to heap iniquity upon iniquity, and thereby
inflamed still more and more the vengeance of God. He threatens them, therefore,
and that not once only, because such was the hard-heartedness of the people,
that it was not enough to utter the threatenings of God three or four times,
unless he should continually impress them. But, at the same time, he shows the
causes why God determined to treat his people so severely; namely, because they
were contaminated with many superstitions, because they were perfidious,
avaricious, cruel, and full of rapine, given up to luxury and depraved by lust:
all these things are united by our Prophet, that he may show that the vengeance
of God is not too severe, since the people had arrived at the very last pitch of
impiety and all wickedness. At the same time, he gives them, here and there,
some taste of the mercy of God. For all threats are vain, unless some promise of
favor is held out. Nay, the vengeance of God, as soon as it is displayed, drives
men to despair, and despair casts them headlong into madness: for as soon as any
one apprehends the anger of God, he is necessarily agitated, and then, like a
raging beast, he wages war with God himself. For this reason, I said, that all
threats are vain without a taste of the mercy of God. The Prophets always argue
with men with no other intention than that of stirring&#8217; them up to
penitence, which they could never effect unless God could be reconciled to those
who had been alienated from him. This then is the reason why our Prophet, as
well as Jeremiah, when they reprove the people, temper their asperity by the
interposition of promises. He also prophesies against heathen nations, like
Jeremiah, especially against the children of Ammon, the Moabites, the Tyrians,
the Egyptians, and the Assyrians. (Jeremiah 26-29.) But from the fortieth
chapter he treats more fully and copiously concerning the restoration of the
Temple and the city. He there professedly announces, that a new state of the
people would arise, in which both the royal dignity would flourish again, and
the priesthood would recover its ancient excellence, and, to the end of the
book, he unfolds the singular benefits of God, which were to be hoped for after
the close of the seventy years. Here it is useful to remember what we observed
in the case of Jeremiah: (Jeremiah 28:) while the false Prophets were promising
the people a return after three or five years, the true Prophets were predicting
what would really happen, that the people might submit themselves patiently to
God, and that length of time might not interrupt their calm submission to his
just corrections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we now understand what our Prophet is treating,
and the tendency as well as the substance of his teaching, I will proceed with
the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as I was among the
captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>While some skillfully explain
the words of the Prophet, they think that he was not in reality in the midst of
the exiles, but refer this to a vision, as if; when he uses the word
&#8220;among,&#8221;<i> </i>signifying &#8220;in<i> </i>the midst,&#8221; its
sense could be, that he was in the assembly of the whole people: but his
intention is far otherwise, for he uses the above phrase that he may show that
he was an exile together with the rest, and yet that the prophetic spirit was
granted to him in that polluted land. Hence the words, &#8220;among the
captives,&#8221; or, &#8220;in the midst of the captives,&#8221; do not mean the
assembly, but simply narrate, that, though the Prophet was far from the Sacred
Land, yet the hand of God was extended to him there, that he might excel in the
prophetic gift. Hence the folly of those is refuted, who deny to our Prophet the
possession of any spirit of revelation before he went into exile. Although they
do not err so much through mistake and ignorance as through willful stupidity;
for the Jews took nothing so ill as the thought of God&#8217;s reigning beyond
the sacred land. To this day, indeed, they are hardened, because they are
dispersed through the whole world, and scattered through all regions, and yet
retain much of their ancient pride. But then, when there was any hope of return,
this profanation seemed to them scarcely tolerable, if the truth of God were to
shine forth elsewhere than in the holy land, but especially in the Temple. The
Prophet then shows, that he was called to the office of instruction when he was
in the midst of the exiles, and one among them. God&#8217;s inestimable goodness
is conspicuous in this, because he called the Prophet, as it were, from the
abyss: for Babylon was a profound abyss: hence the Spirit of God emerged with
its own instrument, that is, brought forth this man, who should be the minister
and herald of his vengeance as well as of his favor. We see, therefore, how
wonderfully God drew light out of darkness, when our Prophet was called to his
office during his exile. In the meantime, although his doctrine ought to be
useful to the Jews still remaining in this country, yet God wished them not to
return to him without some mark of their disgrace. For, because they had
despised all the prophecies which had been uttered at home, in the Temple, the
Sanctuary, and on Mount Zion, these prophecies were now to issue forth from that
cursed land, and from a master who was sunk, as I have said, in that profound
abyss. We see then, that God chastised their impious contempt of his
instructions, not without putting them to shame. For a long time Isaiah had
discharged the prophetic office; then came Jeremiah: but the people ever
remained just as they formerly were. Since then prophecy when flowing freely
from the very fountain was despised by the Jews, God raised up a Prophet in
Chaldea. Blow, therefore, we see the full meaning of the
clause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the river of
Chebar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,&#8221; </i>which many understand to
mean the Euphrates, but they assign no reason, except their not finding any
other celebrated river in that country; for the Tigris loses its name after
flowing into the Euphrates, and on this account they think the Euphrates is
called Chebar. But we are ignorant of the region to which our Prophet was
banished: perhaps it was Mesopotamia, or else beyond Chaldea, and besides, since
the Euphrates has many tributaries, it is probable that each has its own name.
But since all is uncertainty, I had rather leave the matter in suspense. Because
the Prophet received his vision on the banks of the river, some argue from this,
that the waters were, as it were dedicated to revelations, and when they assign
the cause, they say that water is lighter than earth, and as a prophet must
necessarily rise above the earth, so water is suitable for revelations. Some
connect this with ablution, and think that baptism is prefigured. But I pass by
these subtleties which vanish of themselves, and very willingly do I leave them,
because in this way Scripture would lose all its solidity: conjectures of this
kind are very plausible, but we ought to seek in Scripture sure and firm
teaching;, in which we can acquiesce. Some for instance torture this passage,
&#8220;By<i> </i>the rivers of Babylon we sat down and wept,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:1,) as if the people betook themselves to their banks to pray and worship;
when the situation of that country only is described, as being&#8217; watered by
many rivers, as I have just mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the heavens were opened, and I
saw visions of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God opens his
heavens, not that they are opened in reality, but when, by removing every
obstacle, he allows the eye of the faithful to penetrate even to his celestial
glory; for if the heavens were cleft a thousand times, yet what great brightness
must it be to arrive at the glory of God? The sun appears small to us, yet it
far exceeds the earth in size. Then the other planets, except the moon, are all
like small sparks, and so are the stars. Since, therefore, light itself grows
dark before our glance penetrates thus far, how can our sight ascend to the
incomprehensible glory of God? It follows therefore when God opens the heavens,
that he also gives new eyesight to his servants, to supply their deficiency to
pierce not only the intervening space, but even its tenth or hundredth part. So,
when Stephen saw the heavens open,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440756&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:56,) his eyes were doubtless illuminated with unusual powers of perceiving far
more than men can behold. So, at the baptism of Christ, the heavens were opened,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:16,) that is, God made it appear to John the Baptist, as if he were carried
above the clouds. In this sense the Prophet uses the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the heavens were
opened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I saw visions of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some think that this means most
excellent visions, because anything excellent is called in Scripture divine, as
lofty mountains and trees are called mountains and trees of God; but this seems
too tame. I have no doubt but that he calls prophetic inspiration
&#8220;visions<i> </i>of God,&#8221; and thus professes himself sent by God,
because he put off as it were his human infirmities when God intrusted to him
the office of instructor. And we need not wonder that he uses this phrase,
because it was thought incredible that any prophet could arise out of Chaldea.
Nathaniel asked whether any<i> </i>good thing could come out of Nazareth, and
yet Nazareth was in the Holy Land. How then could the Jews be persuaded that the
light of celestial doctrine could shine in Chaldea, and that any testimony to
the grace of God could spring from thence? and that there also God exercised
judgment by the mouth of a Prophet? This would never have been believed unless
the calling of God had been marked in some signal and especial manner. Since he
next adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this was the fifth
year of king Jehoiachin&#8217;s captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>(or Jechoniah, or Jechaniah,) it is plain that by these very words he
reproves the obstinacy of the people. For when God afflicts us severely, at
first we are much agitated, but by degrees we necessarily become submissive.
Since, however, the willfulness of the people was not subdued during these five
years, we infer that they persevered in rebellion against God. Nor does he spare
those who remained at Jerusalem, for these took credit to themselves for not
going into exile with their brethren, and so they despised them, as we often
find in Jeremiah. Since then those who remained at home pleased themselves and
thought their lot the best, the Prophet here marks the time, because it was
necessary to allay their ferocity, and since they resisted the prophecies of
Jeremiah, to use a second hammer that they might be completely broken in pieces.
This is the reason why he speaks of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

of a prophet is never mentioned unless he were a prophet himself. Their
ignorance is proved on other occasions, and here surely their curiosity is
shameful, since they decide this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Buzi</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to be a prophet, and because they know of no one else, they fix on Jeremiah: as
if it were probable, that when the father was left at Jerusalem, the son was an
exile, which is entirely conjectural. But because he was a priest;, so he says,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son of
Buzi</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; Our Prophet ought to have some
reputation, for if he had been of plebeian obscurity, he would scarcely have
been listened to. The priestly dignity, then, availed something towards securing
attention. Now he expresses what I have previously mentioned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the land of
Chaldea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if he had said: although God
has not been accustomed to raise up prophets in lands so distant and polluted,
yet now his rule is changed, for even among the Chaldeans is one endued with the
prophetic spirit. And the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>illic, </i>&#8220;there,&#8221;<i> </i>is emphatically added;. &#8220;was<i>
</i>there upon him,&#8221; says he. For otherwise the Jews would have dreaded
Ezekiel, as if he were a monster, when they found that the word of God had
proceeded from Chaldea. &#8220;What,&#8221;<i> </i>say they, &#8220;will<i>
</i>God pollute and contaminate his doctrine, by its springing up from such a
place as that? Who are the Chaldeans, that God should erect his seat there?
Mount Zion is his dwelling-place: here he is worshipped and invoked. Here must
his lamp burn of necessity, as he has often witnessed by his prophets.&#8221; To
such taunts the Prophet; replies: God has begun to speak in Chaldea &#8212;
there his power is conspicuous: &#8220;The word of the Lord is come unto me; for
we know that God alone is to be heard, and that prophets are only to be attended
to, as far as they utter what proceeds from him.&#8221; Hence it is required
that all teachers of the Church should first have been learners, so that God
alone may retain his own rights, and be the only Lord and Master. As then
supreme authority resides in God alone, when prophets desire to be heard, they
profess not to offer their own comments, but faithfully to deliver a message
from God. Thus also our Prophet. I touch these points rather lightly now, as I
have treated them more at length elsewhere. At length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of the Lord was upon
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some explain the word
&#8220;hand&#8221;<i> </i>by &#8220;prophecy,&#8221; but this seems to me weak
and poor: I take &#8220;hand&#8221; to mean divine power, as if Ezekiel had said
that he was endued with divine power, so that it should be quite clear that he
was chosen a Prophet. The hand of God, then, was a proof of new favor, so that
Ezekiel might subject; to his own sway all the captives, since he carried with
him the authority of God. This may also be referred to the efficacy of his
doctrine. For the Lord not only suggests words to his servants, but also works
by the secret influence of his Spirit, and suffers not their labors to be in
vain. The passage then may be received in this sense. But since the Prophet only
assumes to himself what was necessary, and so claims for himself the position
and standing of a Prophet, so when he uses the word <i>&#8220;hand,&#8221;
</i>[do not doubt his meaning to be an inward operation. There is, it is
admitted, an inward efficacy of the Holy Spirit when he sheds forth his power
upon hearers, that they may embrace a discourse by faith, so also if all hearers
were deaf, and God&#8217;s word should evaporate as smoke, yet there is an
intrinsic virtue in the prophecies themselves: Ezekiel points out this as given
to him by God. Here I shall finish, because I should be compelled to break off
directly, and we shall be coming to the vision, which is the most difficult of
all.</font><br></div>

SECOND.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A VISION is now to occupy our attention, whose
obscurity so deterred the Jews that they forbade every attempt to explain it,.
But God appeared to his Prophet either in vain or not in vain: it is most absurd
to suppose the former &#8212; then if the vision is useful, it is necessary for
us to attain at least a partial understanding of it. If any one object that the
vision was exclusively intended for the Prophet &#8212; the objection is easily
answered, for what the Prophet wrote was clearly for the use of the whole
Church. Now, if any one asks whether the vision is lucid, I confess its
obscurity, and that I can scarcely understand it: but yet into what God has set
before us, it is not only lawful and useful but necessary to enquire. Base
indeed would be our sloth should we willingly close our eyes and not attend to
the vision. We shall perhaps but skim the surface of what God wills: yet this is
of no small moment, and not only a moderate but a slight degree of understanding
may suffice for this. Thus briefly do I finish my preface, and come to the words
of the Prophet: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We must first consider the intention of this Vision.
I have no doubt but that God wished first to invest his servant with authority,
and then to inspire the people with terror. When therefore a formidable form of
God is here described, it. ought first to be referred to reverence for the
teaching conveyed; for, as we have remarked before, and shall further observe as
we proceed, the Prophet&#8217;s duty lay among a hard-hearted and rebellious
people; their arrogance required to be subdued, for otherwise the Prophet had
spoken to the deaf. But God had another end in view. An analogy or resemblance
is to be held between this vision and the Prophet&#8217;s doctrine. This is one
object. Then as to the vision itself, some understand by the four animals the
four seasons of the year, and think that the power of God in the government of
the whole world is here celebrated. But that sense is far-fetched. Some think
that the four virtues are represented &#8212; because, as they say, the image of
justice is conspicuous in man, that of prudence in the eagle, of fortitude in
the lion, of endurance in the ox. Yet although this is a shrewd conjecture it
has no solidity. Some take the contrary view, and think that four passions are
here intended, viz. fear and hope, sorrow and joy. Some think that three
faculties of the mind are denoted. For in the soul,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;
lo&gt;gikon</font><font face="Palatino">, is the seat of reason;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qu&gt;mikon</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that of the passions;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpiqumh&gt;tikon</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that of the lusts; and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunte&gt;resiv</font><font face="Palatino">
that of the conscience. But these guesses are also puerile. It was formerly the
received opinion, that under this figure were depicted the four Evangelists:
they think Matthew was compared to a man, because he begins with the generation
of Christ; Mark to a lion, because he begins at the preaching of John; Luke to
an ox, because he begins his narrative by mentioning the priesthood; and John to
an eagle, because he penetrates, as it were, to the secrets of heaven. But in
this fiction there is no stability, for it would all vanish if it were to be
properly examined. Some think it a ,description of the glow of God in the
Church, and that the animals are here to be taken for the perfect who have
already made greater progress in faith, and the wheels for the weak and
undisciplined. But they afterwards heap together many trifles, which it is
better to bury at once, and not take up our time ill refuting them. All these,
then, I reject; and now we must see what the Prophet really does mean. I have
already said, that it was the Almighty&#8217;s plan, when he gave commands to
his Prophet so to honor him, that his doctrine should not be open to contempt.
But the special reason which I touched upon must be considered &#8212; viz.:
that God shortly points out by this symbol, for what purpose he sends his
Prophet. For the visions have as great a likeness to the doctrine as possible.
For this reason, in my opinion, Ezekiel
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, behold! a whirlwind came
out of the north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The people had already
experienced the vengeance of God, Mien he had used first the Assyrians and then
the Babylonians to chastise them. Jeconiah, as we have ,seen, had gone into
voluntary exile. The Jews thought that they would still have a quiet home in
their city and country, and laughed at the simplicity of those who had so
quickly gone into exile. The Prophet therefore says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw a stormy wind from the
north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This rush of the wind or tempest
ought to be referred to the judgment of God: for he wished to strike terror into
the Jews, that they should not grow torpid in their security. After he has
spoken concerning the storm or tempest, he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>&#8212; I saw four living
creatures and four wheels connected
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to signify that their motion
had not originated from chance but from God. These two things ought to be joined
together, viz.: that the storm sprang up out of the north, and that God, the
author of the storm, was beheld upon his throne. But in the meanwhile, that
God&#8217;s majesty might the Jews, he says &#8212; I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw four living creatures and
four wheels connected together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the
four living&#8217; creatures he understands cherubim: and we have no need of any
other explanation, for he explains it so in chapter 10., when he saw God in the
temple, the four living creatures were under his feet, and he says they are
cherubim. Now we must see why four animals are here enumerated, when two
cherubim only embraced the Ark of the Covenant; and next, why he describes four
heads to <i>each: </i>for if he wished to accommodate his language to the rites
of the Sanctuary, why did he not place two cherubim, with which God was content?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022018&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:18;) for he seems here to depart from the command of God himself:
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;040789&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
7:89) now, four heads and round feet, do not suit the two cherubim by whom the
Ark of the Covenant was surrounded. But the solution is at hand: the Prophet so
alludes to the Sanctuary, or, at the same time, to bend his discourse to the
rudeness of the people. For their religion had become so obsolete, and their
contempt of the law so great., that the Jews were ignorant of the use of tie
Sanctuary; then they so worshipped God as if he were at a distance from them,
and entirely rejected his providential care over human affairs. Here, then, we
see how gross was their stupor, so that though often stricken, they never were
aroused. Because the Jews were thus completely torpid, it became needful to
propose to them a new form, and so the Prophet chooses half of it from the
Sanctuary itself, and assumes the other half, as it was required for so rude a
people; although he did not manufacture anything out of his own mind, for I am
now speaking of the counsel of the Holy Spirit. God was, therefore, unwilling to
drive the Jews away from the sanctuary, for that was the foundation of all right
understanding of truth, but because he saw that the legal form was not
sufficient, he therefore added a new supply, and as he gave each cherub four
heads, so he wished their number to be four.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to their number, I doubt not that God
wished to teach us that his influence is diffused through all regions of the
world, for we know the world to be divided into four parts; and that the people
might know that God&#8217;s providence rules everywhere throughout the world,
four cherubim were set up. Here also it is convenient to repeat, that angels
were represented by cherubim and seraphim: for those who are called cherubim
here and in Ezekiel 10, are called seraphim in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:2; and we know that angels are called principalities and powers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:10,) and are rendered conspicuous by these titles, while Scripture calls them
the very hands of God himself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:16.) Since, therefore, God works by angels, and uses them as ministers of his
power, then when angels are brought forward, there the <i>providence </i>of God
is conspicuous, and his power in the government of the world. This, then, is the
reason why not two cherubim only were placed before the Prophet&#8217;s eyes,
but four: because God&#8217;s providence ought to be evident in earthly things,
for the people then imagined that God was confined to heaven; hence the Prophet
teaches not only that he reigns in heaven, but that he rules over earthly
affairs. And for this reason, and with this end, he extends his power over the
four quarters of the globe. Why, then, has each animal four heads? I answer,
that by this, angelic virtue is proved to reside in all the animals. Yet a part
is put for the whole, because God by his angels works not only in man and other
animals, but throughout creation; and because inanimate things have no motion in
themselves, as God wished to instruct a rude and dull people, he sets before
them the image of all things under that of animals. With reference, then, to
living creatures, man holds the first place, <i>because </i>he was formed after
the image of God, and the lion reigns over the wild-beasts, but the ox, because
he is most useful, represents all domestic animals, or, as they are usually
called, <i>tame </i>animals. Since the eagle is a royal bird, all birds are
comprehended under this word; and here I am not fabricating allegories, but only
explaining the literal sense; for it seems to me sufficiently plain, that God
signifies angelic inspiration by the four cherubim, and extends it to the four
regions of the earth. Now:, as it is equally clear that no creature moves by
itself, but that all motions are by the secret, instinct of God, therefore each
cherub has four heads, as if it were said that angels administer God&#8217;s
empire not in one part of the world only, but everywhere; and next, that all
creatures are so impelled as if they were joined together with angels
themselves. The Prophet then ascribes four heads to each, because if we can
trust our eyes when observing the manner in which God governs the world, that
angelic virtue will appear in every motion: it is then, in fact, just as if
angels had the heads of all animals: that is, comprehended within themselves
openly and conspicuously all elements and all parts of the world; &#8212; thus
much concerning the four heads.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the four wheels, I do not doubt their
signifying those changes which we commonly call revolutions: for we see the
world continually changing and putting on, as it were, new faces, <i>each
</i>being represented by a fresh revolution of the wheel, effected by either its
own or by some external impulse. Since, then, there exists no fixed condition of
the world, but continual changes are discerned, the Prophet joins the wheels to
the angels, as if he would assert that no changes occur by chance, but depend
upon some agency, viz., that of angels; not that they move things by their
inherent power, but because they are, as we have said, God&#8217;s hands. And
because these changes are really contortions, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I saw wheel within
wheel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the course of things is not
continuous, but when God begins to do anything, he seems, as we shall again
perceive, to recede: then many things mutually concur<i>, </i>whence the Stoics
fancied that fate arose from what they called a connection of causes. But God
here teaches his people far otherwise, viz., that the changes of the world are
so connected together, that all motion depends upon the angels, whom he guides
according to his will. Hence the wheels are said to be full of eyes. I think
that God opposed this form of the wheels to the foolish opinion of men, because
men fancy Fortune blind, and that all things roll on in a kind of turbulent
confusion. God, then, when he compares the changes which happen in the world to
wheels, calls them &#8220;full<i> </i>of eyes,&#8221; to show that nothing is
done with rashness or through the blind impulse of fortune. This imagination
surely arises from our blindness: we are blind in the midst of light, and
therefore when God works, we think that he turns all things upside down; and
because we dare not utter such gross blasphemy against him, we say that Fortune
acts without consideration, but in the meantime we transfer the empire of God to
Fortune itself. Seneca tells a story of a jester belonging to his wife&#8217;s
father, who, when he lost the use of his eyes through old age, exclaimed that he
had done nothing to deserve being cast into darkness &#8212; for he thought that
the sun no longer gave light to the world; but the blindness was in himself.
This is our condition: we are blind, as I have already said, and yet we wish to
throw the cause of our blindness upon God himself; and because we do not dare
openly to bring a charge against him, we impose upon him the name of fortune;
and for this reason the Prophet says the wheels have eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the scope of the vision, and we
must next approach its several parts. After he has said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a wind sprung up from the
north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a great
cloud,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was also a fire folding
round itself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Moses, in the ninth
chapter of Exodus,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
9:24,) uses the same word when he speaks of the storm which he caused in Egypt.
<i>There was fire en-folded or entwined, </i>and <i>the splendor of fire.
</i>Some shrewdly expound this splendor of the fire, as if God&#8217;s judgments
were not obscure, but exposed to the eyes of all. I cannot agree in this
meaning, nor do I think it correct. Here the majesty of God is described to us
according to the usual scriptural method. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fire was splendid in its
circuit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was as it were the
appearance of &#8220;Hasmal&#8221; in the midst of the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Many think Hasreal to be an angel
or an unknown phantom, but, in my opinion, without reason, for Hasmal seems to
me a color. Jerome, following the Greek, uses the word <i>electrum, </i>but
surprises me by saying that it is more precious than gold or silver; for
electrum is composed of gold, with a fifth part of it silver, hence, as it does
not; exceed them both in value, Jerome was mistaken. But whether it was electrum
or any remarkable color, it so clearly portrayed to the Prophet the majesty of
God, that he ought to be wrapt in admiration, although the vision was not
offered for his sake personally, but, as I have said before, for the Church at
large. The color differed from that of fire, that the Prophet might understand
that the fire was heavenly, and, as a symbol of God&#8217;s glory, had a form
unlike that of common fire. Now follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I have already explained why God showed four angels
to his Prophet under the form of four animals. It was necessary to turn a little
aside from the sanctuary, since the whole legal worship was obnoxious to the
profane. God therefore descends, as it were, from heaven, and appears familiarly
on earth, as if he would say that he reigned not only above among his angels,
but that he exercised his power here, because angels are engaged on earth, and
are connected with all regions of the globe; and the conclusion is, that
God&#8217;s providence is everywhere<i> </i>diffused. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these animals have the likeness

as some interpret it: but here he says they have the form of a man, and the
solution is, that the first feet are like those of a man, although in some
respects<i> </i>different; nor is it doubtful that cherubim were beheld by the
Prophet as angels of God. Wings also do not suit human nature, but he means,
that they had <i>the </i>usual human stature: although they are not entirely
like human beings, yet there is much likeness in their general appearance: and

<div><font face="Palatino">This seems added by way of explanation. Since Ezekiel
has spoken of their human form, he adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their feet were
straight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>although he calls them round
or like those of a calf. I refer the straightness not to the feet only but also
to the legs. It is therefore just as if he had said that these animals stood as
men do. For we differ from the brutes, who look down towards the ground. As the
poet appositely remarks, when he commends the singular favor which God has
conferred upon man,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Man looks aloft,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now signifies the same thing, when he
says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the animals had
straight feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He asserts that they had
not anything akin to brutes, but rather to the appearance or likeness of man. He
says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their feet were
round</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and this seems to indicate their
agility or the variety of their movements, as if he had said that their feet
were not confined, to any one direction, but wherever God impels them they move
easily, since their feet are round. If any of us wishes to turn either to the
right or the left, he will feel himself to be contending with nature, if he
attempt at the same time to walk backwards; if however his feet were round, or
of the form of calves&#8217; feet, he could easily move in any direction.
Agility of this kind then seems pointed at in the animals. As to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sparks which shone like
polished brass or steel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we know that
this similitude often occurs in Scripture, for whenever God wishes to render his
servants attentive, he proposes new figures which may excite their admiration.
This very thing happened to our Prophet, because if the usual fleshy color had
appeared in these animals, this perhaps would have been neglected: even the
Prophet had not considered the meaning of the vision with sufficient attention.
But when he saw the glistening thighs and sparks shining in every direction, as
if from polished steel, then he was compelled to apply his mind more attentively
to this vision, Now, therefore, we see why he says that the appearance of the
legs was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like polished
steel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that
sparks</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> glittered on

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet says:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hands were under their
wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Since hands are the principal
instruments of action, we know that all actions are often denoted by this word:
whence hands, either pure or defiled, signify the works of men either clean or
unclean. When the Prophet says that the animals were endowed with hands, he
signifies that they were ready for the performance of any duty enjoined upon
them: for he who is without hands lies useless, and cannot execute any work.
Therefore that the Prophet may express angelic vigor, he says that they had
hands. This also refers to their human figure, but hands denote something
peculiar: namely, that they have such agility that they can execute every
commandment of God. For he says:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were under their
wings,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by which words he signifies, that
the angels have no motions in themselves, so that they cannot be carried where
they please, except they are divinely impelled, and their every action guided by
the will of God. For without doubt by wings, as in this place so in others, we
must understand something more than human, Since therefore the wings, with which
the animals are clothed, signify nothing else but the secret instinct of God, it
follows, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hands hidden under
the wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>denote nothing else than that
angels do not move, as we say, intrinsically, but are impelled from without,
namely, by the power of God himself: hence they are not carried about rashly
hither and thither, but all their actions are governed by God, since he bends
and directs them whithersoever he pleases. This is the reason why the Prophet
says that he saw </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hands on the
animals</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that those hands were under their
wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He repeats again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had faces, and four wings to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The use of the phrase
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four
sides</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is worthy of notice, just as if he
had said that the animals have the power of acting equally in all directions,
not that they had four hands each, although at first sight this may appear to be
the meaning of the words </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on four
sides,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or in each corner, but it simply
means that the hands so appeared on the animals, that they were ready for action
whensoever God wishes to impel these animals. Now follows

the explanation: namely, that the animals so go forward that they proceed in a
perpetual course towards their own end or goal, but it does not follow that they
afterwards rest there. Therefore when the animals proceed, they do not turn
aside in either one direction or another, nor do they turn back, but go straight

<div><font face="Palatino">We must now see why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>each animal walked onwards, or in
the direction of his face. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I simply interpret
it in a straight course, so that they neither wandered nor declined to either
the right hand or the left. For those who turn the face on one side or the
other, often stumble, and thus decline from the right way: there was therefore
such attention in the animals, that they always kept their object in view, and
never bent from their fixed purpose. Hence we see that a fixed, and, as we say,
inflexible rule in divine actions is here commended. Men often change their
places, and fluctuate, and when they have any purpose, if a different thought
strike them, they are carried back again, as if they had forgotten themselves.
But God wishes to show that his actions are so arranged, that they have nothing
in them either crooked or erroneous. For we have said that angels are
represented by these living creatures; and under the image of angels the
government of the whole world is signified, because it must be held, that they
are, as it were, the hands of God, since he used them in obedience to his
will.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He now comes down to the faces or countenances of the
living creatures themselves. The face is properly used with reference to the
whole body, but the Prophet only means the countenance. He says therefore that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was on the right as it were
the face of a man and of a lion, and on the left, the face of an ox and of an
eagle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We explained yesterday why four
heads and as many faces are ascribed to the angels of God, because so great was
the dullness of the people, that they did not acknowledge the providence of God
over all parts of the world. For we know that they were so intoxicated with
foolish confidence, that they wished to hold God shut up as it were within a
prison: for their temple was as it were God&#8217;s prison. Hence the Prophet
shows how the providence of God shines over other parts of the world. But since
there is vigor in animals, so for brevity&#8217;s sake he puts four remarkable
species of animals. Yet one question remains, and that a difficult one, for in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
10:14, he puts a cherub for an ox. Some think, or at least reply, that it
appeared at a distance the face of an ox, but nearer it was that of a cherub.
All see that this is a sophistry, and because they cannot otherwise escape the
difficulty, they have imagined that fiction, which has no firmness in it. Others
think that cherub and ox are identical; but this may be refuted from many
places, for cherubim have not the heads of oxen, as all very well know. I
therefore have no doubt there was some difference in the second vision, when God
appeared to his own Prophet in the Temple. It is called the same vision on
account of the likeness, but it does not follow that all particulars were
exactly the same. Nor ought this conjecture to be rejected, because when God
made himself known to his servant in Chaldea, as I have said before, he wished
to reprove the sloth of the people by this multiform image; but when he appeared
a second time in the Temple, there it was something more divine. Hence therefore
the variety, because each animal then bore the <i>face </i>of a cherub instead
of that of an ox. Therefore, besides the stature of the whole body, there was a
remarkable feature whence the Prophet could more easily and familiarly recognize
these living-creatures to be cherubim or angels. This reason also seems to
explain why God showed to his Prophet a form which approached more nearly to
that of the sanctuary, and to the two cherubim who surrounded the ark. Besides,
some think that the heads were so arranged, that the man&#8217;s head should
look towards the east, and the opposite head towards the west. But it is
scarcely to be doubted that the four faces had the same aspect, and turned their
eyes in the same direction, there being on the right the two forms which we have
mentioned of a man and a lion, and on the left, those of an ox and an eagle.

together, so that a fourfold form could be seen on one head: there was the form
of a man, and then that of a lion, as in one glass various forms sometimes
appear, but each answers to its own original. So also the reader might mistake
here, as if different faces belonged to the same head: hence the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were stretched forth or

diversity of heads, and as to the wings, he says they were extended, and, at the

wings: this the Prophet means; and as to the other wings, he says that they

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
or in the direction of its face: </i>and he will say the same again: nor is this
repetition superfluous, since, as we said yesterday and must repeat again,
mankind can scarcely&#8217; be induced to ascribe glory to the wisdom of God.
For we are so stupid, that we think that God mingles all things inconsiderately,
as if he were in the dark. Since, therefore, the actions of God appear to us
distorted, it is needful to repeat this clause, viz.,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that angels proceed straight
forward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, are constrained to
obedience. For the son who wishes to imitate his father, and the servant his
master, is often agitated and at a loss what to do. Since then, something always
appears confused in <i>creatures, </i>the Prophet diligently enforces that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angels proceed in the direction
of their</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> face, </i>that is, they tend at
once to their goal, and decline neither to one side or the other. What he
announces with regard to angels, ought to be referred to God himself; because
his intention was not to extol angelic wisdom, but he sets them before us as
God&#8217;s ministers, that we may perceive here one of the fundamental
principles of our faith, viz., that God so regulates his actions, that nothing
is with him either distorted or uncontrolled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wheresoever there was spirit for
proceeding, they
proceeded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Spirit is here used in the sense
of mind or will: we know that it is often put metaphorically for wind, and also
for the human soul, but here the will ought to be understood, and so the Prophet
alludes to that very motion by which angels are borne along when God uses their
assistance. Since, therefore, the vigor and swiftness of angels is so great that
they fly like the wind, the Prophet seems to allude to this likeness. And what
David says in the 104th Psalm, &#8220;God makes the winds his ministers,&#8221;
the Apostle, in the first chapter of the Hebrews, aptly applies to the angels
themselves. This analogy then, will stand very well, viz., that the angels
proceeded wherever their will bore them; and yet by this word the Prophet points
out that secret motion by which God bends his angels as he pleases. In the
meantime, he confirms what we have lately seen, that angels are not rashly
driven in every direction, but have a definite end, because God, who is the
fountain of all wisdom, works through their means. He says again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they so proceed as not to
return,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, that they do not
deviate from their course, for he afterwards says, <i>they do turn backwards.
</i>But it is easy to reconcile these statements, because it only signifies that
their course was not abrupt. While, therefore, they are proceeding in one
direction, they go forward until they finish their allotted space, and then they
return like lightning. For God does not so fit his angels for one single work,
and that they should rest ever afterwards, but daily, nay, every moment, he
exercises them in obedience. Since, then, the angels are continually occupied,
it is not wonderful that the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they go and return, and yet not
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is explained by their not
receding until they have discharged their duty. Lastly, this vision has no other
meaning than to inform the Prophet that God does not desert his works in the
middle of their course, as he says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8. Since, therefore, in the works of God, there is nothing unfinished or
mutilated, the angels go forward, and finish their allotted space till the goal:
they afterwards return like lightning, as he will shortly say. It follows:

reprove the people&#8217;s sluggishness. At the same time, if the face of a man
had not been different from common forms, the vision had not excited such
admiration in the mind of the Prophet. Hence something heavenly ought to be
mixed with the earthly figures. This is the reason why the living creatures were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like burning
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now we begin to understand what
this difference means; as when God appeared to Moses, if there had been nothing
wonderful in it, Moses would not have thought that he was called by God, but he
acknowledged God in the bush, because he saw that the bush was on fire and yet
not consumed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
3:2, 3.) Then he began to be aroused, and to reflect within himself, that a
divine vision was presented to him. The same is to be diligently observed in
this place. And hence we gather, how humanely, nay, how indulgently, God deals
with us. For, as on his part, he sees how small is our comprehension, so he
descends to us: hence the faces of the living creatures, the stature of their
body, and what we have formerly mentioned. Now, however, since he sees us torpid
upon the ground, and lying there, as it were idle, so he raises us up: this is
the meaning of what Ezekiel now says, viz.,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the appearance of the living
creatures was like burning coals.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And
since coals taken out of the fire sometimes die out, he says the coals were
burning. The Prophet would of necessity be moved when he saw that. the living
creatures were not really such, that is, when he saw in the form of the animals
something celestial, and exceeding the standard of nature, and even the senses
of man: and this also ]s profitable to the rest of man.-kind. For when we read
this vision we acknowledge what the Prophet narrates to be so evident, that God
shines forth in it, and does not suffer his Prophet to doubt. Hence his
teaching, which is marked by such certain proofs, is better confirmed to us. In
the meantime, it is desirable to impress upon the memory what we said yesterday,
that there is something terrific in this vision, since the people were hardened
against all threats, nay, even blows themselves. For God had already inflicted
severe judgments, not only on the kingdom of Israel, but on the city itself, and
the whole land of Judah. Even the captives were champing their bits and roaring,
because driven into exile, and, in the meantime, those who remained in the city
thought that they were treated nobly. Wherefore such was their security, that it
was necessary to put terrors before them, as we shall see a little while
afterwards. And it is also said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fire burned before God,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">where he not only wishes his own glory to be
beheld by us, but where he wishes to strike fear, as he did at the promulgation
of the law.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:20) And David, in the 18th Psalm, narrates that God appeared to him in this
way when he was preserved by him:
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;191808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:8-15:) doubtless he understands that God unfolded his formidable power
against the unbelieving. So also in this place, he says, <i>the appearance of
the living creatures was like fiery and burning coals, </i>and then he adds
another image, that <i>they were like lamps, </i>which some explain as
firebrands or burnt wood. But another opinion is more general, and more approved
by me. The Prophet now expresses the form of the fire more dearly, viz.,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the coals were like
lamps</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For lamps send out their
brightness to a distance, and seem to scatter their rays in every direction,
like the sun when it shines through the serene air. On the whole, the Prophet
means, that the fire was not obscure but full of sparks, and shows that rays
were diffused like lighted lamps. Afterwards he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they walked between the living
creatures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet sees, as it were,
a fiery form amidst the living creatures themselves. Thus God wished to show the
vigor of his own spirit in all actions, that we should not measure it in our
manner, according to the depravity which is innate with us. For when we
discourse concerning the works of God, we conceive what our reason comprehends,
and we wish in some way to affix in our minds an image of God. But God shows,
that when he works there is a wonderful vigor, as if fire were moving to and
fro. Hence that vigor is incomprehensible to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fire was bright, and
lightning issued from it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This would
affect the Prophet&#8217;s mind, when he saw fire glittering in an unaccustomed
manner. We know that fire is often bright, especially when flame is added; but
the Prophet here intends something very uncommon, as if he had said that the
fire is not like that arising from lighted wood, but that it was resplendent,
whence we may readily collect that God here sets before us his visible glory:
and for the same reason he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lightning issued from the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence arises the splendor just
mentioned, since lightning is mingled with the fire. But we know that lightning
cannot be beheld without fear; for in a moment the air seems inflamed, just as
if God would in some way or other absorb the world: hence the appearance of
lightning is always terrible to us. He was unwilling, indeed, that his Prophet
should be frightened, except as far as was needful to humble him. But, as I
stated at the beginning, this vision was not offered to the Prophet for his
private use, but that it might be useful to the whole people. Meanwhile the
Prophet, as he was but human, had need of this preparation, that he might be
humbled. For we always attribute something to pride, which renders our senses
obtuse, so as to be incapable of the glory of God. Therefore when God wishes to
become familiarly known to us, he strips us of all pride and all security:
lastly, humility is the beginning of true intelligence. Now we understand why
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lightning issued from the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he afterwards confirms
this.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the living creatures ran, and
returned like lightning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>by which words
he doubtless signifies their amazing swiftness. For lightning (as Christ uses
that comparison when he speaks of his own Advent &#8212;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402427&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:27) goes forth from one part of the world and penetrates instantly to the
opposite. Since, then, the swiftness of lightning is so great that it reaches in
a moment through the immensity of heaven, for this reason the Prophet
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, the living creatures ran,
and returned like lightning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>as if he
had said, in whatever direction God wishes to impel them, they were ready to
obey; as we have formerly said, angels are at hand to obey the commands of God:
but we cannot comprehend the extreme swiftness of their course, unless by this
comparison of lightning. Now we see how well these two things agree, that they
did return and yet did not: they did not return until they had arrived, as I
have already said, at the goal, because, although many hindrances occur, yet God
breaks through them, so that they never interrupt his actions. The devil,
indeed, by his obstacles, endeavors to compel God to recede; but here the
Prophet shows that when God determines anything, the angels are ready to govern
the world, and that they have so much vigor in them, that they go on constantly
to the end, as far as God inspires them with his own power. Afterwards it

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet descends to the wheels which were
joined to the living creatures. Each had a double wheel, as we shall see
afterwards &#8212; that is, one wheel rolling upon another. The Prophet did not
notice at one glance that the wheels stood near the living creatures, and this
is occasioned by the magnitude of the vision. For although he was attentive, and
God doubtless gave him understanding by his Spirit, and although he was taken
up, as it were, into heaven, yet inasmuch as he could not at once embrace so
great a vision he was convicted of infirmity. Then this wonderful secret was set
before him, that he might attend to the whole spectacle with greater reverence.
He says, therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when he had
fixed his eyes upon the living creatures, immediately the wheels
appeared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He uses indeed the singular
number, but afterwards declares, there were four wheels. And now he removes all
doubt:

wheel to each animal: this is easily gathered from the Prophet&#8217;s words. I
explained yesterday what God meant to represent to his servant and to us by
these wheels: namely, the changes which constantly occur in the world. For if we
consider what the condition of the world is, we may correctly compare it to a
sea, and even a tempestuous one. For as the sea is subject to opposite winds,
and hence storms are excited, so also since there is nothing firm or calm in the
world, its condition is a perpetual change like the turning of a wheel.

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet uses the plural number, and says,
there were four wheels. He says, the color was like a precious stone. Jerome
translates <i>it &#8220;sea,&#8221; </i>because the sea which looks towards
Cilicia with respect to Judea is called Tharsis. But I know not why the color of
the sea or the sky took his fancy. But granting that, the word is not found
simply for a bluish-green color, for tharsis is a precious stone, as we learn
from Exodus,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
28:20, and many other places. The Greeks translated it chrysolite, but I know
not whether correctly, nor does it much matter. We need only hold it to be a
precious stone, whose color was so exquisite that it attracted all eyes to
itself. And so God wished, under the figure of wheels, to place before his
Prophet something earthly; but, at the same time, to raise his mind by its
color, because he would ascertain from this that they were not either common
wheels, or wooden, or of any earthly material, but heavenly ones. The color,
then, was intended to draw off the Prophet&#8217;s mind, so that he might
ascertain that heavenly secrets were laid open to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Like the appearance of a precious
stone,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says: afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they four had one
likeness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may, indeed, be referred
to the living creatures as some have conjectured, but I have no doubt that the
Prophet here teaches, that the wheels were so equal that there was no difference
between them. Therefore their proportion and equality shows that in all
God&#8217;s work there is the greatest arrangement &#8212; not that this lies on
the surface, (for we should rather think that all things are involved in hurried
confusion,) but if we raise our senses above the world, it will doubtless be
given us to acknowledge what the Prophet here describes, viz.: that in all
God&#8217;s works the arrangement is so complete that no line could be better
directed. God therefore, whilst he turns round the world, preserves an even
course with <i>respect </i>to himself, so that what we call changes or
revolutions have no inequality with respect to himself, but each is in harmony
with all the others. At length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their aspect and workmanship, or
form, was as if each wheel were in the midst of a
wheel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that the bending of one wheel
is across that of another. For he does not mean to say, that one wheel was
greater and another less, but that two wheels were so united that they were at
right angles to each other. Now, we may see why the wheels were double; I
touched on it briefly yesterday &#8212; viz., because God does not seem to hold
on a direct course, but to have various changes, and, as it were, in contrary
directions, as if the motion by which each creature is inspired with vigor was
drawn in different ways. Therefore it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one wheel was in the middle, of
another</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Finally, here God represents to
us to the life what experience teaches. For first, the world is carried, along
just as the wheels run round, and that, too, not simply but with such great
variety that God seems to send forth his impelling force, now to the right hand
and now to the left. This, then, is as if two wheels were entangled together.

to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">What he says about the circumferences of the wheels
may seem superfluous, but he refers to the second clause of the verse, where he
says, that these circumferences were full of eyes. Here, then, he now treats
about their height and terrible aspect. It signifies that the wheels were large,
for being round their length and breadth is equal. When he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were
lofty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he, doubtless, signifies that
they inspire terror by their very appearance, as he afterwards expresses it..
The sum of the whole is, that these wheels were not common ones, but. they so
exceeded the usual size that their magnitude was formidable. But all these
things tend to impress the vision on the attention of the Prophet, because
unless the Lord should, as it were, draw us violently to himself, we should
become torpid through sloth. The Prophet then required to be so variously
affected, that, as soon as he sees that no common vision is before him, he
should apply all his faculties to its consideration. What he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the circumferences of the
wheels were full of eyes, </i></font><font face="Palatino">signifies that all
the wheels were not rashly but considerately<i> </i>put in motion. If the eyes
had been in other parts, they had not been useful; but since the wheels turned
by means of their felloes &#8212; that is, their iron hoops &#8212; there the
Prophet saw the eyes fixed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, therefore, we see in what manner God directs the
world in various ways, and yet nothing&#8217; is done without reason and plan.
By <i>the eyes, </i>the Prophet understands, that providence which never
wanders. He does not say, that every wheel had two eyes, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the circumferences were full
of eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which expresses much more than
if he had said they possessed eyes: which means that there was not the least
motion in the wheels unless arranged and governed with the utmost reason. And
hence the error of those who think that years are intended by the entangled
wheels is refuted. This idea they obtained, I suppose, front the Egyptians, for
in their hieroglyphics the year is represented under the image of a serpent.,
which, being twisted round, bites his own tail. It is indeed true, that the
continual series of time is so woven together that year draws year behind it,

<div><font face="Palatino">By this verse the Prophet teaches, that all the
changes of the world depend on celestial motion. For we have said that the
living creatures represent to us Angels whom God inspires with a secret virtue,
so that he works by means of their hands. Now, therefore, when he says, that the
wheels proceeded through a higher movement than their own, it follows that
nothing happens by chance in the world, but that God, by his own
incomprehensible wisdom, so directs all things that nothing happens except by
that secret instinct which is imperceptible to us. Therefore in this teaching of
the Prophet, as in a glass, we ought to consider what is concealed from human
comprehension. We see many things happen, and in the meantime we think the
motions, which are so perplexed and multiplied, confused; but the Prophet meets
this perverse imagination, and teaches that the wheels rest by themselves and
are set in motion by a higher force &#8212; that is, as the living creatures or
cherubim are moved, so the wheels are drawn along by their influence. Now,
therefore, because we perceive the meaning of the Holy Spirit, so the usefulness
of the doctrine is to be noticed. When we see men planning&#8217; so many things
that they disturb the whole world, when we see many conspiracies made, and then
all things necessary for action prepared, let us perceive that God governs all
things, but in a secret manner which surpasses our senses. Also, when we see
many things happen as we think unseasonably, let us think that Angels are
discharging their duty, and that by their motion and inspiration things in
themselves motionless are borne along. The same may be said of other things:
winter, for example, may be too mild or too rough; in that excess, let us
consider what the Prophet teaches here, viz.: that God so governs the order of
the seasons, that nothing happens unless by his inspiration. When, therefore,

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same sentence, that the wheels were
fixed, not that they fell but stood without motion, which we know to be
unnatural, for a wheel cannot stand on any part of its rim, but will either fall
on one side or the other, or will roll on: for the Prophet says that the wheels
were immovable. Whence it follows that their moving force was external to
themselves. Afterwards he confirms the same by additional words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as the living creatures and
the wheels stood together, so they moved and were elevated
together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Prophet enlarges upon
what he had just touched upon. For although the matter is obscure, yet this
copiousness excites attention, and leads us to understand that the motion of the
wheels is not uselessly transferred to the living creatures, and that the cause
resides there: because if this had been said briefly, it might have been
transmitted carelessly, but since the Prophet so often asserts the motion of the
wheels to be derived from the living creatures, hence it follows that all
changes of things which are seen in the world have their origin from some
external source, as I have formerly said. The reason, too, is repeated &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the spirit of the living
creatures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or animals
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was in the
wheels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for here as before there is an
alteration in the number. Though the Prophet understood the spirit of the living
creatures to be in the wheels, yet the wheels do not comprehend anything, but
receive vigor, as the moon obtains its brightness from the sun. So we perceive
that the wheels are impelled, not that the intelligence of the living creatures
had been transfused through the wheels. For God does not give mind and judgment
to either winter or summer, to either peace or war, to either the calm or the
storm, the pestilence or anything else. What then? Neither air, nor earth, nor
sea, have any rigor by themselves, unless so far as God by his angels directs
the earth to this use, or while he bends the minds of men in one direction or
the other, to either war or peace. Now, therefore, we clearly see the meaning of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of the living
creatures being in the wheels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>viz.,
that God transfuses his influence through angels, so that not even a sparrow
falls to the earth without his foresight, as Christ says,

12:6.) Therefore, whenever the confusion of our affairs urges us to despair, let
us try to remember this sentiment, that the spirit of the living creatures is in
the wheels. And truly when we tremble in doubtful circumstances, what can we do
but acquiesce in this doctrine &#8212; viz., that the end of everything will be
according to God&#8217;s decree, because nothing is carried on without his
permission, and that there, is no motion, no agitation under the heavens, unless
he has inspired it by his angels. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet states the principal thing in this
vision &#8212; that God was seated on his throne: because if he had spoken only
of wheels and living creatures, the vision had been partial, and therefore
inefficient. But when he places God upon his own throne, we understand that
angels, who inspire motion in other things, have neither vigor nor motion
peculiar to themselves. On the whole, the Prophet here says that angels so move
all things that are done under heaven, that no proper motion ought to be
ascribed to them. And why? because God presides over them and governs their
actions. This is the object of the latter part of the vision, which we are now
going to explain.</font><br></div>

</i>By these words he wishes gradually to draw us to God himself, and God also
so deals with his Prophet that he places different steps by which the Prophet
himself according to his capacity may gradually climb to an immense altitude.
The Prophet does not here speak concerning the throne of God, but only
concerning the firmament. For when we raise our eyes upwards, God&#8217;s glory
appears nearer to us than it does on earth. True it is, that it shines equally
on all sides; but heaven has in itself: greater excellence than the whole earth,
and the nearer we approach to God, the more conspicuous to us becomes his image.
For truly God there exercises his own power and wisdom much more clearly than on
earth. How many wonders does the sun present to us! If we consider first the
planets, and next the stars, we shall be inspired a hundred times with
admiration. Therefore when the Prophet speaks of the firmament, he raises our
thoughts so that they approach by degrees unto God. <i>He saw </i>therefore
<i>the </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>likeness of the

received word. The heavens then, which are always visible, could not render the
Prophet sufficiently attentive. But he saw the

not the mere sky, but a new form submitted to his eyes, as if God were bringing

<div><font face="Palatino">There is some obscurity in the words, but it may be
easily removed if we remark the two ways of covering; for those wings which
tended upwards covered the living&#8217; creatures themselves- that is, their
faces, but the other wings, which were joined to their bodies, covered the body
itself. Some think that there is a repetition here, and say that the two wings
which cover the face and those which cover the body are the same. But this seems
to me absurd. I have no doubt but that what we saw before is repeated, namely,
that each living creature was covered with four wings, comprising the two which
were raised upwards, and the two which were so joined that <i>each </i>living
creature was connected with another. That was one form of covering: but another
was by letting the wings fall which covered the whole body. On the whole, the
Prophet adds nothing new, but impresses what he had said before. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he heard the voice of
wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is an explanation of his
former teaching, when he said that the wings followed the course of the living
creatures, and stood, unless when they were drawn by the living creatures: this
he now expresses more clearly by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We know that, precepts are expressed by the voice, and this is the means of
human intercourse, so that he who bears sway proclaims by the voice what he
wishes to be done. Since therefore what we have previously said was obscure
&#8212; that the wheels were moved by the living creatures &#8212; therefore the
Prophet says there was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a voice in
the motion of the wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had said
this before, and he now repeats that the living creatures sometimes rested and
let fall their wings. When the wings were thus let fall there was no motion in
the wheels; but as the wheels obey the motions of the living creatures, he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wings were
vocal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>not that the wheels were endued
with ears or could hear any commands. But the Prophet could not otherwise
express what I have just said: viz., that heaven and earth are full of angelic
motion, unless he said that in such motion there was something like a voice, as
he said that whatever happens obeys God&#8217;s will. But this obedience cannot
be conceived unless a voice go before it. Now therefore we see the Prophet
weaving his own discourse, and by a new form of speech expressing and confirming
what we formerly saw &#8212; that the wheels were mowed by the living creatures,
because in the wings themselves a voice was heard, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was as it were a voice many or
mighty waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We know that a great
noise arises from the overflow of art impetuous river. Nothing is more terrible
than its sound, for it is something like a crash which seems to threaten the
breaking up of the whole earth, and this vehemence the Prophet now expresses. He
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a voice of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It will be harsh to explain this of
God himself, to whom although the phrase is often attributed, yet we know that
it is done metaphorically. But there ought to be some external likeness which
may show the Prophet what was not visible of itself. But that cannot suit the
phrase, &#8220;the voice of God,&#8221; unless we understand it as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;192905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
29:5, 6, 9<i>, </i>concerning thunder: the voice of God shakes the cedars and
the mountains, and makes the animals miscarry in the woods. Here David calls
thunder the voice of God, but I know not whether this metaphor is suitable to
the present place. Nor yet if we could take the word of God in another sense,
could it mean anything but thunder. Others translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yd&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
shedi, </i>brave or violent, which suits tolerably well, unless a general form
of speech is not sufficiently fitted to this place. For those images of things
ought to be set before the mind of the Prophet that tend to raise it upwards.
Besides, if he had said simply the voice of a strong or violent man, it would
imply but little, so I dare not reject the meaning &#8212; thunder; and if this
exposition is unsatisfactory to any one, yet the meaning will still be a loud
and terrific voice, because Scripture calls cedars and mountains, cedars and
mountains of God, on account of their superior excellence.

<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when they
walked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because there was no other
motion, for he said that the wings of the animals were let fall while they
stood. Then it was not necessary for earthly things to be agitated, unless when
the inspiration goes forward in the living creatures, that is the angels. He
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of
speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here Ezekiel proceeds further,
asserting the voice to be articulate. True, inanimate things cannot hear a
voice, but as I have said, he wished to represent the obedience in the wheels to
be such as if they had been taught, and God had eloquently and articulately
commanded what he wished to be done; or as if the wheels had spoken
intelligibly, so that the wheels might not afterwards roll round rashly, but in
accordance with a received command. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as it were the voice of
armies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And the simile is to be
diligently noticed, because in an army, in consequence of the multitude, one can
scarcely notice another with the view of promoting union, and yet military
discipline requires this.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Therefore, in camps there is great clamor
and confusion, yet each accommodates himself to others, and so order is
preserved. The Prophet therefore signifies, that although infinitely numerous
events meet together, yet nothing is left without guidance, because God governs
all earthly motions with much better skill than a general, though endued with
singular foresight, rules his army. We see therefore what the Spirit intends by
this part of the vision, when he compares the things that are carried on in the
world to mighty forces; for he says that such reason was displayed among this
multitude, that although their clamors are tumultuous, yet all things are
mutually suited to each other. Again he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when they stood they let down
their wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This question may be asked,
how can the living creatures rest when God is always at work: as also Christ
says, My Father and I work even to this day?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
5:17.) Since therefore the power of God is never at rest, what can the resting
of the living creatures mean? for God works by angels as we have seen: if they
rest, God has his periods of repose, which is absurd. But when the Prophet says
<i>they rested, </i>he wishes to mark the variety of human events. For sometimes
they are so tranquil, that we think God is taking some repose, and is completely
at rest in heaven: not that he ever ceases, but because we do not perceive the
agitations, which plainly show his virtue to consist in motion and in action.
Therefore the Prophet here wishes only to denote variety; not that we ought to
imagine God to rest at any time or his angels to repose, but because he does not
always work in the same equable manner.</font><br></div>

described to us the expansion of the heavens. He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was a likeness of a
throne</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>above the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>firmament, and the likeness of a
man sat on the throne.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He mentions the
steps in order by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above
the expansion was the throne, and above the thone a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For he repeats what he had formerly
said about the expansion of the heavens. And as God consulted his infirmity, so
he now accommodates his discourse to the measure of our capacity. It is worthy
of observation that he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
saw the likeness of an appearance. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Hence we
gather, that it was not the true heavens which he beheld, nor was it a throne
formed of any material substance, nor was it a real and natural body of a man.
This also the Prophet clearly expresses, lest any one should imagine that there
is anything visible in God, and, like the fanatics, should suppose him to be
corporeal; so from this passage any one might ignorantly collect, that God can
be seen by the eye, confined within place and be seated as a man. Lest these
imaginings should creep into men&#8217;s minds, the Prophet here testifies, that
it was not a human body nor any material throne which he saw, but that these
forms and appearances only were presented to him. Let not any one think that the
Prophet is vainly prolix in matters sufficiently clear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above the expansion, which was
above the head of the living creatures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We have already explained why he treats of the heads of the living creatures
&#8212; namely, because the former vision ought all to be referred to God
himself. He now adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
expansion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because we cannot ascend from
the living creatures to God without some assistance. Hence the firmament is
brought before us, so that we may arrive at the loftiness of God by degrees. The
phrase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the likeness of a
sapphire stone</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is used to show that
figures only were apparent to the Prophet: and this is the meaning of the
likeness of a throne. For we know that heretics formerly disturbed the Church by
their folly, who thought God to have a human form like ourselves, and also a
throne on which he sits. Hence the Holy Spirit, that he may meet such comments,
says, that the Prophet did not see a material throne, but only the likeness of
one. But this is chiefly needful in mentioning the figure of a man: &#8216;for
this and similar passages, having been erroneously explained by those who
assigned a human form to the Almighty, have given occasion to the error that God
is corporeal and circumscribed within a defined space, and they proceeded to
that pitch of fury, that they rushed in troops and wished to stone all those who
opposed their impiety. The Prophet, therefore, says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he saw, as it were, the
likeness of a human appearance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>One noun
ought to suffice, but because we are so prone to vague and erroneous opinions,
he joins the word &#8220;appearance&#8221; to &#8220;likeness.&#8221; We see,
then, that whatever the ancient heretics fabricated about the visible form of
God is excluded by the clearest language.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now asked, Why God put on the form of a man in
this vision as well as in other similar ones? I willingly embrace the opinion of
those fathers who say that this is the prelude to that mystery which was
afterwards displayed to the world, and which Paul magnificently extols when he
exclaims &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Great is this
mystery &#8212; God is manifest in the
flesh.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The view of Jerome is harsh, who applies these words
to the Father himself. For we know that the Father was never clad in human
flesh. If he had simply said, that God is here represented, there would have
been no absurdity; let all mention of persons be removed, and then it is true
enough that the man seated on the throne was God. The Prophet also at the end of
the chapter bears witness to this, when he says, this was the likeness of
God&#8217;s glory,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
1:28:) for he uses the name Jehovah, by which the eternity and primary essence
of God is expressed. It is quite tolerable that God should be represented by
this figure, but what John says in his chapter 12
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431241&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
12:41,) must be added, that when Isaiah saw God sitting on his throne, he saw
the glory of Christ, and spoke concerning him. Hence what I have already cited
from the ancients completely agrees with this, that as often as God appeared
under the form of man, an obscure glimpse was afforded of the mystery which was
at length manifested in the person of Christ. In the meantime we must entirely
avoid the dreams of Servetus, who is easily refuted by the words of the Prophet.
For he contends that this likeness was really a man, and then that Christ was a
figurative Son, because God was visibly composed, as he said, of three uncreated
elements.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These are most detestable blasphemies, and unworthy
of refutation, yet because that impious blasphemer fascinated many vain persons,
who suffered the deserved punishment of their foolish curiosity, it is useful
just to touch on their errors in passing. He imagines, then, that Christ was the
visible God from the creation of the world, and in this way he interprets him to
be the image of God. He does not acknowledge the Father as a person, but says,
the Father was the invisible God, but that Christ is both the Father&#8217;s
image and also a person. He now says, he was composed of three uncreated
elements. If he had said of three elements only, Christ had not been God, but he
fancies for himself elements called into being which have their origin in the
essence of God; these elements, he says, were so disposed as to have the form of
man, so that he does not say that Christ appeared only in human form, but he
says, that Christ was a man figured in that. divine essence. At length he says,
that Christ was made man of the seed of Abraham, because to these three elements
a fourth was added, which he allows to be created: so he says Christ was man,
because he imagines a mass concocted in some confused manner out of that visible
deity and of the seed of Abraham. Christ then, according to him, was man for a
time, because that visible deity was mingled with flesh, he next adds, that the
flesh of Christ was absorbed by the Deity; and so God was made man not by union
but by confusion; and then he says, that the man was deified, and that
Christ&#8217;s flesh became of the same essence with God: and hence, that he is
no longer man. Hence he derides us, who teach that we cannot be partakers of
Christ unless we ascend by faith into heaven, because he feigns his body to be
everywhere and immense. How can this be? He is deified, says he, and hence
retains no trace of human nature. We now see what monstrous things this impostor
fabricated. But our Prophet dispels such clouds when he says &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then appeared the likeness of the
appearance of a man.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Daniel describes to us the throne of God more
distinctly, who
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
7:9 and following) brings forward The Ancient of Days as wearing- the figure of
a man. There God is placed on the highest summit: next Christ the Mediator is
joined to him: and Daniel says he was brought to the Ancient of Days, because as
Christ descends from the Father, so he was received into his glory, and now the
greatest sway and power has been given to him, as we are there taught at length.
But, with reference to this passage, it ought to suffice us, that the Prophet
saw God only in the person of Christ, because what is said of the likeness of a
man cannot be transferred to either the Father or the Spirit: for neither the
Father nor the Spirit was. ever manifested in flesh, but God was manifested to
us in flesh when Christ appeared, in whom resides the fullness of the Divinity.
In
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7, Paul says that Christ was made in man&#8217;s likeness; and that in form
and habit he appeared man, but in another sense: for he does not make a
figurative Christ, nor does he treat professedly of the essence of
Christ&#8217;s body, but he informs us, that such was his condition when he came
down to us. He says, that he was humbled, so that he differed in nothing from
the human species: and even the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mo&gt;rfh</font><font face="Palatino">
is used by Paul, which distinguishes essence from species. Now, therefore, we
hold the view of Paul, who says, that Christ was found in fashion as a man,
because he was outcast and despised in our flesh. But in this place the Holy
Spirit teaches otherwise, viz., that Christ now appeared in the form of man,
though not yet made man. If any one should now ask, whence this body was taken,
the reply is at hand: the body was not created as to substance, but this form
was created for the time. For God, as is well known, sometimes gives his angels
bodies, which afterwards vanish away. But there was another reason for this
vision, because Christ did not appear in the form of man, that he might taste
food as the angels did,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
19:2, 3) but only that he might accommodate himself to the capacity of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole then is this: the likeness of
body was only in appearance, as the Prophet says, but not in essence. Hence we
collect, that when mention is made of God the whole essence is understood, which
is common to the Son and the Holy Spirit with the Father: for under the name
Jehovah it is absurd to understand Christ only. It follows, then, that the whole
essence of God is here comprehended. At the same time, when the persons are
mutually compared, the phrase, &#8220;in the form of man,&#8221; belongs solely
to Christ. The whole Deity, then, appeared to his Prophet, and that too in the
form of a man, but yet neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit appeared, because
the persons begin to be considered when the peculiar property of Christ is shown
forth. We are compelled to remark this, because fanatics now spread a new error,
as if Christ and the Holy Spirit were distinct Deities from the Father. A
certain impostor, named George Blandrata of Piedmont, once came among us under
the character of a physician, and concealed his impiety as long as he could, but
when he found himself detected he fled to Poland, and infected the whole of that
region with his poison. He is unworthy of mention, but because he wished to
acquire a name by his blasphemies, he has become, forsooth, as famous as he
desired. Since, then, this error is widely circulated, and the whole of Poland
is infected with this diabolical delirium, as I have said, those who are less
exercised in Scripture ought to fortify themselves lest they fall into those
snares. They imagine that Christ is indeed God, but not that God whom Moses and
the Prophets celebrate; and although God is often mentioned in the Law and the
Prophets, yet they restrict this to the Father alone: they allow, indeed, Christ
to be God, but when pressed closer, they say that he is God in
essence,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to whom the Father has communicated his
essence, as it were, by transfusion; so, according to these, he is only a
fictitious God, because he is not the same God with the Father. They think their
impiety is established as often as the Father is simply called God: but the
solution is easy, that a comparison is then made between the Father and the Son.
In John 3, God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son: true, the
Father is here called God, but, on the other hand, the Son is added: so it is
not to be wondered at that the original Deity is placed in the highest position.
At other times, when there is no comparison between one person and another, then
the whole Deity, which is common to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and is one and
simple, is denoted. Lastly, when the persons do not come into consideration,
there is no relation of one to the other, but when the persons are considered,
then the mark of relation between them arises, so that the Father is put first,
and then the Son and Holy Spirit, each in its own order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I shall not collect the universal testimony of
Scripture, because it is sufficient just to put the finger on these foul errors,
lest any of the unskillful should be caught by such snares. When Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:16,) that God was manifest in the flesh, surely he does not speak of
any secondary or adventitious essence. For the essence of God is one: therefore
the whole Deity was manifest in the flesh, as also Christ says, I am in the
Father and the Father in me;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:10, 11;) and in other places he teaches, that the whole fullness of Deity
resides in Christ. Hence we collect, that the essence of God ought not to be
torn, as if one part could be with Christ, and another with the Father. So that
when John, in his Canonical Epistle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:20,) says, that Christ is truly God: This is the true God, he says, and
life eternal &#8212; surely the blasphemy will not be tolerated if men should
say that the true God is any other than the Father. Concerning whom then can
this be predicted, except the only God? If this is transferred from the Father
he will cease to be God. If, therefore, Christ is truly God, it follows, that
his essence is the same as the Father&#8217;s. So that when Paul says, that the
Church was purchased with the blood of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442028&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:28,) surely the name of God is placed there simply and without addition. When
that impostor restricts the name of God to the Father, how will this agree with
the opinion of Paul? God, he says, redeemed the Church with his own blood: if
this were so, we ought to understand that God of glory who was from eternity and
whom Moses and the Prophets celebrate. Now therefore, we understand how Christ
appeared as to person in human form, and yet the whole Deity appeared. That
Christ appeared can be clearly shown from that twelfth chapter of John which I
have quoted.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431241&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
12:41.) That the whole Deity appeared both Isaiah and Ezekiel plainly testify. I
saw Jehovah seated on his throne.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:1.) Who is that Jehovah unless the God of Israel, concerning whom Moses
formerly pronounced, Thy God, O Israel, is one God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:4.) How then does John transfer this to Christ? why, with regard to person. We
see then how well all these things harmonize, because the whole Deity appeared
in the perfection of his glow, and of his immense essence, and yet appeared in
the person of Christ alone, because neither the Father nor the Spirit were ever
clothed in human flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have dwelt a little longer on this doctrine,
because there are many who are not versed in the writings of the Fathers, and
cannot easily satisfy themselves, and these are knotty points; yet I have
endeavored so to clear up a matter which seems obscure and perplexing, as
shortly as possible, that any one of moderate capacity and judgment can easily
understand what I have said. At the same time, I shall not proceed with what I
could skillfully bring forward on the point;. Nothing is more useful in such
matters than wisdom tempered with sobriety and discretion. God appeared under a
visible form to his servant: could Ezekiel on that account do as scholastic
theologians do &#8212; philosophize with subtility concerning God&#8217;s
essence, and know no end or moderation in their dispute! by no means, but he
restrained himself within fixed bounds. Paul was caught up even to the third
heavens,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:4,) but he says, that he heard unspeakable things which he was
not permitted to explain. So, therefore, let us be content with sound doctrine,
which can sufficiently fortify us against all the snares of the devil. For this
reason he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon the throne
was the likeness as of the appearance of a man upon it.</i></font><br></div>

appeared so visible under the form of man that the splendor dazzled his eyes.
For if the appearance of Christ was such that the Prophet could consider each
part separately, as when I behold a man, I not only cast my eyes upon his form
from head to foot, but I consider of what kind his eyes are, and also his sides,
and what his stature is, whether tall or short.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we look at men or trees, a glance is sufficient
for distinguishing their several parts. But if we wish to cast our eyes upon the
sun, they are immediately made dim, for the brightness of the sun is so great
that it dazzles us. Then if our eyes cannot bear the light of the sun, how can
the glance of our mind penetrate even to <i>God, </i>and comprehend the whole of
his glory? This then is the Prophet&#8217;s object when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I saw as it were the color of
amber.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have said that some
interpreters understand an angel here, but in my judgment, their view is
erroneous: hence I reject it, for I have no doubt that color is meant, and what
sort of color. As to Jerome&#8217;s version, <i>electrum, </i>I leave it
doubtful: as to his saying that it is more precious than gold and silver, this
is foolish, because it is composed of both metals. But then its color was
remarkable, because it not only attracted the eyes of the Prophet but dazzled
them with its splendor, so that he acknowledged it as celestial and divine.
Therefore he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was as
it were the appearance of fire within,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which we have previously explained, and that, too,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>round about

Prophet might understand that there were some marks of the glory of God; and at
the same time, that he might perceive, as we shall see at last, this vision to
be otherwise useless unless he restrained himself within due limits: because
when the majesty of God meets us on the way, it can destroy the angels
themselves. What therefore would become of us? But God suits himself to our
capacities, so that visions should be useful to us only when we avoid pride and
are not carried away by foolish and bold curiosity. He says then,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the likeness of a celestial
bow was presented to him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which profane
men call his, and imagine that she performs the commands of the gods, and
especially of Juno. But Scripture calls it the bow of God, not because it was
created after the Deluge, as many falsely suppose, but because God wished to
stir up our hope with that symbol, as often as thick vapors cloud the heavens.
For we seem as if drowned under those waters of the heavens. God therefore
wished to meet our distrust, when he wished the bow in the heavens to be a
testimony and pledge of his favor, because it is said by Moses, I will put my
bow in the heavens.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
9:13.):Now some distort this as if the bow was not in existence before: but
there is no doubt that God wished to inscribe a testimony of his favor on a
thing by no means in accordance with it, as he freely uses all creatures
according to his will. The bow in the heavens is often a sign of continued rain,
and seems as if it attracted the shower. Since then its very aspect may cause
terror, God says in opposition to this feeling, as often as the bow appears, it
is clearly determined that. the earth is now safe from a deluge. But the opinion
of those who consider it in this place a testimony of favor does not seem to me
proved, for the whole vision is opposed to it. This is indeed plausible that a
bow appeared because God now wished to show himself propitious to his servant,
just as they interpret that verse in the fourth chapter of Revelations,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;660403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
4:3,) when John saw the throne of God surrounded by a bow, because God was
reconciled to the world by Christ. As far as this passage is concerned, I do not
dispute it, but to interpret it so here would be altogether out of place,
because the whole of this vision was formidable, as I said at the beginning.
Thus to mingle contrary things would pervert the whole order of the
vision.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is the object of this bow in the heavens?
We have said that heaven appeared to the Prophet as he ascended by degrees to
comprehend the glory of God, because the marks of deity are more conspicuous in
heaven than on earth. For if we look back upon what we have formerly explained,
God is never without witness, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
14:17,) but yet his majesty shines clearer in the heavens. But when the bow
appears, a new reason occurs for magnifying the glory of God. For in the bow we
have the image of deity more clearly expressed, whilst we reflect on the
magnificent workmanship of heaven, and whilst we turn our eyes round to all the
stars and planets. In this way, I allow, God compels us to admire his glory, but
the bow presents an addition not to be despised, as if God would add something
to the; bare aspect of heaven. Now therefore we see why the Prophet saw a
celestial bow, &#8212; that he might be more and more affected when God
presented such signal appearances to his view, and that he might be more induced
to contemplate his glory. Hence what interpreters bring forward about a symbol
of reconciliation is altogether out of place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the form of a bow which is

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the cloud on a rainy

colors are without substance, it is certain that colors arise from the rays of
the sun on a hollow cloud, as philosophers teach. Therefore when the Prophet
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a bow appears on a rainy
day,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he simply means, exists or appears
in the midst; not that the colors have any substance, as I have just said, but
the rays of the sun, whilst they are mutually reflected on the hollow cloud,
occasion the manifold variety. Afterwards he adds again,
like</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the appearance of brightness
round about</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Again the Prophet confesses
that his eyes were blinded, because he could not bear such great splendor. And
God manifests himself familiarly to all his servants, yet so as not to foster
our curiosity, to which mankind are &#8216;far too inclined. God then wished to
manifest himself as far as it was useful, but not so far as the desire of
mankind &#8212; which is always immoderate &#8212; would carry them. Since
mankind so eagerly strain themselves that they easily become weakened, we must
remark what the Prophet inculcates a second time, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the appearance of brightness
was seen round about</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Of what sort,
then, was that brightness? Why, such as to blind the Prophet&#8217;s eyes, and
to render him conscious of his weakness, so that he should not desire to know
more than was lawful, but submit himself humbly to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At length he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this was a vision of the likeness
of the glory of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and by these
words confirms what I have said before, that the glory, of God was so beheld by
the Prophet, that God did not appear as he really is, but as far as he can be
beheld by mortal man. For if the angels tremble at God&#8217;s glory, if they
vail themselves with their wings, what should we do who creep upon this earth?
We must hold, then, that as often as the Prophets and holy fathers saw God, they
saw </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as it were the likeness or
aspect of the glory of God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but not the
glory itself, for they were not fit for it; for this would be to measure with
the palm of our hands a hundred thousand heavens, and earths, and worlds. For
God is infinite; and when the heaven of heavens cannot contain him, how can our
minds comprehend him? But although God has never appeared in his immeasurable
glory, and has never manifested himself as he really exists, yet we must
nevertheless hold that he has so appeared as to leave no doubt in the minds of
his servants as to their knowing that they have seen God. And this is the
purport of those phrases which sometimes appear difficult. I have seen God face
to face, says Jacob.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:30.) But was he so foolish as to think that he saw God like a mortal? by no
means; but that appearance convinced him of its certainty, as if he had said
that no specter by which he could be deceived was presented to his view; for the
devil deludes us unless we are attentive and cautious. Therefore Jacob here
distinguishes the vision which he enjoyed from all prodigies in which profane
nations delighted. Familiar knowledge, then, is the meaning of seeing face to
face. At the same time, as I have said, God never gave the Fathers a sight of
himself except according to their capacity. He always had respect to their
faculties, and this is the meaning of the
phrase,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> this was a vision of the
splendor of Jehovah&#8217;s glory. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Since, then,
it is certain that Christ was beheld by him, he is Jehovah, that is, Eternal
God; and although he is distinct from the person of the Father, yet he is
entirely God, for the Father is in him: for the essence cannot be divided
without impiety, although the persons must be distinguished. The rest I shall
put off till tomorrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>

of which was to confirm his mission, he now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I fell upon my

persuasion that God&#8217;s glory was manifested to him. For the knowledge of
God does truly humble us, while the Prophet also teaches that men cannot be
brought to order unless they are laid prostrate: for he does not say that he was
only prepared to receive the commands of God, nor does he commend his own
teachableness, but rather signifies that he was violently thrown down. For he
had not all at once put off the affections of the flesh; but we know that
confidence is born with us. Therefore, because the Prophet was not naturally
disposed to obey God, he ought to be cast down with fear, that at length he
might be really humbled. Now he adds:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet narrates that he was chosen by the
command of God. For God never prostrates his people so as to leave them lying
upon the earth, but continually raises them afterwards. As to the reprobate,
they are so frightened at the sight of God, that they utterly fall and never
rise again. But it is different with the faithful, because the pride of the
flesh is corrected in them; then God stretches forth his hand to them, and
restores them, as it were, from death to life. And this difference we must mark
diligently, because we see the impious often dread the voice of God. But if they
disdainfully despise him when speaking, they are frightened by his hand when
some signs of his wrath and vengeance appear: but yet they remain lifeless. In
like manner the faithful dread the voice of God, but the result is altogether
different, as we see here: because after God has humbled them, he commands them
to be of good courage, and shows that he intended nothing else but to establish
them by his power. At the same time the Prophet teaches that nothing was
accomplished by this voice till the Spirit was added. God indeed works
efficiently by his own words, but we must hold that this efficacy<i> </i>is not
contained in the words themselves, but proceeds from the secret instinct of the
Spirit. The Prophet therefore shows us both truths. On one side he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I heard the voice of God, so that
I stood on my feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>God thus wished to
animate his confidence: but he adds that he was not raised up by the voice,
until </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit placed him on
his feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This work of the Spirit, then, is joined with the
word of God. But a distinction is made, that we may know that the external word
is of no avail by itself, unless animated by the power of the Spirit. If any one
should object, that the word was useless, because not efficacious by itself, the
solution is at hand, that if God takes this method of acting there is no reason
why we should object to it. But we have a still clearer reply: since God always
works in the hearts of men by the Spirit, yet his word is not. without fruit;
because, as God enlightens us by the sun, and yet he alone is the Father of
Lights, and the splendor of the sun is profitless except as God uses it as an
instrument, so we must conclude concerning his word, because the Holy Spirit
penetrates our hearts, and thus enlightens our minds. All power of action, then,
resides in the Spirit himself, and thus all praise ought to be entirely referred
to God alone. Meanwhile, what. objection is there to the Spirit of God using
instruments? We hold, therefore, that when God speaks, he adds the efficacy of
his Spirit, since his word without it would be fruitless; and yet the word is
effectual, because the instrument ought to be united with the author of the
action. This doctrine, thus briefly expounded, may suffice to refute foolish
objections, which are always in the mouths of many who fret about man&#8217;s
free-will: they say, that we can either attend to the word which is offered to
us or re jeer it: but we see what the Prophet says. If any of us is fit for
rendering obedience to God, the Prophet certainly excelled in this disposition,
and yet the word of God had no efficacy in his case, until the Spirit gave him
strength </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to rise upon his
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we collect, that it is not
in our power to obey what God commands us, except this power proceeds from him.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now more clearly explains the object of
the vision which he has formerly mentioned, namely, that being armed with
authority he might more freely discharge the office of Prophet among the
Israelites. For we know that God claims this honor to himself alone, that he
should be head in his Church, and deservedly so, for he is not called our
Lawgiver in vain,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
33:22;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:12,) and our wisdom consists in nothing else but in attending to his
instructions. Since, therefore, God alone is to be heard, every mortal, whatever
he professes himself, must be rejected, unless he comes in the name of God, and
can prove his calling, and really convince men that he does not speak except by
God&#8217;s command. Therefore, that Ezekiel may not labor in vain, he ought to
prove himself divinely inspired, and this was done by the vision. Now he more
clearly explains that object of the vision. Here it may be remarked, that
figures are illusory without an explanation. If the vision only had been offered
to the eye of the Prophet, and no voice of God had followed, what would have
been the advantage? But when God confirmed the vision by his word, the Prophet
was enabled to say with advantage, I have seen the glory of God. And this can
also be transferred to sacraments, because if signs only are presented to our
eyes they will be, as it were, dead images. The word of God, then, throws life
into the sacraments, as it has been said concerning visions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since Ezekiel so often uses this form of speech,
saying, that he was called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I do not doubt that God wished to
prevent the people from despising him as one of the common herd. For he had been
dragged into exile not without ignominy: since then he differed from the
generality in no outward appearance, his doctrine might be despised and
rejected. God, therefore, takes him up, and, by way of concession, calls him Son
of man. So, on the other hand, he signifies that the teaching ought not to be
estimated by outward appearance, but rather by his calling. It is quite true,
that his language was then more prolix, and we see how our Prophet differs from
the rest. For his language has evidently a foreign tinge, since those who are in
exile naturally contract many faults of language, and the Prophet was never
anxious about elegance and polish, but, as he had been accustomed to homely
language, so he spoke himself. But I have no doubt that God wished purposely to
select a man from the multitude contemptible in outward appearance, and then to
raise him above all mortals by dignifying him with the gift of
prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now see how God prepares him for the
discharge of his duties. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I send
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the children of Israel, a
rebellious race</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, disobedient
and revolting. In this manner the Prophet was able to escape as soon as he saw
the odious duty&#8217; assigned to him, for its difficulty alone would frighten
him. But a double trial is added when he saw himself engaged in a contest with
numberless enemies. He challenged, as it were, to conflict all the Israelites of
his day, and this was a most grievous trial. But another trial was, not only
that he perceived himself beating the air, &#8212; to use a common proverb,
rebut he must have felt it a profanation of heavenly doctrine to address it to
impious men, and that too only for the purpose of exasperating them still
further. We see, then, that the Prophet had no inducement of earthly
gratification to urge him to undertake his duty. If God wished to use his
agency, he ought to afford him some hope of success, or, at least, he ought to
leave it sufficiently uncertain to urge him to make every effort. But when in
the first instance this difficulty occurs, that he has to deal with a perverse
and stubborn generation &#8212; next, that he is drawn into a hateful contest
&#8212; thirdly, that he is advised to cast what is holy before dogs, and pearls
before swine, and thus, as it were, to prostitute the word of God, surely his
mind must despair a hundred times when he pondered these things within himself.
Hence it was God&#8217;s plan to arm him with unconquerable constancy, so that
he might go forward in the course of his calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must bear in mind, then, this principle: when God
wishes to stir us up to obedience, he does not always promise a happy result of
our labor: but sometimes he so puts our obedience to the test, that he wishes us
to be content with his command, even if our labor should be deemed ridiculous
before men. Sometimes, indeed, he indulges our infirmity, and when he orders us
to undertake any duty, he at the same time bears witness that our labor shall
not be in vain, and our industry without its recompense: then indeed God spares
us. But he sometimes proves his people as I have said, providing that whatever
be the result of their labors, it is sufficient for them to obey his command.
And from</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">passage we readily collect that our Prophet was thus
dispirited. And we read the same of Isaiah; for when he is sent by God, he is
not only told that he must speak to the deaf, but what God proposes to him is
still harder. Go, says he, render the eyes of this people blind, and their ears
dull, and their heart obstinate.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:9, 10.) Not only therefore does Isaiah see that he would be exposed to
ridicule, and so lose the fruit of his labor, but he sees that his address has
but one tendency, and that the blinding of the Jews: nay, even their threefold
destruction &#8212; though even one destruction is enough: but, as I have
already said, God sometimes so wishes his servants to acquiesce in his
government, that they should labor even without any hope of fruit: and this must
be diligently marked. For as often as we are called upon by God before we apply
ourselves to our work, these thoughts come into the mind: &#8220;What<i>
</i>will be the result of this?&#8221; and &#8220;What shall I obtain by my
labor?&#8221; And, then, when the event does not turn out according to our wish,
we despond in our minds: but this is wresting from God a part of his government.
For although our labor should be in vain, yet it is sufficiently pleasing to God
himself; therefore let us learn to leave the event in the hand of God when he
enjoins anything upon us; and although the whole world should deride us, and
despair itself should render us inactive, yet let us be of good cheer and strive
to the utmost, because it ought to suffice us that our obedience is pleasing to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:15, 1.6,) that the gospel, although it is a savor of death unto
death, is yet a sweet savor unto God. When it is said that the gospel brings
death, our judgment might immediately suggest to us, that nothing is better than
to leave it. Therefore Paul meets us, and says, we ought not to judge the gospel
by its success. Although, therefore, men not only remain deaf, but even become
worse, and rush headlong in fury against God, yet the gospel always retains its
sweet savor before God. The doctrine of the Prophet is the same. Now, if any one
objects that God acts cruelly while he so purposely blinds men, that those who
are already sufficiently lost perish twice or thrice over, the answer is at hand
&#8212; God offers his word indiscriminately to the good and bad, but it works
by his Spirit in the elect, as I have already said; and as to the reprobate, the
doctrine is useful, as it renders them without excuse. Next, that their
obstinacy may be broken down &#8212; for since they refuse to yield willingly to
God, it is necessary that they should yield when conquered &#8212; when,
therefore, God sees the reprobate thus broken down, he strikes them with the
hammer of his word. At length he takes away all excuse of ignorance, because
being convicted of their own conscience, whether they will or not, they become
their own judges, and their mouth is stopped. Although they do not cease their
rebellion against God, yet they are subject to his judgment. Although,
therefore, this may seem absurd, that God should send his Prophets to render the
people blind, yet we must reverently submit to his counsel, even if the cause is
unknown to us for a time. But, as I have said, we do understand, to a certain
extent, why God thus strives with rebellious and obstinate men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, therefore, since at the very beginning Ezekiel
is informed of the result, it is scarcely doubtful that God wished to prepare
him to descend to the discharge of his duty without yielding to any obstacles.
For some who seem to be sufficiently ready to obey, yet when difficulties and
obstacles occur, desist in the middle of their course, and many recede
altogether; and some we see who have renounced their vocation, because they had
conceived great and excessive hopes of success, but when the event does not
answer their expectations, they think themselves discharged from duty, and even
murmur against God, and reject the burden, or rather shake off what had been
imposed upon them. Because, then, many retreat from the course they had
undertaken, because they do not experience the success they had imagined, or had
presumed upon in their minds, therefore before Ezekiel begins to speak, God sets
before him trials of this kind, and informs him that he would have to deal with
a rebellious people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of Israel are a
revolting nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">drm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
mered, </i>signifies to rebel or resist, and the noun &#8220;rebellious&#8221;
is suitable enough. Therefore</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I
send thee to the rebellions nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because directly after follows the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wdrm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>merdo, </i>which means </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who
have rebelled against me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know that
among the Jews this is a word of reproach; for they often call us
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">mywg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
goim &#8220;Gentiles,&#8221; </i>as if they called us &#8220;profane,&#8221;
&#8220;rejected,&#8221; and altogether alienated from God. Lastly, this word
<i>goim </i>means with them <i>&#8220;pollution&#8221; </i>and
&#8220;abomination;<i>&#8221; </i>we are to the Jews like dung, and the
off-scouring of the world, because we are<i> goim. </i>And there is no doubt
that this pride filled the minds of the people in the days of the Prophet; God
therefore calls them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unbelieving
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. I </i>confess, indeed, that this is
sometimes used in a good sense; but because the Scriptures more usually call
foreigners <i>goim </i>who are not partakers of God&#8217;s covenant, hence it
became a mark of disgrace and reproach among the Jews. It is scarcely doubtful,
then, but that God wished to abolish the honorable title which he had assigned
to them; for it was a holy nation and a priestly kingdom. When, therefore, God
calls them <i>goim, </i>it is just as if he should say, that they were cut off
from all that dignity in which they formerly excelled, and differed in nothing
from the profane and re-jeered nations, as we have a similar description in
Hosea. There the Prophet is ordered to take a harlot to wife. (Hosea 1.) He says
that he begat a son and a daughter, and that, he called the son
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ym[al</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lo-ammi </i>that is, &#8220;not God people.&#8221; Then he called his
daughter &#8220;not beloved.&#8221; By this vision the Prophet shows that the
Jews were rejected, so that God no longer thinks of them as sons, but repels
them as foreigners. So also in this place rejection is denoted, when the
Prophet, as the mouth of God, calls them Gentiles. The plural number is used,
that he may the better express the defection which oppressed the whole people.
If a few only were such as this, the Prophet might still feel encouraged. But
God here pronounced the severest sentence, because the whole people, taken both
at large and separately, was rebellious; and this is the reason why the plural
number is used.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Is &#8216;it then asked whether a single individual
remained who would embrace the Prophet&#8217;s doctrine? The answer is easy. The
discourse does not relate to individuals, but to the whole people; for the
Prophets often use similar language, as when <i>they </i>call the Israelites
degenerate and spurious, then sons of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the offspring of
Canaan: they inveigh against the multitude promiscuously; for they had in fact a
few disciples who could not be classed in that order.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:10;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:16;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
57:3;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
16:3.) But we must hold what is said by Isaiah 8. &#8212; &#8220; Bind my
testimony upon my disciples.&#8221;<i> </i>There the Prophet is ordered from
above to address the faithful, of whom a small number remained, and so to
address them as if the letter were folded and sealed. But he spreads abroad this
discourse among the whole people<i>. </i>So also when God pronounces the sons of
Israel to be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rebellious
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he looks to the body of the
people; at the same time there is no doubt that God always preserved a seed to
serve him, although hidden from man. Daniel was then in exile with his
colleagues, and he surely was not a rebel against God; but as I have already
said, enough has been brought forward to show that the whole people were
impious. God says that he had previously tried what the people was &#8212; They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have
rebelled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which words he signifies that he
was not making an experiment as if they were previously unknown. He says that he
had already found out their perverseness by many trials; and yet he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he sends to

already said, to render their ignorance perfectly excuseless, and then he wished
to break down their

<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they and their fathers have

when he says, that they imitated the example of their fathers, but he rather
increases their own impiety when he says they were not the beginners of it, but
were born of impious parents, as if he should say, according to the vulgar
proverb, &#8220;a<i> </i>chip of the old
block.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it appears that there is no
pretext for the error when we use the fathers as the Papists do, who oppose them
as a shield to God; for whilst they have the fathers on their tongue, they
esteem this a sufficient defense for every impiety. But we see that God not only
reckons this as nothing, but that the crime of the children is exaggerated when
they plead the evil example of their fathers as the cause of their own
obstinacy. Now, not only does the Prophet desire to show this to be a frivolous
excuse, if the Jews should object that they framed their life in imitation of
their fathers, but as we see, it shows them doubly condemned, because<i>
</i>they did not desist from provoking God at the beginning, and so by a
continual succession, impiety and contempt of heavenly teaching prevailed
through all ages, even to their own. Besides, this passage warns us against
abusing the long-suffering of God; for when he sent his Prophet we see the
purport of his doing so &#8212; the people was now on the brink of utter
destruction, but God wished to plunge them deeper into the lowest abyss. Let us
take care lest a similar punishment should be our lot if we remain obstinate.
When, therefore, God sends some Prophets to one people, and some to another:, it
ought to recall us to penitence, and to caution us, lest the word which is
peculiarly destined to the salvation of men, should be to us a savor of death
unto death, as it was to the ancient people. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God proceeds in the same discourse, but expresses in
other words the great rebellion of the people, for they were not only obstinate
and unbending in heart, but also of a contumacious countenance: therefore he
places hardness in face as well as in heart. The words indeed are different,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y&ccedil;q</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yqzj</font><font face="Palatino">,

&#8220;winked&#8221; and &#8220;contumacious,&#8221; for this disposition
appears in the countenance, nor is it objectionable to render it
<i>&#8220;impudent.&#8221; </i>But. propriety of speech must be retained; for we
must speak of the robust of heart as

more apposite, we must render it <i>&#8220;of </i>broken <i>countenance,&#8221;
</i>then of &#8220;broken spirits,&#8221; as we call the wicked
&#8220;brazen-fronted.&#8221; The meaning is, that the Jews were not only
rebellious against God and puffed up with proud contempt, but their impiety was
so desperate that they opposed themselves to God without disguise, as if they
had been horned oxen or furious bulls. We know that hypocrisy often lies hid in
the mind, and although men swell with malice, yet they do not betray what they
inwardly nourish. But the Prophet here signifies that the Israelites were so
immersed in impiety, that they displayed themselves as the open enemies of God
in their very countenances. The result is, that the Prophet, while he applied
himself to perform the commands of God, ought so to determine with himself, when
he approaches the people, that his teaching would be not only useless as to
them, because it would not be received with the reverence which it deserves, but
would be even exposed to many reproaches: since the Israelites were not only
filled with a hidden contempt of God, but they openly showed their ferocity, so
to speak, since they were of so brazen a front that they would without doubt
purposely reject the Prophet.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet I send thee unto

command, as the Prophet simply acquiesces in this word alone, &#8220;I have a
divine mission.&#8221; If he displeases men, he is content to have his labor
approved of God. This is the meaning of the phrase which is now a second time
repeated, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I send thee unto
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the Prophet might object, What
can I do? for if they are of a brazen heart and of an iron front, I shall labor
in vain. But God answers in return, that the Prophet need not be anxious, it is
enough to have a command: as if a prince should not explain the whole of his
counsel to his ambassador, and yet should order him to discharge his embassy,
thus God acts towards his servant. We see then how God here magnifies his
authority: and we must mark this diligently, that we may not wish always to be
bargaining with him, as we are accustomed. For unless God show us the present
fruit of our labor, we languish, and so we endeavor by turning back to withdraw
ourselves from his authority: but God opposes this single sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I send

<div><font face="Palatino">After God has admonished his servant as to the
difficulty of his mission, he now strengthens him and exhorts him to unconquered
freedom. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if he should say, this alone is
sufficient for overcoming all obstacles, that he has to take in hand God&#8217;s
business. For even here God does not give fixed commands, that he will do
afterwards in its place, but the observation is general. <i>Thus saith Jehovah:
</i>that is, I bring forward nothing of myself, but faithfully relate what God
has commanded. We see then the Almighty&#8217;s object here: viz., to oppose his
name to the obstinacy of the people, and he orders the Prophet when instructed
by his authority to be of a brave and intrepid disposition, although he has
stern and hard-hearted enemies. Afterwards he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whether they will hear or whether
they will forbear, yet they shall acknowledge that a prophet has been among
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, again, God exhorts his servant to persevere
whatever be the event of his labor, for if we do not succeed according to the
desire of our minds, we are inclined to despair: but God wishes us to proceed in
the course of our duty, though all things should turn out contrary to our
wishes. But he shows that there shall be some fruit of our labor, although the
people, through their own depravity, reject what has been said to them: for this
thought breaks the spirits of God&#8217;s servants, when they do not perceive
the usefulness of their labor: for we always desire to accomplish something
worth the trouble which we give to it. God therefore here signifies that he has
some other object in view than the salvation of men; namely, the removal of all
pretext for error, and the stripping off of every disguise of impiety in which
men willingly clothe themselves. For even hypocrites, though they perish
knowingly and willfully, yet think themselves excusable, unless God afford them
the light of his doctrine. The meaning therefore is, although the
Prophet&#8217;s teaching would not profit the Israelites, yet it would be useful
in another way, namely, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they
may perceive that there has been a prophet among
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In this way there is no defect,
although some think the words of the Prophet abrupt: for an important word seems
to be wanting when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whether they will hear, or
whether they will forbear, because they are a rebellious house, and they shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. For we have said that the
copula ought to be resolved into the adversative particle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because even then they shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for their perverseness shall not
prevent their being convinced by God. We may learn then from this place, that
although the impious furiously endeavor to reject the doctrine of God, yet they
obtain no other end than the more complete manifestation of their own
wickedness. Hence, also, we may learn that God&#8217;s doctrine is precious to
himself, and that he cannot bear us to despise it. The wicked then never can
escape punishment when they treat with contempt the divine teaching, for it is
as if they trampled upon inestimable treasure, Those who are left without the
law and the prophets shall not escape God&#8217;s hand, because their conscience
is sufficient to take away all excuse.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:12.) But when God invites men to himself, and approaches near them, and offers
himself to them in a peculiar manner as their Father and Teacher, if they reject
so remarkable a benefit, truly their ingratitude is worthy of the utmost
severity. For as often as God raises up prophets for us and faithful ministers
of his doctrine, let this which has just been said come into our minds: unless
we embrace such a benefit, we at length shall know that a prophet has been among
us, because God will exact fearful vengeance for the contempt of his great
loving-kindness. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God again commands his servant to break forth
boldly, even if the people deny him all approach through their malice and
wickedness. But because we often fail through terror; God arms his Prophet with
impregnable confidence against the threats of the people, and then against all
discourses of every sort. He brings forward no other reason
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>than they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or a rebellious and perverse
nation. For we said, though at the first glance it might seem cold, yet it
suffices to animate the servants of God to know that he commands nothing rashly,
and when they acknowledge that God is pleased by their spending their breath
upon the deaf, yet they do not cease to discharge their duty, although they
fatigue themselves in vain as far as the world is concerned. But now when this
thought is added, that God will take care of his own servants, it doubles their
confidence and good spirits. Thus it happens, that all threats and terrors being
despised, they discharge their duty boldly. For this reason he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou, son of man, do not be
afraid of them, nor be terrified at their
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By &#8220;words,&#8221;<i> </i>I
do not understand simply threats but calumnies by which we know the servants of
God to be oppressed. For hypocrites rise up with great confidence and complain
of the injury done to them, and then presumptuously take upon themselves the
name of God, as at this time the Papists not only vomit out threats by which
they disturb us, but haughtily boast themselves to be the Church, and confirm
this by perpetual succession; then they say that the Church never is without the
Holy Spirit, and hence it cannot happen that God should ever desert them. We
see, therefore, that the domestic enemies of God not only use threats against
his servants, but at the same time bring many false pretenses by which they load
the true and faithful Prophets with envy and hatred. But,<i> </i>however such
calumnies have some appearance of truth when its enemies unjustly press us, God
orders us to proceed with unconquered fortitude.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not
afraid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of either them, or their
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And since the same phrase is
repeated shortly afterwards, hence we infer that it has no common meaning. It is
therefore worthy of observation, that God once, yea twice, pronounces that we
ought not to fear their words who boast themselves to be the Church of God, and
doubt not petulantly to render that sacred name a laughing-stock by their use of
it. Since, therefore, God allows us to despise language of this kind, there is
no reason why the Papists of this day should daunt us, when, with inflated
cheeks, they thunder out the name of the Church and the Apostolic authority; for
just honor is not attributed to God, unless every lofty thing in the world is
compelled to obey him, so that the doctrine alone may shine forth which comes
direct from the mouth of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he adjoins, <i>because, </i>(or <i>although,
</i>for this causal particle may be resolved adversatively,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>however rebellious they may be,
and like thorns, however thou mayest dwell among scorpions, yet do not fear
their words, and do not be broken down by their
appearance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ttj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chetheth, </i>signifies to be rubbed and broken, and it is here transferred to
the mind, and is to be metaphorically understood for being broken in spirit, as
if it had been said, be thou intrepid in receiving all threats and calumnies,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage teaches us that none
are fit to undertake the prophetic office, unless those who are armed with
fortitude and perseverance whatever may happen, so that they do not fear any
threats, nor hesitate or vacillate when oppressed by unjust calamities. So Paul
says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:8,) that he persevered through both evil report and good report,
although he was unworthily slandered by the wicked. Whoever, therefore, wishes
to prepare himself faithfully for undertaking the office of a teacher, should be
endued with such constancy that he may oppose, as it were, an iron front to all
calumnies and curses, threats and terrors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We cannot doubt but that the Israelites were much
enraged when they heard themselves called thorns and scorpions. But they ought
to be thus stung, since if they had been attacking a mortal man only, they would
conduct themselves far more petulantly. But when God pronounces them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scorpions and
thorns</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and they see the Prophet
performing commands of this kind fearlessly and without hesitation, they are
necessarily impelled to either fury or silence. But when they have striven to
the very last in their obstinacy and hardness, yet God at length causes them to
yield through shame, because truth has prevailed, of which the Prophet was a
minister endued with such great fortitude of mind. We also perceive from this
passage, that the Prophets often spoke with great asperity when the wickedness
of those with whom they had to deal required it: yet they were not hurried away
into any excess, or carried forward with intemperance against their adversaries.
But they could not in any other way vindicate their doctrine against the wicked,
who, impelled by a diabolical fury, strove with even God himself. We must hold,
therefore, that although they were cruel and severe in language, yet they
breathed pure humanity from the heart. For our Prophet was not a barbarous man,
who excited by indignation, vomited out coarse reproaches against his own
people, but the Spirit of God dictated, as we see, what might seem too severe to
soft and delicate ears.</font><br></div>

change of a few words, yet the meaning is the same, that the Prophet should not
desist in the midst of his course, if he saw that he did not obtain what he
wished and hoped for. For when we apply ourselves to what God commands, we ought
to be of good cheer, and expect that some fruit of our labor may appear. We may,
therefore, indulge both hopes and wishes, but if it should turn out otherwise
than we anticipated, yet we ought to leave the result in the hands of God, and
to proceed even to the goal in the discharge of our duty. To this end this

as we mentioned yesterday, that there were some, though few in number, to whom
his teaching was useful, but he treats here of the people at large. We must
learn, therefore, when God calls us to the office of teaching, not to regard the
conduct of mankind. For if it please God to exercise us while we strive with the
rebellious and refractory, yet God&#8217;s word must be uttered, because he

him of a cause of stumbling which might break his spirit; for when he perceived
the great obstinacy of the house of Israel, he might refuse the office of their
teacher a hundred times over. God, however, adds incentives and exhortations to
perseverance, although he experiences the abandoned obstinacy of the house of
Israel: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do thou
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,

discharge the teacher&#8217;s office, unless he be a proficient in God&#8217;s
school. It behoves, therefore, those who wish to be thought disciples of God to
be teachers of truth, and for this purpose first to listen to God&#8217;s
instructions. Then he takes away a stumblingblock, as we have said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be not thou, rebellious like the
house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For we know that a
multitude has much influence over us to disturb us: for the consent of a whole
people is like a violent tempest, where all conspire together, and even those
who are not wicked yet are carried forward with the crowd. Since, therefore,

indefinitely concerning any people, but concerning &#8216;that nation which
boasted itself to be divinely elected, and bore in the flesh the symbol of its
adoption. Yet God wishes the consent of his people to be neglected by his
Prophet, because we know how insolently the Israelites boasted themselves to be
the sacred and peculiar people of God; in the same way indeed as the Papists now
exult, Israel then vaunted against all the Prophets. And therefore this passage
must be diligently observed, because at this day many of these magnificent

lest we should be struck with awe when Satan uses God&#8217;s<i> </i>name to
deceive us. And as we must use discernment, God here shows us the rule of doing
so. For if we are thoroughly persuaded that, the doctrine which we follow and
profess is from God, we can safely look down from on high not only upon all
mortals but upon angels themselves: for there is no excellence so great but that
God&#8217;s truth outshines it. Therefore when formerly the Israelites pretended
that they were God&#8217;s people, and were adorned by the marks of a true
Church, we must hold that the honor of the Church is frivolous when hypocrites
reign in it, or rather exercise impious tyranny, and oppose themselves to God
and his doctrine. And at this very day we may turn this passage against the
Papists &#8212; nay, even point it at them directly as often as they bring up
those pompous titles of &#8220;the<i> </i>Catholic Church,&#8221; and
&#8220;the<i> </i>Spouse of Christ,&#8221; for God has said once for all, that
we ought not to be rebellious, although the whole house of Israel should become
so; that is, although those who bring forward the name of God should mutually
enter into a diabolic conspiracy, yet we must not regard their conduct so as to
subscribe to their impious conspiracy. We read the same in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:12, 13,) Thou shalt not say a conspiracy whenever this people says conspiracy:
thou shalt not feel their fear nor their dread, but sanctify the Lord of hosts.
Which passage Peter also cites,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 3:14, 15;) because the Jews, who then pertinaciously opposed the gospel,
weakened the feeble by their boasting, by saying that they were the Church, and
yet rejected and abominated the new teaching which was then spread abroad: Peter
cites that place of the Prophet, namely, although the house of Israel impiously
conspired against God, yet such contumacy must be despised. Afterwards the
Prophet adds,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:18,) Behold! I and the children whom God hath given me for a sign and a
wonder. He says, therefore, that those little ones who worship God purely, and
withdraw themselves from the common impiety, were like monsters, and were
esteemed as complete wonders. But the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
accommodates this place to the reign of Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:13,) and not without reason. For to this day we are a wonder to God&#8217;s
enemies, who carry themselves not only with boldness but with abandoned
impudence against the pure doctrine of the gospel. To them we are heretics,
schismatics, dogs &#8212; nay, the offscouring of the world. But although we are
to them for signs and wonders, it is sufficient for us to be acknowledged by
God: because it is needful for us to be separated from that impious conspiracy
unless we wish to be separated from God himself. For what agreement is there
with Papists, or what union with those dregs, unless by separation from God
himself? Therefore, because we cannot extend the hand to Papists on any other
condition, and cultivate a brotherly intercourse with them except by denying
God, let all that injurious union with them cease, and let us learn to separate
from them with boldness, since we clearly see that we are all commanded to act
thus in the person of the Prophet: for he had said a little before, a prophet
dwells in the midst of them &#8212; and this was clearly expressed, that he
might manifest more anxious care for himself. For it is difficult to walk amidst
thorns and scorpions, lest we should be pricked, and lest we should be struck by
their virulent tail. God, then, commands us to be so attentive, that although we
walk amid thorns we should not be pricked by them, and also that we should not
be injured by the poison of scorpions; and if we seek from heaven that prudence
which does not naturally belong to us, this will happen, for if the Spirit of
God govern us, he will preserve us harmless from every bite of the serpent, and
from all injury and mischief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>open thy mouth, and eat whatever
I shall put before thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this
practical symbol God confirms Ezekiel in his vocation: for he orders him <i>to
eat a book, </i>which was fulfilled in vision. Jeremiah uses the same metaphor,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:16,) but with some slight difference, because our Prophet seemed to himself
to eat a volume: but Jeremiah only signifies that he had digested the words of
God like food, not that he only tasted them with his tongue, and that they were
so thoroughly fixed in his mind as if he had really dressed and digested them.
But God wished to confirm our Prophet in another way, namely, by offering him a
volume, and commanding him to eat it. There is no doubt that this volume
comprehended<i> </i>whatever the Spirit of God afterwards dictated to the
Prophet; and yet the effect was just as if God had made a mortal the channel of
his Spirit: as if he had said, &#8220;Now<i> </i>you shall utter nothing human
nor terrestrial; because you shall utter what my Spirit has already written in
this book.&#8221; But here we see a difference between the true servants of God,
who discharge their duty in earnest, and talkative men, who are satisfied with
their own powers of eloquence ,or rather garrulity: for there are many ready
speakers who utter what they have never digested, and thus their teaching is but
vapid. And this is the meaning of what Paul says: the kingdom of God is not in
word but in power.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:20.) But those who truly consecrate themselves to God, not only
learn what they speak of, but as food is eaten, so also they receive within them
the word of God, and hide it in the inmost recesses of their heart, so that they
may bring it forth from thence as food properly dressed. Now, therefore, we
understand why God wished the Prophet to eat the book, concerning which also it
follows afterwards &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet more fully explains what we have just
dwelt upon. He narrates how a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>volume of a book was offered to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>that is, a book in the form of a
roll was offered to him. For the noun which he uses,

<i>megleth, </i>comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gelel, </i>to roll, as the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>volume</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>among the Latins. For they were formerly accustomed to write on rolls, that
is, they had not the form of books so compact and well arranged as we now use,
but they had volumes, which barbarians call rolls. Ancient documents were
written in this way, for there is nothing ancient in the archives of princes
which is not written on rolls. Hence the phrase, &#8220;In<i> </i>the volume of
the book it is written of me,&#8221; etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:8;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:7.) Now the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>such
a volume was offered to ,me that I might eat
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, it was offered to me by a
hand sent forth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But by this symbol God
more clearly shows that the volume was not merely formed in the air, nor was
produced anywhere but in heaven. For if the Prophet had only seen a volume
presented to him, he might doubt whether it was sent by God or not. But when the
hand which offers the volume appears, and is truly sent forth from God, nothing
is wanting for full and complete certainty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after the volume was unrolled,
that he saw it written on each side</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>by
which words he understands not that any brief command was given to him, but that
a length of much time was imposed. For if he had only spoken concerning the
roll, the Jews might have contemptuously rejected him after three or four days,
as if he had come to an ends&#8221; A roll was indeed offered to thee, but now
thou hast spoken three or four times, is not this sufficient?&#8221; Hence, as
the Prophet might meet with neglect, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the roll was written before and
behind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now says, for such was his
argument, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that lamentations only
were written there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
hegeh, </i>signifies sometimes meditation and speech simply, but here,
<i>because </i>it is connected with lamentations, there is no doubt that it is
to be taken for a mournful strain. At length the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hei, </i>is added in the sense of grieving. On the whole then, the Prophet
teaches, that the instruction contained in the book was not sweet or pleasant,
but full of sorrow, since truly God here showed proofs of his anger, and this
cannot be apprehended unless by its causing grief and lamentations. Now,
therefore, we understand that the Israelites were more and more exasperated,
when the Prophet said, that he came like a herald who denounced war in the name
of God, and, at the same time, had no message of peace. As to the rest of the
people, we shall see afterwards, in many places, that he was a messenger of
God&#8217;s mercy, but his duty was to rouse up the Jews, that they might feel
God their adversary: thus the Prophet was sent with no other object than that of
going, as an armed man, into the midst,, and uttering threats in the name of
God. I cannot now proceed further, although what follows is connected with this
subject.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel, as we have just seen, proceeds to say, that
a book was given him to eat, because God&#8217;s servants ought to speak from
the inmost affection of their heart. We know that many have a tongue
sufficiently fluent, but use it only for ostentation: meanwhile, God treats
their vanity as a laughing stock, because their labor is fruitless. Hence we
must observe the passage of Paul already quoted, &#8220;the kingdom of God is
with power.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:20.) But the efficacy of the Holy Spirit is not exerted unless
when he who is called to teach applies his serious endeavors to attain to the
discharge of his duty. For this reason, then, Ezekiel is commanded to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat the
roll</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Next he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was as sweet as
honey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, but a little before, he said
it was filled with curses: therefore, either he had put off all humanity, or
ought to be grieved, when he found himself appointed to be the herald of
God&#8217;s vengeance. But, in other places, we saw that the servants of God
were endued with feelings of an opposite kind; for, as they were often rough and
stern like their work, so they condoled with the miserable people: but, their
grief did not hinder them from proceeding in the discharge of their duty. For
this reason Ezekiel now says, <i>the book was sweet, </i>because he acquiesced
in God&#8217;s commands, and although he pitied his own people, yet he
acknowledged that it could not happen otherwise, and subscribed to the just
judgment of God. Therefore, by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sweetness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he signifies his acquiescence in embracing the office enjoined upon him, and
he so obeyed God that he forgot all the material for sorrow in the book, because
the justice of God prevailed and thus extinguished the feeling of too great
humanity which might otherwise have delayed him. Jeremiah uses the same
expression.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:16.) He says, that he found the words of God, and that they became to him
gladness and joy of heart. For we saw, that he was only anxious but very
sorrowful when he thought that utter destruction was impending over the people.
But, as I have just said, these two things are not discordant: that Prophets
should desire the safety of the people, and use their utmost endeavors to
promote it, and yet manifest a firm constancy, and never hesitate, when
necessity demands it, to condemn the people and to utter God&#8217;s threats
which are enjoined &#8216;upon them. Thus shortly afterwards Jeremiah says, that
he was filled with anger; thy words were found, says he, and I did eat them, and
they afforded me joy and gladness of heart, because thy name has been called
over me, O Jehovah God of hosts: that is, because I have been taught by the
power of thy Spirit, and as I have been called to this office, so thou hast
stretched forth thy hand unto me that I may fulfill thy commands with good faith
and constancy: therefore thy words were my delight. Afterwards he adds,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:17,) neither have I sat in the council of scorners, nor have I exalted myself
for the sake of throwing off the <i>yoke; </i>for since I perceived that thou
must be <i>obeyed, </i>I was, as it were, overpowered, yet I did not sit with
the scorners, but I sat alone, says he, because thou hast filled me with
indignation. Hence we see, that in one person were two feelings very different
and contrary in appearance, because he was filled with indignation, and yet
received joy through the words of God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now at greater length God explains why he wished his
servant to eat the volume which he held forth in his hand, namely, that when
instructed by it he might approach the children of Israel; for he ought not to
come empty, and we know that man of himself can bring forward nothing solid:
hence Ezekiel must receive from God&#8217;s hand what he delivers to the
Israelites. Let us then preserve this order, as the volume is first given to the
Prophet, and then transferred to the people. God orders him,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to offer or speak his own
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is worthy of remark, as
having the same meaning. But if Ezekiel ought to bring forward nothing but what
he had received from God, this rule ought to prevail among all God&#8217;s
servants, that they should not heap up their own comments, but pronounce what
God teaches them as if from his mouth: lastly, that passage of Peter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:11) ought to guide us, he who speaks in the Church ought to speak the
words of God. Now he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I do
not send thee to a people strange in ,speech and hard in language, but to the
house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Stone think that the
prophet is here animated to his duty, because God demanded nothing from him
which was too difficult. For if he had been sent to remote nations with whom
there was no interchange of speech, he might object that a greater burden than
he could bear was imposed upon him. The difficulty would then have been a
complete obstacle. They think that remote and foreign nations are here compared
with the people of Israel, that he may discharge his duty with alacrity, as if
it had been said, <i>&#8220;I </i>do not send thee to strangers. For neither
could they understand thee, and they also would be barbarians to thee, but
because thou art familiarly acquainted with thine own people, thou canst not
turn thy back when I send thee unto them.&#8221; But this opinion does not
approve itself to me, because I read these three verses in the same context, as
they are united. It is by no means doubtful, that, by this comparison, God
aggravates the impiety of the people. For this sentence is first in order, that
the Israelites would be deaf, although the Prophet should use among them the
common and vernacular language: this is the first point: now he shows the
reason, because </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were a
bitter people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God signifies, that
nothing prevented the Israelites from obeying the doctrine of the Prophet but
their malice and impiety. For this reason he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I do not send thee to a people
profound in speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I know not how some
have conjectured that this epithet means learned or clever; for it is the same
thing for a people to be of a strange speech and of a hard language. For what is
a <i>&#8220;hard&#8221; </i>but a barbarous language? Now we perceive the
genuine sense, that the Prophet is not sent to men of an unknown language
because he would have been a barbarian to them and they to him.
<i>I</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> do not send thee to
them, therefore, but to the house of Israel.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to many
peoples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those who translate
<i>&#8220;many&#8221; </i>by <i>&#8220;great,&#8221; </i>do not understand the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning, for God had spoken in the singular number concerning
all people, but now he uses the plural, as if he had said, I send thee neither
to Egyptians, nor to Chaldeans, nor to any other remote nation, since the world
is on all sides of thee, inhabited by peoples whose language thou dost not
understand: to those therefore I do not send thee. The particle, <i>if not,
</i>follows, and Jerome translates, &#8220;If<i> </i>I had sent thee unto
them,&#8221; although the negative particle is interposed, literally, <i>if not,
</i>but because this phrase appears harsh, some have supposed
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alA&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>am-la, to </i>have the sense of swearing, and interpret it affirmatively for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tmak</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
cameth, &#8220;truly,&#8221; </i>or &#8220;surely.&#8221; But if we receive it
so, the passage will be defective; for they understand
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
am, &#8220;again,&#8221; &#8220;afterwards:&#8221; </i>for these two words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alA&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>am-la, </i>have the force of an oath interposed. What sense then shall we
extract from the words, <i>&#8220;truly </i>I will send thee unto them, and they
shall hear thee?&#8221; We see then this sense to be too forced. Some explain
the passage thus: &#8220;If<i> </i>I had not sent thee unto them, they would
have heard thee,&#8221; as if God here blamed the disposition of the people,
because they rather sought vain and foolish prophecies:, than submitted
themselves to the truth; just as if he had said, if any impostor should pour
darkness upon them, they would immediately embrace his fables and lies, as they
are so prone to foolishness. Since, therefore, I send thee, therefore they do
not hear. But this explanation does not suit, because a little afterwards we
shall see it in its own place. To me therefore this context is most probable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if I had not sent thee to them,
these also would have heard thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if
it had been said, unless a difference of speech had interposed, I had rather
have used thine assistance with reference to foreign nations. In this way God
signifies his displeasure, when he says, that he would rather send his Prophet
hither and thither than to the Israelites, except through the want of a common
language; for this difference of language presented the only boundary to the
Prophet, so that he was confined to his own people. In this sense there is
nothing forced. I <i>do not, </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>send thee to many peoples,
profound in ,speech and strange in tongue, because thou wouldst not understand
their language</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But if this had not been
an obstacle, I would have sent thee, and they would have heard thee. We see then
what I have just touched upon, that the Israelites are compared to foreign or
uncircumcised tribes, because they rejected the instruction offered them, not
through ignorance of the language, but through the hardness of their heart.
Isaiah also says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:11, 13,) that the word of God would be deep and obscure to even the Jews
themselves, but in another sense; he also compares his prophecies to a sealed
book, since God had blinded them according to their deserts. Since therefore
they were so given over to a reprobate mind, and were destitute of sound
understanding, therefore he says, that his teaching would be like a closed and
sealed book: then he says, that he would be a barbarian, as if he was using an
unknown language. So God in this place clearly shows that the house of Israel
were suffering no impediment in profiting by his word, except their own
unwillingness to hear.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:16; Isaiah 29:11.) For he says, that the heathen would be obedient, if they
could be partakers of such a benefit. Unless therefore the language of the
Prophet had been unknown to the profane and uncircumcised heathen, he had there
found attentive and obedient disciples, as God testifies. How then comes it to
pass that the house of Israel cannot hear! It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the house of Israel are
unwilling to hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the house of
Israel is unwilling to hear thee, because it will not hear me, says
he.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, therefore, we clearly see the sloth of the
people assigned as a reason why they purposely rejected the Word of God, and
hardened themselves in obstinacy. He also ascends higher, and says, that the
people were not only disobedient to the Prophet but to God himself, as Christ
also when he exhorts his disciples to perseverance in teaching. Therefore, says
he, they will not hear you, because they will not hear me, and why am I and my
teaching hated by them, unless because they do not receive my Father?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
15:18.) For this stumblingblock is likely to break the spirits of the pious,
when they see their teaching so proudly rejected. This reproach alone,
therefore, is often accustomed to recall the servants of God from their course:
but this admonition is proposed to them in the midst, that God himself is
despised. Why then should they take it ill, that they are held in the same
estimation as God, who is himself rejected? They think themselves undeserving of
such contempt and haughtiness being thrown upon their labor. But is not God
worthy of being listened to before all angels? Since, then, they are proud and
unbelieving towards God himself, it is not surprising that they do not
reverently receive what is proposed to them by mortal man. Now, therefore, we
see what the intention of God is when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of Israel will not hear
thee, because they do not hear me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>lest
it should be vexatious to the Prophet to see his labor profitless, nay, even the
children of Israel rising against him: because he ought to bear it patiently, if
he should suffer the same obloquy which they did not hesitate to display against
the Almighty himself. It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the whole house of Israel
is of a bold or a daring aspect, and of a hard
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He repeats what we saw before,
but in other words &#8212; namely, that the people&#8217;s hardness of heart was
untameable, and that they were not only obstinate in heart but brazen in
countenance, so that they cast aside all modesty; and lastly, he implies that
their obstinacy was desperate, when he joins a brazen countenance with a hard
heart.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel was forewarned of the obstinacy of the
people, yea, even of their desperate <i>wickedness. </i>Now God strengthens him
lest he should despair when he saw that he must contend with such abandoned and
reckless men; for what else was it than contending with stones? If Ezekiel had
been commanded to strike a mountain, it would have been just the same as
contending with such a people. He had need then of this strengthening, viz.,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his forehead should be adamant
against the hardness of the people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If
he had hoped for more fruit from his labor, perhaps that facility had been the
cause of negligence: for confidence makes us more remiss when the work in hand
is neither laborious nor difficult. The Prophet, therefore, would have been
colder, if, certainly persuaded that the people would be docile, he had
approached them more carelessly. God, therefore, excites him when he speaks of
their obstinacy. As then it was useful that the Prophet should comprehend how
arduous was the duty to the discharge of which he was called, so also he ought
to be armed with the strength of God, for otherwise he would have been easily
overcome by its difficulty. This is the reason why God adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he had given him a stout
front and a brazen aspect against the face and front of the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Besides, in this way he was
admonished that fortitude was to be hoped for from some other quarter, that he
might not spend his strength in vain, but allow himself to <i>be </i>governed by
the Spirit of God. For when we think only on the quality and quantity of our own
powers, they may easily flow away, and disperse, and even become vapid, unless
we discharge our duty with manliness. God, therefore, recalls his Prophet when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he had given him a
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if he would say, that the
Prophet did not make war in his own strength, but was armed with celestial
virtue. Although, therefore, this seems to have been spoken once for
Ezekiel&#8217;s private use, yet it belongs to us all. Let us learn, then, when
God calls us to the office of teaching, never to measure the effect of our work
by the standard of our own capacity, nor yet to consider our own powers, but to
repose on some communicated strength which God here extols in no empty praises.
Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge that God is sufficient for overcoming all
obstacles, will gird himself bravely for his work; but he who delays for
calculating his own strength is not only weakened but is almost overcome.
Besides, we see that we are here instructed in humility and modesty, lest we
should claim anything as due to our own strength. Hence it happens, that many
are so full, yea so puffed out with confidence, that they bring forth nothing
but wind. Hence, let us learn to seek from God alone that fortitude which we
need: for we are not stronger than Ezekiel, and if he needed to be strengthened
by the Spirit of God, much more do we at this time need it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, we gather from this passage that although the
whole world should rise up against the servants of God, yet his strength would
be superior, as we saw it was with Jeremiah: They shall fight against thee, but
they shall not prevail.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:19;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:20.) Hence there is no reason why we should be afraid of the violent attack
of any enemy, and although the whole world should be in a tumult, yet we need
not tremble, because God&#8217;s strength in us will always be more powerful.
Therefore it is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as an
adamant, harder than flint, have I placed thee; therefore do not fear
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have placed the forehead of the
Prophet like adamant;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not that he strove
with the people by either injustice or audacity, but <i>because </i>God opposed
the confidence with which Ezekiel was endowed to the furious impudence of the
people. In this sense then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
forehead of the Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adamant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Now he adds &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do not
fear, then, and do not be broken by their face or
presence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These phrases, that the
Prophet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be not
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet fear
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>seem to be opposed to each other,
since he excels in unconquered fortitude. But God so tempers his favor, that the
faithful always have need of excitements, even when he animates them, and
supplies them with strength. God, therefore, so works within his servants, that
they do nothing except as they are ruled by his Spirit; and yet they have need
of his teaching, since his exhortations to them are never superfluous. Profane
men think that there is no use in teaching, and that all exhortations are
frivolous, if God, when he acts upon us by his Spirit, not only begins, but
continues and perfects his own work. But the Scripture shows that these two
things mutually agree; for while God strengthens us and renders us unconquerable
by his Spirit, at the same time he breathes virtue into his exhortations, and
causes them to flourish within us, and to bring forth fruit In this way God on
his part confirms his Prophet, by giving him an adamantine forehead and more
than stony, and by giving him an unconquered spirit, and yet he exhorts him to
fear not. We see, then, how God governs his own people within them, and yet adds
teaching as an instrument of his Spirit. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they are a rebellious
house,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or although they are; for the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>is often put adversatively, as we have said elsewhere. If we take it
in its proper sense, it will suit very well,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if it had been said, the
Prophet has no cause for fear, because he was carefully admonished beforehand,
and nothing new could happen; for we are accustomed to be very much frightened
by novelty; but when we have meditated on what happens, we are not disturbed,
neither do we stand still nor hesitate; for although the Prophet had already
learnt that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of Israel
was rebellious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>yet he perseveres,
because he experiences nothing new or unusual. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This is a repetition of the same doctrine; for we
said that our Prophet is more verbose than Isaiah, and even than Jeremiah,
because he had accustomed himself to the form of speech which was then customary
among the exiles, he is not, therefore, either so restricted or so polished; but
we must understand that he accommodated his language to learners, because he had
to do with a people not only rude and dull, but also obstinate. And then they
had degenerated as much from the purity of their language as from that of their
faith; hence the Prophet purposely bends aside from elegance of language.
Whatever repetition he might use with men so dull and slothful, it was not
superfluous. He says, therefore, what we have formerly seen,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was commanded to speak
all the words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but he previously says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was commanded to receive
them in his heart, and to perceive them with his
ears</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The order is inverted, because we
must perceive with the ear before we receive in the heart. And they philosophize
with more subtlety than truth who say, that the interior hearing precedes,
inasmuch as the ears are struck by the sound in vain, unless the heart was
already docile. For although God prepares his elect for hearing, and gives them
ears for that purpose, yet his teaching does not penetrate to their minds before
it has been received by the car. There is no doubt, then, that here one thing is
put before the other, by what we call a
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[steron
pro&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The result is, that; the
Prophet, as he is sure of his calling, hears God speaking to him. But this was
not said for his sake, but that he might securely boast himself to be a servant
of God, and bring forward nothing but what he had heard from the mouth of God
himself. As, therefore, in this confidence, he was to contend against the
people&#8217;s impiety, so he was commanded
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to hear the words of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We hear, then, a repetition of what
we formerly saw, namely, that the Prophet freely boasts that he did not bring
forward merely windy eloquence, as profane men do, who have no other object than
to obtain the applause of men.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may go and proceed to the
captivity, to the children of his own
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see, then, that God does not
regard the Prophet so much as the Israelites, because they had never willingly
yielded to the Prophet when he brought a message by no means pleasing. For
nothing could be more sad and hateful to them than to hear threats and curses.
Because, then, they had never willingly bent to obedience, he is sent with a
testimony that he had learnt what he uttered in God&#8217;s school; then that he
had so learnt from God, that he adds nothing of his own; lastly, that he so
speaks, that; the obstinacy of the people is not <i>overcome:

pleasing to God, although it be useless to men, yet this ought to suffice us,

that God had worked upon his mind by the secret instinct of his own Spirit.
Although, therefore, God had exhorted him to fortitude, yet the Prophet shows
what he demanded of himself. In short, the Prophet was strong in God, because
God implanted his virtue within him. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was raised up by the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which only means that the

doubt that this benediction was suitable to the occasion of its utterance: when,
therefore, this voice was heard, God wished to refute the clamorous voices of
the people who thought themselves injured. For we know that the people were
querulous, and murmured because they thought themselves treated with greater
harshness than they deserved. Hence the glory of God is opposed to all impious
and sacrilegious blasphemies, which the Israelites were in the habit of vomiting
forth against God, as if he treated them cruelly. In short, this voice
restrained all calumnies, by which the impious then endeavored to overwhelm the
glory of God. He says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that glory
is blessed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because although men dare
not utter gross and open reproaches against God, nevertheless they curse his
glory as often as they detract from his justice, and accuse him of too much
rigor. Hence, in opposition to this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a voice is heard, saying, the
glory of God is
blessed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I understand the Temple. I
confess that in many passages of Scripture heaven is so called; not that
God&#8217;s essence, which is immense, can be included within any place; for as
heaven is called his throne or seat, so also the earth is his footstool, because
he fills all things with his immensity. So here, as often in other places, the
Temple is called God&#8217;s place, because he dwelt there with respect to men.
Besides, this is said as well with reference to the exiles as to the rest of the
people yet remaining at Jerusalem. For the exiles did not sufficiently consider
that they were banished from their country, and dragged into a distant region,
through the just vengeance of God. Since, therefore, this captivity did not
sufficiently subdue them, the name of God ought to be set before them, that they
might know that they were not banished from their country by the cruelty of
their enemies, but by the judgment of God. The Prophet, doubtless, regards also
those Jews who as yet remained at home: for they boasted that God was seated in
the Temple, and so fancied that they should be always safe under his protection.
But the Prophet, as we shall afterwards see, denounces on those who remained a
punishment similar to that of those who were in captivity. It is then just as if
he had said that God remained in his Temple, that he might shine there with
conspicuous glory. Now as he wished to humble the ten tribes as well as the
other two, so he wished to alleviate the grief of them all, that they should not
cease to hope for the promised return. For calamity itself might lead them to
despair, and to suppose their salvation impossible: nay, to think that God was
as it were dead, and his virtue extinct. To what purpose, then, was the worship
of God? to what purpose the splendor and dignity of the Temple, unless that God
should protect his own? But they had been deserted by him; here then was matter
for despair, unless it had been met: the Prophet now treats this, since on one
side he reminds them that God was the just avenger of wickedness, when he
suffered the ten tribes to be dragged into exile, yet that he would be their
deliverer, because he does not cease to reign in his Temple, although profane
men think him conquered, and treat with wanton insolence their own triumphs over
him. Now therefore we perceive the sense of the Prophet: for this sentence would
be cold if it were merely general; but when it is accommodated to the state of
things at the time, we see that the glory of God is not extolled by any vain
eulogium, and that the Temple is not mentioned in vain.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now seems to express from whence the
voice which he heard proceeded: for I do not think that the voice proceeded from
any other quarter, and that afterwards the living creatures moved in unison with
the wheels, but it seems to me to explain what would otherwise have been
doubtful, namely, that God&#8217;s glory was celebrated by the living creatures
and the wheels. It is not wonderful then that a voice should be attributed to
the living creatures, because we saw them to be cherubim or angels, as by the
wheels God wishes to mark all actions and motions; motions, I say, which seem
fortuitous, but yet are governed by the living creatures, whom God inspires with
his own virtue, while he wishes to execute his designs, and so exercises his
dominion over all creatures; for nothing happens which is not governed by his
will. Hence a voice proceeds as well from the living creatures as from the
wheels, which extolled the glory of God, and proclaimed him, in the midst of
that sad and wretched slaughter of the people, still reigning in his own Temple;
then, indeed, especially exercising his power, because he was a judge, in
punishing their wickedness; then because he was about to become the deliverer of
his own people, as he had promised them restoration after seventy years. He says

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what we have formerly seen, namely, that
he was acted upon by the Spirit of God, so that it was in some way without
himself, and not as profane men have invented, enthusiastically: for their
Prophets were deprived of self-control, and the devil so dealt with them, that
they were not of sound mind. Hence the Prophet does not understand that he was
deprived of self-control, because God&#8217;s Prophets were of a sedate and
composed mind; but he understands that he was so governed by the Spirit of God,
that he was unlike himself, and did not breathe a terrestrial air; lastly, he
understands that visible marks were graven upon him, which obtained for his
doctrine authority with all the people. And it was the more necessary that the
Prophet should be adorned with his own proofs, on account of the dullness of the
people, and also because his message was distasteful to them, and he had not
previously discharged the duty of a teacher. It was needful, therefore, that he
should be so renewed that the <i>people </i>should acknowledge him as inspired.
He had lived familiarly among his friends, and was sufficiently known both by
appearance and character. Meanwhile God, as I have said, separated him from
common life, that he should represent something celestial; and the object of
this was, as we have shown, to <i>conciliate </i>confidence and reverence
towards his teaching. He felt indeed the agitation of the Spirit, and it is
scarcely to be doubted that the people also knew it, otherwise they would
scarcely have had <i>confidence </i>in him when speaking of
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The object of this remarkable government of the
Spirit was, that the Israelites, if only awake and attentive to the miracle,
might know the Prophet to be in some manner renovated. But what follows seems
opposed to the former sentence; for he says
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:3) the volume was sweet as honey, but now
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he departed in the
bitterness of his spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;. </i>but as I
briefly explained yesterday, this is easily reconciled; for the Prophet was not
deprived of all sensation. Although he was entirely consecrated to God, and in
no degree remitted his diligence and alacrity, yet he retained some human
feelings: hence the spirit of bitterness of which he speaks, which he calls
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whence we perceive an implied
contrast between that motion by which he was caught up and that feeling, which,
although not sinful, was in some way different from the grace of the Spirit,
because the Prophet so burnt with zeal that he performed the commands of God
almost in forgetfulness of self: yet, at the same time, he felt within him
something human, since the power of the Spirit had not extinguished all sorrow.
We hold, therefore, that the Prophet was in some degree inspired by the Spirit,
and yet that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own spirit was
bitter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the hand of Jehovah was
strong upon me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
&#8220;hand,&#8221;<i> </i>some understand prophecy, but in my opinion
ignorantly: I do not doubt that its meaning is power or authority. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of God was
strong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he ought to obey God,
although the bitterness of which he spoke should draw him in a contrary
direction. As Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:14, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:23,) that he was constrained by a zeal of God, so also the Prophet signifies
that he was constrained by the secret instinct of the Spirit, so that he did not
act from human motives, nor yet obey the wishes of his own mind, nor follow his
own individual will, but was only intent on rendering obedience to God. In this
sense, then, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the
hand of God was strong upon him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Otherwise it might be objected &#8212; why did he not fall away when he was
so oppressed with grief, and anxiety so overwhelmed his spirit? he replies, the
hand of God was strong and prevailed, since otherwise he would have failed a
hundred times, had he not been supported by the power of God. And thus we see
that there was some repugnance in the Prophet, since as man he was affected with
sorrow, but the power of the Holy Spirit ruled over him, so that he denied
himself and all his human affections.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says, that he had returned to his own people,
not that he had ever removed from them, but had been drawn by the vision from
the intercourse with men. For God revealed himself to him on the bank of the
river Chebar, but he was solitary: and that this was done by vision, is by no
means doubtful, since he was always among his own people. How then does he say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he is now
returned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>Why, because the vision had
vanished, and so he was entirely occupied with the other captives. What some
affirm with subtlety, that he was like a monk, is frivolous: for they say, that
he abhorred the wickedness of the people, and, that he might not contract any
stain of impurity, had sought solitude: but this is not probable. Without
doubt., the Prophet means that he returned to his former mode of life from the
time when he heard God speaking and saw the vision. He then says &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I sat seven
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in some way absorbed in either
admiration or sorrow, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;m&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,

</i>be astonished,&#8221; <i>&#8220;to </i>wonder.&#8221; But as to the Prophet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sitting quiet and silent for
seven days,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>there is little doubt but
that in this way God prepared him for beginning to speak afterwards to the
greater surprise of the whole people. Nor ought it to seem absurd that he was
dumb although sent by God:: for this did not occur through any negligence or
delay which can be accounted a fault, but the office of teaching had been so
imposed that he was not yet instructed by any fixed commands; as if any one were
chosen ambassador either by a king or a senate, and were afterwards furnished
with his instructions, so the Prophet was called to the prophetic office., but
knew not yet what he was to say. He had indeed eaten the roll, but God had not
yet suggested whence he ought to begin, nor how he ought to temper his doctrine.
Hence Ezekiel had not yet been drawn forth: therefore he says, that he sat with
either great stupor or great desolation, as they say. For his very appearance
would rouse the attention of men, that they should enquire the meaning of this
unusual sorrow. Whatever it was, we see that this silence was a preparation for
the discharge of his duty with greater fruit and efficacy, since his speech
ought afterwards to be received with greater reverence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when he had been silent for seven
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I came to the exiles who sat in

opinion of those who take this for the name of a place, and ancient interpreters
even have left these two words. Their Septuagint version has
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mete&gt;wron</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwlt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thelol, </i>if the Prophet meant that he was exalted, but this is not
suitable, since he rather asserts that he was like the rest of mankind after the
vision was withdrawn. Some render it <i>&#8220;skillful,&#8221; </i>but I am not
aware of their reason: but as I have already said, their opinion is probable,
who suppose it the proper name of a place. Jerome translates, <i>&#8220;a
</i>heap of fruit,&#8221; and not badly; for this was probably the origin of the
place&#8217;s name, as cities and villages and mountains often receive their
name from their situation and other ,circumstances; so also this place was
called Thelabib. For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thel, </i>signifies &#8220;a heap,&#8221; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byba</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>abib, </i>means a &#8220;stalk,&#8221; or &#8220;straw<i> </i>of corn,&#8221;
and it may, therefore, be that the place was called Thelabib on account of its
fertility, since the harvest there is very plentiful. But this is of no great
moment. What we have mentioned must be especially remembered, that the Prophet
was beheld in that sad and sorrowful countenance,

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet shows more clearly why he continued
in silence for seven days, because, indeed, he had been appointed a teacher, but
the time had not fully arrived in which he was to utter the commands of God. He
waited, therefore until he should receive a distinct message. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the end of seven days I
received a word from the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whence we
gather, that he had been chosen before, and that the burden of an embassy was
imposed upon him: meanwhile he stood, as it were, in suspense, because he did
not distinctly understand what he was to say, and where he ought to begin. Hence
it appears, that God acts by degrees towards his servants, so that he claims
them for his own, then he shows them generally what duties and labors they have
to discharge, and at length he sends them forth to the performance of their
work, and the execution of their office. This we see was done in the case of our
Prophet. For first he learned that he was chosen by God, afterwards he was
admonished generally to behave himself courageously, and not to yield to any
threats or terrors: at length God explained to him what commands he wished him
to bear to the people. As yet God seems to speak but generally, but it is as if
he announced that the time had come when the Prophet must gird himself to his
work: hence he says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, Son of man I
have appointed thee a watchman of the house of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What Ezekiel heard belongs to all teachers of the
Church, namely, that they are Divinely appointed and placed as on watch-towers,
that they may keep watch for the common safety of all. It was the duty of those
who have been appointed from the beginning ministers of the heavenly doctrine to
be watchmen. And would that in the Papacy, as this name has been imposed on
idols, dumb and blind and deaf, those who with swelling cheeks call themselves
Bishops, had been admonished of their vocation. For we know that the word Bishop
means the same as watchman. But when they were boasting themselves to be
bishops, they were drowned in the darkness of gross ignorance: then also they
were buried in their pleasure, as well as in sloth, for there is no more
intelligence in these animals than in oxen or asses. Asses and oxen do spend
their labor for the advantage of man, but these are not only destitute of all
judgment and reason, but are altogether useless. But what I have said is to be
remembered, when God chooses Prophets, that they are placed, as it were, on
watch-towers, that they may keep watch for the safety of the whole Church. This
ought now to have its force, that pastors may acknowledge themselves placed in
stations whence they may be watchful: and this, indeed, is one point. Now this
cannot be done unless they are endued with superior gifts and prevail in the
grace of the Spirit above the commonalty. Nor is it sufficient that pastors
should live as private men, but they ought to wait longer, as if they were
placed on a lofty watchtower, which demands both diligence and a power of
observation: this is a second point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt hear words from my
mouth, and shalt announce them to the people
from</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> me. </i>Here a general rule is
prescribed to all Prophets and pastors of the Church, namely, that they should
hear the word from the mouth of God: by which particle God wishes to exclude
whatever men fabricate or invent for themselves. For it is evident, when God
claimed to himself the right of speaking that he orders all men to be silent and
not to offer anything of their own, and then, when he orders them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to hear the word from his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he puts a bridle upon them
that they should neither invent anything, nor hanker after their own devices,
nor dare to conceive either more or less than the word: and, lastly, we see that
whatever men offer of their ownselves, is here abolished, when God alone wishes
to be heard, for he does not mingle himself here with others as in a crowd, as
if he wished to be heard only in part. He assumes to himself, therefore, what we
ought to attribute to his supreme command over all things, namely, that we
should hang upon his lips. But if this was said to Ezekiel, how is it that men
of no authority now dare to spread abroad their own fictions, as we see done in
the Papacy? for what. is such a religion but a confused jumble of the numberless
fictions of men? dray have heaped together, from many brains, an immense chaos
of errors; &#8216;for they wish us to adore as the oracles of God whatever
foolish men have imagined. But who among them will boast himself superior to
Ezekiel? nay, if they were all put together will they dare to assert that they
can be compared with him alone? And if they dare, who will admit their
arrogance? We see then, that Ezekiel with the other Prophets is reined in, that
he should not say anything but what he has heard from God&#8217;s
mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt admonish them from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word which the Prophet uses,
signifies as well to admonish as to caution. There is no doubt that he means
those admonitions by which men are roused to caution, lest they should perish
through any error or thoughtlessness. Hence after God had subjected the Prophet
to himself, and commanded him to be a disciple, he appointed him a teacher,
because hearing was not sufficient, unless he who had been called to rule the
Church should deliver out of his hand what he had received from God. God
therefore commands his Prophet to speak, after he had ordered him to hear. But
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the people may understand that
God alone is the author of instruction. False teachers, indeed, proudly assume
the name of God, as we see in the Papacy that this axiom sounds through it, that
the Church is ruled by the Holy Spirit immediately, and therefore that it cannot
err: but these two things are to be read conjointly, namely, that he who is
appointed a teacher should hear God speaking, and afterwards should admonish in
the name of God himself, that is, should profess that he is the minister and
witness of God, so that his teaching should not be thought his own. For those
who affect the praise of ability, or learning, or eloquence, often obscure the
name of God, and therefore although they professed that they had their teaching
from God, yet afterwards they speak from themselves: that is, they puff
themselves up with vain ostentation, so that the majesty of God does not appear,
nor the efficacy of the Spirit in that profane method of teaching. Hence God
afterwards imposed a law upon his Prophet, that he should utter nothing but what
he had heard: now he adds another clause:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he should admonish the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but he must admonish them not
from himself, but must always have in his mouth that sacred name of God, and
show that he is in reality sent from him. For after this manner spake Moses,
What am I and my brother Aaron?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
16:11.) Here we see that Moses spake from God; that is, professed himself to be
God&#8217;s minister, when he bore witness that he was nothing, that<i> </i>he
assumed nothing to himself, and acted in nothing by his own peculiar counsel or
motion.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is now taught how difficult and dangerous
an office he has now to undertake. God had previously laid it down as a law that
he should utter nothing of himself: now he adds, that, the watchman is so set
over the people that he must render an account of the diligence with which he
goes through his watches. It is just as if it had been said that souls were
committed to his care and fidelity, so that if they should perish he must
undergo punishment before God. But it is better to explain the words &#8212; if
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when I say to the impious,
&#8220;Thou shalt surely die,&#8221; and thou dost not admonish him, and he
perish, then from thee will I require his
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In the first place, God confirms
what we saw yesterday, that it is not. permitted to any mortal to condemn or
absolve at his own discretion. When, therefore, God sends forth his servants, he
does not resign that power, for still the supreme authority remains with
himself: because there is one lawgiver, as James says, who can save and destroy.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:12;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
13:19.) And elsewhere Ezekiel reproves the false prophets, because they keep
alive the souls which were dying, and slay the souls not devoted to death. For
we know that proud men always tyrannize over the conscience when they take upon
themselves the prophetic name, and substitute themselves in the place of God, as
their practice is in the Papacy. For the Pope indeed pretends that he does
nothing in his own proper name, but meanwhile he claims the prerogative of God,
and sits in the temple as an idol, because nothing is more peculiar to God than
ruling our minds with celestial doctrine; but the Papists themselves heap on
their own comments, and so it comes to pass that they miserably distort and
drown their own consciences even to utter destruction. They enact laws according
to their pleasure, then they always add the condition, that they must be kept
under pain of eternal damnation, or of mortal sin, as they say. This place,
then, must be diligently marked, where God claims to himself alone the power and
right of condemning: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if, says he,
when I say to the impious.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this we
infer, that all those are sacrilegious who bind consciences with their own laws,
decrees, and enactments, enforcing one thing and forbidding another, because
they take away from God what here he wishes to be assigned to him, for it is his
office alone to pronounce sentence, for Prophets are only his
heralds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile those fanatics are to be rejected, who,
under pretext of this place, wish to give license to sin, and assert there is no
difference between good and evil, because it is not our duty to condemn. For,
properly speaking, we do not assume anything to ourselves when we recite what
has proceeded from the mouth of God. God condemns adulterers, thieves,
drunkards, murderers, enviers, slanderers, oppressors: if one inveigh against an
adulterer, another a thief, a third a drunkard, shall we say that they take upon
themselves more than they ought? By no means, because they do not pronounce of
themselves as we have said, but God has said[it, and they are but witnesses and
messengers of his sentence. Yet this moderation must be maintained, not to
condemn any one through moroseness, since many immediately abominate whatever
displeases them, and cannot be induced to use diligent inquiry. Inquiry,
therefore, should precede our sentences; but when God has spoken, then we must
follow the rule which was given to the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if thou hast not admonished him,
and spoken for his admonition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the
character which was imposed upon Ezekiel is referred to: for the same duty does
not devolve upon private individuals who do not bear the prophetic name. For we
must remark that this is not a general declaration which concerns all men at
large, but it concerns a Prophet who had already been called to be a watchman:
for unless those who sustain such a burden admonish mankind, no excuse remains
for them but the necessity of sending an account to God for those who are lost.
And the repetition shows that this ought not to be done as a matter of course,
but that Prophets ought to be anxious and even zealous in recalling sinners.
This clause was clear enough: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if
thou dost not admonish the wicked after I have
spoken:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and hast not spoken for his
admonition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This sentence seems to be
repeated in vain, but God signifies that. unless the Prophet admonishes sinners,
he is not absolved, because he spoke once in passing and uttered but a single
word. We should remember that sinners ought to be continually reproved that they
may return to the right way. And this is the tendency of Paul&#8217;s doctrine
to Timothy:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;be instant in
season and out of season.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Timothy 4:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For if it had been sufficient to reprove sinners
mildly, and afterwards to spare them, Paul would have been content with that
courtesy, but he says, we must be urgent on every occasion. The minister of the
Church then must not cease to repeat these admonitions, as Paul says elsewhere
to the Philippians &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am not weary of
repeating the same things to

<div><font face="Palatino">And we know what he professes in the Acts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:31.) I have not ceased day and night, publicly and privately, to admonish
each of you. That perseverance then which Paul shows that he used is here
enjoined on all the Prophets and servants of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to urge him to turn from his evil
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, to be cautious; as it was
said yesterday,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rhz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zeher, </i>means to be cautious; here it is taken <i>actively</i> &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unless thou hast spoken, that
thou mayest teach him to be cautious, or to return from his evil
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here it may be asked, why does God
touch only on one side of the teaching, and omit the chief point? For why was
the law given? and why were Prophets called forth, unless to collect the people
for God? Here we must exercise the obedience of faith, since we know that God
regards nothing as more important than uniting miserable men in the hope of
eternal life. This is the chief end of the law and the gospel, that men being
reconciled to God, may worship him as a Father. Chastisements, threats, and
terrors follow afterwards, of which now there is only the mention; but we must
consider the condition of the people, as we have already seen it; for at that
time the prevalence of impiety, and contempt of God, and of all kinds of
wickedness, was so great, that the Prophet could not address the people mildly
and softly. Since, indeed, that passage of Paul must be remembered,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:21,) what will ye? how shall I come to you? with a rod, or in the
spirit of mildness? When he gives the Corinthians the choice, whether they wish
him to come in a spirit of tenderness, or armed with a rod for their
chastisement &#8212; and why? For when they were self-satisfied with their sins,
Paul could not, according to his custom, treat them as sons, nor deal freely
with them, but he was compelled to assume, as it were, another character, and to
use pure austerity and rigor. Such, then, were the Israelites, and hence we
cannot feel surprise that God should lay aside his pity, his promises of favor,
and whatever is sweet and pleasant to men; for they were not in a fit state to
hear the paternal voice of God, unless previously subdued; and this could not be
done without violence, because of their exceeding perverseness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we must remark, that the more displeasing the
Prophets&#8217; embassy, the greater need they had of excitements; because, if
the grace of God only is to be set before a people, and the hope of eternal life
to be held out to them, since there is nothing in such teaching which greatly
offends them, or embitters their feelings, hence it is easy to offer freely
messages of this kind. But when men are to be summoned, or rather dragged, to
the tribunal of God, when they are to be frightened by the fear of eternal
death, when the minister, in the armory of God, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:5-7,) brings his vengeance before mankind, because offense is
thus stirred up, and this sometimes instigates men to fury, because, they cannot
bear thus to be pressed home with the word of God; hence it is necessary that
Prophets themselves should be animated, lest they fail, or even hesitate in
their duty. Now, therefore, we understand why God speaks only of his own threats
and terrors, for he mingles no taste of pity, because, in truth, the Israelites
were not capable of profiting by any mildness, so that the Prophet would never
have dared to discharge his duty so courageously unless this threat had been
added. In other places we shall see the Prophet as God&#8217;s ambassador, for
reconciling the miserable exiles to God; for he will bring forward many
testimonies concerning the reign of Christ, and the restoration of the Church,
and will herald the mercy and pardon of God; but before he can utter any message
of grace, he must himself contend with the extreme obstinacy of the people.
Hence it is, therefore, that God only can say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the impious must be
admonished, that they may return from their
impiety</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to give them
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and this may seem absurd, because
all hope of repentance was taken away beforehand; they are a rebellious house
and a bitter one, thou wilt not profit them.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
2:5, 6, 8.) But it now seems that the fruit of his labor is promised, when
mention is made of the life of those who, when admonished, shall repent. But in
the first place we must remember, that some individuals always are curable, even
if the whole body of the people appears desperate. For God, when he previously
said that all the Israelites were rebellious and intractable, referred to the
body at large, but as he is accustomed to preserve some small seed, there were a
few remaining in that people who might be converted by the Prophet&#8217;s
labor. This is one point. Besides, we must remember, even if no success from
labor appears, yet it ought to satisfy us, just as if we had succeeded better
and according to our wishes. For example, suppose our duty to be with the
impious multitude, where-ever we turn our eyes contempt of God meets us, and
even such wickedness, that we seem to lose all our pains. But yet, whilst the
sin of the people affords us only materials for despair, we ought, nevertheless,
to pursue our course, just as if the seed sown were producing fruit. Although,
therefore, Ezekiel had heard from God&#8217;s mouth that the people would be
rebellious, yet he ought to spend his labors for God quite as much as if he
either perceived or hoped for some good result. In the meantime, what I have
touched upon must be borne in mind, namely, that God always has some seed as a
remnant, although the people as a whole may be lapsed into
impiety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the impious man shall die in his
impiety, but I will require his blood at thy
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God here says, that he had called
his servant under this condition, that he must render an account if any one
perished through his fault. This place, although I have lately touched upon the
subject, shows how dangerous an office those sustain who are called to the duty
of teaching. Nothing is more precious to God than souls which he has created
after his own image, and of which he is both the Redeemer and Father. Since,
therefore, our souls and their salvation are so dear to God, hence we infer, how
anxiously Prophets and all pastors ought to discharge their duties; for it is
just as if God were to commit souls to their care, under this condition of
rendering an account of each. Nor is it sufficient to admonish one and another,
for unless they had endeavored to recall all from destruction to life and
salvation, we hear what God here pronounces. Hence, also, Paul uses this
expression, woe is me if I preach not the gospel, for a necessity is laid upon
me.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:16.) In fine, that the Prophet may be roused to undertake his
office, God here announces that certain penalties hang over him, unless he
diligently endeavor to recall all wanderers into the way of salvation. But,
because men think that their ignorance will prove a sufficient defense, this
cavil is removed, because God says they shall perish, although they were not
admonished. This exception is added advisedly, that men may not flatter
themselves, and throw the blame upon their pastors, if they perish in error.
Although, therefore, any one has not been admonished, yet he shall die, and
although the pastor shall render an account of his negligence, and shall spare
himself while doing so, yet he shall have no excuse before God. Now we perceive
that negligence in Prophets and pastors is allied to perfidy, when they
knowingly and willingly permit souls to perish through their own silence:
meanwhile, it is not surprising if God adjudges to death those who are not
admonished: for their conscience<i> </i>is a sufficient accuser,<i> </i>and
however they may now defend their error and ignorance, it is certain that they
perish of their own accord. Afterwards it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is here taught how usefully he will lay
out his labor, although he should appear to fail, for he ought to be satisfied
with this alone, that God approves his efforts. Although, therefore, those who
were to be brought back by holy exhortations remain obstinate, yet God&#8217;s
servants ought not, through fastidiousness, to throw up their commission as if
it were useless, for they free their own souls. It has been formerly said, that
a necessity was imposed upon them, but if they are dumb dogs the destruction of
souls will be imputed to them, but when they have executed their duty and
satisfied the Almighty, ought not it to suffice them to be absolved in his
opinion? We see then, that the Prophet was animated by this consolation, lest he
should be weary of admonishing abandoned and obstinate men, because, if they
were not profited by his teaching, yet its fruit should return to himself. That
expression of Christ&#8217;s is well known, &#8220;Into whatsoever house ye
enter, salute it: if the house be unworthy, your blessing shall return to
yourselves.&#8221;

10:5, 6.) So also when the Prophets anxiously desired to reclaim the wandering
sheep and to collect them within the fold, if they experienced such petulance
that their labor did not profit them, yet their usefulness shall return to
themselves. Now we understand the counsel of God in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou, therefore, hast freed thy

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God adds another part of duty which is incumbent
on all Prophets. For they are first sent to bring back into the way those who
had been alienated from God, then to retain those who are already within the
flock, and to lead those onward to the goal who have already entered upon the
course. We see, therefore, that Prophets ought to be occupied with both duties,
so that they may not only recall to their obedience to God those who wander
after their own lusts, but also confirm those who are, of their own accord,
teachable already, and encourage them to persevere, and prevent them from
failing away. Hence, after God has spoken concerning the correction of sinners
who had strayed, he now adds another member. If, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the righteous man be turned aside
from his righteousness, and thou hast not admonished him, he shall ate, and I

</i>Where in effect God signifies, that Prophets are guilty, not only if they do
not exhort those who have withdrawn from the right way to retrace their steps,
but also if they do not retain within their duty those who have already entered
upon the right course. We must then have two objects in view, to recall those
who have fallen into various errors, and to take care that those within the fold
should not fall away, but be strengthened in perseverance. Hence it is now
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If the righteous shall
turn aside, he indeed shall die, but his blood will I
require</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here it may be asked, how can the just turn aside,
since there is no righteousness without the spirit of regeneration But the seed
of the Spirit is incorruptible,

Peter 1:23,) nor can it ever happen that his grace is utterly extinguished; for
the Spirit, is the earnest and seal of our adoption, for God&#8217;s adoption is
without repentance, as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29.) Hence it may seem absurd to say, <i>that the just recedes and turns
aside from the right way. </i>That passage of John is well known &#8212; if they
had been of us, they had remained with us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 2:19,) but because they have departed, that falling away proves
sufficiently that they were never ours. But we must here mark, that
<i>righteousness </i>is here called so:, which has only the outward appearance
and not the root: for when once the spirit of regeneration begins to flourish,
as I have said, it remains perpetually. And we shall sometimes see men borne
along with a wonderful ardor of zeal for the worship of God, and to be urged to
promote his glory beyond even the very best men; indeed we shall see this, but,
says Paul, God knows those who are his own.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:19.) Hence it is not wonderful that God under the name of
righteousness here commends virtues which deserve praise before men, even if
they do not spring from a pure fountain. Thus we see it. often happens that the
righteous are alienated, <i>and
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn aside from the right

us up to seek from God continually a spirit of perseverance, because such is our
propensity to sin, that we immediately flow in different directions like water,
unless God strengthen us. When therefore we see the righteous themselves depart
from the way, let us lea4 and become sure of the constancy of our own faith,
only let our confidence be founded on the help of the Holy Spirit and not. in
ourselves. In the meantime, we see that Christ did not pronounce this passage in

24:13,) because many fall away in the midst of their course, or reversing their
steps, turn their backs upon God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we must carefully remark what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his righteousness shall not be
remembered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because some desire to
bargain with God, so that if for a time they enter upon the pursuit of piety,
that may be taken into account and avail in their favor. But we hear what God
pronounces, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all their
righteousness shall not be remembered in the case of
backsliders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is no encouragement
to flatter ourselves into sloth and security, when God shows that unless we
continue to the end, even the goal of our career, whatever else we attain unto,
it is useless. He says, as clearly as words will express it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if he shall fall
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or recede, or turn aside
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from his righteousness and shall
commit iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We must mark this
diligently, because we know that the very best men often fall away; but here a
falling away is intended, where any one casts himself headlong on impiety: hence
to commit iniquity is to give oneself up entirely to impiety; as when John says,
that those who are born again of the Spirit of God do not commit sin,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:9,) he means, are not addicted to sin, even if as yet they dwell among
many infirmities and failings: as also Paul says, that sin dwells in us, but
does not reign.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:12.) Hence to commit sin is to give oneself up to sin. But God says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or for placing, or if I shall
have placed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a stumblingblock
before his face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Punishment is here
called a stumblingblock, when God demonstrates his vengeance against apostates.
Although a stumblingblock may also be called actual admonition, as the phrase
is; but because that is too far-fetched, I receive it simply,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if the righteous shall have
turned aside: but I shall have rendered the reward which he
deserved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he shall die,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because thou hast not admonished
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>in his unrighteousness shall he
die: thus I point it off, for interpreters seem to me improperly to have mingled
together &#8212; he shall die, and &#8212; he shall die in his iniquity. Now
that threat which we have seen is repeated, namely, that all prophets who have
deserted their office are guilty before God, because their sloth differs little
from perfidy: for God considered them worthy of the greatest honor, since he
committed souls to them, which, as we have said, he esteems so dear and
precious. But if they reject this trust committed to them, we see that they not
only act injuriously to man, but are also ungrateful to God; and their
sluggishness is not only united with perfidy, but also with sacrilege, because
they permit Satan to snatch from God what was his own. Just as if any watchman
should desert his post and betray it to the enemy; because when they see some
wander and others desert, it is clear that this does not arise from ignorance,
as we have said, but to the snares of Satan and lust are those exposed whom
Christ has redeemed with his blood: hence as we have said, this their treachery
is without excuse.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We saw in our last lecture that the office of pastors
is twofold, that they collect the dispersed sheep, and retain within the fold
those whom they had gathered together. For as man&#8217;s nature is inclined to
many failures, it often happens that those who have been gathered into
God&#8217;s sheepfold are dispersed hither and thither, through their own
infirmity, unless they are strengthened. For this reason constant admonitions
are necessary; and hence God asserts that those pastors will be guilty, if
though their negligence the righteous fall away. He now pursues the same
sentiment, but adds another clause &#8212; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if the righteous is admonished
the shepherd is guiltless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The whole
meaning is this, because Ezekiel had been called to the office of teaching, he
ought to be intent in recalling into the way those who have erred, and also in
retaining others. In the meanwhile we must observe, that those who seem to have
entered on the right way are daily subject to error, unless God retains them by
his servants, and urges them to go forward. Now it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">God seems in some way to play with his Prophet, when
he sends him about, and apparently changes his plan. For the duty of teaching
was previously imposed upon the holy man, but now he is commanded to go abroad,
and afterwards God orders him to shut himself up at home. Hence this variety
seems like a change of plan, when God first commands his servant to speak, and
afterwards to be silent. But it is by no means doubtful that, by this method,
the authority of the Prophet was confirmed, when God evidently governed his
tongue, whether for speech or silence. For although he was created a teacher,
yet he restrained himself till God should suggest what he was to say. Afterwards
he was ordered to be silent, and obeyed God; then when God dictated words, and
commanded him to go forth in public, he began to discharge his office. Now, if
he had begun to speak directly upon his appointment, too great levity might be
objected against him; but when he showed his alacrity, and yet remained silent
during God&#8217;s pleasure, greater weight was added to his
teaching.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we understand to what purpose
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of God was upon
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>his power is understood; for that
exposition is cold, as I have before observed, which interprets the hand of God
as the prophetic office. He perceives, then, that he was impelled by the secret
virtue of God. Lastly, the hand of God is nothing else but the agitation of the
Spirit, since the Prophet felt that he was not carried forward by human power,
or by any arbitrary impulse, tie says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of Jehovah was upon me,
and he said to me arise, and go forth to the plain, that I may speak there with
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Ezekiel could not but suppose that
he was led forth to proclaim immediately God&#8217;s commands to the people. But
in this opinion he was mistaken, because, as we shall see, he was brought forth
into the midst that he should immediately shut himself up at home. But before he
says this, he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he went
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see hove submissive he was
whenever God sent him. And this is worthy of notice, because unless God&#8217;s
calling please us, and our sense approve
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f80</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it, we fly back, or at least put it off. But the Prophet had a just excuse,
according to human judgment, for turning his back with some color of reason; for
God had often addressed him already, and as yet without fruit. But now, although
he is hitherto held in suspense, yet God does not pronounce what he wishes him
to do; yet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he goes out into the
plain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God commanded him. We are
taught by this example, even if the result of things is hidden from us, that as
soon as God issues any command, we must obey, even if our senses refuse, yet we
ought so to obey him as to follow whenever he calls, even if our doing it seems
not only in vain, but ridiculous. But God did not address him in vain when he
appeared in his glory, for the appearance of the glory of God ought to satisfy a
holy man, although all other things should fail.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saw the glory of God, as it
were, near the river Chebar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>whence we
gather, that. the vision was not fixed to any definite place. God, therefore,
appeared once above the bank of the river to his servant, and then in the plain.
As to his saying </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he fell on his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I have previously explained what
he means. It must necessarily happen that the faithful, who are impressed with a
serious fear of God, should dread his appearance. The impious, also, are
compelled to fear God, but afterwards they grow hardened, and although they are
rendered almost lifeless, the stupor which follows extinguishes all sensation.
But the fear which the faithful feel from the appearance of God is joined with
reverence. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus also Ezekiel fell
on his face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so as not to rise again
until the Spirit raised him up, as it follows afterwards.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Ezekiel confirms what I have said: whenever the
faithful are frightened at the sight of God&#8217;s glory, they cannot collect
their mind unless the Lord prop them up by his strength. But this state was
peculiar to the Prophet, because he ought to acknowledge himself, as it were,
dead when he felt the Spirit of God living and flourishing in his mind.
Therefore this tends to confirm him, because the Spirit restored him from a
state of death to life: therefore he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit
came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In fine, as the soul gives life to
the man, so the Spirit of God is a supernatural life in man. We live after the
manner of men, because<i> </i>a virtue is implanted in our soul which has
faculties of its own. For in the soul is the seat of intelligence, and the will,
and the sensations, and it diffuses its vigor through all the members. But the
life which souls breathe into bodies is only earthly, but the Spirit of God
gives life supernaturally. And this distinction must be held, because profane
men boast only in outward appearances, as they<i> </i>call it &#8212; that is,
in outward splendor, which is nothing else but a mask: and so with all their
might they celebrate free-will and our natural faculties, because they have
never tasted what that supernatural life is which is here mentioned. Ezekiel
indeed was filled with the Spirit of God after a peculiar manner, that he might
be fit to undertake the prophetic office, but this is common to the faithful for
their spiritual life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says next,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was placed upon his
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he was lying prostrate,
nor could he, as I have said, raise a finger, unless he had been raised by
divine power. Afterwards he relates the command of God, which appears to be
absurd. For why did God appoint Ezekiel a Prophet unless that he should apply
himself to the office of teaching? But now he orders him not only to rest, but
even to he concealed at home. He uses the word &#8220;concealed&#8221; as if he
had said, remain at home as a captive. If he had been a private man, he had
enjoyed a free passage out, but now since God enjoins upon him the prophetic
office, he is held captive. But all this is opposed to his mission. But first,
God wished to prove the obedience of his servant; then he wished specially to
confirm his calling more and more, for this was no common confirmation, because
although the Prophet excelled in singular virtue, yet he did not leap into the
midst, but rested at home, and became a voluntary captive, because it so pleased
God. Hence the whole people might know that the Prophet did not proceed rashly,
or by any sudden impulse, because he was often mute by the command of God.

<div><font face="Palatino">Now God explains the reason why he wishes the Prophet
to cease for a time, and to remain at home as if dumb.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
placed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>said he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ropes upon thee with which they
may bind thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The opinion of those who
take the passage metaphorically is not unsuitable, as if it had been said, the
perverseness of the people hinders Ezekiel in the discharge of his duty, just as
if he had been bound with ropes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To make this clearer, we may call to mind what Paul
says to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:11,) namely, that he was held in bondage, because his teaching
could not find access to them, nor penetrate to their souls. &#8220;Our
mouth,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is open towards you, O Corinthians! Our heart is
enlarged towards you:&#8221; that is, as far as lieth in me, I am prepared
faithfully to spend my labors upon you: but your bowels are straitened. Since
therefore men, by their own depravity, hinder the course of doctrine, by
reducing the servants of God to straits, it is quite consistent to represent the
malice of those who are not teachable to be like ropes by which faithful
teachers are bound, so that they cannot proceed freely in the course of their
duty. If any one, however, prefers taking what is here said strictly and
literally, the sentence must thus be understood, that the Israelites were not as
yet prepared for instruction, because if the Prophet shall utter God&#8217;s
commands immediately, they would be like the furious who would lay hands upon
him and bind him with ropes. This sense also is very appropriate, and hence we
may choose freely between them. But as to the general purport, God&#8217;s
intention is by no means obscure, namely, that the Prophet ought not to take it
ill, if he be for a time apparently useless without obtaining either hearers or
fit disciples. We see then that this is said for the Prophet&#8217;s comfort,
that he should not murmur or take it ill that God wishes him &#8216;to remain
shut up at home; because the fit time had not yet come, as if it had been said
&#8212; &#8220;If you hasten now, you will approach furious men who will by and
bye rush against you and bind you with ropes. Because, therefore, you see them
not yet prepared for learning, wait a while until I prepare their ears for you,
that they may attend to you; or at least, that they may be rendered the more
excuseless, I will send thee; and meanwhile, although they are as yet perverse,
yet they cannot rise violently against thee, but whether they will or not, they
shall be compelled to hear the commands which proceed from my mouth.&#8221; And
he afterwards confirms this at length, as we shall see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will fix thy tongue to thy
palate</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; or I will make thy tongue adhere
to thy palate &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so that
thou shalt not be to them a reprover, because they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What God ascribed to the
Israelites he now transfers to himself. He had said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will bind thee with
ropes:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make thy tongue cleave to
thy palate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But these two things are
easily reconciled, because in truth the Israelites rejected prophecies through
their intemperance, and God thus deprived them of this benefit, because he saw
they were unworthy of it. But this place shows that it is a sign of God&#8217;s
vengeance, when all prophecies cease, and opportunity for hearing is taken away.
For as God shines upon us by his instruction, and we have thereby a certain
pledge of his fatherly grace and favor, so also when instruction is removed, it
is just as if God hid his face, nay, even turned his back upon us. We must
consider, therefore, what is here said &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because the house of Israel was
rebellious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>hence the Prophet was dumb,
and refrained from teaching those impious ones. God therefore desists, when he
sees that he is dealing with the stupid and deaf; but. not on the first occasion
of their wearying him, because he rather contends with man&#8217;s ingratitude,
and never ceases, as we see in Jeremiah, to rise in the morning, and to keep
watch even while it is yet night;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:2;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
11:7;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
35:14;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
74:9;) he never ceases to call to himself even those who are slow and sluggish,
nay, even the utterly rebellious: but at length, when he sees that he does not
succeed by long-suffering, he takes away his instruction, as we have said. And
therefore the Church complains that it is destitute of Prophets, and places that
slaughter among the extreme signs of God&#8217;s anger: &#8220;We do not see our
signs, and Prophets do not appear among <i>us</i>.&#8221;<i> </i>In this way
they understand that they are alienated from God, and that no consolation
remains to them, when God does not give them any taste of his goodness by
Prophets. The ungodly indeed wish this, because nothing is more troublesome to
them than to hear God continually exclaiming. Hence, as far as they can, they
seek hiding-places, and think nothing better for themselves than to be torpid
amidst their vices, and to be deaf to every voice of reproach; but yet nothing
is more destructive to them, because God offers himself as a physician who cures
our diseases, while he exhorts us to wisdom. But when he is silent, he deserts
us as if abandoned to de-st, ruction, and hence I said that nothing is more
destructive than when no reproach sounds in our ears, but we are sweetly
flattered, because in this way Satan deprives us of our senses, and this is his
final poisoning, when he so soothes us with his blandishments, that all reproach
which may alarm our security altogether ceases. Now it follows:

<div><font face="Palatino">After a silence, God shows by what commands he wishes
to instruct his servant, namely, by such as would exasperate the people, as we
have formerly seen. His embassy therefore was hateful, since the Prophet begins
with this insult &#8212; &#8220;If ye wish to hear, hear; but if not, I am not
concerned.&#8221;<i> </i>Those who are sent as ambassadors are usually ordered
to try whether they can conciliate, by courteous and friendly discourse, those
with whom they have to deal. But God here follows a method completely the
contrary. For what is the meaning of these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who hears, let him hear: he
who desists, let him, desist</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>namely,
that the Israelites may understand that the Prophet was sent to them, not
because there was any hope of their becoming wise again, since they had borne
witness by experiments sufficiently numerous that they were altogether
desperate: but the Lord sends the Prophet, that he may strike and wound them
further, and at length inflict a deadly blow. Now, therefore, we see that
confirmed which the Prophet previously brought forward, that the office of
teaching was enjoined upon him, not because his labor would be useful and
fruitful with reference to the common people, but that he might inflame the
Israelites to madness, if they were unwilling to grow wise again, that he might
break them if they would not bend, and if they rejected<i> </i>him, that he
should accuse them before God, who would be their judge, and in the meanwhile
the course of Prophetic teaching would be free, however pertinaciously they
might resist it. Now we understand the intention of the Prophet. Hence also we
collect what I have lately touched upon: that God deals with the reprobate in
various ways. Sometimes he makes it doubtful whether they be curable, and
destines Prophets for them, who should exhort them to repentance. But when he
sees them in their ingratitude burying all the light, then he deprives them of
all doctrine; afterwards it shines forth again: at length other and denser
darkness succeeds:<i> </i>therefore let us hasten, as long as the doctrine of
salvation shines upon us, lest God darken all our minds and senses, and deprive
us of that singular benefit, when the image of his paternal favor is engraven on
us, as we have said. Let us go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God begins to speak more openly by means of his
servant, and not to speak only, but to signify by an outward symbol what he
wishes to be uttered by his mouth. Hence he orders the Prophet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to paint Jerusalem on a
brick.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Take<i> </i>therefore, he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, a brick, and place it in
thy sight: then paint on it a city, even
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is one command: then
<i>erect a tower against it. </i>He describes the form of ancient warfare; for
then when they wished to besiege cities, they erected mounds from which they
filled up trenches: then they moved about wooden towers, so that they might
collect the soldiers into close bands, and they had other machines which are not
now in use. For fire-arms took away that ancient art of warfare. But God here
Simply wishes the picture of a city to be besieged by Ezekiel. Then he orders
him to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set up a pan or iron
plate, like a wall of iron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This had
been a childish spectacle, unless God had commanded the Prophet to act so. And
hence we infer, that sacraments cannot be distinguished from empty shows, unless
by the word of God. The authority of God therefore is the mark of distinction,
by which sacraments excel, and have their weight and dignity, and whatever men
mingle with them is frivolous. For this reason we say that all the pomps of
which the Papal religion is full are mere trifles. Why so? because men have
thought out whatever dazzles the eyes of the simple, without any command of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if any one now objects, that the water in baptism
cannot penetrate as far as the soul, so as to purge it of inward and hidden
filth, we have this ready answer: baptism ought not to be considered in its
external aspect only, but its author must be considered. Thus the whole worship
under the law had nothing very different from the ceremonies of the Gentiles.
Thus the profane Gentiles also slew their victims, and had whatever outward
splendor could be desired: but that was entirely futile, because God had not
commanded it. On the other hand, nothing was useless among the Jews. When they
brought their victims, when the blood was sprinkled, when they performed
ablutions, God&#8217;s command was added, and afterwards a promise: and so these
ceremonies were not without their use. We must therefore hold, that sacraments
at first sight appear trifling and of no moment, but their efficacy consists in
the command and promise of God. For if any one reads what Ezekiel here relates,
he would say that it, was child&#8217;s play. He took a brick, he painted a city
on it: it was only a figment: then he had imaginary machines by which he
besieged the city: why boys do better than this: next he set up a plate of iron
like a wall: this action is not a whit more serious than the former. Thus
profane men would not only despise, but even carp at this symbol. But when God
sends his Prophet, his authority should be sufficient for us, which is a certain
test for our decision, and cannot fail, as I have said. First, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>paint a city, namely
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lay siege to
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>move towards it all warlike
instruments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: place
even</i></font><font face="Bwhebl">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrk</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><font face="Bwhebl">
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>kerim, </i>which some interpret
<i>&#8220;leaders,&#8221; </i>but they are <i>&#8220;lambs,&#8221; </i>or
<i>&#8220;rams,&#8221; </i>for the Hebrews metaphorically name those iron
machines by which walls are thrown down <i>&#8220;rams,&#8221; </i>as the Latins
do. Some indeed prefer the rendering <i>&#8220;</i>leaders,&#8221; but I do not
approve of their opinion. At length he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this shall be a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and on this clause we must dwell:
for, as I already said, the whole description may be thought useless, unless
this testimony be added: indeed the whole vision would be insipid by itself,
unless the savor arose from this seasoning, since God says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this should be a sign to the
Israelites.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When God pronounces that the Prophet should do
nothing in vain, this ought to be sufficient to lead us to acquiesce in his
word. If we then dispute according to our sense, he will show that what seems
foolish overcomes all the wisdom of the world, as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:25.) For God sometimes works as if by means of folly: that is, he
has methods of action which are extraordinary, and by no means in accordance<i>
</i>with human judgment. But that this folly of God may excel<i> </i>all the
wisdom of the world, let this sentence occur to our minds, when it is here said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let this be for a sign to the
house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For although the
Israelites could shake their heads, and put out their tongues, and treat the
Prophet with unbridled <i>insolence, </i>yet this alone prevailed sufficiently
for confounding them, that God said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this shall be for a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And we know of what event it was a
sign, because the Israelites who had been drawn into captivity thought they had
been too easy, and grieved at their obedience: then also envy crept in when they
saw the rest of the people remaining in the city. Therefore God meets them and
shows them that exile is more tolerable than to endure a siege in the city if
they were enclosed in it. Besides, there is little doubt that this prophecy was
directed against the Jews who pleased themselves, because they were yet at ease
in their rest. For this reason, therefore, God orders the Prophet to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>erect
towers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to pitch a
camp</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepare whatever belongs to the
siege of a city, </i></font><font face="Palatino">because very soon afterwards
the Chaldeans would arrive, who had not yet oppressed the city, but are just
about to besiege it, as we shall afterwards see at length.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must first consider the scope of this prophecy,
and we shall then discuss more conveniently its separate parts. It is not
doubtful that God wished to oppose the pride of the people, for they thought
themselves punished more severely than they deserved. And this is customary with
hypocrites, because while they dare not acquit themselves altogether, they yet
murmur as if God afflicted them too severely, then they willingly offer
something in compensation that they may free themselves from punishment. For
although they confess themselves guilty, yet they do not cease to turn aside,
and think if God descends to equity with them, that either they will escape, or
at least be less miserable. Such was the disposition of the ancient people, as
is well known. We now only need to repeat what we have said before: that the
Jews were more obstinate because God had spared them. Nor did they think this
only temporary, but they exulted with great freedom, as if they had settled all
their business with God. Meanwhile the exiles were constantly complaining,
first, that God had treated them so severely, and yet had in clemency pardoned
the Jews: then they thought that they had been deceived, and that if they had
prudently attended to their own affairs they could have escaped the miseries by
which they were oppressed. Now, therefore, Ezekiel is ordered to come forward
into the midst of them, and shortly to show that no other result is possible but
that the whole people should receive the reward of their wickedness. But because
simple teaching was not sufficient to stir them up, a vision is added, and to
this end the Prophet is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to lie on one side for three
hundred and ninety days, and on the other side forty
days.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Now the interpretation is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that days are taken for so many
years</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But the meaning is, that the
people through three hundred and ninety years carried on war with God, because
they had never ceased from sin. Hence the Prophet is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to take upon him the iniquity of
so many years</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>but God appointed him
days for years, then forty years are added which belong to the people of
Judah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This place is variously twisted by interpreters. I
will not refer to all their comments, for they have fatigued themselves in vain
by inventing arguments which vanish of their own accord: I will not spend the
time in refuting them, but will only endeavor to elicit the genuine sense. Some
extend the name of Israel to the whole body of the people, but this must be
rejected; for they begin the three hundred and ninety years from the first
revolt, of which mention is made in the Book of Judges,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;070202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
2:2,) and they gather together those years during which the Israelites often
fell into impiety: hence they reckon the three hundred and ninety years, and
subtract those periods in which religion and the pure worship of God flourished,
as under Gideon, under Samson for some time, and under David and Solomon. They
subtract then those years in which piety flourished among the people, and the
remainder reaches about three hundred and ninety years. But it would be absurd
to include the tribe of Judah under the name of Israel, when a comparison
between each kingdom is made. We know, indeed, that all the posterity of Abraham
were so named by their father Jacob, when, therefore, the name of Israel is put,
the twelve or thirteen tribes are comprehended without exception; but when there
is comparison, Israel signifies only the ten tribes, or that adulterous kingdom
which set up Jeroboam as king after the death of Solomon.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;111220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 12:20.) Since, then, both Israel and Judah are treated of here, it is by
no means suitable that the prophecy should speak of the whole people, and mix
the tribe of Judah with the rest. Then the event itself dispels many clouds and
takes away all room for controversy: for if we number the years from the revolt
in Rehoboam&#8217;s time, we shall find three hundred and ninety years till the
siege of Jerusalem. What then can be easier, and what room is there for
conjectures? I wonder that Jerome, since he relates nothing but mere trifles,
yet boasts of some wonderful wisdom; for he says, he did not do it for the
<i>sake </i>of boasting, and truly he has little cause for it; for if any one
will read his Commentary, he will find nothing but what is puerile.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;111228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 12:28.) But, as I have already said, since the name of Israel everywhere
signifies the ten tribes, this interpretation is best here: namely, that the
obstinacy of the ten tribes was continued through three hundred and ninety
years. For, as is sufficiently, known, Jeroboam erected two altars, that he
might turn away the people from the worship of God: for he thought himself not
sufficiently established in his kingdom, so as to retain the obedience of the
people, unless he turned them away from the house of David. Therefore he used
that artifice &#8212; thus the worship of God was corrupted among the
Israelites. Now by idolatry the Prophet here points out the other sins of the
people; for from this fountain flowed all other iniquities. After they had once
cut themselves off from God, they became forgetful of the whole law. The Prophet
therefore includes all their corruptions under this one expression, since by the
edict of their king this people had shaken off the yoke of God, for which Hosea
reproaches them.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;280511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
5:11.) We now understand the three hundred and ninety years of Israel&#8217;s
iniquity, because the people then rejected the law, and followed foreign
superstitions, which Jeroboam fabricated with no other intention than That; of
strengthening the power of his kingdom, just as earthly kings are influenced by
no other desire, although they pretend, and even magnificently boast, that they
seek God&#8217;s glory with the utmost devotion, yet their religion is only a
delusion; provided only that they retain the people in obedience and duty, any
kind of worship, and any mode of worshipping God, is the same to them. Such,
therefore, was the cunning of Jeroboam: but his posterity greatly deteriorated,
so that the worship of God could never be restored among the Israelites.
Circumcision, indeed, remained, in which they imitated what Moses had commanded
in the law, but at the same time they had two altars, and those profane ones,
instead of one only. At length they did not hesitate openly to adopt the
idolatries of the Gentiles: hence they so mixed up God with their inventions,
that what even they valued under the pretense of piety, was an abomination to
him. This is the reason why God says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the iniquity of the people
of Israel has endured for three hundred and ninety
years</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The difficulty in the second clause is greater,
because the computation does not agree exactly. After the death of Josiah we
shall only find twenty-two years to the destruction of the city. But we know
that this king, of his eminent piety, took care that God should be sincerely
worshipped; for he purged the whole land of all its defilements. Where, then,
will be those forty years? Hence it is necessary to take a part of the reign of
Manasseh, because then Jerusalem not only revolted. from the teaching of the
law, but that tyrant cruelly raged against all the Prophets, and the city was
defiled by innocent blood. Hence it will be necessary to omit the reign of
Josiah, then a part of the reign of Manasseh must be cut off, because he did not
immediately relapse into idolatry; but after he grew up, then the worship of God
and the examples of his fathers being despised, he turned aside to strange and
fictitious worship, though he did not persist in his impiety to the end of his
life. Eighteen years, then, must be taken and joined to the two-and-twenty, that
the number which the Prophet uses may be made up, unless, perhaps, any one would
rather take a part of the reign of Josiah. (2 Kings 22) For although that pious
king did his utmost to uphold the worship of God, yet we know that the people of
very wickedness strove with the goodness of God. For when the law was found no
amendment followed, for the memory of all its doctrine had grown obsolete; but
when it was placed before the people they ought to have become new. But so far
from those who had been previously alienated from God becoming wise again, they
betrayed their obstinacy more and more. Since then, the impiety of the people
had been detected, it is not surprising that the people of Judah is said to have
sinned for forty years. Certainly this latter explanation pleases me most,
because the Prophet refers to continuous years, which followed the captivity of
the ten tribes; although I do not reject the other interpretation, because it
reckons those years during which Manasseh exercised his tyranny against
God&#8217;s servants, and endeavored as much as he could to abolish his pure
worship, and to pollute it with the filth of all the nations. Now, therefore, we
understand the forty years of the iniquity of the tribe of
Judah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to those interpreters who refer the four hundred
and thirty years to the siege of the city, as if God&#8217;s vengeance was thus
satisfied, I fear it will not hold good; it seems to me not a suitable
explanation; it only signifies that it is not surprising if their enemies
besiege the city so long, since they did not cease to provoke God for as many
years as the siege continued days. The city was besieged a whole year and two or
three months. The beginning of the siege continues to the end of the half year,
but it was finished in three or four months, when Pharaoh endeavored to free the
<i>Jews, </i>who were then his allies and confederates, by bringing up his army.
Then Nebuchadnezzar went forth to meet him, and the city was relieved for a
short time. Now if we take three hundred and ninety days, we shall find a whole
year at first, that is three hundred and sixty-five years, although then there
was an intercalary month, and they had not their year defined as we now have;
but yet there will be three hundred and sixty-five days, which make a complete
year. The two months will make sixty days, so we shall have four hundred and
twenty days. Now a month and a half elapsed before the return of Nebuchadnezzar.
Then the computation will amount to four hundred and thirty years. But
interpreters are satisfied, because the siege of the city endured to a time
which answers to that prescribed to Abraham. For God entered into covenant with
Abraham four hundred and thirty years before the promulgation of the law. But I
do not see why they are so satisfied with this resemblance. Nor is this the
meaning of our Prophet. When he speaks of a siege he certainly regards
especially the destruction of the city. Therefore I do not think that the days
of the siege are here enumerated as a just punishment, but only that years are
compared with days, that they may determine how long the siege should be, and
that the end was not to be, expected until the whole people
perished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, we see as we go on that the Prophet lay on
his side three hundred and ninety days; where there is no mention of forty days,
and that part seems to be omitted. Yet this remains fixed, because Israel and
Judah had been obstinate in their wickedness; hence the city was besieged until
it was utterly taken. Now surely the punishment of Israel cannot be considered
as consisting in the overthrow of the holy city; for already the ten tribes had
migrated from their country, and did not know what was doing at Jerusalem,
except by report. Whatever happened their condition was altogether separate from
all the miseries of the people, for they were then quiet in exile. As then the
Prophet is ordered </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to bear the
iniquity of Israel for three hundred and ninety
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this ought not to be restricted to
the siege. God simply means, since so many years had elapsed during which both
Israelites and Jews had not ceased to sin, their final destruction was already
at hand. But we know that then the kingdom of Judah was extinguished, and exile
was to the ten tribes like death. On this account they had perished; nor did the
Prophet bear their iniquity as if they were then paying the penalty of their
sins. But we know that this is the customary manner of Scripture, because God
reckons sins to the third and fourth generation.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:5;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
5:9.) When, therefore, God wished the ten tribes to be dragged into exile, then
he punished them for their wickedness three hundred and ninety years. Afterwards
he bore with the city of Jerusalem for a certain time, and endured a similar
impiety in that tribe, that he should not utterly blot out the memory of the
people. But the Jews did not repent, since we also see by Isaiah comparing them
with the Israelites, that they became worse.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
18:1, 7, 8.) Micah reproves them for following the statutes of Omri;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;330616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
6:16,) whence it is not surprising if the punishment which they endure should
answer to the wickedness in which they had involved themselves. We shall see
also that the same subject is repeated by our Prophet in Ezekiel
16.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the whole then, God wished to show the people that
they had abused his forbearance too much and too long, since they did not desist
from sinning even to the four hundred and thirtieth year. The Israelites indeed
began to turn aside from the true worship of God while the Temple still remained
pure, but at length the tribe of Judah, by degenerating, became guilty of the
same impiety. Now we understand the intention of the Holy
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I pass on to the words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt lie upon thy
left side</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We must remark that this was
not in reality completed, because Ezekiel did not lie for three hundred and
ninety days upon his side, but only by a vision, that he might afterwards relate
to the people what God had made manifest. As to the opinion of those
commentators who think the ten tribes are meant by the left side, because
Samaria was situated to the left hand, I do not think it applicable. I do not
doubt that God wished to prefer the tribe of Judah to the kingdom of Israel; for
although the ten tribes excelled in the number, opulence, and strength of men,
yet God always made more, of the kingdom of Judah. For here was the seat of
David; and the ten tribes were the posterity of Abraham only after the flesh,
the promise remained to Jerusalem, and there also the lamp of God shone, as we
have said in many places. Hence the right side signifies that dignity with which
God wished always to adorn the kingdom of Judah: but the ten tribes are marked
by the left side; because, as I have said, they did not enjoy equal glory with
the kingdom of Judah, although they are more numerous, more courageous, and more
abundant in all good things. It must now be observed that the burden of bearing
their iniquity was imposed on the Prophet: not because God transferred to him
the iniquity of the people, as some here invent an allegory, and say that the
Prophet was a type of Christ, who bore on himself the iniquity of the people.
But an expiation is not here described: but we know that God uses his servants
for different purposes. So therefore the Prophet on one side is ordered to
oppose Jerusalem, as if he were the king of Babylon; hence he sustains the
character of king Nebuchadnezzar when he opposes the city of brick, of which we
spoke yesterday. Now he sustains other characters, as of the ten tribes and the
kingdom of Judah, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when he lies
upon his left side three hundred and ninety days, and on his right side forty
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For this reason also it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have appointed to thee the
years of this iniquity, according to then number, of the
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc</i>; that is, when I order thee to
lie on thy right side so many days, I represent to thee years. For it would have
been absurd to demand of the Prophet to lie upon one side four centuries, so God
accommodates himself in these figures to our standard; and it is contrary to
nature that a man should lie for four centuries, and because that is absurd, God
changes years into days; and this is the reason why days are said to be
substituted for years. Afterwards it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when thou shalt have fulfilled
those years, then thou shalt afterwards lie upon thy right side, and shalt bear
the iniquity of the house of Judah forty
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God shows the tribe of Judah,
that when it ought to be frightened by the punishment of the kingdom of Israel,
it still persisted in its wickedness hence the Jews could not possibly escape
the punishment of the Israelites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and towards the siege of
Jerusalem thou shalt set or establish thy
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Either meaning may be received;
either directing and ordering, or establishing and strengthening; although the
word directing or ordering pleases me better in this place. He had said, indeed,
before, thou shalt direct thy face until Jerusalem shall be besieged; but in my
opinion God simply here orders his Prophet to be intent on the overthrow of the
city. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thine arm shall be made
bare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, for expedition: for we
know that orientals use flowing tunics and long robes, so that they cannot
execute any business without putting off their garments. Hence the Prophet is
here ordered </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to make bare his
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>just as if any one should take his
coat half off, and throw it over the other side, that he might have one arm
free. Such was the dress of the Prophet, but by a vision, as I have said.
Afterwards it is added,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that
thou, shalt prophesy against it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Again
God repeats what we saw yesterday: for nothing had been colder than that the
Prophet should make bare his arm, and direct his face against towards the siege
of a painted city. Had the picture been only an empty one, the spectacle might
be justly condemned; but God adds the meaning to the figures, that the prophecy
may have more force: as if he had said, I see that these signs are not of
themselves of much moment, and you may object to me, why do you concern yourself
with these trifles? But whatever you do shall be a certain seal of prophecy. Now
we see why God joins the word &#8220;prophecy.&#8221; Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I will place upon thee
ropes, so that thou canst not turn from, side to side, until thou hast completed
the days of thy siege</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God here
signifies that his decree concerning the siege of Jerusalem was inviolable: for
as he held his servant so bound down, by this the firmness of his decree was
designated, because the Jews thought that they could extricate themselves by
their deceits. For we know that they always flattered themselves when the
Prophets threatened them. Therefore God signifies that the siege of the city was
certain until it was taken; because the Prophet should be bound with cords, and
should not move himself, nor turn from one side to the other. And hence we
understand, from the figure here used, that the Jews should suffer the same
punishments as the ten tribes. Just as if God should say that the time
determined for the destruction of the kingdom of Israel had come, and that the
same end would happen to the Jews; for ill whatever direction they might escape,
yet the same execution of God&#8217;s judgment would arrive, as if the matter
had been already determined. Now it follows:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is by no means doubtful, that this verse applies
to the siege, because God signifies that the city would then suffer famine, but
a little afterwards he adds another vision, from which we gather, that the
subject is not only the siege of Jerusalem, but the general vengeance of God
against all the tribes, which had fallen on the Jews through their alliance with
them, and which ended at length in the siege. But here God shows the future
condition of the city Jerusalem. For this various kind of bread is a sign of
want, for we make bread of wheat, and if any region is barren there barley is
eaten or&#8217; vetches, and if we have but a moderate supply, still wheaten
bread is used, but when lentils and beans, and millet and spelt are used, a
severer penury is portrayed. In the time of Jerome the name of spelt was in use
for &#8220;zea,&#8221; since he says, it was &#8220;gentile&#8221; among the
Italians. I know not how it agrees with what Jerome calls &#8220;vetches;&#8221;
in his Commentaries he says it is &#8220;zea,&#8221; and uses that name for
spelt, which was then wheat: whatever it is, when leguminous plants are mixed
with wheat, and when barley and spelt are used, it shows a deficiency in
ordinary food. It is just as if the Prophet Ezekiel were to denounce against the
Jews a deficiency in the harvest which they were then reaping while they were
free, for this vision was offered to the Prophet before the city was besieged.
Hence he threatened want and famine at a time when they were still eating bread
made of pure wheat. For he orders
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all these things to be put in one
vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we gather, that this
mixture would be by no means acceptable to delicate palates: for we know that
beans and lentils are grosser than wheat, and cannot be kneaded into a dough of
the right kind, since the wheat and pulse are dissimilar. For this reason, then,
God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>places them in one
vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then it is added &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt make bread for thee

days here numbered are the three hundred and ninety: there is no mention of the
forty days, but it may be a part put for the whole. Now it

Prophet to live sparingly. When the city was besieged, bread was distributed in
pieces to each person. God then here says, that the Jews should be almost
famished during the siege, so that they should not have bread except by fixed
weight, and that a small one. What follows is more miserable, namely, the want
of water; for this is the last stage of calamity when thirst oppresses us. it
seems hard, indeed, to want wine, but when water is deficient, this, as I have
said, is the last stage of famine, and this the Prophet denounces against the

<div><font face="Palatino">This vision properly belongs to the ten tribes, and,
for this reason, I have said that God&#8217;s vengeance is not to be considered
as to the siege of the city alone, but to be extended longer. After the Prophet
had spoken of the siege of Jerusalem, he adds, that their reward was prepared
for the children of Israel, because a just God was the avenger of each people.
As, therefore, he punished the remnant who as yet remained at Jerusalem, so he
avenged the wickedness of the ten tribes in exile at Babylon. For this reason
the Prophet is ordered to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cook a
cake with dung</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>that is, he is commanded
to take human dung instead of fuel: nor does he simply say dung, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the dung of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By and bye the application follows.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus the children of Israel shall
eat their polluted bread among the Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Now, therefore, we see that the Jews are at length drawn to judgment,
because they had not been so touched with the slaughter of their brethren as to
repent, but, in the meantime, the wrath of God was conspicuous against the ten
tribes, because among the Gentiles those miserable exiles were compelled to eat
their bread polluted. We know that cakes are made of the finest flour, for the
purer the flour the more delicate is the bread, but the Prophet is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to make cakes of
barley</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to cook them in
dung</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for that uncleanness was forbidden
by the law.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;030503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
5:3;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;030721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
7:21.) Therefore God signifies, that the Israelites were so rejected that they
differed in nothing from polluted nations; for the Lord had separated them as we
know from the rest of the world: but from the time of their mingling themselves
with the filth of the impious, at length, after long forbearance, they were
altogether rejected as it is here said. For under this figure a universal
pollution is signified, as if he had said, nothing is any longer holy or sacred
in Israel, because they are mixed up with the pollutions of all nations:
finally, the impure bread embraces within itself all kinds of impiety. Now when
he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it means, that they would be
such inhabitants of the lands among which they were driven, that they should be
not only exiles but banished from the land of Canaan, which was their
inheritance. In fine, a disinheriting is here marked, when the Jews are said to
be driven about hither and thither, so as not to, dwell in the promised land. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here inserts the answer which he received
to his request that God would relax his severe command: for it was abominable to
eat flesh cooked with human dung, not only on account of the stench, but because
religion forbade it: though the Prophet did not regard the taste of his palate,
but objects that it was not lawful for him, and relates how anxiously he had
abstained during his whole life from all polluted food. For if he had formerly
dared to feed promiscuously on all sorts of food, he could not pray against it
as he now does, that he should not be compelled<i> </i>to eat polluted bread:

commandments of the law. (Leviticus 9.) For because a carcass is mixed with
blood, God forbade them to touch the flesh of an animal which died by itself,
because it had not been strangled, then if a wild beast should tear a sheep or
an ox, that cruelty ought to be detestable to men. Since, therefore, both a
carcass and torn and lacerated flesh are unclean food, the Prophet here says,
that from his childhood even to that time he had kept the commands of God with
his utmost endeavors: hence he obtains, as I have said, some mitigation. Yet he
is compelled to eat his flesh cooked with the dung of oxen. This was done by
vision, as I said yesterday: but meanwhile God did not change what he had
determined concerning the people: viz.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they should eat their bread
polluted among the Gentiles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For a cake
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cooked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the dung of oxen was unclean according to the Law. Hence God shows his
own <i>decree </i>was fixed that the Israelites should be mingled among the
Gentiles, so that they should contract pollution from their filth. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">God returns again to the citizens of Jerusalem, and
announces that they should be so destroyed by famine, that they should be
reduced to the last extremity, and all but consumed by want. But he places here
two forms of punishment: he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he should break the staff of
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>then, that their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abundance of bread should be
small</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because they would be compelled
to eat their morsels </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by weight
and fear, and to drink water by measure and
astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I said they were different forms,
because even if bread was sufficient, God often breaks its staff, as he calls
it. And this clearly appears from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;032626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:26, whence our Prophet has adopted this expression. For here Moses explains
what it is to break the staff of bread; because, he says, ten women shall cook
their bread in one dish, and then they must <i>bona fide </i>restore the
quantity of meal given them; for the bread shall be weighed, and thou shalt eat
and not be satisfied. There God had said, I will break the staff of bread: but a
clearer explanation follows &#8212; namely, although wheat for cooking the bread
should be sufficient, and the women should mutually observe each other that no
theft should take place, but should return in weight what had been given out to
them, yet its nourishment should be deficient. We see then that God breaks the
staff of bread, when a sufficiently plentiful supply exists, but those who eat
are not satisfied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That this may appear more clearly, we muse assume the
principle that men do not live by bread only, but by every word which proceedeth
out of the mouth of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
8:3,) for here God signifies that we are not nourished by virtue of the bread,
properly speaking: for how can bread be life-giving when it wants both sense and
vigor? We see then that there is no force in bread to nourish us which excludes
the hidden grace of God, for we live by the word of God. The subject here is not
the word of doctrine nor yet spiritual life; but Moses understands that we are
sustained not by bread and wine and other food, or by any kind of drink, but by
the secret virtue Of God whilst he inspires the bread with rigor for our
nourishment. Bread then is our nourishment, but not by any peculiar or intrinsic
virtue: this it has from another source, namely, the favor and ordination of
God. As, therefore, a small portion of bread is sufficient; for us, so if any
one gorge himself he will cry out sooner than be satisfied, unless God inspires
the virtue. And for this reason Christ uses that passage against Satan: Man
lives not by bread alone,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
4:4;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
4:4,) because he shows that the life of man was propped up by the secret virtue
of God, and that God, whenever it pleases him, does not need these foreign
assistances. God then can sustain us by himself: sometimes he uses bread, but
only as an adventitious instrument; in the meantime he derogates nothing from
his own virtue: hence a staff is taken metaphorically for a prop. For as old men
already totter on their legs, and all their limbs being broken down by weakness,
support themselves with a staff, so also bread is said to have a staff, because
we are propped up by the nourishment. Our strength also becomes deficient, and
hence he who takes nourishment is said to refresh himself with food. God,
therefore, breaks the staff of bread when he renders men famished, even when
they have a sufficient abundance of bread. Neither are <i>they </i>satisfied,
how much soever they may gorge themselves, because the food loads instead of
refreshes them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the first punishment with which God threatens
the Jews. Another also is added, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they shall be destitute of
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. We </i>see then that there is a
double mode by which God punishes us by hunger. For although bread is
sufficient, yet he breaks and destroys its staff, so that it cannot prop us up
nor recall our lost vigor. At length he takes away our bread, because he either
strikes our fruits with blight or hail, or makes us suffer under other
calamities. Hence barrenness brings want, so that God will affect us with hunger
both ways: for he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold! I
will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and then he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
eat their bread by weight and in fear, they shall drink their water by measure
and in astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because in truth
they shall be reduced to such straits that they shall <i>scarcely </i>dare to
touch their bread, because while they look forward to the morrow they shall fear
and be astonished. And he confirms this opinion in the next verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they shall be destitute of
bread and water, and shall be astonished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>for this explanation agrees better; therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a man and his brother shall be
astonished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, they shall look
mutually on each other as if astonished. Thus those who are without wisdom and
discern nothing but despair are accustomed to act: at length
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall pine away in their
iniquity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again God repeats that the
Jews could not complain when he so grievously afflicts them, because they shall
receive the reward of their own iniquity. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">By another vision God confirms what he had lately
taught concerning the siege of Jerusalem. For he orders the Prophet to shave the
hairs off his head and his beard, then to distribute them into three parts, and
to weigh them in a balance. He mentions a just balance, that equity may be
preserved, and that one portion may not surpass another. There is no doubt that
by the hairs he understands the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as by the head he
understands the seat itself of their dwelling-place. Then the application will
follow; but this I shall pass by today, because I cannot proceed farther. It is
sufficient to hold briefly, that men are here designated by hairs, for hair can
scarcely be counted, indeed that of the beard is countless; such was the
multitude at Jerusalem, for we know that the city was very populous. We know,
again, that it took occasion for pride from this; when they saw that they were
strong in the multitude of their people, they thought themselves equal, if not
superior, to all enemies, and hence their foolish confidence, which destroyed
them. God then commanded the Prophet to shave off , all the hairs of his head
and of his beard. Thus he taught that not even one man should escape the
slaughter, because he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make
the sword pass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or pass it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>over thy head, then over thy
chin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that nothing may remain. We
see, then, how far the passing of the razor is to go &#8212; until no hair
remains entire on either the head or beard. Whence it follows, that God will
take vengeance on the whole nation, so that not one of them shall survive. As to
his ordering </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>three parts to be
weighed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and a proportion to be kept
between them, in this way he signifies what we have often seen in Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:2) &#8212; Whosoever shall have escaped the sword shall perish by famine, and
whosoever shall escape the famine shall perish by some other means. But here God
explains at length the manner in which he was about to destroy all the Jews,
although they were distributed into various ranks. For their condition might
seem different when some had been put to flight, and others had betaken
themselves to Egypt. But in this variety God shows that it detracts nothing from
his power or intention of destroying them to a man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us come to the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make a razor pass over thy head
and over, thy beard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then <i>take
scales</i>.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynzam</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
maznim, </i>is properly called a balance on account of its two ears.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
balance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>scales for weighing,
</i>and divide </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
hair.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What this division means I have
already explained, because all the Jews were not consumed by the same
punishment,, and therefore those who had escaped one kind of destruction boasted
that they were safe. Hence they were enraged against God. But this foolish
confidence is taken away, when the Prophet is ordered to divide the hair
extracted from his head and beard,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Divide
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says; afterwards he adds, <i>a
third part. </i>As to God&#8217;s distributing the people into three parts, it
is not done without the best reason for it; for a part was consumed by famine
and distress before the city was taken. But because God marks all miseries <i>by
fire, </i>therefore he orders a third part to be cast into the fire, and
consumed there. Now because there were two parts remaining, every one promised
himself life; for he who escapes present death thinks himself free from all
danger, and hence confidence is increased; for we too often think ourselves safe
when we have overcome one kind of death. For this reason, therefore, it is
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after thou hast burnt a
third part in the fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take a third part and strike it
with the sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Besides, he orders a
third part to be burnt in the midst of the city. Ezekiel was then in Chaldea,
and not near the city; but we said that all this took place by a prophetic
vision. What is here said answers to the wrath of God, because before the siege
of the city, a third part was consumed by pestilence, and famine, and distress,
and other evils and slaughters; and all these miseries are here denoted <i>by
fire.</i> For after the city had been taken, God orders a third part to be
struck with the sword. We know this to have been fulfilled when the king with
all his company was seized, as he was flying over the plain of Jericho, (2 Kings
25) when meeting with the hostile army; because very many were killed there, the
king himself was carried off, his sons murdered in his sight, while his eyes
were put out, and he was dragged to Babylon bound in chains. Hence this is the
third part, which </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he commanded
the Prophet to strike with the sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because that slaughter represented the slaughter of the
city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he should take a third part
and cast it to the wind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>then follows
the threat, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will unsheathe my
sword after them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here it is spoken as
well of the fugitives who had gone into various countries, as of the poor, who
being dispersed after the slaughter of the city, protracted their life but a
short time. For we know that some lay hid in the land of Moab, others in that of
Ammon, more in Egypt, and that others fled to various hiding-places. This
dispersion was as if any one should cast the shorn-off hairs to the wind. But
God pronounces that their flight and dispersion would not profit them, because
he will draw his sword against them and follow them up to the very last. We see
therefore, although at first sight the citizens of Jerusalem differ, as if they
were divided into three classes, yet the wrath of God hangs over all, and
destroys the whole multitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now added:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt take then a small
number, and bind them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(that is, that
number, but the number is changed,) viz.,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those hairs of which the number
is small in the skirts of thy clothing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>It either takes away the confidence which might spring up from a temporary
escape, or else it signifies that very few should be safe in the midst of the
destruction of the whole people, which came to pass wonderfully. If that is
received, the correction is added, that God would give some hope of favor
because the people was consumed, yet so that the covenant of God might remain.
Hence it was .necessary that some relics should be preserved, and they had been
reduced like Sodom, unless God had kept for himself a small seed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:29.) Therefore in this sense the Prophet is ordered to bind and to hide in the
skirts of his garment, some part of the hair. Moreover, that part is understood
only in the third order, because those who had escaped thought that they had
obtained safety by flight, especially when they collected themselves in troops.
Afterwards it follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt
then take from these, and throw it into the midst of the fire, and burn it in
the fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Out of these few hairs God
wishes another part to be burnt and consumed; by which words he signifies, even
where only a small portion remains, yet it must be consumed in like manner, or
at least that many out of these few will be rejected. And indeed those who
seemed to have happily escaped and to have survived safely, were soon after cut
off by various slaughters, or pined away by degrees as if they had perished by a
slow contagion. But since it pleased him to remember his promise, we gather that
a few of the people survived through God&#8217;s wonderful mercy: for because he
was mindful of his covenant, he wished some part to be preserved, and therefore
that correction was interposed, that the Prophet should bind under his skirts a
small number. Yet from that remnant, God again snatched away another part, and
cast it into the fire. If the filth of the remainder was such, that it was
necessary to purge it, and cast part of it into the fire, what must be thought
of the whole people, that is, of the dregs themselves? For the portion which the
Prophet bound in his skirts was clearly the flower of the people: if there was
any integrity, it ought to be seen there.</font><br></div>
<div><a name="wakker"></a><font face="Palatino">We just saw that there were many
reprobate in that small number. Hence, therefore, it is easily gathered how
desperate was the impiety of the whole people.
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>After this, he </i>says, <i>take: </i>this
adverb is used that those who survived after the slaughter of the city should
not think that all their punishments were over: <i>after this, </i>says he, that
is, when they shall fancy all their difficulties over,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt take from that part
which thou hast preserved, and shalt cast it into the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. Thence, </i>he says,
a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> fire shall go forth through the
whole house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He signifies by
these words, as we have seen before, that the vision was not illusory, just as
many fictitious things are represented in a theater. Hence God says, what he
shows by vision to his servant would happen, as the event itself at length
proved. But he goes further<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the whole house of
Israel shall burn in this burning,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>because indeed the last destruction of the city brought despair to the
miserable, exiles, who, while the city was standing, promised themselves a
return. But when they saw such utter destruction of the city, they were consumed
just as if fire from Judea had crept even to themselves. In the meantime the
remnant are always excepted whom the Lord wonderfully preserved, although he was
in a vision destroying the whole people. We now see the tendency of this vision.
I will not proceed further, because I should be compelled to desist, and so the
doctrine would be abrupt. It is sufficient therefore to hold, although the
people was divided into many parts so that the condition of each was distinct,
yet that all should perish, since God so determined. Hence the confidence of
those who thought they would be safe at Jerusalem was broken: then the ten
tribes, which were captives, ought also to acknowledge that the last vengeance
of God was not <i>complete, </i>until the city itself, the seat of government
and the priesthood was destroyed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now God shows the reason why he determined to act so
severely and harshly towards that holy city which he had selected as the royal
residence. For the greater the benefits with which he had adorned the city, by
so much the baser and grosser was their ingratitude. God recounts, therefore,
his benefits towards Jerusalem, and that for the sake of reproving it. For if
the Jews had embraced the blessing of God, doubtless he would have enriched them
more and more with his gifts: but when he saw that they rejected his favors, he
was the more angry with their indignity. For contempt of God&#8217;s benefits is
a kind of profanation and sacrilege. Now, therefore, we understand the intention
of the Holy Spirit when he says, that Jerusalem was placed as it were on a lofty
platform, that its dignity might be conspicuous on all sides. This is not said
in praise of Jerusalem, but rather to its greatest disgrace, because whatever
the Lord had conferred upon it ought to be taken into account, since they had so
unworthily corrupted themselves and had polluted God&#8217;s glory as it were on
purpose. As to its being said, <i>that Jerusalem was in the midst of the
nations,</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
74:12,) I do not take this so precisely as Jerome and most others. For they
fancy that Jerusalem was the center of the earth, and he twists other places
also into this sense: where God is said to have worked salvation to the midst of
the earth, he explains it the very middle, as they say. But that is in my
judgment puerile, because the Prophet simply means that Jerusalem was placed in
the most celebrated part of the world: it had on all sides the most noble
nations and very rich, as is well known, and was not far distant from the
Mediterranean Sea: on one side it was opposite to Asia Minor: then it had Egypt
for a neighbor, and Babylon on the north. This is the genuine sense of the
Prophet, that Jerusalem was endued with remarkable nobility among other nations,
as if God had placed it in the highest rank. There is no city which has not
nations and lands round it, but God here names <i>lands and nations par
excellence, </i>not any whatsoever, but those only which excelled in
fruitfulness, in opulence, and all advantages. And the demonstrative pronoun is
emphatic when he says, This </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for he extols the city with
magnificent praises, that its ingratitude may appear the greater &#8212; hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was placed in the midst of the
nations and of countries round about it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>because it was surrounded by many opulent regions, and there the grace of
God was chiefly displayed, as if it were the most beautiful part of a theater,
which attracted all eyes towards it, and moved all minds to
admiration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My judgments are
changed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>concerning the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mereh</i>, I said that it signifies sometimes to change, but oftener to
transgress or to reject, and there the sense suits very well, because the Jews
were rebellious against the judgments of God even to impiety. But he enlarges
upon their wickedness when he says, my
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>statutes have been
despised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>since they so addicted
themselves to impiety. For if there had been any pretext of virtue, their fault
might have been extenuated, but when they cast themselves into gross impiety,
and thus despise God&#8217;s commandments, this is inexcusable. Let us learn
from this passage, that unless we use God&#8217;s blessings with purity the
charge of ingratitude will always lie against us: for whatever God bestows upon
us, he sanctifies as well to our salvation as to the glory of his name. We are
then sacrilegious when we corrupt those things which were destined for his
glory; then are we utterly perverse when we convert to our destruction what God
has appointed for our salvation. Now we must consider the ingratitude of
Jerusalem as flagrant, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because
they rejected the commandments of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>When therefore God deposits among us the treasure of celestial doctrine, we
must diligently take care that we do not turn aside to impiety, because there is
no excuse for error when once we have been taught what is right, and that from
the mouth of God himself. Then he declares the same sentiment in other words,
and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beyond all nations and
all lands which were round about</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by
which sentence he signifies that the Jews; were worse than all the rest, because
knowingly and willingly they had shaken off God&#8217;s yoke. Other nations had
not conducted themselves better, for we know that the worship of God was then
everywhere vitiated: but the impiety of the elect people was fouler, for they
turned light into darkness, while the Gentiles wandered in darkness for they
were blind, but the conduct of this people was different whom God had familiarly
instructed. Since therefore the teaching of the law was conspicuous among the
Jews, the Prophet deservedly says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they were impious beyond all
nations and countries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then he explains
how they had either changed the judgment of God, or were themselves rebellious,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they had
despised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he, my
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgments, and had not walked in
my statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>First, he says, they had
not fallen through ignorance but through pride and contempt; for when the will
of God is made known to us, there is no place for ignorance. <i>We </i>do not
sin lightly therefore, but our minds are necessarily infected with pride and
contempt of God. Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they did not walk in his
precepts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by which words he signifies
that the contempt just mentioned appeared openly, because in truth the fruit
showed itself in their whole life. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is variously expounded on account of the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;knmh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
hemenekem: </i>for some read it jointly in one context, as if through being
multiplied they did not worship God; as if he meant that they were luxurious
through their opulence, as horses are restive through too much food and fatness.
That passage of Moses has been marked: Israel, when highly fed, kicked;
therefore they think that this place is like it, and so they combine it
together: because thou hast been multiplied beyond. all Gentiles which were
around thee, thou hast despised my judgments, for thou hast become blind and
drunken by prosperity.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:15.) But I do not approve of this sense, for it is clearly too forced. Others
derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hemeh, </i>which signifies to be agitated or disturbed, and elicit this
sense, because <i>ye </i>are tumultuous beyond all nations &#8212; -that is,
because your lasciviousness and <i>licentiousness </i>surpass that of all
people, whilst your eagerness has drawn you on as it were without a bridle. But
I fear that explanation is far-fetched, and so I take it simply for to be
multiplied, or multiplication; for <i>machor </i>may be either a noun or a verb,
but in the same sense. At the same time, I do not refer this to the number and
multitude of the people, nor even to the abundance of goods, as the majority do;
for they say that the number of persons was multiplied, which does not suit the
sense; if it be referred to wealth, it is indeed true that God had acted
liberally towards that city, but I take it actively, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have multiplied beyond all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>and Jerome, in my opinion, has
not rendered it badly by translating, <i>&#8220;because </i>ye have surpassed
the nations,&#8221; yet he has departed from the proper sense of the word: so it
will be better to retain the verb &#8220;multiply&#8221; or the noun
&#8220;multiplication,&#8221;<i> </i>yet actively, because they had wantoned
intemperately in their superstitions, so that they surpassed all nations in evil
doing. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account then of your
multiplying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or on account of your
multiplication beyond all nations, that is, because ye were not content with
moderate impiety, but heaped together all kinds of wickedness, so that your
impiety has arrived at the highest pitch whence a curse follows it: but before
he comes to that he confirms what he had said before, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they had not walked in
his statutes, and had not kept his
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This, therefore, is the
meaning of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to
multiply</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because when the law was
delivered to them they despised it, and imitated the wickedness of the nations
and the countries around them. These sentences then agree, because beyond all
the nations they had been rebellious in impiety against God, and then because
they had multiplied beyond all nations and countries. Again the reason is to be
observed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they did not
walk in God&#8217;s statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the
Gentiles held no course, hence it is not surprising that they wandered in their
own oblique direction. But a way had been shown to the Jews: the language of
Moses was not in vain.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:19.) I call heaven and earth to witness that I have set before you life and
death: choose ye therefore life. Since then God had thus laid down the doctrine
of salvation for the Jews, he was the more indignant at their insolence and
baseness in not walking according to his statutes. Life then had been set before
them, as Moses says; it remained for them to walk therein, which the Gentiles
could not do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and according to the judgments of
the Gentiles which are round about you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here the Prophet seems to blame what otherwise and in many places is
praised. For the Jews ought to be separate from the Gentiles, so that they might
worship God in purity, and the Prophets often expostulate with them because they
followed the judgments or statutes of the Gentiles. On these words I have said
nothing, because they occur often, and it has been already shown in many places
why God calls his judgments laws. Some distinguish between judgments and
statutes, because judgments belong to mortals, and statutes to ceremonies. But
this distinction is not everywhere observed. But God, in very many places,
commends the precepts of his law, since he shows that nothing necessary to a
complete system of teaching was omitted. But. this name is sometimes transferred
to perverse rites and vicious superstitions, so that to walk in the judgments of
the Gentiles, is to corrupt oneself with their perverse morals. As I have said
already, the Jews were often condemned by the Prophets because they gave
themselves up to the corruptions of the Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, therefore, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they had not done according
to the judgments of the Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But he
understands that in this particular, also, they had surpassed the madness of the
Gentiles, because they had not embraced the law of God so as to remain
constantly in obedience to it. For we saw in the second chapter of Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:10, 11,) that the Gentiles were obstinate in their madness. Although that was
not praiseworthy, yet God deservedly blames his people because they held him in
less honor than the Gentiles did their idols. For we know how obstinately the
nations were fixed in their superstitions, for they did not change their
religion except by some violent impulse, just as if heaven and earth were shaken
together. Since, therefore, the religion of each was firm and fixed, God accuses
the Jews of trifling deservedly, because they inclined towards the errors and
madness of the heathen. This, therefore, is Ezekiel&#8217;s meaning when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Jews had not done
according to the statutes of the Gentiles: </i></font><font face="Palatino">as
if he had said, they should have looked at the Gentiles, and as they saw them
obstinately worshipping idols, so they should have persisted in my law and in
pure worship. But while the obstinacy of the Gentiles was so great that they
could not be torn away from their own superstition, my people, says he, have
perfidiously declined from me and my law by rash impulse, and without necessity
for it. Now, therefore, we perceive why the Prophet adds this to their crimes,
that the people had not walked after the judgments or manners of the Gentiles.
Hence they might have perceived, that what men had once embraced they ought not
lightly to have thrown away, because when we are suddenly and easily turned
aside in the matter of the worship of God, it is certain that we have never put
forth living roots. Since, then, the Gentiles instructed the Jews in their duty,
their crime became more detestable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the threat, that God was prepared to take
vengeance. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I, even, I, am
against you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gam, &#8220;even,&#8221; </i>is used as we in French say, <i>yea, even: I,
</i>even I. We now see that the repetition is emphatic, as if God asserted a
horrible destruction to be hanging over the Jews. For he wishes to inspire them
with fear, since he assures them that he will prove an avenger. Though I do not
receive Jerome&#8217;s comment, for he says, that angels and other ministers of
God&#8217;s wrath are excluded, because God determined to destroy the Jews by
himself. This we know to be false, for he made use of the Assyrians and
Chaldeans. Since then those people were his scourges, it follows, that angels
and men are not excluded when God pronounces himself an avenger. But he
increases the weight of the punishment when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I, even I, am he with whom thou
shalt have to do</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will execute
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which word jurisdiction,
as they call it, is intended. What Jerome and those interpreters who follow him
affirm is not correct, that by this name God&#8217;s justice is asserted, as if
he meant, that he would not be cruel in exacting punishment, nor yet unjust nor
too rigid. For to execute judgment means merely to exercise jurisdiction, and an
earthly judge is said to exercise justice when he sits on his tribunal, even if
he perverts justice and equity. This, indeed, cannot be the case with God,
although the word allows of it. Besides, there is a suitable antithesis between
the doctrinal judgments and the actual ones; God complained that the Jews did
not execute his judgments: now he threatens that he himself would execute them,
because he will vindicate his law by punishments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he will execute judgments in
the midst of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he will
ascend a tribunal and compel the wicked to plead their cause, and to render an
account of their life. God, therefore, then executed his judgments when he
manifested his vengeance by means of the Chaldeans, and so famine was a part of
his punishment, as well as the sword and the pestilence. For while he delays, he
seems to have ceased from his duty, and then the impious indulge themselves as
if he had forgotten to execute judgment. Therefore, in opposition to this, he
denounces </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would execute
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>as if he had said, I will
appear as judge although you think me asleep. For he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will execute judgments in the
midst of Jerusalem, before the eyes of the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which assertion he means,
that their punishments would be remarkable, and such as might be easily
considered by all the nations: for we know that the Gentiles were then blind,
for they thought that good and evil happened by chance. But God affirms, that
his judgments will be so manifest that the blind will be, as it were,
eye-witnesses. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now God subjoins, that their punishment should be so
severe that no similar example could be found in the world &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will do what I have not done,
nor intended to do,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, I will
avenge your contempt of my law in a striking and unexpected manner; for God
sometimes so chastises men as not to exceed the ordinary method. But because
punishments seem vile and contemptible when they are so common, God is compelled
to surpass the ordinary measure, and to punish the wicked signally and
portentously, as he says by Moses.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052846&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:46.) When therefore he now says, <i>that he would do what he had not done
before, and what he would not do again, </i>he signifies a horrible vengeance,
which has no similar example. It means nothing else than what, we have quoted
from Moses, that the vengeance would be signal and portentous. Interpreters take
this metaphorically, but this view cannot be admitted, because in their opinion
no history has recorded its fulfillment; hence they fly to allegory and
metaphor. But first of all, we know what Josephus says, that mothers were so
ravenous that they slew their children and fed upon them, although here a
previous siege is referred to, in which God signifies that he would cause
fathers to devour their children: I confess it; but even if we receive what they
wish, it was not done then; hence Jeremiah is mistaken when he says, that
miserable women cooked their children for food.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;250410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:10.) Surely this is a sufficient witness; for to say that we never find that
this actually happened is to reject the testimony of Jeremiah. Besides, God had
threatened that very thing by Moses; nor can the passage be eluded, because
there is weight in the words &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Men delicate among you, and those
accustomed to luxuries,&#8221; says he, &#8220;shall<i> </i>eat their own
children; a man shall envy the wife of his bosom, so that he shall not suffer
her to enjoy that nefarious food with him. Then by stealth shall he consume and
devour the flesh of his son, so that he shall distribute no part of it to
another.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052854&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
28:54, 55.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Moses uses this language he certainly does not
mean that there shall be intestine dissensions, so that disciples shall rise up
against their masters, and masters oppress their disciples, as Jerome fancies.
But it is necessary to take the words as they sound, namely, that God would not
be content with common and customary punishments when the Jews had arrived at
the very last pitch of impiety and wickedness, since he blames them so severely.
Hence Ezekiel now threatens this; nor is it surprising that the Prophets took
such forms of expression from Moses, since they used the language of Moses
rather than a new one, that the people might not despise their prophesyings.
Now, therefore, we must decide, that the Prophet uses these threatenings against
the Jews literally. But if any one now object that what God says will not happen
does often happen, a solution must be sought for. For we said that when the Jews
were besieged by Titus, such a ravenousness attacked certain women, that they
fed by stealth on their own children. But God pronounces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he never would do this
again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I reply that this kind of
vengeance is not to be restricted to one day, so that God should not often
punish the Jews in a similar manner. But we do not read that this was done,
except by the Jews, for although this cruelty is related in tragedies &#8212;
that children were used as food by their parents, yet this barbarity nowhere
existed, that a father knowingly and willingly ate his own son; hence this was
peculiar to the Jews. And that God had once executed this vengeance on them by
means of the Chaldeans, is no obstacle to his again inflicting the same
punishment, when he wished to take vengeance on the extreme rebellion of the
people. For although in Ezekiel&#8217;s time all things were very corrupt, yet
we know that when the Son of God was rejected, the Jews cut off from themselves
all hope of restoration to the mercy of God. It is not surprising, then, if ,
again he had suffered sons to be devoured by their fathers, as he now threatens
that fathers should be so rabid as not even to spare their own
bowels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I know not why Jerome invented this difference, which
is altogether futile. For he says, that when a thing is honorable and becoming
it should be ascribed to God, but when the thing itself is base, God averts the
infamy from himself. For when this wonder is treated of here, God does not say I
will cause the people to eat their sons, but he says, fathers shall eat their
sons, and sons their fathers. But there is nothing solid in this comment,
because the cruelty which the Chaldeans exercised towards the Jews certainly was
not either honorable or becoming, and yet God ascribes to himself whatever the
Chaldeans did. Again, what was baser than the incest of Absalom, in debauching
his father&#8217;s wives? and even that was not sufficient, but he wished the
whole people, at the sound of a trumpet, to be witnesses of his crime; and yet
what does God say? &#8220;I<i> </i>will do this before the sun,&#8221; says he.

Samuel 16:21, 22.) We see, then, that this man was not familiar with the
Scriptures, and yet that he offered his comments too hastily. There was, indeed,
no true religion in the man, and it is not without cause that I admonish you;
for there is danger lest many be deceived, if they were not admonished that his
genius was full of ostentation and arrogance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fathers shall eat their sons in

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;250410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:10.) For he says that women are tender-hearted, he does not say mothers
merely, but that they were humane beyond others; but we know that maternal
affection is more tender. But when mothers and those tender ones devour their
children, that was the final portent. Now he adds,

such dispersion, that no body or name of the people should remain. But that hope
might cherish and sustain the Jews, if any name and body of the people had been
left. But when God pronounces that they should be offscourings to be scattered
to every wind, he takes away all hope of restoration for the present at least.
We know that there was a certain number left, but such destruction was
necessarily threatened before God gave any hope of his mercy. When he says,
<i>to any wind, </i>he signifies in any quarter whatever. For as one or another
wind blows so the dust is carried, and the offscourings are dispersed in all
directions. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">YESTERDAY, after Ezekiel had prophesied concerning
the slaughter of Jerusalem, he expressed one reason why God was so angry against
that city, which he had formerly chosen for his dwelling. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had
violated</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>polluted his
sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now therefore we see of what
great importance before God is that true and pure religion whose pollution he so
severely avenges. And indeed the safety of the city depended solely on the pure
worship of God. Therefore the profanation of the Temple was just as if they had
rejected God himself, and renounced his aid. Lastly, that impiety sufficiently
shows that they despised whatever God had promised them. And these words are to
be marked, where he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even I
will diminish thee, and my eye shall not spare, and I will not
pardon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because nothing is more precious
to God than that worship which he has commanded: when his sanctuary is polluted,
it is no wonder if he is thus angry. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now he explains without a figure what he had
previously proposed figuratively. For he had been commanded to shave off the
hairs of his head and of his beard with a razor, and to divide them so that the
pestilence should consume one part, the sword another, and the famine a third.
Now he repeats the same thing but in another manner. Hence God explains why he
had offered a vision of this kind to his servant. But he shortens what we
formerly saw, because he omits the fourth member; for he was commanded to take
some portion and to hide it under his armpit, or in the hem of his garment: but
here there is no mention of that part, and yet it was not spoken in vain, but
God speaks in various manners, and that by his own right. Meanwhile, both the
figure and its application agree, because God was consuming the whole people by
either famine, pestilence, or the sword. What was said concerning the fourth
part was not in vain, but it was not necessary to repeat it. To this end then
the Prophet tended, since some were survivors it might seem that they were
exempt from the common slaughter: that he might take away that hope, he said,
that they also, or at least many of them, should perish by burning, so that they
should light up a fire in the whole people of Israel. For it happened through
the unconquerable obstinacy of the people, that the wretched exiles were more
hated; those who had already spared them began afresh to rage against them with
cruelty, because the name of the people became detestable among all men.
Because, therefore, the remnant of the citizens who remained at Jerusalem
perished, hence it happened that the burning penetrated to the ten tribes, and
to those wretched exiles who were captives in remote lands. But now our Prophet
is silent on this point. In the meanwhile, he comprehends whatever we saw
before, although more briefly: only that explanation was wanting, which,
although it was formerly useful, yet ought not of necessity to be repeated.

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet only teaches what he had
said before, but by way of confirmation, namely, that God&#8217;s vengeance
would be horrible and unceasing until the destruction and extinction of the
people. There are some who think that this was interposed that God might
mitigate the rigor of his vengeance, and so this verse, according to them,
contains a promise of pardon; but it is rather a threat. For what they assert
&#8212; that God would cause his anger to cease &#8212; cannot stand. For it
follows afterwards </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
know that I Jehovah have said it, when I shall have filled up my wrath or anger
against them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And the context, as we
shall afterwards see, will refute that comment. Let this, then, remain fixed,
that the Prophet does not here promise the people any mitigation of their
punishment, but goes on denouncing the vengeance which he formerly
mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall be filled
up:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
keleh, </i>signifies sometimes &#8220;to<i> </i>finish,&#8221; but also,
&#8220;to<i> </i>be accomplished,&#8221; &#8220;to<i> </i>consume,&#8221; and
also, &#8220;to<i> </i>be consumed.&#8221; In this place God signifies that
there should be no end to the punishments until he was satisfied. The image is
taken from men desirous of vengeance, whose eagerness does not cease till they
satiate themselves with revenge. God, therefore, here likens himself to men when
he speaks of the end or fulfillment of his anger. Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cause my fury to rest upon
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, my fury shall be, as it
were, fixed upon them. For &#8220;rest&#8221;<i> </i>is not to be received here
for &#8220;cease,&#8221;<i> </i>for wrath is said to rest when it has spent
itself, but God wishes here to mark by his Prophet the perseverance or untiring
course of his vengeance. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
wrath, therefore, shall rest upon them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that is, it shall not remove or pass away; for God is said to withdraw his
hand when he ceases to punish us, but here the rest of his wrath is its
perpetual continuing. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will take comfort</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God transfers to
himself what properly does not belong to him, for he does not delight himself
after the manner of men when he takes vengeance on wickedness; but we know that
God&#8217;s judgment cannot be comprehended, unless he puts on the character of
man, and in some manner transforms himself. Hence he is said
to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> receive
comfort</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the approbation of just
judgment. For this comfort signifies, that God cannot bear the contempt of his
law &#8212; then that the malice of man is so desperate, that the judge must at
length appear in his own nature; not that he indulges in any passions, as is
sufficiently known, but because we cannot otherwise conceive him to be a just
judge, unless he declare himself pleased with vengeance, when he sees men so
utterly abandoned and beside themselves, as not to be otherwise recalled to
penitence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall know that I
Jehovah have spoken it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God
obliquely blames the stupidity of the people, because they not only despised all
prophecies, but also proudly laughed at his threats. As often, then, as the
Prophets declared the vengeance and judgments of God, they gave material for
laughter to a perverse and impious people, and their obstinacy so blinded them
that they did not think it was God who spoke; for they supposed that men only
would be their adversaries, and hence their rage against the Prophets. For if
they had thought that they had spoken by divine inspiration, they would never
have dared to rise against them so madly; but because they thought that the
Prophets uttered in public their own comments, therefore they strove with them
in forgetfulness of God. The Jews, therefore, did not acknowledge him. But let
us mark the source of their ignorance: they turned aside their senses from God
of their own accord, as at this time many do not think that God speaks when his
truth is openly shown from the Scriptures. Why do they not think so? because
they are unwilling. Hence this blindness was voluntary and affected, so to
speak, in the ancient people, since they imagined that the prophecies would be
without effect. This is the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then they shall know that I have
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because, as the proverb is,
experience is the fool&#8217;s teacher; since, therefore, they rejected all
threats, it came to pass that, by the teaching of calamity, they perceived too
late that God was the speaker. And so there is an antithesis between
experimental knowledge, and blindness which arises from an evil disposition and
a contempt of God. For when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall know when he has
fulfilled his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that knowledge
shall be too late and unfruitful. Lastly, God here pronounces, that he would
inflict just punishment on their voluntary ignorance, from which the Jews should
know, whether they would or not, that the prophecies against which they had
closed their eyes had proceeded from himself alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he had spoken in his
zeal,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or jealousy, because the Prophets
were thought to be very furious when they thundered so against the impious. God
therefore here acquits those whom we know were commonly esteemed fanatics, and
says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he spoke in his
zeal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because the impious, when they
wish to load the servants of God with envy, object that he is mild and merciful,
and that it does not accord with his character to speak roughly and sharply. God
therefore says that he also uses zeal, or anger, that the Jews might not think
his Prophets carried away with inconsiderate zeal and fervor, since we know that
they fell into that grievous error. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He further explains how the Jews should be devastated
and become a reproach among the nations. Now, he does not speak of their
dispersion, but uses two words for one idea: he puts
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hprj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherepheh, </i>which signifies a reproach, and adds
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpwdg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gedopheh, </i>which signifies a taunt and a mocking: but this could not take
place without the slaughter of the people. Unless the profane heathen had some
ground for it, there was no reason why they should utter their taunts and
hissings against the Jews. Hence destruction and complete slaughter are
comprehended under the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reproach and
taunt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or laughing-stock. But this
sentence belongs to the former verse: there it was said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Meanwhile the execution of
God&#8217;s vengeance is marked; when, therefore, God reproaches us, we are
compelled to lie under the power of his hand, because an attempt to resist him
is vain. We shall wrestle, indeed, as the ungodly do, but unless we yield
willingly, the violence of his power will crush us. Hence we must observe the
context: I will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make thee a
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thou shalt be
one,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because God signifies that his
threats should not be either empty or in vain. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt be a
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rswm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>moser, </i>signifies discipline and instruction, but is often used for that
correction which springs from a sense of God&#8217;s wrath. When, therefore, God
chastises his people, if they repent, they are said to profit by his discipline,
since they have learnt themselves to be sinners by the punishments which he has
inflicted on them. But he says that the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>should be a correction to the
profane nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because they should
grow wise by their punishments; for while we apply examples to our use, this is
a timely correction, since we do not wait till God strikes us; but when he takes
vengeance on the despisers of his law at a distance, if we are moved by such
examples, this is, as I said, correction in good time: for the Prophet now
applies it to the nations, not without the disgrace of the elect people: as if
he had said that their punishment would be so notorious that the very blind
would recognize them, and tremble at the perception of their
import.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These words, indeed, do
not seem sufficiently in agreement with the Jews being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a wonder and a
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but the Prophet does not
simply mean that those who perceived the judgment of God should be either stupid
or docile, he only means that in God&#8217;s severity material would be proposed
for all, as well of correction as of astonishment, so that they should be
horrified when they saw God treating his elect people so harshly. For he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when I shall execute judgments on
thee in wrath, and in fury, and in burnings of
anger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms what we saw before,
namely, that God&#8217;s judgment would be remarkable, because he had so long
borne with a reprobate people. Since he had so long borne their impiety, he
broke forth at length in one impulse, and then exercised the formidable judgment
of which he speaks. This is the reason why he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the nations shall be astonished
when I execute my judgments upon thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>What, then, were these judgments? &#8212; in truth, anger, and burning, and
furious rebukes. Here the Prophet seems verbose; but he could not be too much
so, since the sluggishness of the people was so great that they were not moved
by any prophecies. As we have formerly seen, he had been, doubtless, derided by
those Jews in Chaldea, who as yet remained at home tranquil, as it were, in
their nests. &#8220;Does he, the wretched exile, threaten us? let him be content
with his own lot: since God has spared us, he seems to be stirred up to vex us
by envy alone; but we have no reason to fear the envy of a captive and an
exile.&#8221; Since, then, the Prophet knew that he was contemptible among the
Jews, it was necessary to heap up such forms of speech, that his teaching might
have more weight: nor does he look: at the Jews<i> </i>alone, but at those
people also who had been dragged into the same exile; for he has to advise them,
for the reasons which we have formerly explained. Now, therefore, we understand
his meaning when he speaks
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>concerning anger and
burning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and adds, at the same time<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burning
rebukes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He adds also,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I Jehovah have spoken
it:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which he will repeat at the last
verse of the chapter. And this confirmation is also very useful, because when
both the Israelites and the Jews looked at a mortal and abject man, a captive
and a slave of an impious people, they would doubtless have despised all his
prophecies. Hence he sets God before them, by which he means that he was not the
author of the threats, but spoke only from the mouth of God, as the organ of the
Spirit. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He illustrates the sentiment which we have seen, but
not after the manner of rhetoricians, who affect splendor and ornament of
speech; but his only design was to penetrate the minds of the people, like
stones or iron. This, then, is the reason why he uses such variety here, and
adorns his teaching with various figures. For he now compares God to an archer,
who points his arrows against them; but he speaks metaphorically concerning the
arrows of God; for he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arrows of famine and
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, deadly and death-bearing.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall hurl evil
arrows against them, they shall cause their destruction,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">says he; that is, they shall not escape death,
because they shall be struck with mortal wounds. A person might be struck by the
blow of an arrow, and yet become convalescent; but God pronounces the arrows of
which he speaks deadly, so that whoever is struck by them has no hope of safety
left. Besides, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by arrows of
famine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we may understand such barrenness
of soil as flies, locusts, and other scourges of God &#8212; at one time
scorching, at another mildew dries up the corn-field, now rains make the wheat
rot, now heat burns it up, as many sources of corruption and pestilence as these
are to the crops, so many are the arrows of God which transfix men&#8217;s
hearts, and that too by a deadly wound. If so subtle an explanation does not
please any one, he is at liberty to take it otherwise; yet if any one properly
attends, he will confess that God darts his own arrows as often as he causes
famine, or deprives men of sustenance. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which shall become
corruption</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He confirms what we said was
denoted by the epithet
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y[rh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hergnim. </i>He says, therefore, that these arrows would be destructive,
because </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they should be for
perdition and destruction.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Another
confirmation follows: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I
will send</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against them to destroy
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God distinctly affirms that
he would dart forth those arrows, and repeats again what we saw before, and
that, too, in the same verse. But we have taught you why the Prophet insists, in
many words, on a matter by no means obscure. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will multiply famine
against them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he signifies that he
was armed with different weapons, so that if men perceive themselves to have
fallen, they may perceive that God has other hidden weapons, which he has not
yet brought into use. By the word <i>&#8220;</i>multiply<i>&#8221; </i>the
Prophet expresses what we have already seen, by means of arrows, for he uses the
plural number, but the impious restrict as much as they can the power of God.
&#8220;If God wills&#8221; they say, &#8220;he can indeed ruin the corn-fields
with continual rain, he can also burn them up by too much heat, if we have
escaped the frost and the hail, the storm, and the rain., and the drought, it
will have already gone well with <i>us.&#8221; </i>Thus the impious harden
themselves in their security. And why? because they restrict God&#8217;s arrows
to a fixed and certain number. This is the reason why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will multiply famine upon
them;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, when they think their
yearly produce safe, because they have escaped drought, and rain, and mildew,
and storm, and hail, I will find, says he, other modes unknown to them, by which
I will bring famine upon them. And he expresses one manner of doing so &#8212; I
will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>break the staff of
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>concerning which form of speaking
we have spoken previously. I do not subscribe to their opinion who say, that the
staff of bread is broken when God sends a deficiency of corn; for in the
greatest plenty the staff of bread is broken, as we saw in Moses, when God takes
away the nourishing quality of bread, and makes it vanish,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
8:3,) because man lives not by bread alone, but by that secret inspiration which
God has implanted in the bread. Hence we may eat more than fourfold the usual
quantity, and yet not be satisfied, as this form of speech often occurs with the
Prophets, which they take from Moses. Thou shalt eat, and not be satisfied, say
they.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;032626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus

that God breaks the staff of bread, that is, takes away its nourishing quality,
so that he who feeds upon it does not feel that he has recovered new rigor. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God speaks generally concerning certain
adversities &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will send
evil upon them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says, but immediately
afterwards he adds the kind of evil, of which he had not yet spoken. Hence,
under the name of evil he embraces all adversities, as if he had said that he
intended to exact the penalty from the wicked, not in one or two ways only, but
by those numberless troubles which surround us, and to which we are subject; so
that there would be no bounds to his wrath, unless men should cease to provoke
his anger. This is the reason, then, why he now speaks generally concerning
evil; but as I have said he adds the kind of evil <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An evil beast shall come upon
thee, and so I will bereave thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Although only one form of evil is expressed, yet it is by no means doubtful
that for the sake of example God mentions this, that they might understand that
all injuries are in his hand. And these are numberless. If we look upwards, how
many deaths hang over us from that direction? If we look at the earth, how many
poisons? how many wild and fierce beasts, how many serpents, swords, pitfalls,
stumbling-blocks,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>precipices</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>falls of houses, throwings of stones and darts? In short, we cannot stir a
step without ten deaths meeting us. So God here speaks of wild beasts only for
the purpose of showing that <i>they </i>were at hand, and that by them he would
execute his judgments. Now, therefore, we understand why Ezekiel first spoke of
the <i>genus, </i>and afterwards came to the <i>species.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And at length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
bereave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or deprive them, namely, that he
will deprive fathers of their sons, and sons of their fathers; and he will do
that, not only by cruel and savage beasts, but by various other ways. Again he
repeats &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pestilence and
blood shall pass over thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had not
spoken of blood before, unless under the name of the sword, which he repeats
again: but he heaps together, as I have said, various forms of speech, so that
those should be at length awakened who had been too slow, and were afterwards
turning themselves willingly away from all sense of the wrath of God. Hence he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pestilence and blood shall
pass through thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Then, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will bring a
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he spoke of blood, he really
intended a sword, but, as I have already said, this did not cause either the
Israelites or Jews instantly to tremble at such threats. What, therefore, was in
itself sufficiently clear and easy, ought to be impressed in various ways. With
this view he adds again</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, I
Jehovah have spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For he turns away
the Jews and Israelites from looking at himself, and shows them that he was not
the author of the threats, but that he faithfully delivers what he had received
from God&#8217;s hand, and what he was commanded to utter against
them.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now turns himself to the kingdom of
Israel, since he had formerly spoken concerning the Jews alone. He says that he
was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>divinely sent to the
mountains of Israel. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The first question may
arise about the time; for the kingdom of Israel had been cut off, and the ten
tribes dragged into exile- and the kingdom had come to an end in Ezekiel&#8217;s
time. The time, therefore, does not seem to accord with the denunciation of the
Prophet as to what had happened many years previously. But nothing will appear
out of place, if we say that it was partly prophecy and partly doctrine, so that
the Israelites might understand why they were driven out of their country, and
dispersed among the nations. I say that God&#8217;s plans were partly explained
to the exiles, that they might know why God had driven them to distant lands:
for this punishment would not have been useful had not God convinced them of its
cause. But although the kingdom had fallen, it is probable that some of the
people were remaining: for the Assyrian did not carry off so many thousand men,
and his kingdom would have been burdened by such a multitude. Doubtless he
collected the flower of the people, and permitted the commonalty to remain
there: for he sent from his own kingdom inhabitants for the deserted soil. But
the change was great and ruinous to the king himself, and vexatious to all
alike. Although, therefore, the kingdom did not exist any longer &#8212; nay,
even the name of Israel was almost extinct, because there was no mass of people,
and they dwelt in their country like foreigners and guests, yet there was still
some portion of them left. Now, we collect from the words of the Prophet that
they were obstinate, because they were not induced by either the exile of their
brethren, or their own calamity, to leave their own superstitions, and embrace
the true and pure worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, therefore, this chastisement did not profit
them, hence the Prophet is ordered to preach
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is ascertained from the first
chapter that Ezekiel received this command after the destruction of the kingdom
of Israel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
1:1, 2) for he said that he was divinely stirred up in the thirtieth year after
the jubilee, and in the fifth year of the captivity of Jechoniah or Joachim. It
is evident, therefore, that the Prophet spake against the land of Israel after
the ten tribes had been dispersed. Hence we may elicit that there were still
many people there, because it would have been difficult for the Assyrians to
receive<i> </i>all the people, and those who remained alive in the country went
on in their own abominations, so that it became necessary for some other
judgment to be denounced against them, on which we are about to enter. Now,
therefore, this principle is established, that the Prophet so treats the
slaughter of the kingdom of Israel, that he predicts as about to come to pass
what those left in the country by no means feared; for they were persuaded that.
they were free from all dangers. But the Prophet shows that God&#8217;s wrath
was not yet complete, but that their former calamities were only a prelude, and
that heavier woes were at hand, because they had so hardened themselves against
the power of God. The prophecy, too, has greater weight when the Prophet
addressed the mountains than when his discourse was directed to men. So that
Ezekiel is not ordered to exhort the Israelites to penitence, and to threaten
them with the punishment which still remained, but he is ordered to turn his
discourse </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to hills, and
mountains, and valleys</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Thus God
obliquely signifies, first, that the Israelites were deaf, and then unworthy of
the trouble which Ezekiel would spend in teaching them. Thus the Prophet sent to
Jeroboam did not design to address him, but turning to the altar
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O altar, altar,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;thus<i> </i>saith Jehovah, Behold a son shall be born to the family of
David, by name Josiah, and he shall slay upon thee the priests of the high
places, and :shall burn upon thee the bones of the dead.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;111302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Kings 13:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The king was burning incense on the altar, the
prophet does not regard him, but as I have just said, directs his discourse to
the altar: that was far more vehement than if he had reproved the king sharply.
For that was no common reproof, to pass by the king as if he had been only the
shadow of a man, and to admonish the dead altar concerning a future event: so
also in this place: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of man,
set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet might object that the
mountains had no ears, and hence that it was only child&#8217;s play. But he
understood God&#8217;s intention, and so obeyed cheerfully, because he saw the
people despised and rejected by God because they were deaf and incurable, and
meanwhile he knew that his labor would not be lost although he addressed the
mountains. For we know that the earth was created for the use of man, and hence
God proposes to us examples of his wrath in brutes, trees, the atmosphere, and
the heavens, that we may know that admonitions belonging to us are engraven
there, although in every other way God turns away his eyes and his face. This,
therefore, is a sign of his wrath, when God shows his judgments on all sides,
and yet is silent towards us, because we gather from this that we are unworthy
of any trouble for our improvement, and this was doubtless the Prophet&#8217;s
conclusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now a clearer expression follows in the third verse:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt say, ye mountains of
Israel, hear the word of the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here
an audience is required of the mountains which they could not give, but that has
respect to mankind, as I have just said. God, therefore, requires the mountains
to listen, so that men may understand that an inanimate thing may be endued with
sense, if their stupidity is considered. For at length God enforced his
judgments against the mountains of Israel. Although, therefore, they could not
hear the Prophet speaking, yet they took up his instruction, because it was
efficacious in them, and God at length in reality proved that he had not spoken
in vain. The event, therefore, openly made the mountains in some way attentive.
Neither could they escape the judgment which had been openly denounced. Now he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah to the
mountains and the hills</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Ezekiel now
addresses not mountains only, as he had been commanded: hence he seems to exceed
the prescribed command, for he had been sent to mountains and hills only, but
now he says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, hear ye mountains,
hear ye hills, hear ye valleys.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But we
said yesterday that prophets sometimes speak briefly, and sometimes explain more
fully what they had uttered but shortly. God, therefore, at the beginning spoke
only of mountains, but he doubtless comprehended valleys, and the flowing down
of rivers, because the Prophet only explains what he had said in one word: hence
he speaks to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains and
hills</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the pouring down of waters or
torrents</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jerome translates it rocks,
and the Hebrews call whatever is violent
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qypa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aphik, </i>hence when there is any violent course they use this word; and so
we may understand in this place either rocks or flowing down of waters or
torrents, no matter which. But since he afterwards adds valleys, this
explanation is to me probable, that the Prophet indeed understands either
torrents or the rushing down of waters. Here we must also remark, that those
parts are marked out where the Israelites had <i>erected </i>perverse and
adulterous worship: for we know that mountains were filled with superstitions,
and so also valleys, though the reason was different: for when they erected
their altars on the mountains they thought themselves near God, but when they
descended into the valleys, their rites were thus performed in shade and
obscurity, and thus they thought themselves in this way hidden as it were in a
sanctuary. It is sufficiently known that they exercised their idolatries in the
mountains as well as the valleys. This, therefore, is the reason why the Prophet
here shows that the whole land of Israel was polluted with defilement.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I bring a sword
against you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence we infer that when
the Prophet addresses the mountains, yet he speaks for the sake of man. For the
sword could not injure the mountains: for one stone would break a hundred, nay a
thousand swords, and yet remain entire. God, therefore, had threatened the
mountains with slaughter in vain, nay, when mention is made of the sword, we
know that death is understood: for the cause is put for the effect.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>God addresses men indirectly, but when he directs his discourse to the
mountains he shows that men themselves are deaf, and therefore turns away his
face from them, and addresses mute elements and inanimate things:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will
destroy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,

taught before, that mountains, and hills, and valleys, and descending waters are
named, because perverse and impure worship flourished there. For by
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lofty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

mixed of their own imaginations to corrupt the worship of God. They properly
call altars
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lofty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because they were erected in high and conspicuous places. But the species is
here put for the genus. Meanwhile, God signifies that he so abominates all
fictitious worship that he cannot bear the sight of the places. The stones
indeed of which the altars were built we know to be harmless: for places are not
polluted by idolatry of their own will; for as far as the world was created by
God it always retains its own nature, but as far as man is <i>concerned, </i>the
places themselves were polluted, and the contagion renders them hateful to God.
Hence this is put for the detestation of idolatry. He continues the same
sentiment, and first denounces that altars should be laid waste. Now it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it appears how greatly obedience pleases God,

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22; I Kings 12.) For it is certain that the <i>Israelites </i>extolled
their own fictions exorbitantly, as if they were worshipping God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>correctly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In the beginning, indeed, Jeroboam cunningly devised those new rites, that
he might alienate the ten tribes from the family of David, and at length the
error spread, so that they thought that God approved that impious worship. But
we see that God abominates them. We should always hold this principle, that
although men think that they obey God when they thrust in their own fictions,
yet they produce no other effect than to provoke the wrath of God against them.
This vengeance, therefore, had not been taken against altars, unless God had
been greatly offended with the impious mixture.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your altars, therefore, shall
come to ruin and destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your idols shall be
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here some understand the
idols of the sun, as the noun is taken from heat, which is afterwards repeated:
but this divination seems to be too contracted Hence I do not doubt that the
idols are so called on account of the mad love with which the worshippers were
seized: for throughout the Prophets they are said to be like adulterers, and our
Prophet also uses the same language. Idols therefore may very properly derive
their name from heat, because their superstitious worshippers inflame themselves
with love, and like adulterers run after harlots, as we shall again see. He
afterwards uses another word, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will lay prostrate your slain
before your idols</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>for they call idols
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylwlg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gelolim, </i>on account of their foulness, nay even filth. We see then in the
first place that the fury with which the Israelites were inflamed is condemned
by the Prophet, since they perverted the pure and lawful worship of God: then he
reproves their enormity because they willingly remained in filth and defilement.
But here also we are taught how mightily God is angry with all superstitions,
when he not only cites mankind to his tribunal because they profane true piety,
but is angry with external instruments &#8212; as stones and wood, and, as it
were, involves these instruments of idolatry with their authors. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">By these words the Prophet signifies that God&#8217;s
wrath would be manifest, because he impresses certain marks by which it may be
judged that the Israelites had provoked his anger; because they had departed
from the pure and genuine order of the law. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will place the carcases of the
sons of Israel before their idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when
the carcases were so mingled with the idols, hence it appeared that God was
greatly offended. For we know that it was detestable in all sacrifices that
either human bones or carcases should be joined with the victims: so that the
religion of the Israelites was openly condemned by this sign, so that unless
they had been utterly blind, they would acknowledge all their worship to have
been abominable. We understand, therefore, the design of God when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would cast the carcases
of the sons of Israel before their idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>as if he had said, I will defile all your rites which seem to you sacred,
and I will make them stink even before the unbelievers. But how? for the altar
is polluted by contact with a carcase; but the carcases shall be cast there,
that the contagion may spread to the altars.

sprinkle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,

would profane those sacred rites which the Israelites had fabricated for
themselves with their carcases: by which he understands that they would be
doubly disgraced whilst they defiled by their pollutions what they had thought
beautiful. The Prophets constantly proclaimed that these rites were folly and an
abomination, but still those who were attached to those superstitions pleased
themselves. When, therefore, God&#8217;s servants effected nothing by their
sacred admonitions, at length a real and actual proof was added, when their
altars were polluted, and that, too, with their own defilement. For in this
God&#8217;s remarkable vengeance appeared, as I have formerly
said.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In other words, the Prophet signifies that God would
take vengeance on the superstitions of the ten tribes in all places; whence it
is <i>clear, </i>that no corner was free from corruption. For, while he names
all habitations, he means that they had defiled every habitable place.
Wheresoever they dwelt they had erected their altars and strange worship, as
another Prophet reproves them; according to the number of your cities were your
Gods.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:28;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
11:13.) He addresses the Jews there, but the meaning is the same. Hence the
Prophet signifies, that it was not a single part only that was polluted with
their idolatries, but their filth was spread abroad through the whole land
wherever there were any inhabitants.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In all your
habitations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cities shall be
deserted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he threatens destruction
and desolation to the cities, he means what I have just said, that those places
were corrupted by impious superstitions. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy high places shall be
destroyed </i></font><font face="Palatino">or made desolate. Here he explains
himself more clearly, that the cities should be reduced to solitude, because
their religion was corrupt, and the inhabitants were given up to their own
fictions and idolatries. He adds therefore high places to cities, that he may
point out the reason of the cities perishing. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may be
desolate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or reduced to a desert: it is
again the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chereb, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and your altars may
perish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms the same doctrine,
namely, that he was so hostile to the cities of Israel because they were all
polluted with profane and strange altars. For, as we have said, God had chosen
that land to himself, and so all its cities were dedicated to his glory. This,
then, might move us to wonder why he threatened them with destruction; for we
might readily answer this by saying his counsel was changed. But the Prophet
shows, that although the cities themselves were pleasing to God, yet they were
hated by him through the corruptions by which they were polluted. Hence he joins
high places to altars. Hence a probable conjecture is elicited, that the
Israelites did not sacrifice wherever they had erected high places. They had
then their own high places when they worshipped false gods, and also their own
altars. And since the worship of God was vitiated in both ways, the Prophet, as
I have said, here joins them both.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and your idols shall be broken up
and cease,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or be abolished. Again he
uses that reproachful word which I have said is taken from the stench of dung.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:15.) But it signifies that which is highly esteemed among men is abominated
by God, especially when it is worshipped.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. I </i>have said that this word is
derived from heat. It means, that the idols were the cause of their madness,
since the Israelites were so corrupted with impure love that they deserted God
and looked only at the idols: but he compares the zeal with which idolaters are
maddened to impure and brutal lust. At length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your works shall be
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> .</i>Here he uses a general name,
and significantly points out the difference between the pure worship of God and
all corruptions. There is no need of a long discussion if we desire to know how
God is to be worshipped. For he rejects and excludes our works. If, therefore,
we do not obtrude our works, but only follow what God demands, our worship will
be pure, but if we add anything of our own, it is an abomination. We see,
therefore, that useful instruction can be collected from one word, namely, that
all worship is perverse and disapproved by God when men bring anything forward
of themselves. For by works he does not here understand idols made of either
wood, or stone, or brass, or gold, or silver, but it comprehends likewise
whatever men have fashioned, and whatever can be ascribed to them, because they
have not taken them from the mouth of God and the commands of his
law.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Yet here another promise is added, which may temper
the bitterness of so sorrowful a prophecy. For hitherto God shows that he burns
with indignation against the land of Israel, so that he determined to destroy
it, since it was polluted everywhere, and at all corners. Nothing could
therefore be hoped for, if Ezekiel had spoken precisely; therefore a promise is
added in mitigation &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I

Israelites quiet and safe in the land, but he says that their safety shall be in
exile. Hence therefore we collect that they were so depraved that they were
unable to obtain pardon, because God says that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

some hope of favor, yet he also admonishes them that they could not obtain

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
SEVENTEENTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last lecture I only recited the ninth verse,
but did not explain it; for the Lord says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he would afterwards make some
part of Israel a remnant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>since he hoped
they would profit by the chastisement: <i>then, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant will remember
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he obliquely reproves
the sluggishness of the ten tribes, who could never be brought to any sense of
God&#8217;s anger, unless by experiencing it. For there is an opposition between
remembrance and forgetfulness, since he says they would remember after they were
afflicted, he signifies that during their prosperity they were drowned in
<i>negligence </i>and contempt. <i>We </i>may learn from this that God&#8217;s
chastisements are very useful to us, because when he indulges us we abuse his
kindness, and flatter ourselves so as to become hardened in sin. It is
necessary, therefore, nay, even useful, that those who indulge themselves in
their vices, should be chastised, and although the Lord can recall us to himself
in other ways, yet our weakness is so great that we always grow torpid in our
sins, until his chastisements draw us back to life. Besides, we must also
observe, that; all are not permitted to become wise again, even when chastised
by God. And the Prophet does not speak generally, but marks out the survivors,
or those who shall have been preserved.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;kyfylp</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
phlitikem, </i>says he, that is, those of you who shall be saved; but this was
only a small portion, as we have seen. Now as the difference is sought for
between the few permitted to escape<i>, </i>and the multitude which perished,
none other will be found, except because it pleased God to preserve a seed. All
were worthy of death; he consumed almost the whole body of the people; he wished
a small number to remain safe. We see, therefore, that the safety of those of
whom the Prophet now speaks flowed from the mere mercy of God. Besides, what I
have said must be borne in mind &#8212; that none repented but those to whom it
was given; whence it follows, that repentance is a singular gift of God. And we
see that many plunge into a worse state, nay, even rage against God when he
chastises them: first they roar, then they are outrageous, then they rush on to
unbridled madness, so that they would be prepared to wage war with God, if they
could penetrate as far as the heavens. Since therefore chastisements are common
to the elect and the reprobate, and yet some go on to rage more and more against
God, it follows that it is not permitted to all to repent when God admonishes
them, cites them to his tribunal, and demands punishment for their sins when
they displease him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This therefore is the reason why the Prophet
restricts this promise to those who should be saved out of the whole people. He
had said they should be preserved, because God was unwilling to extinguish the
whole Church, that he might not destroy his covenant, which ought to be
perpetual and inviolable. He says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>among whom, or where,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were
captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here also the Prophet
signifies that exile would be useful to the Israelites, because as long as God
suffered them to possess the Holy Land, they provoked him as if on purpose.
Since, therefore, they so polluted God&#8217;s worship in the Holy Land, he
ought long ago to have destroyed them. And the Prophet signifies this when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the nations where
they were captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they would then
return to a sound mind, though they had been obstinate in the region assigned
them by God. It follows </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he
was broken down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or worn down,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through their
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There may be a double sense of
the words. The first is, that God was at length conquered by their wickedness,
after he had found that he did not profit by bearing them patiently. For when he
sees that his favor becomes a laughing-stock, he is the more angry, and
deservedly so. Thus, therefore, this passage may be conveniently explained,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God was broken on account of
the adulterous heart of the Israelites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>because when he had long suffered them to sin with impunity, yet when he saw
no end to it, being conquered, as it were, by their obstinacy, he descends to
punish them. But we may also refer this to pardon, because they will acknowledge
that God is broken through their heart, because he wishes to pardon them. For he
is said to be broken who voluntarily forgives injuries; and since there are many
tender and kind, who willingly pardon their enemies for even the greatest
crimes. And this explanation is in some degree suitable, because the sinner
cannot really remember God, without perceiving some taste of his goodness, so
that he hopes he will be propitious to him. Yet the first sense seems more
suitable, that the Israelites will begin to remember when they were dragged into
exile, that just punishment awaited them, because God had borne with them
patiently, and had not treated them at once with the utmost rigor, but when
compelled, he descended at length to take vengeance, after he was broken down or
worn down by their desperate wickedness. Now, therefore, we understand the
Prophet&#8217;s intention. Hence also we gather, that those who seriously repent
do not acknowledge their fault lightly, but think within themselves in what
ways, and how long, and how perversely, they have provoked God&#8217;s wrath.
The Prophet expresses this by the word <i>breaking. </i>God, therefore, did not
treat the Israelites so harshly, while he was offended by their wickedness, but
at length he was broken by their hardness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through their adulterous heart
which departed from me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through their adulterous eyes
after their idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This image occurs
everywhere throughout the Prophets; and because I have often explained it, I now
pass it slightly by. For the superstitious are said to commit whoredom with
their idols, that all idolatry may be rendered more detestable. For those who
adulterate the worship of God by their fictions, yet think that they offer an
acceptable obedience. Since, therefore, the blind and unbelieving so please
themselves by their corruptions, hence Scripture compares them to adulterers.
The name of devotion among the Papists is at this time so plausible that it
buries all the light of sound doctrine. For by this one word they reject
whatever is offered them in the law and the gospel: and so also concerning
&#8220;good<i> </i>intentions&#8221; as they call them. Since, therefore, the
incredulous so intoxicate themselves with their own comments, God distinctly
mentions fornicators, and says, that all who recede from the pure rule of the
law contaminate themselves with debaucheries. At the same time, as I have often
said, the prophets allude to a sacred and spiritual marriage in which God has
bound himself to his Church. For chastity of soul means the pure worship of God.
When, therefore, men fall off from that sincerity, it is just as if a woman
should desert her husband and follow adulterers. Now that the Prophet may
express this mad desire more clearly, he adds eyes to the heart. By these words
he understands furious lust, not only because they were devoted to their idols
with all their heart, but they were drawn that way by their eyes, as if their
eyes had been torches to inflame their mind. He retains, however, his own image,
because adulterers by their wandering glances generate the flames of lust, and
so their heart is set on fire. For this reason therefore he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were adulterous both in eye
and heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall become
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or shall be cut off
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in their
faces</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, before their face:
others translate, they shall feel nausea, which seems rather too rough. But
because the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ket, </i>signifies to spew out, those who use a word of abomination render
the Prophet&#8217;s sense faithfully.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be
therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an abomination to
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those who translate it,
<i>&#8220;</i>They<i> </i>shall be cut off,&#8221; also receive the word
metaphorically; for he who suffers so much shame that he scarcely dares to look
on heaven and men, is said to be cut off. But others translate, they shall
contend or quarrel before their eyes. But since that signification is rarer, I
scarcely dare subscribe to their opinion, especially when the best sense is,
that they should be abominable to themselves. Therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall be rejected before
their face,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, they shall not wait
till men condemn them or until others reprove their perverse worship, but they
shall willingly abominate themselves. Now the Prophet shows that their penitence
is real, because it may happen that a person may feel that he has some dealing
with God, and yet not be truly humbled: just as Cain was compelled to tremble at
the sight of God, yet was always like himself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:9.) So it usually happens to all the wicked. The acknowledgment of this
judgment of God is indeed some portion of repentance, but only half: wherefore
the Prophet, that he may show the Israelites that they would remember God not
without fruits when his hand was upon them, adds, that they should be abominable
to themselves. This displeasure is then the second part of repentance. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the evils which they have
done in all their abominations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
Prophet expresses more clearly, that the veil by which the eyes of the
Israelites had been so long covered should be removed when they returned to God.
For escape from punishment causes men to connive at their sins, as if a veil had
been placed over their eyes, and they imagine that what God not only rejects but
even detests is honorable. But when God by the infliction of punishment forces
the wretched to perceive this, and no longer to put light for darkness and
darkness for light, then they begin to be displeased with themselves. Now it
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He now mentions the fruit of their repentance,
because the Israelites were beginning at length to attribute just honor to his
prophecies. For we know that they trifled carelessly while the Prophets were
threatening them. Because, therefore, they were in the habit of destroying
confidence in all the servants of God, and of reducing as it were their truth to
nothing, the Prophet says, that when they repented they would then perceive that
God had not spoken in vain. While they were despising his threats, they did not
perceive that they ought therefore to be considered despisers of God. For
listening only to men, when they heard Jeremiah or Ezekiel, they thought that
they were contending with them only, and could do so with impunity against mere
mortals. God therefore, in opposition to this, testifies that he was the chief
author. For as error springs from error, they proudly rejected whatever the
Prophets said, when they treated it as frivolous and vain. God therefore says:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall then know that I have
not spoken in vain, when I bring upon them this
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This knowledge, which is produced
by real dissatisfaction with self, is very useful. I have said that it is the
fruit of repentance, but at the same time it profits the miserable, to humble
themselves seriously before God, and to call to memory their own ingratitude:
then they perceive what they had never admitted before, that God is trustworthy
as well in his threats as in his promises. Hence it happens that they reverently
embrace his word which they had formerly despised. He pronounced the same thing
previously concerning the reprobate, who, as we have already said, feel
God&#8217;s hand without producing fruit. But because he now speaks of those
very few whose conversion he had previously praised, he doubtless comprehends
the fear of God under recognition or perception of him. For if all God&#8217;s
threats had been buried, the people could not be thought to have returned into
the right way, nor could their conversion have any existence before God. We know
that contempt is not free from impious sacrilege, which is now treated of.
Therefore, that the sinner may submit himself sincerely to God, this
acknowledgment is required, that he should weigh within himself how unworthily
and wickedly he had formerly either repudiated or neglected the word of God. In
the meantime the Prophet triumphs over the arrogance of those who had wantonly
despised the teaching of all God&#8217;s servants, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall feel (or acknowledge)
that I Jehovah have not spoken in vain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Since, therefore, the Prophet here depicts as in a painting their late
repentance, let us learn to tremble in time at God&#8217;s threats. Although
indeed God does not yet execute his vengeance upon us, yet let us be sure that
he does not speak in vain, and let us be alarmed as soon as he shows any sign of
his indignation. God indeed testifies that he would be propitious to the
Israelites, although their repentance was tardy; but as far as we are
concerned,<i> </i>let us repent in time, as I have already admonished, and as
soon as God utters his threats, let it be to us just as if their execution were
at hand. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This confirms what we have formerly seen concerning
the slaughter of the ten tribes. The kingdom of Israel had been indeed
afflicted, but because those remaining in their own country thought themselves
free from further calamity, and gave themselves up to their idolatries more and
more, it was on this account necessary that final destruction should be
denounced against them. Since, then, words moved them but little, God adds a
sign, according to his custom in obstinate cases. He orders the Prophet, by
clapping of hands, and by extending his legs and feet, to show that the land was
cursed.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Divide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for thus men are accustomed to do
when they denounce anything gravely, or burn with indignation: they extend their
legs in opposite directions; so I have rendered it verbally
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>separate thy
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>the clapping of the hands has the
same object. God wishes by this gesture that his word should be confirmed, not
for the Prophets sake, but for the sake of the obstinacy of those who were deaf
to all words, as we have said. Hence we truly comprehend how great was the
stupidity of men, who, when God was thundering from heaven, yet remain secure,
and do not cease to follow after their own desires: even when God inspires
terror, they do nothing but laugh &#8212; this is monstrous. And yet we see it
was an old disease, and I wish we of this day were free from what Ezekiel
experienced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, it is just as if he had been commanded to
bring the Israelites into his presence<i>. </i>When, therefore, he was commanded
to cry
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>alas!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or, oh! </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon all the
abominations of the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>there is no doubt that his gesture as well as his exclamation ought to be
efficacious. The reason also is added &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all shall perish by sword,
pestilence, and famine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have said
that these three kinds of punishment are always proposed, not because God
strikes the despisers of his law with pestilence, the sword, and famine only,
but because this method is more known and more common. God has innumerable
hidden methods of punishing transgressors; but since, as I have said, this
scourge is more used, hence the Prophets more frequently mention
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The result is, that destruction to the kingdom of
Israel was at hand, which they had never thought of; because God avenges the
wickedness of his people not only by war, but by pestilence and famine.
Sometimes by the figure, a part for the whole, it comprehends other punishments.
And we know with how many miseries war is replete; for when once<i> </i>men
begin to take up arms, the gate is opened to robberies and rapines, burnings,
slaughters, debaucheries, and all violence; and in war all humanity and equity
is buried. Then as to famine, we know that it usually renders men ravenous. But
in pestilence the husband will desert the wife, every family is invaded by
death, orphanhood afflicts one, and widowhood another. Since, therefore, these
scourges of God draw with them infinite miseries, it is not to be wondered at if
the Prophets use war, pestilence, and famine, for shortness, when they signify
that those who provoke God too long shall perish. Now follows a clearer
explanation &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet explains himself how the Israelites
were to be destroyed by famine, the sword, and pestilence, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who shall be far off shall
die by pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, after they
think themselves hidden in secret places, so that no danger nor inconvenience
can overtake them, they shall die there by pestilence. For when they were
dragged into distant exile, they thought themselves altogether remote from all
harm. But pestilence, he says, shall attack them although the sword shall cease.
Then those who shall be at hand, that is, those who remain at home, the sword
shall consume. Now the remnant, he says, who had been besieged and hemmed in,
shall die by famine. And so he confirms what we formerly saw, that there should
be no cause why the Israelites should sleep amidst their sins when God spared
them: because if they do not all perish by the sword, God has other means of
punishing them; for he has pestilence and famine in his hand, so that he can
extinguish those who are far off, since pestilence will pursue them even there;
then if any are left, they shall perish &#8212; even in the midst of peace
&#8212; nevertheless, because God will destroy them by famine and want. Then he
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will fulfill my burning
wrath against them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>by which words God
signifies that he had borne with that impious people thus far, but if at any
time he pleased to exercise rigor, that he had not yet exacted sufficient
punishment for their wickedness. Hence God blames them, though he had borne with
them thus far, and although he had sometimes stricken them with his rods, yet he
was not a rigid judge, but admonishes them as a father to return to the right
way. But since they had so obstinately abused God&#8217;s forbearance, he here
pronounces that his last act was approaching, and for this reason he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fulfilling of his burning
anger:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>thus the Prophet turns away all
envy from God, that the Israelites should not charge him with cruelty; thus he
shows them that whatever evils they suffered were only a prelude to a horrible
slaughter which was overhanging them, and which they still despised. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Now he again announces that they shall know what they
have long neglected. But here a different knowledge from the former seems to be
marked; for he has lately said that they should so remember as to be ashamed,
and acknowledge that the slaughters predicted by the Prophets had not been in
vain: but here he mentions nothing of this kind, but only speaks of that
experimental knowledge which is common to the ungodly. And, in truth, this
doctrine seems to be extended promiscuously to all the commonalty. For although
for the most part they did not profit by it, yet all perceived that God was a
judge, because so clear and conspicuous was the proof of his vengeance, that
they were compelled to feel, whether they would or not, that their punishment
was just. We may perceive, then, that the Prophet intends the phrase &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then ye shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc., </i>in a wide sense, because he
addresses all the Israelites without exception, even those who should perish.
For, we said, such was the character of that knowledge, that it only frightened
them, and did not bend them to humility. And, truly, the words which follow show
only the terrible vengeance of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when they shall be
slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he, that is, shall fall,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>near their
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we have said that they would
more clearly acknowledge the vengeance of God from this &#8212; that he rendered
their false gods an object of ridicule. But, as I have said before, the Prophet
uses an opprobrious name when speaking of idols. Since, therefore, they so fell
near their idols, under the confidence and protection of which they thought that
they would always be safe; and although the idols themselves were thus involved
in the condemnation, this made God&#8217;s vengeance more manifest. And this is
the reason, as I have before suggested, why the Prophet enters into these
details. What follows is to the same purpose &#8212; by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the circuit of all their
altars</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This, then, was profanation of
all altars, to be defiled by carcases being drawn over them, and then sprinkled
with human blood. But he also points out the places where they worshipped false
gods; for we have said that lofty places were chosen for them, but here he puts
<i>lofty hills, </i>and then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
tops of the mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But as
idol-worshippers heaped to themselves various and numerous games, when they were
satiated with their high places, they had shady valleys, for their altars were
under trees, where they offered incense. The Prophet therefore pronounces that
there was no place which God did not condemn with infamy. When, therefore, he
says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the incense had a
pleasing smell</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the opposite is
doubtless intended, since this incense was foul before God: as when an immodest
woman desires to please an adulterer, it moves the wrath of her husband, so here
God silently complains that he was provoked by that foul incense with which the
Israelites wished and desired to gratify their idols.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">EZEKIEL pursues the same sentiment, but it is
necessary to persist with more words in confirmation of his prophecy, because it
was somewhat difficult of belief, especially among men so secure, and who had
been hardened against God by long habit. This is the reason, then, why he uses
so many words about a thing in itself by no means obscure. Now he speaks
concerning </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the extension of
God&#8217;s hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is a Scriptural
form of speech sufficiently familiar; for it is said that God extends his hand
when he puts forth manifest examples of his wrath. But the phrase is taken from
men, who, if they wish to accomplish anything great extend their arm. We know
that God accomplishes all things by his nod alone, but because through our
sluggishness we do not comprehend his judgment, the Scripture, in compassion to
our rudeness represents his hand as extended. But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he will place the land in
devastation and stupor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The two words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
shemmeh, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shemeh, </i>are different, though derived from the same root.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
shemeh, </i>signifies to destroy and lay waste; also to wonder at: so that the
explanation of some is not bad &#8212; I will place the land for a desolation
and an astonishment. But because the comparison of a desert follows immediately,
I willingly subscribe to the opinion of those who translate desolation or
solitude, and vacancy or waste: for although these: two words are synonymous, as
they say, yet the Prophet properly adds vacancy or solitude to waste, because he
does not. inculcate the same thing too often, for the sake of explanation, but
only that he may confirm what he otherwise knew would not be attended to by the
Israelites. Some translate from the desert even to Diblathah; and there are some
who think Riblatha should be read instead of Diblathah &#8212; and it may happen
that an error has crept in, on account of the similarity of the letters
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d</font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r</font><font face="Palatino">.
But I do not think any change is needed: and besides, I reject as absurd, the
explanation from the desert even to Diblathah or Riblatha. But
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino"> is
rather a mark of comparison: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
land of Israel shall be reduced to
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>more than the desert of
Diblathah. For how could the Prophet have said &#8212; from the desert even to
Diblathah? The threat is against the land of Israel, but Diblathah was in Syria
beyond the land, for they think it was Antioch: hence the true sense, according
to the Prophet&#8217;s intention, could not be elicited from this. But it is
most suitable that the desert should be placed before the eyes of the
Israelites, because it was not far from their country: Syria was between them
and it, but since there was frequent intercourse, that desert was sufficiently
known to them. Already had they passed through the desert when they passed into
exile, and the difference in the aspect of the country would rather waken up
their senses: for the whole of Syria is fertile, and Antioch has an excellent
site, as geographers relate. Since, therefore, the Israelites had traversed a
pleasant land, and one filled with all opulence, when they came to a desert vast
and sorrowful, that appearance, as I have said, would stir them up the more.
This, therefore, appears to me the reason why the Prophet says that the desert
Diblathah was not so waste, or solitary, or dry, or squalid, as the land of
Israel should become.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all their
habitations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that they may know that
there would be no corner free from that devastation which he predicts: for it
will often happen that some land is partially seized and spoiled, but here the
Prophet comprehends all habitations.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I am
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>that is, they shall know that I
have spoken by my Prophets. But God announces this with displeasure, because the
Prophet&#8217;s authority ought to have been sacred and established among the
people. For his calling was so marked out that they could not contend against
him without being opposed to God. Hence Ezekiel is omitted here, and God comes
forward, as if he had spoken himself.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore, he says, both my
faithfulness and power. Besides this knowledge is extended to the reprobate who
do not profit by God&#8217;s chastisements. Although, therefore, experience
compels them to acknowledge God as a judge, yet they remain obstinate, as we
shall soon see again and again. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel seems here too verbose; for he repeats the
same sentiments almost in the same words. But the reason which I have brought
forward must be marked, if God had only uttered his commands shortly, when the
people were not only slow to believe but of a perverse disposition, his message
had proved cold and ineffectual. With this design he uses, as we have seen, many
words, and now repeats the same: he now changes his expression, because he ought
by all means to stimulate that sloth, or rather sluggishness, under which the
people labored. Another thing to be noted is, that he came not once only by
God&#8217;s command to preach to the people, but. that he was often sent to stir
up their minds. For if he had included in one context what God had enjoined, the
Israelites might for the time have thought of God&#8217;s judgment, but a
prophecy once uttered would have easily escaped them. Besides, when Ezekiel
testifies that he was sent by God, and afterwards returns and affirms that he
brings new commands, this was more effectual to influence their minds. Now we
see the meaning of the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word was given by
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For this prophecy is
distinguished from the former, and yet the matter is the same, without any
difference, as it seems to weave in with the same discourse: this, indeed, is
true, but he ought to be sent twice, that the people may understand that not
once only, but twice and perpetually, what he heard from God&#8217;s mouth was
to be repeated: since it was sufficiently clear, that God was anxious for their
safety, since he never ceased to exhort them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>says the Lord
Jehovah concerning the land of Israel: an end is coming, an end upon the four
corners of the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God seems to
regard the moderate punishments which he had already inflicted on the kingdom of
Israel. For we know that they often felt God&#8217;s hand, but when some
relaxation was afforded them, they thought themselves escaped, so they forgot
their wickedness and went on in it so carelessly that it was very clear that
they despised God, unless when he oppressed them with his dreadful power. This
seems the meaning of the word <i>end, </i>and it is emphatically repeated:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an end is coming, an end upon the
four corners of the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He puts,
indeed, wings, but intends it metaphorically for four different regions. God,
therefore, reproves the Israelites for their obstinacy, because though often
chastised they did not cease to transgress, through not supposing that any thing
more grievous could happen. He puts therefore the word <i>end, </i>as if he
said, hitherto I have treated you moderately. And surely God had displayed a
remarkable specimen of clemency in punishing the Israelites so lightly when he
might utterly have cut them off. Since, therefore, he had so refrained himself
in punishing, the sluggishness of the people was on that account the less
tolerable, since they thought all was over as soon as God had withdrawn his
hand. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an end is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, after this you must not
hope for any moderation. I see there is no hope of repentance in you, and so I
shall utterly consume you; and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the four corners of the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as he had just said, in all your
dwellings. Again, therefore, he teaches, that no part of the earth should be
free from the slaughter which he predicts. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He puts the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> end
</i></font><font face="Palatino">a third time, and repeats it even a fourth and
a fifth time. Whence we collect, that those miserable ones, although admonished
more than enough both by teaching and experience, were yet like brute animals,
so that they always promised themselves something to fly to, and were not
impressed with the fear with which the Prophet would strike them. They did not
think that an end was really coming, but said, Oh! something will remain, some
will escape; and this therefore was their pride. Hence the Prophet does not
inculcate the same word in vain:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the end is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the end has
come,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he signifies that the Israelites
vainly and foolishly trusted in the future, because they had not yet experienced
extreme rigor. God, as he had said, had been lenient with them as to punishment.
What then did they do? When they perceived such forbearance in God they thought,
that it would always be so. Hence the Prophet marks the difference between the
past and future, as if he should say, that God&#8217;s vengeance as they had
formerly known it, was moderate, but now nothing else remained but that God
should utterly tear them up and consume them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is an end
concerning thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had spoken in the
third person, but he was directing his discourse to the whole land of Israel,
and he had said upon the four corners of the land,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the end cometh upon
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will send my indignation upon
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God indeed had given signs of his
anger, but he had not been so severe that the Israelites ceased from flattering
themselves. When, therefore, he speaks of his own indignation, he doubtless
signifies that he was so offended that he would not restrain himself as he had
formerly done. This too is the sense of what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will judge thee according to
thy ways</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They had been judged formerly,
but only in part; for God had given them time for repentance had they been
curable: but now, when he compares their judgment with their sins, he means,
that nothing was wanting to extreme severity. And he explains that more clearly
at the end of the verse,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will
put upon thee all thine abominations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, I will cast thine own burden upon thee. For although God had begun
to exact just punishment. for their superstitions, yet they had not suffered a
greater burden than they deserved. Hence God now pronounces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all their abominations
should come upon their own heads</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so
that they should be utterly buried. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In other words he confines his own sentence, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will not spare
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>nor will he be entreated. For when
hypocrites hear the praises of God which are assigned to him in scripture,
namely, that he is merciful and long-suffering,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
14:18;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:8,) they seize upon them and fabricate for themselves the material of
foolish and perverse confidence. God here pronounces that his pity would not be
accessible to the wicked, who do not cease to repel it far from them. And this
is worthy of notice, because nothing is more natural than to be intoxicated with
false hope when we hear that God is merciful, unless we know for what purpose he
testifies this concerning himself, namely, that sinners may betake themselves to
him, and may fearlessly call upon him, and implore his mercy, of which they have
such remarkable testimony. But hypocrites always become worse, meanwhile they
wish God to be propitious to them. Hence when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his eye will not spare, neither
would he pity them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>his intention must
be observed, that. wicked and ungodly men should not think his clemency prepared
for them against which they have previously shut the door.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I will put thy ways upon
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that<i> </i>is, I will cast thy
wickedness against thee. We see then that the people&#8217;s sins were placed
before them, and as it were lay there as long as God spared them. Now,
therefore, he first signifies that they should have no cause of quarrel or
complaint, because he will cast against them the iniquities which they had
heaped upon him. Then also he silently accuses them of too much security,
because they never could be brought to repentance, while God sustained and
tolerated their sins. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy
abominations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be in the midst of
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They were so from the first as far
as their guilt was concerned, but God had not yet poured forth his anger. He
says, therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy abominations
shall be in the midst of thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because
it should really appear that they were not obstinate against God without
punishment. Again he repeats, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye
shall know that I am Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is
quite clear, that by their obstinacy they compelled God to speak thus, since
they despised Ezekiel. But although they pretended to some piety, it cannot be
doubted that they would despise God himself.</font><br></div>

although the Israelites are deaf, yet they are compelled to attend to
God&#8217;s continued threats. The Prophet therefore strikes their ears, because
he was not immediately attended to, and again he speaks of the end:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an end is
come,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an end is

repetitions which we see. For</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>concerning which he speaks could
with difficulty penetrate their minds, for they were always supposing that God
could be appeased by various means. Since, therefore, they promised themselves
something remaining behind, and put away from them what the Prophet taught about
the end, he could not do otherwise than threaten often though he could scarcely
persuade them. Hence </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an end is

<div><font face="Palatino">Now he uses another word. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the morning is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>though some translate kingdom, but
erroneously. For although
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrypx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tzephireh, </i>is a turban sometimes, or a royal diadem, yet the
Prophet&#8217;s language is distorted when they say that the kingdom was
transferred, or taken over to the Babylonians. But the sentence flows best
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the morning
cometh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By &#8220;the<i>
</i>morning&#8221; he implies what he had said before, namely, the hastening of
God&#8217;s vengeance. As, therefore, he said the end was watching, since God
was hastening to take vengeance,<i> </i>so also he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the morning is come to
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then rouses them from that
drowsiness in which they had grown torpid. We know that hypocrites commit all
their sins as if no eye were upon them; as long as God is silent and at rest
they revel without shame or fear. But the chosen remain faithful even in secret;
but God&#8217;s word always shines before them, as Peter says &#8212; ye do well
when ye attend to the Prophetic word, as a lamp shining in darkness.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;610119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 1:19.) Although the faithful may be surrounded by darkness, yet they
direct their eye to the light of celestial doctrine, so that they are watchful,
and are not children of the night and of darkness, as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 5:4,5.) But the impious are, as it were, immersed in darkness, and
think they shall enjoy perpetual night. As the rising morning dispels the
darkness of night, so also God&#8217;s judgment, on its sudden appearance,
strikes the reprobate with unexpected terror, but too late.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason, then, the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>morning is come to the
Israelites,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because they had promised
themselves perpetual night, as if they were never to be called upon to render an
account of their<i> </i>conduct. We see, therefore, that he alludes suitably to
that torpor which was the cause of their obstinacy, when they thought themselves
safe in their hiding-places. Hence he laughs at their perverse confidence, who
promise themselves impunity because they are in night. For the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, will immediately seize upon you; hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>morning is coming upon thee, O
inhabitant of the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the time is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gneth, </i>properly signifies all appointed or determined time. Hence the
Prophet meant that the time had come which God had fixed beforehand for his
judgment, and thus he takes away from the impious the material for pride, for
they always suppose that God is as it were asleep when he does not attack them
at the very first moment. He speaks, therefore, of an appointed time, as in
other places the Prophets usually do, and frequently of the year of visitation.
He signifies the same thing when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day of
tumult,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or<i> </i>noise, <i>is at hand.
</i>This member of the sentence answers to the former. He had said the end was
watching; he had said that the judgment was hastening on: now simply and without
figure he says, the day is <i>at hand,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwrq</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
krob, a day, </i>I say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of noise,
and not the echo of the mountains, </i></font><font face="Palatino">says he;
that is, it shall not be an empty resounding, as when a. sound is produced among
the mountains a concussion arises, and since the sounds which are uttered there,
when taken up by the neighboring mountains, return to their own place, and thus
a greater resounding occurs, called echo. The Prophet therefore says, that the
clamor of which he speaks should not be an echo, that is, an empty resounding,
because all should seriously cry out. Some think
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hed, </i>means <i>&#8220;</i>acclamations<i>,&#8221; </i>which is properly
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddyh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
hided; </i>it is, indeed, from the same root, but
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>her, </i>is used in the same sense. But if this explanation seems better, the
Prophet will allude to mountains, not lofty, but vine-bearing, as many were in
the land of Israel. But the other explanation is preferable, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall be the sound of a
tumult</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not on account of the
reverberation, as they say, but because every one should cry out, until sorrow
and crying should abound on every side. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

which he formerly mentioned, namely, that they should unwillingly feel

hand, because they do not willingly obey his word: but we said that the Prophet
here triumphs over the people&#8217;s pride who dared to deride all threats as
if God were sleeping in heaven. He says therefore at length, that when God

<div><font face="Palatino">Now Ezekiel uses another figure, but to the same
purpose. He repeats what he had said before:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he adds another part, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the morning had
advanced</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we said that the impious,
when God connives at their sins, exult as it were in darkness without shame or
fear. Since therefore they were as wanton as if they had obtained the license of
night, the Prophet denounces that morning is at hand, because God would suddenly
bring to light what they thought would be always hidden. Since therefore, when
God retired, they supposed themselves in complete darkness, the Prophet recalls
them to the consideration of the daily order of things: for light emerges
immediately from the dawn. Thus he laughs at their folly, because they thought
that God had his eyes shut, when for the time he dissembles. This therefore is
the reason, as was fully explained yesterday, why the Prophet calls the sudden
change
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Therefore </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the morning has
arisen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rod has blossomed, pride has
flourished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is not doubtful that he
means Nebuchadnezzar by the rod, but interpreters vary on the context; for many
refer the following verse to the king of Babylon: but others, in my judgment
rightly, take it of the Israelites themselves. As to his saying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rod has
blossomed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it refers to God&#8217;s
forbearance. For when the Israelites had sinned a long while with impunity, they
thought, as I said yesterday, that their peace with God would be perpetual. But
here Ezekiel pronounces in opposition to this, that God had as it were a hidden
root; as he who plants a tree waits for the time, till it rises to a just
magnitude. Hence he compares Nebuchadnezzar to a rod which was growing. God
could indeed without man&#8217;s assistance destroy the Israelites, and could
also compel others to obey him: for all creatures are at hand to fulfill his
commands; but here Ezekiel commends God&#8217;s forbearance, though he had
planted the tree, from which the rod was to spring up with which he would smite
the Israelites. So he reproves their sloth, because they did not reflect upon
the time of their visitation, which God had determined in his secret
counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the whole, in saying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rod has
flourished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he refers to those steps
which God takes in executing his judgments. For he does not act hastily after
the manner of men, but just as a husbandman in sowing and planting. Hence God
provides for his own use ministers of vengeance, and permits them to increase
and to arrive at maturity. If therefore God does not hasten as we wish, we may
know that he still has rods prepared, and if they are not yet grown to maturity,
it is because the time which the Almighty has previously fixed is not yet
arrived. Now it follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
pride has budded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have just said that
some referred this to the Babylonians, but I rather understand it of the
Israelites. Hence God shows how the staff grew in Chaldea by which the
Israelites were to be struck, and yet the root was among themselves. For here
the noun &#8220;pride&#8221;<i> </i>is to be taken as usual in a bad sense: it
does not denote simply haughtiness or arrogance, but that licentiousness which
springs from a contempt of God. But this does not suit the Babylonians as far as
God governed them with his hand, when he wished to take vengeance on the
Israelites. But in this sense there is nothing forced,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the staff with which the
Israelites were to be struck had increased</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and yet it had no other origin than their sins, and hence that no other root
need be sought for than this. Hence <i>it flourished, </i>but whence did it
spring? from pride<i>. </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of this
staff</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was the pride of the Israelites.
But this pride is akin to impiety, and we know that they were blinded by their
confidence when they despised God, and treated all his threats as vain. Hence
the Prophet points out pride as the fountain of all evils. A clearer explanation

Israelites. He says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that violence
had risen up into a rod of wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Thus he confirms what he had touched upon, that the rod of God&#8217;s
vengeance was not to be sought elsewhere than among the Israelites. God indeed
had stirred up the king of Babylon to punish them: but the rod had grown up from
the root of their wickedness by which the Israelites had provoked God&#8217;s
anger: and so he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
nothing should be left of them: nothing, says he, should remain safe, either of

<i>neh, </i>and hence translates &#8212; there shall not be rest among them: but
the Prophet means that there shall be neither sorrow nor lament, because the
slaughter of all would be promiscuous. And we saw the same in Jeremiah: when one
family has perished, friends and acquaintances assemble, and celebrate the
funeral of the deceased; but when a pestilence pervades the whole city, and no
house is free from death: nay when fathers are mingled with sons, so that their
carcases can scarcely be drawn out for multitude, all sorrow ceases. With this
intention then the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall be no
grief</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>nor<i> </i>lamentation. For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hhn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>neheh, </i>means lamentation. But we have already explained its meaning,
namely, that all the Israelites were so destined to destruction that there
should be, no survivors to lament the dead, and even should there be any, they
should be so astonished amidst the multitude of the dead, that every duty of
humanity towards them would perish, .Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now uses another kind of speech.
Meanwhile he teaches that there should be such a change that all things should
be so mixed as if there were no difference between the rich and the poor. Yet
such a change does not happen unless God were grievously offended, and so did
not exact ordinary vengeance as he had formerly denounced. Paul indeed exhorts
all the pious to pass through this world as if they were pilgrims in it,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460729&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:29, 30, 31,) and thus he says is our faith proved, as with the
buyer so with the seller, as with the married so with the single. This general
doctrine is prescribed to all the children of God, since the fashion of this
world passes away, that they may pass through it, without having their minds
fixed on these perishing things. But the meaning of our Prophet is different,
because God will so disturb all things among the Israelites, that there shall be
no difference between buyer and seller. He who acquires rejoices, and he who is
compelled to sell suffers some degree of sorrow; and sometimes the man who is
deprived of his lands and possessions tears out as it were his own entrails. It
is natural therefore for the buyer to rejoice, and for the seller to lament. Now
God shows that the confusion in the kingdom of Israel was so great, that neither
poverty nor riches afford the material for sorrow or grief. Now we understand
the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the time has come, the day has
approached, in which the buyer will not rejoice, and the seller will not
lament</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: because, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>indignation is upon all this
multitude</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here that reason of Paul is
not brought forward, that the fashion of this world passes away, but a
concussion, or rather ruin of that land is pointed out, so that nothing remains
safe. For although, whilst we travel through the world, we ought always to erect
our minds and senses towards heaven, yet the political faculty remains and
flourishes even among the faithful. For the sons of God, though they are poor in
spirit, yet possess what God has conferred upon them: they exist, as Paul
exhorts them, as it were not possessing but yet enjoying their goods. But the
Prophet here signifies, that when the kingdom of Israel shall have been
overturned, there will be no use for either money or lands, because all being
cast out of their country shall be reduced to want. And he follows up the same
sentiment &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is interpreted variously, but the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning is by no means obscure: at the beginning he says, that
those who sold had no cause of sorrow on account of their not returning to their
lands. But this does not seem suitable. But, under one member, the Prophet
comprehends what I have lately said &#8212; that the disturbance of all things
would be so great, that the lands would be deprived of their masters, and those
who formerly possessed them would be outcasts and exiles; they would be in want
of all things, and be unable to plant their foot on their own soil. Nor is this
opinion contrary to Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
32:7, 8, 9.) When Jeremiah was in prison, he was commanded to buy land from a
relation: but that was done that the faithful might hope for their promised
restitution with quiet minds. But the discourse is now directed to the
reprobate, who were excluded from all hope of freedom. Our Prophet, therefore,
only fulminates here in God&#8217;s name, and breathes nothing but terrors;
there is no mention of favor in the meantime, because they had cast themselves
into despair. And this is the reason why he speaks of perpetual slaughter. He
says, therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall not
return to the things sold, although their life is among the
living</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This clause is variously
explained, but I do not willingly consume time in repeating the errors of
others: I shall follow what appears to me to be right. First, this clause must
be read adversatively: he says, indeed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and as yet their life is among
the living</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>but the copula ought thus to
be resolved &#8212; although their life is among the living. The Prophet seems
to allude to a custom then common. For there was not a sale of lands in
perpetuity among the sons of Abraham; for that was forbidden by the law, because
they were only strangers in the land.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;032513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
25:13, 14, 15.) God, therefore, in claiming the dominion of the land, did not
permit them to sell their land except for a time &#8212; for every fiftieth year
they returned to their own possessions. If they sold in the twentieth year, they
were restored after thirty years; if in the fortieth, the sale was only for ten
years, through the occurrence of the Jubilee. Now therefore the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>although they remain survivors,
yet they shall not return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Why? for the
captivity will hinder them. Now, therefore, we understand the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who
sold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall suffer no
loss</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For if they had remained at home,
they would have been deprived of their possessions; but this shall not happen,
for they shall be dragged to a distant region, and there they shall live and die
exiles. But if they should protract their life even to the hundredth year, yet
their possession will remain deserted, because the conquerors will not allow
them to return to their country. Hence the miserable condition of the exiles is
denoted, since, if God were to prolong their life, they would still be compelled
to consume it in poverty and want, since they had been driven away from their
lands and were unable to return to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because the vision shall not
return upon all the multitude of them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here also interpreters differ. For some distinguish this part into two
clauses, because the vision was for the whole people, nor had any one been
converted or repented. This opinion is plausible, because it contains a useful
and fruitful doctrine, which is everywhere met with among the Prophets. For we
know that nothing is less tolerable to God, than when men, admonished by
Prophets, do not return to a sound mind, but go on in their wickedness. Since,
therefore, such obstinacy exceedingly provokes God&#8217;s anger, this sense
seems to suit well enough &#8212; that the vision was for the whole multitude,
and yet none repented; that is, that God exhorted all, from the least to the
greatest, to repentance; for all were deaf, and, as it were, desperate in their
vices. Although, therefore, this exposition seems probable, I do not adopt it:
for I doubt not the Prophet&#8217;s meaning to be that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vision concerning the whole
multitude should not return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, be
in vain. And thus also Isaiah speaks when he says, thy word shall not return to
me void,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
55:11,) for he means that prophecies are always joined with their effects. Some
turn this to the fruit of the doctrine, because God will always have some
disciples who will embrace the prophetic word. But this is foreign to the
purpose. The Prophet rather means that hypocrites will be greatly deceived,
while they think God&#8217;s word to be an empty sound, by which the air only is
struck. Hence he says that God&#8217;s word will not want its effect., because
God will fulfill whatever he pronounces &#8212; whether he promise safety to the
faithful, or denounce destruction on the reprobate. As therefore Isaiah says
God&#8217;s word shall not return to him fruitless, since he will prosper it, so
our Prophet denies that God&#8217;s word should return after it had been
promulgated against the whole multitude.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore, is taken here for the
prophetic doctrine; but there is no doubt that he restricts the vision to
God&#8217;s judgment. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was towards the whole multitude,
nor shall it return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, it shall
be certainly executed. Afterwards he
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, and a man shall not
strengthen his soul in his iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Others term it &#8212; in the iniquity of his soul: but since the relative
is double, this opinion cannot stand; but others take it otherwise. But I am
unwilling to hold you in suspense here, and it seems to me that nothing is more
useful than to investigate the genuine sense of the Prophet. I have no doubt the
Prophet here confirms what we have now explained &#8212; that it is vain for the
despisers of God to hope to escape, because when God executes his vengeance, he
will hold them in his grasp. For as to what others say, that they have not
fortified their soul on account of iniquity; that is, that they were so bound
down to their sinfulness, that they did not lift up their minds and desires to
the hope of safety, that sense is too forced. Therefore the Prophet confirms
what we now see, namely, that his threats should not return empty, because God
would take away all material for confidence from the hypocrites and despisers of
his teaching. For the impious wrestle against God, and oppose their own
obstinacy and hardness, as if by violence they could break and destroy his word.
Since, therefore, the wicked precipitate themselves so boldly, says the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall not fortify themselves
by iniquity unto life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, they
shall strive in vain to obtain life by their iniquity, which is not sufficient
for resistance. I do not understand &#8212; on account of their iniquity;
because he simply denounces that obstinacy should be in vain, which profane men
use as a shield against God, and its force be reduced to nothing.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not fortify
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in life, or by
iniquity,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>unto life; that is, by that
obstinate wickedness by which they think themselves superior. Let us, therefore,
from this place learn to tremble at God&#8217;s threats, and always to have
their effect before our eyes, as the Apostle says &#8212; Noah saw by faith the
deluge which was hidden,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:7,) because, whilst others indulged themselves, he was always reflecting
during one hundred and twenty years how horrible that vengeance would be. So,
therefore, when God has spoken, may we immediately apprehend his judgment, as if
it were clear before our eyes; and let us especially beware of that obstinacy
which will assuredly be in vain, because we hear what the Prophet here
denounces. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems here to be at variance with
himself, because he formerly pronounced them all devoted to destruction. How,
then, does he now say that some should come hither and thither, to seek
hiding-places in the mountains? But what seem at, variance easily agree, because
by these words he means that the life of those who escaped should be more
miserable than if they had perished by the sword, or had been consumed by
pestilence and famine. And why so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
mountains.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By mountains he doubtless
understands dry and desert places. But he who seeks hiding-places in the
mountains is only anxious about preserving his life, since he expects not to
live. So, therefore, the Prophet means, nothing can be more miserable than the
exile of those who had escaped, because they would be in dry and desert
places,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> like doves of the
valleys</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there they will not dare to cry
out. He means, also, that they would be so timorous, that even in anxiety, want,
and squalidness, and despair of all things, finally, in the heap of their
miseries, they would groan <i>as doves, </i>and as <i>doves of the valleys,
</i>that is, which hide themselves through fear, and dare not show themselves;
unless, perhaps, the contrast increases the evil, as if he had said that they
should be much more astonished, because the unaccustomed aspect of the place
should strike them with greater fear. Now, therefore, we understand the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if any should escape from the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>yet nothing else would happen
through their flight, than that they should miserably protract their life in the
greatest anxiety. For we know that this is the last solace in evils, when men
complain freely, and unburden themselves by weeping and groaning. But when the
wretched one dares not complain, he becomes as it were twice dead among the

the slaughter of the people that they should all gird themselves with sackcloth.
But it seems little in accordance with this, that those who should be astonished
should gird themselves with sackcloth, so as not to bewail the dead. But the
prophets so vary their discourse because they cannot otherwise affect obstinate
minds. Although therefore these things do not seem at first sight to agree,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they should bind themselves
in sackcloth, and upon all their heads should be
baldness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>then that all should perish
without grief or sorrow: yet these things suit well enough, because the Prophet
does not express what they should do, but what the event should be. Since,
therefore, slaughter shall occur on every side, at length God shall consume some
by pestilence, others by famine: therefore he adds, there should be material for
grief, although in consequence of the multitude of evils they should be
lifeless, and torpid, and omit all signs of sorrow. Therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall gird themselves with
sackcloth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We<i> </i>know that this was
a remarkable symbol of penitence, but it is often transferred to common sorrow,
and even profane men clothe themselves in sackcloth, although they do not
acknowledge God the author of evils. Hence when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all should take sackcloth in
which to clothe themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does not
mean that they should feel punishments divinely inflicted that they should
repent; but he only expresses the common ceremony of grief in distress which is
also common to the wicked and to despisers of God, Now he adds,

that was preposterous affectation. And we know that men are ambitious in grief.
Hence that God may impose restraint upon sorrow, he forbids his people to cut
the skin, or to produce baldness. Hence we see that the Prophet does not speak

people would be so great that they would forget both gold and silver: for we
know that men are more anxious about those possessions than about life itself.
But gold, unless it be prepared for use, has no value in itself: yet we see that
the majority are so inflamed with the desire of gold, that they cast themselves
into the certain danger of death. For how many neglect their own life to acquire
wealth: hence when men despise gold, they are assuredly astonished by fear and
anxiety so as to lose their natural senses. The Prophet means this when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall cast their gold into
the streets,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because if they thought
they should survive, and if there were any hope of life left, doubtless they
would hide their gold and silver. But when gold is cast away, it is certain, as
I have said, that all things are full of despair.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be cast
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I prefer this interpretation to an
unclean thing.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nedeh, </i>signifies pollution, defilement, and separation. If any prefer-the
translation <i>&#8220;</i>separation<i>,&#8221; </i>I do not object, only let us
understand that the Jews would treat their gold as valueless, and so willingly
separated from it. For we know that men are so attached to their gold and silver
that it grieves them to be torn from what they so much love: no less than if you
tore away their entrails. But the word <i>&#8220;</i>a<i> </i>casting
away&#8221; is clearer, and will answer to the former member of the sentence
better. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their gold and
silver will be unable to preserve them in the day of Jehovah&#8217;s
anger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet derides the
perverse confidence of those who thought themselves safe, because fortified with
great wealth. For when men see themselves protected by guards they fear nothing,
and such security is not easily wrested from them. For this cause also, Ezekiel
pronounces that gold and silver would be useless to the Jews when God was fierce
against them. And at the same time he obliquely reproves their sloth, because
they despised God&#8217;s judgments since they were spared at the time. Hence he
declares &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day of
God&#8217;s burning wrath shall come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>then he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall not
satisfy their souls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall not fill their
bellies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he means that the richest
even should be famished. When any famine presses upon the people, yet those who
have money at home do not suffer; besides, the rich have all kinds of produce in
their barns and granaries. But the Prophet says, that the penury shall be such
as to involve the rich, so that they should not have food to refresh themselves.
Thus the reason is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because
it was the stumblingblock of their iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Some take this clause generally, that the Jews should stumble on account of
their iniquity, that is, then shall be the time of receiving their reward. For
God had seemed to pardon them, and not to notice so many iniquities with which
they provoked him. He says therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in that day shall be a
stumblingblock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>if that sense pleases
you, but I would rather restrict it to money itself, since silver and gold shall
profit nothing, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inasmuch as it
shall be a stumblingblock of iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, it shall be the material or occasion of sinning: and the next verse
confirms this sense when it says &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I doubt not that Ezekiel strengthens what he had just
taught by other words, namely, that the people&#8217;s silver should be cast
away, because it had been unworthily abused for luxury, vain pomps and
superstitions. Some explain </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wyd[
ybx</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>tzebi-gnediu, </i>of the temple; and
certainly I confess that the temple was the chief glory of the Jews, so that
they might boast of it, if they had rightly and properly worshipped God there.
Hence God conveyed great glory to the Jews when he desired a temple to be
erected among them to himself, which should be as it were his earthly
dwelling-place. But I do not see why we should take these words of the temple,
because the Prophet explains his own discourse: for he mentions gold and silver:
he said, there should be no use for gold and silver, because every one should
cast it into the mud, since they should cast away all hope of life and safety.
He now continues the same sentiment; he shows the lawful use of gold and silver:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it
was</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the glory of his
ornament</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For whatever God has given to
men is a testimony of his paternal favor: therefore God&#8217;s liberality is
refulgent in us when he enriches us with his gifts. If therefore riches are a
glory and ornament, so also are bodily health, and honors, and things of this
kind. Since therefore God wishes his favor to be conspicuous in all his gifts,
by which he adorns and marks men out, the Prophet properly says that the Jews
were adorned with gold and silver. But he accuses them of ingratitude because
they turned such glory to pride. For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wag</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gaon, </i>I here take in a bad sense, as in many other places: it sometimes
signifies excellence, but I have no doubt that the Prophet here blames the Jews,
because they were proud of their wealth, which they took as a testimony of
God&#8217;s favor. Therefore, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he turned the beauty of their
ornament, he turned it to pride</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the images of their
abominations and of their detestable things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or of their idols, for the Hebrews thus speak sometimes of idols,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they made
therewith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
is used as if it were
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
as often in other places, and thus it points out the material; for he says, that
the Jews </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made their
images</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which were so many abominations
before God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of gold and
silver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was a second profanation of
God&#8217;s gifts: the former was in pride, when the Jews through wantonness and
abundance began to be insolent against God, thus they profaned the glory with
which they had been adorned. But another pollution is also added, namely, that
they made their idols of gold and silver, and offered to them gifts and
sacrifices: as God complains in Hosea,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;280208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:8,) that they converted whatever he had conferred upon them into impious
worship. I had given, said he, my corn, and wine, and oil: but they adorned
their idols: this was forsooth their thanksgiving, that blind to my liberality,
they offered sacrifices to their idols of my corn and oil and wine. Of which
matter Ezekiel discourses more fully in Ezekiel 16. But he now
says:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that they made images of
their abominations out of that glory by which he had distinguished
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And at the end of the verse he
confirms what we have lately seen:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wherefore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will appoint
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, that beauty,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to them for a
castaway</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see the same sentiment
repeated which he had used before: but he here relates the reasons why the Jews
should disregard their gold and silver in the day of God&#8217;s wrath, since
they had unworthily defiled these gifts of God in which his grace and paternal
favor shone forth. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
make,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>therefore says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their gold or beauty as a
castaway</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he had said the same thing
before, but had not yet expressed the reason of God&#8217;s wrath. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that I do not approve of twisting these
words to the sanctuary, as some interpreters do. Hence I do not doubt that the
Prophet still speaks of the people. He changed indeed the number in the former
verse, for at the beginning he had used the singular number: now he returns
again to the singular number, and designates the people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will deliver
it,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the hand of strangers.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This was more severe than if they had been
oppressed by any domestic tyranny: nor do I doubt that by strangers the Prophet
signifies remote and barbarous nations, as we know that those with whom we have
no communication are more savage against us. First, therefore, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall be the slaves of
strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the impious of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he means that their enemies
should be so cruel and wicked, that no pity or equity was to be expected from
them. The sum is, that God&#8217;s wrath would be terrible since he had borne
the iniquities of the people so long. Hence we gather that wicked and abandoned
men are God&#8217;s scourges, and are governed by his will and hand. Since it is
so, we gather that God so works by them that he is pure from all alliance with
their faults, because he so exercises his judgments by means of them, that he
appears without blame with regard to them; but they are condemned deservedly,
because either their own avarice or ambition, or other lusts destroy them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall give them therefore into
the hands of strangers to destroy them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the wicked of the
earth for a prey, and they shall profane
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this word interpreters have
been induced to take this verse with reference to the sanctuary. But we know
that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chelel, </i>is taken in another sense &#8212; to slay. This word therefore
may be explained, that there shall be a general slaughter of the people: because
the enemies not content with the booty and spoil, shall also slay the captives
when they have obtained the victory. But I willingly retain the sense
&#8220;profane,&#8221;<i> </i>which means the same as <i>&#8220;</i>render<i>
</i>vile,&#8221; because the Prophet seems to me to allude to all kinds of
abuse, as when we do not consider for what purpose things are intended, but
rashly and thoughtlessly, contemptuously, and even insultingly dissipate them.
It means therefore that such should be the insolence of their enemies, that they
should waste and lay in ruins not only the people&#8217;s substance, but also
their persons: although this may be here referred to the substance itself: for a
robber is said to prey upon a man when he takes away whatever he has and leaves
him naked: in this sense we may conveniently explain what the Prophet now says.
But that simple explanation satisfies me, namely, that the enemy shall so
disperse the people generally, that there shall be no difference. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">As to the beginning of the verse there is no
ambiguity, for God pronounces that the Jews would be miserable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he would avert his face
from them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For in this was situated
their happiness, that God, as he had promised, would regard their safety. As
long, therefore, as God deigned to look upon them, their safety was certain, so
that there was no fear of danger. But when he no longer cared for them, these
wretched ones were exposed to all calamities; hence they are said to be deprived
of all protection, when alienated from God. This, then, is one clause. As to
what follows, expositors interpret it of the sanctuary; and I do not greatly
object to this, if any one approves of this sense, but I take it in a wider
sense. For God in my view calls the land
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his hidden
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which was safe under his
protection. For he says, that he had extended wings, under which he could hide
the people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:4;) and David prays that God would <i>receive </i>him within the hidden place
of his tabernacle.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;192705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
27:5.) Since, therefore, the people was protected by the power of God, the land
is deservedly called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s
hidden place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as an asylum, and it will
be proper so to translate it. <i>Devastators, therefore, shall profane my
asylum, because they shall enter in there, and shall profane it. </i>He repeats
the same word. Those who take it for the sanctuary restrict it to the holy of
holies, for so they call the shrine or oracle whence the answers were given; and
they call it an oracle, not from praying, but because they enquired there of
secret things. But as I have said, that seems to be forced, though I will not
quarrel with it, but show what I like better. The meaning is, however God had
spared the Jews for a long time, nay, had them hidden, as it were, under his
wings, and the land was as it were a sacred asylum, since they were so hidden
that they felt no injury from foreign enemies: yet this should profit them
nothing, because God would throw down all bulwarks, and give easy access to
their enemies, so that they might break through, and then profane and confuse
all things. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters refer the Prophet&#8217;s being ordered
to make a chain to the captivity; for we know that captives are accustomed to be
bound with chains and fetters, or manacles. Hence they explain it that God
threatens the people with exile. But the Spirit seems rather to allude to
criminals, who plead their cause in chains. For the Jews had long reveled in
their vices, and the absence of punishment had rendered them very audacious. Now
the Prophet says, the time had come in which they were to be brought to the
tribunal of God, and there to be dealt with most justly as criminals. Since,
therefore, they bound criminals with chains, that they might plead their cause
ignominiously &#8212; criminals, I say, who were already, as it were, half
condemned; hence the Prophet is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to make a
chain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that not only the people
should be called upon to render all account of their wickedness, but should also
be drawn, whether they wished it or not, to God&#8217;s judgment-seat. And he
explains himself when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>since the land is full of the
judgment of bloods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Hebrews call
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment of
bloods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the material of death, when the
cause is capital, and the criminal is so convicted that he cannot escape final
punishment; so any capital conviction is called a judgment of blood. He says,
therefore,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the earth is full of
a</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment of
bloods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, is guilty of so many
crimes, that it cannot escape the final vengeance. And afterwards he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which, in the general corruption
of the land, ought to retain something of its purity; but he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the city also is so full of
violence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>under which word are doubtless
embraced all unjust oppressions &#8212; rapines, pillage, unlawful gains,
robberies, and whatever opposes justice and equity. The result is, that the
people&#8217;s impiety and wickedness had come to such a pitch, that they were
no longer endurable by God; and hence God ascends his tribunal to exact
punishment from them; and this is the chain of which he speaks. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats what he had said, that enemies would come
who should be ministers of God&#8217;s vengeance. And again we learn from this
place, that even the impious are impelled by the hand and secret direction of
God, so that they cannot move a finger but by his will. He had formerly said
that he would give the Jews into the hands of strangers; but what now?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cause them to
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he, as if he would stretch
out his hand to them, and induce them. We see, therefore, that God holds the
impious under his guidance, as it were, for executing his judgments; but we must
consider the difference which I have lately laid down; for God so works by them,
as still to have nothing in common with them. For they are carried on by a
depraved impulse; but God has a method, wonderful and incomprehensible by us,
which impels them hither and thither, so that he does not involve himself in any
alliance with their fault. For he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the perverse
nation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that the Jews might know that
the last slaughter was approaching, since they should have to do with the most
cruel enemies. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall

pride of the people might seem an obstacle to God&#8217;s exacting the deserved

were swollen with haughtiness and self-confidence, the Prophet could not profit
them at all. Therefore he says, that God would make their haughtiness to cease,

draws away from them the vain hope by which they deceived themselves, when they

shows that their security was false, while they oppose the temple to God, as if
the temple were a shield to repel his vengeance. God, indeed, dwelt in the
temple, but this condition was added, that he was to be purely worshipped there.
But when the temple was polluted, God departed from it, as we shall afterwards
see. For this reason the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the enemies should come who
should pollute and contaminate the holy places of the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hitherto he had not spoken of
the temple, but he now adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

boast in the name of God, as if they held him fixed to themselves. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here explains more at length the nature
of that slaughter of which he was a herald. And again he deprives the Jews of
all ground for hope, and shows that they should look around on all sides in
vain, because God would deprive them of all help. This is the meaning of the
passage. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calamities shall
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that some shall follow one
portion, and others another. In this way he advises the Jews that they should
catch at security in vain, as if, at the passing away of one evil, they were
already free. For the wicked as soon as God with-draws his hand, think
themselves escaped from all trouble, and so despise God more carelessly: for
they fancy that God has done with them just like a debtor who has paid a small
sum to his creditor, and thus has obtained a relaxation, is careless; so the
reprobate harden themselves when God grants them some respite: for they think
that they have an agreement with him that he should not trouble them more. But
the Prophet denounces that there would be such a heap of evils
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that one calamity should have
many companions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God would not
cease to add evils to evils. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rumor upon
rumor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is referred to the object of
fear, because rumors of wars and of the cruelty of enemies would be spread
abroad. Since, therefore, the Jews are deaf and stupid, the Prophet announces
that God would continue exercising his vengeance, so that one calamity should be
only the forerunner of another, until they should perish a hundred times rather
than that God would suffer them to escape with impunity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall seek a
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet again shows
that the Jews should be stripped bare of every help. For although they boldly
despised God, yet we know that they wickedly abused his name. For they so threw
aside all modesty that. they did not hesitate to ridicule God and all his gifts.
Hence their last refuge in their calamities was to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek a
vision,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, to enquire what God was
about to do. Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
shall seek a vision from the Prophet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It
seems to me that the expression is too abrupt,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they shall seek a vision
from a Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because nothing is added
except concerning the priest and elders.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino"> is
sometimes taken negatively when words are united: I know not whether the
language will properly bear our saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall seek a vision, but
there shall be no Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And yet the
sense would flow better, if Ezekiel denied there should be any Prophets: for
this is a sign of desertion, when no consolation occurs which assists us in our
wars. Thus the Church complains in the Psalms,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
76:9,) that it was reduced to the greatest straits, and that no Prophet
appeared: we do not see our signs, nor is there a Prophet among us. And, in
truth, Ezekiel meant that the Jews would seek a Prophet in vain, because God
would take away that gift from them. As far then as the sense is concerned there
is no ambiguity, though the diction is, as I have said, rather obscure. The
meaning is, when they think God so bound to them that he will never deprive them
of visions which are prepared for their comfort, yet they are already deprived
of this good, and since they are destitute nothing remains except that utter
destruction which he has mentioned. We must leave the rest for
to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE TWENTY
FIRST.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We yesterday began to expound the Prophet&#8217;s
language when he denounced<i> </i>what the Jews little feared, that a time would
come when God would deprive them of their Prophets. Since therefore God was
accustomed to rule his people by counselors, and priests, and prophets, hence he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>counsel should perish from
the elders, and the law from the priests. </i></font><font face="Palatino">As to
the Prophets, he says, the Jews would enquire of them in vain the will of God.
The result is, since God always governed his people, there would be miserable
dispersion, because no more teaching should shine forth, but they would be
immersed in the darkness of ignorance. But this was the most grievous threat,
because in extreme evils it is no common consolation to have God shining upon us
by his word. For by this we are stirred up to patience, then our sorrows are
mitigated when we taste some hope of pardon, and God bears witness that he will
be propitious to us. But when this comfort is withdrawn, we are easily
overwhelmed by even the smallest evils. Yet God sustains us by his word in the
deepest afflictions as upon a vast sea, and as long as his teaching remains to
us we have as it were a chart of guidance which will bring us safely into
harbor. But when God nowhere appears, the lightest trial buries us in the
deepest abyss. So this was the sign of God&#8217;s fearful vengeance when the
gift of prophecy was extinct among the Jews, and the priests and elders had no
counsel. For we know how mightily they boasted that were powerful in wisdom. For
while Jeremiah blames them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
18:18,) we see that they rose up against him, relying on this confidence, that
the law could not pass away from the priests, nor prudence from the wise men and
counselors, nor yet a vision or utterance from the prophets. &#8220;Come ye, let
us take counsel against Jeremiah, and let us strike him with the tongue; for
counsel shall not <i>perish,&#8221; </i>etc. Being excited by this diabolical
fury they dared to raise their crests against <i>God, </i>and boldly claimed for
themselves what God here denounces that he would take from them: for the vision
they asserted must remain with the prophets and the teaching of the law with the
priests. But we see that God averts that perverse boasting when he denounces
that there should be no counsel to the old men, no teaching with the priests,
and no vision among the prophets. And hence also we gather that we can this day
refute the Papists by the same argument. For in the strength of what weapons do
they so proudly rage against the clear and certain doctrine of the law and the
gospel? Namely, that they are the representative Church, as if they openly
declared to God that his doctrine could not possibly perish from their priests.
I omit to no<i>tice </i>that this priesthood is not from God, since priests are
created<i> </i>for sacrificing Christ, and that without any command. But suppose
we grant them to be ordinary pastors of the Church, of what advantage is that
title when God deprived of all light of doctrine the Levitical<i> </i>priests,
who were created<i> </i>by him and not by human suffrages?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn therefore from this passage, that the
gift of prophecy and all teaching is God&#8217;s peculiar gift: let us learn
that this gift is withdrawn when God wishes to exact punishment for man&#8217;s
ingratitude. For if the doctrine is received<i> </i>less reverently than becomes
us, and God himself is despised, as is often the case, he throws men into
darkness, and causes them to err through blindness, and deprives them of the
least spark of light. when the priests themselves forget their office God
infatuates them, as we see has happened in the Papacy. Nothing is more to be
despised than those beasts, and yet they claim to themselves the spirit of
revelation. But God repays them the just reward of their madness, because<i>
</i>they have ruled tyrannically, and so have utterly abused the sacred name of
pastors: then because they have mingled their fictions with the law and the
gospel, and so have corrupted all purity of doctrine by their comments. God
therefore has revenged their pride, as we see; but when God shows us the way of
life by his servants, and shines upon us with heavenly doctrine, let us not
blindly wander in darkness, let us know that this inestimable treasure :is not
to be despised, lest we should be deprived of it. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet affirms that God&#8217;s
vengeance should be so common that it should alight equally upon the highest and
the lowest. He begins with the king, then he descends to his counselors, then he
comprehends the whole people. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
king shall lament</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says. But it is
his duty to give life to others, and then to devise a remedy for all evils; but
when the king has nothing left but grief and sorrow, it is a sign of despair. He
metaphorically clothes the elders in a garment of desolation. We know that a
garment has two uses; since it fortifies us as a defense against the cold, and
then it hides whatever is dishonorable in us. In the opposite sense the Prophet
says, shame shall be as a garment to the elders, and then he goes down to the
common people. At the same time, he assigns the reason, I, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will do to them according to

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I do unto
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>and in the same sense he
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, in their judgment will I

<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8221;
</i>is used peculiarly here, and contrary to its ordinary sense. For judgment
means the same as righteousness; but it is often transferred to transgressions,
as if he had said, they shall feel me a just judge though I avenge their sins.
Hence </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>mean perverse abuses, and
comprehend not only superstitions but all kinds of iniquities. By these words
God intimates that though he should punish the Jews severely, yet it would not
be cruelty, because they deserved such treatment. A confirmation follows in the
next vision. The vision is, indeed, separate, but as the Prophet had just
asserted in God&#8217;s name that the punishment was just under which the Jews
would suffer, he confirms this doctrine by the vision which follows, when he was
seized by the Spirit of God and transferred to Jerusalem, where he saw the
temple filled with various abominations; because there was no corner which they
had not defiled and violated with their idols. But let us come to the
words.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt that a prophetic vision is here
narrated; for the Prophet was not carried to Jerusalem, nor had he changed his
place, nor were the elders of Judah before him, but he seemed to himself to be
seized by the Spirit of God, that he might perceive the pollutions by which the
Jews had profaned the temple. For he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was at home when this
vision occurred to him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and yet it was
possible for him to be walking in the field. He does not, therefore, relate the
thing as done, but simply teaches how God appeared, and adds the circumstances.
By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elders of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I<i> </i>do not understand captives, but
those who were then dwelling at Jerusalem, that they should be witnesses of this
prophecy, and so all excuse and pretense of mistake was taken away from them. He
also expresses the time at which this vision happened, namely
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sixth
year</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which he numbers from the exile of
Jechoniah, as we saw in the first chapter. Hence an interval of a year and two
months has elapsed since the first vision which was then unfolded, and the
present which is now to be treated. Since, therefore, fourteen months had
elapsed, God appeared again to his Prophet. This circumstance of the time is by
no means superfluous, for this shows the great obstinacy of the people. The
Prophet, as I have said, numbers the years from the exile of the king. But they
were accustomed to count from the jubilee year; but he now renews the grief for
that slaughter, when the king was treated ignominiously as a vile captive, and
was harassed as a slave by the enemy. Since, therefore, the Prophet humbles the
Jews by this computation of years, hence it appears how hardened was their
obstinacy, as they did not grow wise though so severely chastened. But we shall
see that they were seized with a prodigious madness, so that they cast aside the
worship of God, they heaped together on every side new idolatries, and infected
the temple with their abominations. We saw in Jeremiah
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240717&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:17, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;244417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
44:17-19) that the worship of God was overthrown in the city Jerusalem, and in
the temple itself; for they poured out libations to the workmanship of heaven
&#8212; others translate, the queen of heaven, but we have shown that those
places ought to be understood of all the stars &#8212; since, therefore, they
offered incense to the workmanship of heaven, then they afterwards took to
themselves idols and polluted themselves with the superstitions of all the
nations. Our Prophet shows that they were not touched with any sense of their
punishment, but that they became worse from the time when God began to raise his
hand against them; for it was just as if he had begun to show himself from
heaven the avenger of their superstitions. Hence we have a reason why the
Prophet here mentions years and months, and even the fifth day of the month,
namely, that the Jews may be held more convicted of their obstinacy, since no
punishments recalled them into the way, but they wrestled with diabolical
obstinacy against God. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of God
fell</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I do not simply understand prophecy as some do, but strength; for the sense
seems too restricted to say, God&#8217;s prophecy fell &#8212; the phrase is too
cold. But this is properly said of the power of God. It is just as if he
professed that he did not bring forward anything of his own, because he put off,
as it were, the man whilst Gods power reigned in him. Thus the power of God is
opposed to all human faculties. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

the first chapter. I am not clear as to what color it was, hence I follow the

appeared to his servant under some image; nor is the human figure out of place,
because if it had been any other figure without doubt the Prophet had been
silent. But we have already seen that God had put on the human form, and so
represented himself in the person of his only begotten Son, as we have said, and
shall see again in the tenth chapter. This, therefore, is the likeness of which
the Prophet speaks, but he uses this word on purpose, that we may know that it
was not a true and solid and substantial thing called body. As to the
Prophet&#8217;s beholding a figure or likeness, this took place only in a bare
vision, not that God then put on a body; and concerning this point also I have
treated at length in the first chapter, and shortly I shall glance at it again.
Now as to his saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one part of

the Jews ought to hope for, when at length they perceived God to be near, from
whom they thought themselves very far off, since they so boldly despised his law
and all the prophecies. As to the splendor, God&#8217;s majesty and
incomprehensible glory is signified. For if brightness blinds our eyes, what
would happen if we endeavor to penetrate to that immense light of which the sun
is only a little spark? Since, therefore, Ezekiel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was the likeness of
splendor above his loins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he doubtless
shows how formidable the majesty of God ought to be to us. For God dwells in
light, but inaccessible, as the Apostle says:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but
below</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was the appearance of
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, because he must not. wait
till the Jews received any joy from the presence of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16.) We know, indeed, that hypocrites always boast rashly in the name
of God, as Amos reproves them, What is to you the day of the Lord? it is a day
of darkness and not light.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:18.) For they boast that God would be entreated in their miseries, and that he
must assist them, because he had taken them under his protection. The Prophet
refutes this arrogance, and says, that the day of the Lord would be darkness. So
also in this place, God appeared in the form of fire towards the earth, that the
Jews should tremble when they saw the vengeance of God lighted up to consume
them. Therefore in the splendor God&#8217;s majesty was shown, which humbled the
Prophet and all the pious, that they should receive the vision reverently; for
in the fire God&#8217;s vengeance was shown, lest the Jews should make for
themselves too wide a shield of the name of God, which they extended falsely and
fallaciously.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here relates that he was carried to
Jerusalem that he might behold the foul superstitions by which the Jews had
defiled the temple. But first he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the form of a hand was put
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whence again we collect that the
body was not solid or substantial which the Prophet had seen; but was only a
visible figure as a symbol of God&#8217;s presence. This explains the word
likeness or figure, for it was not a real hand which seized the Prophet by the
locks or hair of the head, but it was the likeness of a hand, and therefore he
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, in the visions of God it
was done</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. He </i>says indeed that he was
carried up between heaven and earth, but let no one imagine that this was really
done, for he explains himself and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the visions of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>visions of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he understands a revelation free
from all doubt: for there is a silent opposition between these divine
revelations and the spectres which often deceive men&#8217;s senses. Those who
interpret &#8220;visions of God&#8221; simply as prophecy weaken what the
Prophet wished to express emphatically; and those who think God&#8217;s name
used here as an epithet, (as the Hebrews call anything remarkable, divine,) also
depart from the genuine sense of the Prophet. There is no doubt, therefore, that
he opposes the visions of God to all spectres: for Satan as we know deludes
men&#8217;s senses with his prodigies and his wonderful arts of fascination: for
it happens that the children of God are sometimes deluded: hence the Prophet, to
take away all doubt from his teaching, says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was carried to Jerusalem
in visions of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was carried to the
northern gate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know that there were
many gates of the large area, so that the people&#8217;s entrance should be more
commodious. For if there had been only one gate open, they would have been more
tumultuous, as a multitude usually is. The area of the temple then had an
eastern and a northern gate: then it had other gates, which gave an easy
entrance to the people as well as to the priests. The priests indeed had an
inner area which was distinct, but when they offered victims on the altar, they
mingled with the people. This therefore was the reason why the floor of the
temple had different gates. Now the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was carried to the porch
of the gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that he did not
penetrate directly into the secret part of the temple, but seemed to himself to
be standing before the doors, till God informed him of what was doing within. He
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was the seat of the
idol.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know not what the idol was,
except that the Prophet says it was abominable. He first calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the idol of
jealousy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then adds the participle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>provoking God to
jealousy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But although the noun as well
as the verb is often taken in a bad sense, yet God transfers the affection of
jealousy to himself, and in this sense he says in Deuteronomy,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They<i>
</i>provoked me: they made me jealous with what is not God: therefore will I
make them jealous,&#8221;

32:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He alludes to the jealousy of husband and wife, for
if the woman prostitutes herself, the husband burns with indignation, and that
outbreak of his anger is most flagrant, So also when the wife in her turn knows
that her husband is an adulterer, she is carried away with intemperance and
excess. Hence God, when he shows how he esteems his glory and worship, compares
himself to a jealous man, when we turn aside to idolatrous and adulterous
worship. In this sense the idol which was in the porch or entrance of the temple
is called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the idol of jealousy,
and the idol which causes jealousy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Although we may also translate, it was the seat of the idol causing
jealousy, since the noun,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hanq</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

jealousy, because the Jews by erecting this idol trod under foot their God, or
at least endeavored to prostrate his glory. Now it follows

Prophet, namely, the idol erected at the entrance of the area near the altar. It
may happen that the worship of God is but slightly vitiated, so that the
corruption is scarcely apparent. But while the Prophet repeats that the idol was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that of
jealousy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>lie points out the gross and
shameful disgrace of that spectacle, so that they could not gloss over their
impiety by any pretense, after they had so openly and confessedly revolted from
the law of God. But when </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is
ordered to raise his eyes to the way of the
north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this also avails for the
confirmation of his teaching. For if the Prophet had turned his eyes that way of
his own accord, his looking that way would have been of less moment, but when
God directs his eyes by express command, the reproach which afterwards follows
has more weight. This, therefore, is the reason why the Prophet did not cast his
eyes of his own accord towards the idol, as he might have done, but was
admonished by God to do so. Meanwhile it appears with what docility he obeyed
God&#8217;s commands. He puts these two things together,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was ordered to raise his
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he immediately did

the crime. If the idol had been erected in any remote corner it would have been
an intolerable sacrilege, though the modesty of the Jews had been greater: but
when they erected the idol before the altar they flew as it were in the very
face of God. If an immodest woman runs after an adulterer, her husband is justly
enraged; but if she brings him before her husband, and wantons with him before
his eyes, and prostitutes herself to all crimes, then certainly such wanton lust
cannot be endured. But such was the audacity of the people, that when the idol
was erected before the gate of the altar it seemed like wishing to dethrone the
Almighty, and to contaminate his altar by the sight of the idol. It follows

the chapter we shall see how severe a vengeance God was about to take on the
people. Hence the Prophet prevents those obstreperous reproaches with which the
people loaded him through envy, when he chastised them according to their
deserts. Hence he doubtless wished the exiles to be persuaded of what they could
scarcely conceive, namely, that the destruction of Jerusalem was near. For we
have said that those who had been drawn into captivity had displeased him, and
wished to return to their country. Since therefore their condition was too
grievous and severe, for this reason God wished to testify to them that the last
overthrow of Jerusalem was at hand. He does this while he shows the great
abominations which reigned in the very temple, whence the Almighty must of
necessity appear as the avenger of his glory and worship. The rest

TWENTY-SECOND.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE stopped yesterday at that. clause when God asks
his Prophet, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whether he saw the
abominations which the sons of were
perpetrating</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the very temple: by
which words he not only cites his servant as a witness, but constitutes him in
some sense a judge, so that all should know that the coating vengeance was not
only just but must be immediate. This is the reason why God asks,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whether he saw the
abominations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For if a mortal is
compelled to pass an opinion, surely God, who sees much further than the eyes of
man, cannot be ignorant of their crimes, when they had come to such a pitch of
obstinacy that his patience could no longer hold out. Now the adverb of place is
used, which seems to be put emphatically, because he refers to the temple, from
which all filth and defilements ought to be removed. Since therefore God
complains that abominations were perpetrated there, he magnifies the
people&#8217;s wickedness, because even the temple did not remain pure. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
retreating</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>some refer this to the
people and elicit this sense, that those who so pervert God&#8217;s worship
recede from his sanctuary, because they have no longer anything in common with
God. But I rather interpret it concerning God himself, who is compelled to
depart from his sanctuary, as we shall afterwards see. For while they so defiled
the temple with their sacrilege, they yet thought God included therein. He now
renounces the temple, and says, that he left the place empty and void, because
he could not bear to dwell among that sordid defilement. The meaning is, that
God would depart from his temple, because the complete worship which he had
commanded under the law did not flourish there. And this place is worthy of
notice, because we gather from it that God could not bear the profanation of his
worship, but will leave those who pervert his law by their fictions, as we see
the Jews did. At this day we know how haughtily the Papists pride themselves in
their figments, but the more they heap together fictitious ceremonies the more
they provoke God&#8217;s anger. Hence it happens that they vainly boast that
they have him in their temples, as they think. For this sentiment will ever
remain fixed, that God cannot dwell in a profane place. Now nothing sanctifies a
place more than obedience and sincerity of faith. When men introduce their
inventions, it immediately causes God to depart from them: this is the full
meaning. Now he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn
thyself, and thou shalt see great
abominations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some translate greater,
but because a question would arise, why he calls the abomination first greater
and then different, I interpret it simply that the Prophet should see other
great abominations. Afterwards indeed he will express another, for he will say
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twb[wthlam
twldg</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>gedloth-maleh-thogn-both, </i>but in my

<i>maleh, </i>I simply interpret <i>&#8220;beyond </i>others,&#8221; and I
rather approve of this simplicity, because interpreters anxiously labor to show
this last abomination heavier than all others, though the reason for it does not
clearly appear. But there is no need of our making these difficulties, because
the Prophet only speaks of great abominations. Let us go on

<div><font face="Palatino">Here now the Prophet is brought to another place,
where another kind of abomination is shown. If an idol had been erected in some
<i>recess </i>of the temple only, even that impiety when joined with sacrilege
could not have been borne. But when all parts of the temple were contaminated
with such filth, hence we collect that the people was utterly desperate. For the
Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was led
into a more secret place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and since
there was a hole there, he dug it by God&#8217;s command, so that it became a
door by which he could enter. This only ought to be understood of a vision. For
the Prophet had brought nothing with him with which he could so dig a wall, but
when he could only behold that hidden abomination through a chink, God opened
the wall. But the Prophet seems to himself to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a door of entrance by his own hand. But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there were painted birds,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an abomination and all the idols
of the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see that
there was not only one idol, but a great number. And in truth as soon as the
true worship of God is <i>neglected, </i>men place no bounds to themselves: they
are not content with one or two errors, but they heap to themselves numberless
delusions. So the children of Israel fell away from one idol to a great
multitude. Meanwhile it must be remarked, that the idol which he has mentioned
was detestable beyond all others. For it was not called a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>provocative of
jealousy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>without reason, since it
inflamed God to jealousy. It is therefore probable that this idol was more noble
than others, and held in greater price and veneration, since the unbelievers had
greater and lesser deities. But now the Prophet refers to common idols, of which
there was a great abundance, but not such great honor. For he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that part of the temple was full
of pictures all around</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is indeed
certain, that the use of painting was always plentiful, but God wished his
temple to be pure from images, lest men, being taken with such enticements,
should turn aside directly to superstition. For if we see a man or an animal
painted in a profane place, a religious feeling does not creep into our minds:
for all acknowledge it as a painting: nay idols themselves as long as they are
in taverns or workshops, are not worshipped. If the painter&#8217;s workshop is
full of pictures, all <i>pass </i>them by, and if they are delighted with the
view of them they do not show any sign of reverence to the paintings. But as
soon as the picture is carried to another place, its sacredness blinds men and
so stupifies them, that they do not remember that they had already seen that
picture in a profane dwelling. This therefore is the reason why God did not
admit any pictures into his temple, and surely when the place is consecrated, it
must happen that the painting will astonish men just as if some secret divinity
belonged to it. Although the Prophet here does not say simply that the walls
were full of pictures, yet he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that an abomination and the idols
of the house of Israel were there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We
see therefore not only that the walls were so decorated for the sake of
ornament, but because the people desired to celebrate all the deities whose
names it knew to be famous among the profane nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the Prophet&#8217;s being ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to dig through the
wall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we gather from this that
superstitions are sometimes so hidden in secret places, that they escape our
eyes even while we look at them. For such is the weakness of the human mind,
that it does not easily perceive how abominable it is to vitiate the worship of
God. Thus the Prophet only looked through a chink, so that he could not form a
correct judgment concerning those pollutions; hence he is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to dig through the
wall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>just as if God assured him that a
thin and obscure view was not sufficient, but that a door must be opened by
which he should look in and thoroughly consider what would otherwise be
concealed beneath those coverings. Now he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he entered and saw the
likeness of everything,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and we must
remember what I have lately touched upon, that the Jews are here condemned for
heaping to themselves a multitude of gods: for it was very disgraceful to
worship reptiles and brutes. The worship of a human figure has a specious
pretext, for the Greeks, who always seemed to themselves wise above others, and
thought the rest of the world barbarians, were deceived in idols referring to
the human figure, but it was too base and gross for them to worship an ox, a
dog, or an ass, as a god. We see therefore how basely the Jews were blinded who
mingled brutes and reptiles for gods. But it is no wonder that they were so
deluded, because Egypt was near, where we know that dogs and oxen, and even
cats, were considered deities: nay they worshipped all kinds of herbs. Since
therefore the Egyptians imagined that the deity resided in reptiles and unclean
animals, as well as in herbs, it is no wonder that the Jews were drawn into
these delusions through neighborhood. But since heavenly teaching had shown them
the way, such blindness was inexcusable, because <i>they </i>could not err so
basely without suffocating and so extinguishing the light which had been set
before their eyes. But we see how men&#8217;s audacity breaks forth, when they
do not restrain themselves within obedience to God&#8217;s teaching. He says
that pictures </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were painted all
round</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on the wall, which again confirms
our observation, that the Jews were inflamed with such desires that they left no
space empty, because they wished their eyes to fall upon those figures, which
more and more inflamed their superstition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that seventy elders of the house
of Israel made incense for their idols</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>I do not think that the seventy who were chosen for ruling the people are
referred to here, though I suppose the Prophet to allude to this number. For we
know that from the beginning seventy were set over the people, and were chosen
from each tribe, and were united together. But with regard to this place, I
think the number seventy is used of those whom, although they were not prefects,
they called seniors in respect to their office, not through their age only.
Meanwhile we must remember that the Prophet looks to that order, because from
the beginning God had wished the seventy to bear rule and hold the government.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
11:16.) Thus the Prophet signifies that the leaders of the people, who ought to
rule others by their counsel, were remarkable for corrupting the worship of God.
He puts </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jezaniah, the son of
Saphah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who was probably a man of great
repute. Since therefore he excelled in the reputation for prudence and piety,
the Prophet wished to exaggerate his crime, because he also, among others,
offered incense to idols. What then could remain pure among the people, when he
who was esteemed a holy man, so profaned himself among the rest! Hence we see
that the Prophet means, that the whole people, from the least to the greatest,
was so corrupt, that those who were superior to the rest prostituted themselves
to idolatry. He says, then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
he stood before them, and each had a censer in his
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Incense was the sign of the
greatest veneration, and even this was retained for common use. Hence at the
outset of Christianity, when the impious wished to seduce the Christians to
idolatry, they only gave two or three grains of
frankincense:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f181</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that was a sign of apostasy: they did
not order them to bend the knee before idols, nor to offer sacrifices, but only
to smell to a few grains of incense. In sign, therefore, of veneration, the
seventy men are said to bear censers or incense dishes. The Prophet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the incense ascended in a
thick cloud.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here understand the
particle of likeness. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The incense
ascended as a thick cloud.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do<i>
</i>not doubt that they were profuse, or rather prodigal, in their madness, so
as to spare no expense: since idolaters rashly squander all things, when the
<i>intemperance </i>of their zeal seizes upon them. And this was not considered
with sufficient prudence. The Prophet therefore says that it was not common
incense, but was dense like a cloud, since they threw it forth in great
abundance, so that the offering might be fatter and richer: just as if he had
said, that they were so intemperate in their superstitions, that they threw away
an abundance of incense, and had all their expense for nothing, and only to
satisfy their idols. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

their ingratitude, because they so drive others with them into alliance with
their impiety. For elders ought to show the way to others. Since, therefore, the
profanation of the worship of God took its origin from them, hence their
disgrace is increased, and they were worthy of greater reproach.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seest
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what they do in
darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>From this word I gather that
the place was remote from public observation; for there were near the floor of
the Temple many cells and many chambers, as we see in Jeremiah.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
20:2;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;110605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 6:5.) Since, then, the ciders had their apartments there, it is not
surprising that a place was shown to the Prophet which they had so stained with
their paintings. But he says that they did it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because they kept secret their
sacred rites; as also there were mysteries among profane nations, which were not
open to any but the initiated. Since therefore the multitude was not thought
worthy of those mysteries, it is therefore probable that the place among the
Jews of which the Prophet speaks was like a small chapel, which the elders, and
those who had authority among the people, retained to themselves. he
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> each within the
recesses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some translate &#8212; in the
chambers of their painting; but I take the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
meshkith, </i>for imagination, as it is also taken in other places. It properly
signifies painting, but it is also transferred to the thoughts of men. Therefore
when he speaks of recesses or hidden places, I do not understand chambers,
though I do not deny that he alludes to those recesses by which men separate
themselves from the multitude, by way of honor. In the meantime he equally
reproves those tortuous and perverse counsels which the ciders of the people
inwardly cherished. For those who think themselves wiser than the vulgar, have
some hidden pride, and swell with concealed haughtiness; and therefore they are
said by Isaiah to dig for themselves hiding-places to escape from God, while
they seem to themselves cunning.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, therefore, we see in what sense the Prophet
mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hiding-places of their
imagination</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, because they reckon
such pictures the mark of the greatest and rarest prudence. This was again
prodigious, that the elders so gave themselves up to foul defilements. For among
profane nations no religion held the leaders and heads of the people. We shall
not find, either among the Greeks or the Latins, any of the higher classes, and
of the chief governors, involved in the errors of the common people, but they
pretended religion, that they might hold others in obedience. They instituted,
indeed, great pomp; they pretended no small degree of reverence; but when they
passed their time as friends at home, they laughed at all these trifles. Since,
therefore, all the ceremonies of the Gentiles were a laughing-stock to sensible
men, this was indeed a detestable prodigy
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the elders of the people of
Israel, in a secret place, in the very recesses of their thoughts, fabricated
idols for themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. Now </i>the cause is
expressed why they heaped to themselves that multitude of gods, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they thought that God no
longer regarded them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage is
badly explained when interpreters think that the elders were epicureans, who
dreamt that God <i>enjoyed </i>case and indulgence in heaven. They bring forward
other passages, which seem similar but in words only, as where, in the book of
Job, the impiety of the multitude is described, he says they think that God
walks upon the hinges of heaven.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;182214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
22:14.) But the Prophet speaks more within bounds. Hence those who take this
passage generally, extenuate the force of the doctrine which ought to be
elicited from these words. Why, then, had the Jews fabricated so many idols for
themselves? because they thought that God no longer regarded them, as I have
already explained it; and this was the sign of their gross depravity; for God
had chastised them in various ways: they ought to have returned into the way,
yet they were so far from repenting, that they rather champed the bit, and thus
persuaded themselves to seek other deities. And this impiety has occurred in all
ages. At this time it clearly appears in the Papacy; nay, even the blind may
even feel it with their hands. For when God afflicts these wretched ones, at
first they suppliantly ask pardon; but. when he presses upon them more severely,
then they begin to rage and look hither and thither, and have a common proverb
&#8212; &#8220;I know not to what saint I ought to pay my vows.&#8221; Boys
learn this proverb in the Papacy, and old men always have it on their lips in
perplexity. Hence Ezekiel reproves this fault, when he gives this as a reason
for the aged heaping up this multitude of deities &#8212; that they thought
themselves overlooked by God &#8212;<i> Jehovah, </i>they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>does not see us
here</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>they do not speak simply of
God&#8217;s providence, but indignantly complain of his disregard, because he
did not relieve their miseries, and had deserted the land, as they afterwards
explain themselves; for they immediately assert that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God had deserted the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see, therefore, that they did
not speak simply against God&#8217;s providence, as if he despised human things,
but that they were inflamed with fury, because God&#8217;s hand pressed them
heavily, and they did not feel any help in him. Hence they descended to brutes,
reptiles, various painting&#8217;s, and all kinds of abomination, because they
thought that they were worshipping in vain the one true God. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He now mentions the third kind of idolatry by which
the Jews polluted the temple; for this was a kind of sin peculiar to females;
and we know that they were always more addicted to such wickedness. Satan,
indeed, fascinates men always more than enough, but in women recklessness
reigned more than superstition. They had therefore a female worship in bewailing
Thammuz. Who Thammuz was is uncertain. Jerome translates it Adonis, and Adonis
was beloved by Venus, as the poets trifle; and when torn to pieces by a boar, he
was turned into a flower of sweetest odor; and in honor of Venus women yearly
solemnized by lamentations the death of that beautiful youth; but it is not
probable that this rite prevailed in Judaea, because we do not read that this
lamentation was practiced in the neighboring regions, but in Greece and Asia
Minor I refer it rather to Osiris, for, as we said before, the Jews were
neighbors to the Egyptians &#8212; hence they adopted various rites from them;
but we know that Osiris was yearly wept for by the Egyptians, and that great
pollution occurred; for they carried the virile member on a pole in procession,
and called it Phallus;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

idol, as if offering themselves to debauchery. This was a most disgraceful
spectacle. But I conjecture that the Jews had adopted this rite when the women
bewailed Thammuz. Here also we perceive, that when once Satan has prevailed, and
cast men into deep depravity, they despise all moderation, nay, are <i>reduced
</i>to more than brutal stupor. Who would think this could occur, that women
should be reduced to such a pitch of defilement, when they had been taught in
the doctrine of the law from their early childhood. But when God&#8217;s temple
was open to such pollutions, we see the Jews so blinded by madness, that God

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet refers to another profanation of the

therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he saw about five

there were as many as this among the first rank of citizens. But a certain
number is put for an uncertain, and I think that the Prophet. was not so
scrupulous on this point, or rather the Spirit of God, who showed that number in
the vision; whatever it was, they not only worshipped the sun in private houses,
but in the temple itself, and that not without gross and pointed contempt of
God. For when they turned their back upon the sanctuary, they made a
laughing-stock of God. It hence appears, that they were of so daring a front,
that they openly boasted in their superstitions, and purposely polluted
God&#8217;s temple. This, indeed, was monstrous, to see the elders of the city,
and those practiced in the teaching and worship of the law, so alienated from
all piety as to worship the sun. For this could not happen through either error
or ignorance. For God in his law when he forbids the worship of the sun and
stars, adds as a reason, that the whole celestial host was created for our use.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:3.) Since, therefore, the sun is our servant and the moon our handmaid, and
the stars also were created to serve us, it is preposterous to depart from the
divinely ordained order, that the sun which was given us to spend his time in
our service should be to us a god. Since, therefore, God has borne witness to
this in his law, there was no excuse for error when the Jews adored towards the
east.</font><br></div>

have said, pollute themselves at home and in conceal-merit with such
defilements. But while they came of their own accord into the temple, it is just
as if they provoked God by open daring, Now, when they turn their back, this is
not only a foul denial but a contempt of God, as if they had said, that he was
unworthy of their respect. Now, therefore, we see the whole force of the
passage. But he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn yet

abominations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>some translate greater, as
I have formerly mentioned, but I do not think it suitable. I do not contend for
it, but if a reason is asked why this abomination is greater than others, it is
not clear to me; hence I prefer to take it more simply in the positive degree.
Nor is it an objection to this that

impiety to break into the holy place, and from thence to despise God. Now we
know this to be a sign of lawful adoration, when the faithful turned their eyes

upon it, there is no doubt that they professedly wished to boast in a contempt
of God and the law. It already appears, that they had adopted various and
numberless forms of superstition. In Egypt they had not seen the worship of the
sun, nor do we read that such worship was in use in Chaldea; but because they
heard that the Persians and other Orientals worshipped the sun as a god, they
imitated their custom. Therefore we see, that from these people they heaped up
rites for themselves, so as to make an immense assemblage. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">God complains as formerly of the wickedness of the
people, especially of their perfidious and wicked revolt, because they so
defiled the temple which ought to be sacred to God alone. He adds besides
another complaint, that they were not content in their wickedness, which tended
to violate human society and common rights, and the pursuit of mutual equity,
unless even religion should be weakened by them. For under the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">smj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chemes, </i>is comprehended whatever is contrary to the second table of the law.
There is, therefore, a use of the figure a part for the whole, in this word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">smj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chemes, </i>violence, as if he had said, they were addicted to frauds,
rapine, slaughter, cruelty, perjuries, spoliations. Since, therefore, they
abstained from no injustice, says God, they manifestly provoke me also: as if he
had said, after being unjust towards men, they now dare to erect their horns
against me. We know that God&#8217;s law was comprehended in the two tables. As
to the former table, it prescribes what the true and pure worship of God is. The
Jews had violated the second table, since they neglected all the duties of
charity, and neither equity nor uprightness flourished among them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After they had filled the land
with iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>this was their
intolerable ungodliness, that after despising men they attacked God himself. We
see now the reason of the context,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is this a light
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>says he. Thereafter he had spoken
of the wickedness simply and by itself, as they say, he now amplifies by
comparison when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
this they had filled the earth with violence, but now they have turned
themselves to provoke me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; behold
these, </i>he says, etc. The adverb of place must be noticed here, as I have
before advised. For their impiety is the more detestable, since they broke into
the temple to defile themselves with their idols. That place at least ought to
remain pure and unpolluted, though the whole land had been infected with many
defilements; but when not even the temple is spared, this is a sign of desperate
and almost furious audacity. He, therefore, repeats the adverb which he had used
before, and in the same sense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the latter part of the verse, some, as I have
said, take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwmzh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hez-moreh, </i>for foulness: I know not why, for I am not aware that this
noun is used elsewhere in this sense. But because nothing better occurred to
them, they think it probable, and some have invented a foolish fable that they
broke wind in honor of the sun, as if the noise of the belly was a grateful
offering to the idol, since by this means they openly despised God. But these
are conjectures. Others think more correctly who suppose this to be used
metaphorically: for they were accustomed to burn incense to their idols; and so,
according to them, God alludes to a pleasing and sweet odor when he names it a
foul smell, as if he had said, even if the Jews pleased themselves in their
superstitions, yet the incense sent forth a foetid odor and they should perceive
it: for if he speaks of the nostrils it ought to be considered as a punishment.
Some suppose that the relative of the third person is put for that of the first,
as if God would say, to my nose or to my wrath: and they fabricate an insipid
comment, that this place was changed by the Rabbins through reverence for God,
as if forsooth there were not numberless passages where God pronounces in
clearer words that he was disgracefully despised. But first, because this noun
properly signifies a branch, and is taken in that sense in many places; then
since the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">pa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aph, </i>may be explained as well passively as actively, the context will
flow best if we say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they put
forth a branch to their wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;
</i>that is, to their destruction, because they provoked God. For what is the
meaning of putting forth a branch, but that they heaped evil upon evil. They had
violated, as I have said, the second table of the law, they were thieves,
robbers, perjurers, and violent. Now at length their rage was directed against
the former table of the law, so as to overthrow the whole worship of God. So
therefore it will make good sense to say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that boughs were put
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#183; </i>for the singular number is
taken for the plural, as often happens. Since, therefore, they so put forth
boughs or budded, God says, that this should be for their destruction,
<i>because </i>at length when he had spared them a long time, after a fit time
for their punishment arrived, he would consume them. Now, therefore, we
understand what the Prophet means. But if any other conjecture pleases, every
one may form his own opinion; I do not contest the point, but I show what I
think most probable. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<i>m</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>e, at length I will
act</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he. There is a tacit contrast,
since God forsooth had ceased for a long time, because there is a certain form
of rest when he ceases from his judgments: God seems to rest when he does not
<i>take vengeance </i>on man&#8217;s wickedness, when he indulges them and
passes them by for a time. Since, therefore, he had so suspended his judgments
against the Jews, he seemed to cultivate ease in heaven: with this view he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would do it in his
anger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he adds, that his vengeance
would be so dreadful that there would be no place for pity. This ought indeed to
strike us when God pronounces himself implacable. For what is more formidable
than to have God hostile, and to be verily without any hope of pardon? As often
as God withdraws his mercy he shows us material for trembling, nor is it
wonderful that he threatened the Jews so harshly, because he had proved by all
methods that they were desperate in their wickedness. For truly nothing had been
omitted towards curing them, unless they had been of an abandoned disposition
and of most obstinate manners. Since, therefore, they were such, it is not
surprising that God was extremely enraged against them, so that he left them no
hope of pardon. But this ought to be referred generally to the whole body of the
people: meanwhile it is by no means doubtful, as we shall afterwards see, that
God excepts his elect from the ordinary multitude. If any one object, that God
always hears prayers, I reply that he never rejects prayers which spring from
faith: but here that tumultuous clamor is alluded to which necessity occasions
to unbelievers. For although they fly to God as their natural sense impels them,
yet they do not this with composed minds, nor even relying upon the promises of
God: but because the torture of their minds does not suffer them to rest, so
that by a natural impulse they are carried to God and cry to him without any
faith or sincere affection. He speaks, therefore, concerning that kind of
ejaculation which is described to us in the case of Esau, and hence he says with
<i>a loud voice,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012734&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

even cry out loudly, as David testifies of himself, yet it is <i>peculiar </i>to
the incredulous to utter their clamor with full cheeks though the mind is void
of faith, and is even obstinate in its wickedness. Hence they do not open the
heart when they thus cry to God. Hence it is not wonderful if God rejects them
and is deaf to their complaints. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet writes that God&#8217;s command was
not vain or empty, because the effect appears directly by vision. Therefore six
men offered themselves. Why again he names six, rather than more or fewer, I
have not found out. For some cite the thirty-ninth chapter of Jeremiah, where
eight leaders are referred to who were in Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s army, and had
the chief authority; but first they vary in number, then they twist themselves
in many ways. But I am not so anxiously curious, nor does it seem to me of any
consequence, unless perhaps God wished to show his servant that a little band
was sufficient, and that there was no need of a large army: or by six men he
confusedly designated the whole army. It is certain indeed that Nebuchadnezzar
came surrounded with a large force to destroy the city; but in the meantime God
wished to destroy that pride and contumacy of the people, since he only shows to
his servant six men who could destroy the whole city. He says therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he came by the
gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, or
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by way of a lofty
gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or higher one, which was towards
the north, because Babylon lay towards that region with respect to Jerusalem. It
appears therefore that the Chaldeans were here pointed out, to whom the way was
direct through that gate, since it ascended from the north over against
Jerusalem. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>each man had
an instrument of destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or of
pounding. This word is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;pn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nephetz, </i>which is to destroy and rub to pieces: therefore it can be taken
as well for the mallet as for the act itself. There is no doubt that the Prophet
meant that God&#8217;s command should not be without immediate effect: because
as soon as he cried out, six men were directly at hand for obeying him, which he
afterwards expresses more clearly when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they stood near the
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For it was a sign of their
readiness to obey God&#8217;s commands when they placed themselves before the
altar. But this passage is worthy of notice, because it shows us how anxiously
we ought to give heed to God&#8217;s threats, which are for the most part
<i>directed </i>against us. In order that we may learn to rouse ourselves from
our torpor, here as in a glass the conjunction of God&#8217;s vengeance with his
threats is proposed to us. For as soon as he had spoken, we see that there were
six men armed and drawn up for destroying the city. But God wished to show his
Prophet this vision, because his business was with a hard and stupid people, as
we have already seen. God&#8217;s voice was as it were their final doom: just as
if a trumpet resounded, and announced that there was no hope of pardon unless
the enemy gave himself up directly. So therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God exclaimed with a loud
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but this was no empty cause of
fright, because he directly joined the execution of it, when six men appeared
before the altar. But he calls <i>the altar </i>which Solomon had built of
square stones <i>brazen: </i>even the brazen altar was not sufficient, but it
looks to its first origin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says that there was among them, <i>one man
clothed with a linen garment.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;110864&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 8:64.) He is not placed among the multitude, as one among the others, but
he is separated, because his signification is distinct. This <i>man </i>then
doubtless sustained the character of an angel, and it is sufficiently customary
in Scripture that angels, when they take a visible form, should be called men:
not because they are really men, but because God endues them with such forms as
he sees fit. Some, whose opinion I do not altogether reject, restrict this to
Christ. But because the Prophet adds no remarkable traits, I had rather receive
it generally of any angel. He says therefore, that there was among the
Chaldeans, who were prepared to execute God&#8217;s vengeance,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one man clad in a linen
garment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>A distinct mark is sometimes
given to angels which separates them from men. The linen garment was then a
remarkable ornament. And the sacrificing Papists, as if they were apes, have
imitated that custom in their garments called surplices. But since priests were
accustomed to be clad in linen robes, here the angel was represented to the
Prophet in this garb. Now let us go on, because in the next verse it will be
evident why mention was made of that angel.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet shows why the angel was added to the
Chaldeans, namely, to put a bridle on them, lest they should rage promiscuously
and without selection against the elect and the reprobate. This is a remarkable
passage, because from it we learn, first, that God effectually threatens the
impious, so that he may have attendants always at hand to obey him; then, that
even unbelievers make war under the direction of God, and are governed by his
rod, and do nothing except at his will. Nor are the Chaldeans said to have come
to the temple in vain, and to have placed themselves before the altar of God.
This is not related to their praise, as if they obeyed God spontaneously, or as
if they had purposed to themselves to carry out his commands, but the secret
providence of God is here treated. Although, therefore, the Chaldeans gave the
rein to their self-will, and did not think themselves divinely governed; yet God
here pronounces that they were under his hand just as if God had them as hired
soldiers: as Satan is said to have joined himself to the sons of God: this was
not a voluntary obedience, but because his machinations could not attack the
holy Job, unless by God&#8217;s command.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
1:6.) God&#8217;s sons appear in a very different way, since they offer a free
obedience, and desire him only to reign. But how great soever is the difference
between the sons of God and Satan, and all the reprobate, yet it is equally true
that Satan and the wicked obey God. This, therefore, we must learn in the second
place. But, thirdly, we are taught that God never rashly executes his vengeance
without sparing his elect. For this reason in the slaughter of Jerusalem he has
an angel, who opposes a shield, as it were, to the Chaldeans, lest their cruelty
should injure them beyond God&#8217;s pleasure, as we shall by and bye see.
Therefore I said that the place was remarkable, because when God puts forth the
signs of his wrath, the sky is, as it were, overclouded, and the faithful no
less than the unbelieving are frightened, nay terrified with fear. For as to
outward condition, there was no difference between them. Because therefore the
sons of God are subject to that terror which obscures all sense of God&#8217;s
favor in adversity, so this doctrine must be held diligently, namely, when God
gives the rein to furious men, so that they dissipate, overthrow, and destroy
all things, then the angels are always united, who restrain their intemperance
with a hidden bridle, since otherwise they would never be
moderate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the glory of the God of
Israel ascended from the cherub to the
threshold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He takes the glory of God for
God himself, as we may readily collect from the next verse; for he says that
Jehovah had spoken. But this speech agrees very well, because God cannot be
comprehended by us, unless as far as he accommodates himself to our standard.
Because therefore God is incomprehensible in himself, nor did he appear to his
Prophet as he really is, (since not angels even bear the immense magnitude of
his glory, much less a mortal man,) but he knew how far it was expedient to
discover himself, therefore the Prophet here takes his glory for himself; that
is, the vision, which was a sign or symbol of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of God. But he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that it
ascended from the cherub</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here also is a
change of number, because God is said everywhere to sit between the cherubim.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;100602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 6:2;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;121915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:15;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:16.) But here only one cherub is put, but this figure of speech is well
understood, as it is so common, for God resided between the cherubim: it is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he went thence to the
threshold of the temple</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was a
prelude to departure, as we shall afterwards see. And this testimony was needful
to the Jews, because they thought that God was bounded by the visible temple.
Hence the Prophet shows that God was not fixed to a place, so as to be compelled
to remain there. This is the reason why it is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he came from his seat to the
threshold of the temple</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he cried out to the man clad
in the linen garment, and whose inkhorn was by his
sid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>e, </i>though others translate it
writing-tablets: but as he afterwards says, <i>write on their foreheads, </i>it
is very probable that the ink was in his girdle, that he might mark the elect of
God, that the Chaldeans should not touch them. Again he calls the angel a man,
but on account of the form which he put on, as I said before. I cannot proceed
further.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE<i>
</i>TWENTY-FOURTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began to explain the precept given to the angel
before God sent forth the Chaldeans to cut off the city, and destroy the people.
The angel is at length commanded to sign the foreheads of all the pious. But
many take the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tho, </i>which means the same as a mark, for the last letter of the alphabet,
and yet there is no reason to compel them to do so.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wt</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
tho, </i>is a Hebrew mark. It is puerile to invent that subtle comment, that the
foreheads of the pious were signed with that letter, because the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thoreh, </i>which signifies the doctrine of the law, begins with the same
letter. Jerome brings forward another figment: he says that in his time, among
the Samaritans, the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t</font><font face="Palatino">
was like a cross, with which the Christians used then to sign themselves. But
all see how nugatory this is. Although it was not the figure which is now in use
among the Papists, but was the mark which the brothers Antonii used: but I omit
that as unworthy of mention. If puzzles please you, it would be a better reason
why the faithful were marked with the last letter, because they were last among
men, and as it were the offscouring of the world. Since therefore from the
beginning, the world has treated the sons of God as if they were castaways,
therefore I have said that they may be signed with the last letter: but we may
be content with the simple and genuine sense of the Prophet: therefore God
orders their foreheads to be signed. We yesterday explained the cause, and said
that a most useful doctrine could be collected from this place, namely, when all
things seem mingled on the earth, and turned upwards and downwards, yet that God
never casts away the care of his own, but protects them from all harm. God
therefore always restrains his judgments, so that he really proves that the
safety of his people is dear and precious to himself. We gather also that angels
are ministers of this grace, because they watch over the safety of the faithful,
as Scripture everywhere testifies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
91:11, 12, and elsewhere often.) Now, if any one asks what this sign was? it
must be simply answered, that this vision was presented to the Prophet for the
common perception of all; for if we wish to single out a few in a crowd, we need
some sign. God therefore here borrows what we read concerning a sign from the
customs of men: for the faithful could not otherwise understand that they were
beyond the reach of weapons, when mixed with the unbelieving. Because therefore
it seems the common condition of all, they might be frightened just as if God
should raise his hand to chastise their sins. Therefore he says here, that they
were signed in some way. It is true then that we daily bear a sign by which God
distinguishes us from the reprobate. For the blood of Christ reconciles us to
the Father, as is sufficiently known; but perhaps that also may be too
far-fetched. It is also true that when God struck the land of Egypt, the
Israelites were passed over by the angel, since the blood of a lamb was
sprinkled on the door-posts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:22, 23.) Every house which had the mark of blood was secure and safe, when
God&#8217;s vengeance was inflicted upon all the Egyptians. But as to this
passage, I interpret it thus: when God gives liberty to unbelievers, so float
they seem to be able to overturn the whole world, the angels are at the same
time sent forth, who hinder their lust that they should not touch the sons of
God. This then is sufficient for us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet adorns the faithful with various
titles, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon the
foreheads of men who groan and cry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>There is a great likeness between these two words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;na</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anek, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aneh; </i>but one is written by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;</font><font face="Palatino">
final, and the other by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">.
He says then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the faithful
groan over the abominations:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they cry
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for thus they translate the latter
clause, although it may also be taken for bewailing, if we only understand
outward sorrow, and that which openly appears. Hence we gather how God receives
us under his guardianship, and sends us his angels as protectors, so that if
mixed with the impious, we may yet keep ourselves undefiled by their pollutions,
and then when we cannot correct their wickedness, yet we bear testimony by grief
and sorrow that they displease us. When the Apostle commends to us the patience
of Lot, he says, that he tormented his heart while he dwelt in Sodom. A single
stranger could not recall those abandoned ones to a sound mind, who had given
themselves over to all wickedness.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;610207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 2:7.) But he did not grow hardened to the foulness of so much sin, but
continually groaned before God, and Was in perpetual grief. The Prophet now
bears the same witness <i>concerning </i>other believers. Whatever it is, God
here shows what he wishes his sons to be. Therefore if we allow ourselves to
approve the sins of the impious, and take pleasure in them and applaud them, we
boast ourselves in vain to be God&#8217;s sons, because he does not reckon any
among his own who do not groan at abominations. And truly this is the sign of
too much sloth, when we see the sacred name of God made the subject of ridicule,
and all order overthrown, and yet are not affected with grief. Nor is it
surprising if we are involved in the punishment of sins which our own connivance
has fostered, instead of their being a torment to us. For that exhortation must
be remembered, that the zeal of God&#8217;s house may eat us up, and the
reproaches of those who reproach God may fall upon us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;196910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:10,) as it is said elsewhere, May my tongue cleave to my palate, if I am
unmindful of thee, O Jerusalem, at the summit of my mirth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:6.) Therefore when we see on one side the name of God trodden as it were
under foot, and all justice violated, we see on the other side the Church of God
miserably and cruelly afflicted, if we smile in security, by this very thing we
sufficiently show that we have nothing in common with God, and in vain we call
him Father. Hence these titles must be marked, by which the Prophet marks all
God&#8217;s elect, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whosoever groan over the
abominations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>then he adds the word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crying
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the better to express the ardor and
vehemence of their zeal, &#8212; just as if he said that groaning was not
sufficient, as many groan in a corner, when they see the whole order of God so
perverted, but when they <i>come </i>to the light and the sight of men, they
dare not give any sign of the least suspicion, because they are unwilling to
incur hatred and ill-will. The Prophet therefore here exacts more from the sons
of God than secret groaning, when he wishes them to groan openly and vociferate;
so that they bear witness that they abominate those things which God has
condemned in his law. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet adds, that the Chaldeans were sent to
destroy the city and its inhabitants, but the order must be observed, because
they are ordered to go <i>behind the angel. </i>The grace of God therefore
precedes to the safety of all the pious: then he opened the gate, and made a way
open for his wrath, long and wide, after he had removed the faithful from all
danger: for this reason it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he went through the city yet
after him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">And Patti also signifies this, when
he says, after that your obedience has been fulfilled, then wrath is at hand
against all rebels and proud ones.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:6.) God therefore first cares for his own; but after he has
received them into his keeping, and hid them as it were under his wings, then he
permits the flame of his wrath to burn against all the wicked. In fine, we see
that as often as God revenges man&#8217;s wickedness, he regards his Church, and
treats all as worthy of peculiar care who are endued with true and serious
piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he orders them to strike, so that
their eye should not spare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>what God had
taken to himself he transfers to the Chaldees, because there ought to be an
agreement between God and all his servants, even those who are not voluntary
agents, but whom he bends every way by his secret instinct. Then he expresses
more clearly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they should
not spare either old men or young men or boys or
girls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if he said, that he must rage
against all promiscuously, without any choice of age or sex. He here opposes
women to men, because that sex bends even the most cruel to pity, and we know
that when men are slain, women are preserved. Now girls seem to hold a better
position and boys also: and decrepit old men, because nothing is to be feared
from them, are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preserved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>safe. But God wishes the Chaldeans so to attack the whole city, that they
respect neither age nor sex. Meanwhile he excepts the faithful of whom he had
spoken, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon whomsoever the mark
shall be, do not approach him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here it
is asked, were all the good preserved free from slaughter? for we know that
Jeremiah was drawn into Egypt, to whom Chaldaea would have been a preferable
place of banishment. Already Daniel and his companions had been snatched away
before him, many were faithful in that multitude. On the other hand, we see many
despisers of God either escaped or left in the land, as Nebuchadnezzar<i>
</i>wished the dregs of the people to remain there. But we saw of what sort they
were in Jeremiah. It follows therefore that God neither spared all the elect,
nor made a difference in consequence<i> </i>of the mark, because the wicked
obtained safety as well as the faithful.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
39:10;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;244302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
43:2, 3, 4;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;244415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
44:15, 16.) But we must observe, although God apparently afflicts his people
with the ungodly, yet they are so separated, that nothing happens which does not
tend to the safety of the righteous. When therefore God forbids the Chaldeans to
approach them, he does not mean them to be free from all injury or disadvantage,
but he promises that they should be so separated from the ungodly, that they
should acknowledge by sure experience that God was never forgetful of his faith
and promise. Now therefore we see how that difficulty must be solved, since God
does not so spare his own as not to exercise their faith and patience, but he
does spare them so that no destruction happens to them, while he is always their
protector. But when he seems to give license to the impious, he grants this to
their destruction, because they are rendered more and more inexcusable. And this
daily </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>experience
teaches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>us. For we see that the very
best are so afflicted, that God&#8217;s judgment begins with them. We see
meanwhile that many reprobate exult with joy, even when they wantonly rage
against God. But God has the care of his own as if they had been sealed, and
separates them from the ungodly; but their own destruction remains for the
ungodly, and they are already held within its folds, although it is not yet
perceptible by the eye.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>begin at my
sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. By </i>the word
&#8220;sanctuary&#8221;<i> </i>the priests and Levites are doubtless intended,
and their fault was clearly greater. There was indeed a small number who
worshipped God purely, and stood firm in their duty, but the greater part had
revolted from the worship of God. Hence this passage ought to be understood of
those impious priests who had despised God and his servants. Nor is it
surprising that God&#8217;s wrath should begin with them. For they sin doubly;
because if any private man fall away, his example is not so injurious as that of
the eminent, who thus draw all men into the same ruin. For we know that the eyes
of the multitude are turned towards their superiors. Since therefore the priests
sinned more severely than all the rest, it is not surprising if God should
punish them in the first place. Those who interpret this sentence generally, as
if God ordered the Chaldeans to begin from his Church, extenuate the sense of
the Prophet too much. For this is not a comparison between the Church of God and
profane nations, but God rather compares the ministers of his temple with the
people in general, and a clearer explanation follows directly after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the Chaldeans began from the

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God. repeats what he had formerly touched upon
shortly and obscurely, namely, that the Jews trusted in vain in the visible
temple, because already he had ceased to dwell there, as we shall afterwards see
that he had departed. He had promised that his perpetual dwelling should be
there,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14,) but that promise is not opposed by the casual desertion of that
dwelling-place. Now therefore he adds this sentence, when he orders the
Chaldeans </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to pollute the temple
itself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But it was already polluted, some
one will say: I confess it: but it regards the Common perception of the people;
for although the Jews had infected the sanctuary of God with their wickedness,
yet they boasted that his worship still remained there and his sacred name. Now
therefore he speaks of another kind of pollution, namely, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Chaldeans should fill all the
area with the slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If a human corpse
or even a dog was seen in the sanctuary, this was an intolerable pollution; all
would cry out that it was portentous. But as often as they entered the temple,
although they dragged their crimes into God&#8217;s presence, (for they went
there polluted with blood, rapine, fraud, perjuries, and a whole heap of guilt,)
yet they reckoned all these pollutions as nothing. God therefore here obliquely
derides their sloth, when he says that they boasted of the sanctity of the
temple in vain, because they should see it at length filled with corpses, and
then should really acknowledge that the temple was no longer sacred. Now
therefore we understand the intention of the Holy Spirit. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they had gone forth, and
occasioned a slaughter in the city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
again the Prophet shows that the Chaldeans would be at hand to smite the Jews
with terror, as soon as God commanded them to destroy the city and cut off the
inhabitants. Perhaps the city had not yet been besieged, and that is probable,
for the Jews thought Ezekiel&#8217;s threatenings fabulous. For this reason he
says that the Chaldeans appeared to him, that they might hear or receive the
commandment of God: then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
they had returned from the slaughter,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to
prove their obedience to God. In fine, he shows that God&#8217;s threatenings

of the Chaldeans would be prepared for obedience. It follows

all the rest were perishing. Yet there is no ambiguity in the sense; for it
signifies that the Chaldeans had so attacked them everywhere, that they left
none remaining. Since, therefore, they raged so savagely against the whole
multitude, the Prophet seemed to himself to remain alone, as if God had snatched
him from the horrible burning, by which he wished the whole people to be
consumed and perish. Now if any one should object, that they were not all slain,
the answer is, that a slaughter took place which almost destroyed the name of
the people; then the survivors were like the dead, because exile was worse to
them than death itself. Lastly, we must remark that the prophecy was extended to
the last penalty, which at length awaits the ungodly, although God connives at
them for a time, or merely chastises them moderately.</font><br></div>

Now as the Prophet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fell upon his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it was a testimony of the human
affection, by which he instructed the people although unworthy. Hence he fell
upon his face as a mediator, for we know that when the faithful ask pardon of
God, they fall upon their face. They are said also to pour forth their prayers
for the sake of humility, because they are unworthy to direct their prayers and
words upwards.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:1.) Therefore Ezekiel shows that he interceded for the safety of the people.
And truly God was unwilling that his servants, under pretense of zeal, should
cast off all sense of humanity, so that the slaughter of the people should be
their play and joke. We have seen how anxiously Jeremiah prayed for the people,
so that he was at length entirely overwhelmed with grief; for he wished, as we
see in the ninth chapter, that his eyes flowed down as fountains.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
9:1.) Hence the Prophets, although they were God&#8217;s heralds to promulgate
his wrath, yet had not altogether put off all care and anxiety; for when they
seemed to be hostile to the people they pitied them. And to this end
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ezekiel fell on his face before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And truly that was a grievous
trial, which he did not disguise; for he complains that a populous city was
destroyed, and women and boys slain promiscuously with men. But he lays before
God his own covenant, as if he said, even if the whole world should perish, yet
it was impossible for God to lose his own Church, because he had promised, that
as long as the sun and moon shone in heaven, there should be a seed of the pious
in the world. &#8220;They<i> </i>shall be my faithful witnesses in
heaven,&#8221; said he.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198937&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:37, 38.) The sun and moon are remaining in their place: therefore God seemed
to have broken his covenant when he destroyed the whole people. This is the
reason why the Prophet lies on his face, as if astonished, and exclaims with
vehemence, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Alas! O Lord God, wilt
thou destroy the remnant of Israel by pouring forth thine
anger?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, whilst thou so purest
forth thine anger against Jerusalem &#8212; for that city remained as a
testimony of God&#8217;s covenant; for as yet some safety could be hoped for;
but although after it was cut off, the faithful wrestled with that temptation,
yet the contest was hard and fatiguing; for no one thought that any memorial of
God&#8217;s covenant could flourish when that city was extinct. For he had there
chosen his seat and dwelling, and wished to be worshipped in that one place.
Since, therefore, the Prophet saw that city destroyed, he broke forth into a
cry, what then will become of it! For when thou hast poured forth thine anger
against Jerusalem, nothing will remain left in the city. Hence also it will
readily be understood, that God&#8217;s covenant was almost obliterated, and had
lost all its effect. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God so answers his Prophet, that he restrains
too much fervor, and at the same time asserts his own justice &#8212; for the
Prophet might be impelled this way and that &#8212; he might even doubt whether
God would be true to his word. God might also shake his confidence in another
manner, as by raging too much against the innocent; since therefore he might be
agitated amidst those waves of trial, what God now does ought to set him at
rest. Therefore, as I have already said, he mitigates the feelings of his
Prophet, and at the same time asserts the equity of his judgment against all
false opinions which are apt to creep over us when God&#8217;s judgments do not
answer to our will. Meanwhile it must be remarked, how the Prophet complains
suppliantly of the slaughter of the city, and although he seemed to expostulate
with God, yet he submitted all his senses to his command, and on that account an
answer is given which can calm him. Whenever, therefore, God does not seem to
work as our carnal reason dictates to us, we may learn, by the Prophet&#8217;s
example, how to restrain ourselves, and to subject our reason to God&#8217;s
will, so that it may suffice us that he wills a thing so, <i>because </i>his
will is the most perfect rule of all justice. We see that Prophets sometimes
complain, and seem also to permit themselves too much liberty when they
expostulate with God, as we saw a memorable example in Jeremiah. (Jeremiah 12
and Jeremiah 20.) Then we read also a similar one in Habakkuk.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;350102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
1:2.) How so? Do the Prophets contend with God himself? yea, they directly
return to themselves, and collect into order all those wandering opinions by
which they perceive that they were greatly disturbed. So also our Prophet, on
the one hand, wonders at the slaughter of the city, and exclaims vehemently; at
the same time </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he falls upon his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and in this way testifies that he
would be obedient, as soon as God answered him. This is the reason, then, why
God also desires to appease his servant; nor is it doubtful that we shall
experience the same thing, if we modestly and soberly learn to enquire when
God&#8217;s judgments do not answer our opinions. If, therefore, we approach God
in this way, he will doubtless show us that what he does is right, and thus
supply us with material for rest. Hence, also, God&#8217;s inestimable
indulgence toward his people is collected, because he so deigns to render a
reason, as if he wished to satisfy them. It is certain that men are carried
forward into too much rashness, as often as they ask questions of God; for who
will dare to oppose himself to his judgments? and who will reply to him? so Paul
says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:20.) But God in his amazing goodness, descends even thus far, so as to render
a reason of his deeds to his servants, to settle their minds, as I have
said.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE TWENTY
FIFTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain God&#8217;s answer,
when he restrains the Prophet&#8217;s feelings: for he complained of the
destruction of the whole nation. There was a specious reason for it, because he
thought that in this way God&#8217;s covenant was made vain. But God simply
answers, that he does not exceed propriety in punishment. The question is not
answered in this way: for the Prophet might still doubt how God&#8217;s covenant
remained firm and yet the people was cut off. But God does not in every way
untie all the knots by which we are entangled: hence he leaves us in suspense,
but while he does this, he wishes to prove our modesty, for if he satisfied us
altogether, there would be no proof of our obedience. But when he commands us to
acquiesce in his judgment, if we do not pass beyond it, then we bear ourselves
towards him as modestly as becomes us. Thus, therefore, he now answers half the
question of his Prophet when he pronounces,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the sin of Jerusalem and
Judah is grievous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beyond
measure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the Prophet may understand
that the <i>city, </i>together with the nation, was to be utterly <i>destroyed,
</i>since there was no end to its wickedness. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land was filled with bloods,
and the city with perverse judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>bloods we may take for slaughters, or, generally, for all kinds of sin; for
the Scripture sometimes calls atrocious crimes which deserve death, bloods, but
it sometimes calls unjust slaughters so. But because God embraces all the sins
of the people, I readily interpret bloods as crimes, by which those who had so
often provoked his anger, brought destruction upon themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they said, Jehovah has
deserted the land, Jehovah sees nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We had a similar sentence a little before,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
8:12,) and I then hinted that it was taken too coldly by interpreters, because
they think that the Jews were Epicureans, who thought that God enjoyed his own
ease, and did not regard human affairs. They think, therefore, that the Jews
were so inebriated by a brutish contempt of God, as to think they could do as
they pleased with impunity, since God was afar off: as at this time profane men
allow themselves so much license, because they do not set God before their eyes,
as the Scripture often says. But we said that the Prophet intended something
else. For when the Jews had been often chastised, they were hardened in their
sins, and when they ought to acknowledge that those punishments were justly
inflicted upon them, they imagined that all things happened to them by chance;
just as unbelievers reckon all events as fortuitous. Such then was the sloth of
the people. God was visiting them, as he often says, that he would be known
among them as a judge: when they felt God&#8217;s hand present with them, they
said he was far off, because he did not succor them in their miseries, nor offer
himself as a shield against their enemies. For their fathers had experienced the
helping hand of God in all their dangers. Since, then, God had cast away all
regard for them, and showed himself rather their enemy than the defender of
their safety, they said that he was afar off. And as we saw, he had stirred up
the Chaldeans, and was then proving the faithfulness of all his prophecies when
he was executing what he had denounced by his servants. Now, therefore, we see
in what sense they said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God
had deserted the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because, in
truth, he was not granting it any taste of his favor. But they experienced his
power in another manner when he executed his punishment upon them. Why then did
they not think him a just avenger when he thus chastised them? But they laid
hold of one thing, that they were not so regarded by God as to be rescued from
their enemies. This passage then is worthy of notice. For when God not only
invites wretched men to himself, but also draws them to receive the punishment
due to their sins, they are often rendered more obstinate, and fancy that
God&#8217; is afar off. Hence, therefore, it happens that they are seized with
madness, and hesitate not to provoke him more boldly. This perverseness is now
described when Ezekiel represents the Jews as saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God had deserted the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For they are unable to see in it
anything more than this; for when profane men once take up the principle that
they are deserted by God, they think at the same time that whatever they do
escapes his notice. But this was the extreme of impiety: hence God shows, that
he could no longer spare men so abandoned. And he confirms this also in the next
verse when he says &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now God pronounces the Jews to be so obstinate in
their malice as to have cut off from themselves all hope of pardon. For when he
now says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would be
hostile to them without pity,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he shows
the necessity of taking vengeance, because their impiety had penetrated even
heaven, so that he could not spare them without denying himself. And abrupt
speech increases vehemence, as if God pronounced that he had changed his plans.
Now then we understand the meaning of this answer, that the Jews were bound by
so many and such impious crimes, that they had closed the door of God&#8217;s
pity: nay, they had compelled him to the utmost pitch of vengeance, because they
continued to provoke him more and more. Let us learn then from this passage not
to weigh God&#8217;s judgments in our scale, because we are too much accustomed
to extenuate our sins, and to treat our serious iniquities as but slight errors,
because we do not attribute just honor to God as the only judge. Now when God
commands his Prophet to rest and be silent, without doubt he at the same time
restrains that rashness of ours by which we burst forth in disobedience when he
seems to us to be too rigid. But, as I have said, we do not consider the
greatness of our sins. Therefore it is God&#8217;s province alone to pronounce
concerning sins, that no mortal should estimate the quality of actions, for then
we trench on God&#8217;s peculiar office. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

God&#8217;s paternal anxiety towards the faithful. For the Prophet taught,
before God would permit the Chaldeans to destroy the city, that an angel was
sent before to succor the elect, and thus to oppose himself to the violence of
the enemies: where we have said that it is shown to us as in a glass that God
holds this order in his judgments, that his fatherly love towards the faithful
always precedes them, so that he does not permit anything to happen to them but
what tends to their safety. For this reason the angel now says,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet relates another vision which has a
great likeness to the first which he related to us in the first chapter, but it
has another object, as we shall soon see. Since we discussed the chief members
of the vision in the first chapter, I shall now therefore be shorter. I shall
only glance at what I formerly said, and at the same time point out any
difference. But before we descend to that, God&#8217;s design in this vision
must be understood. God wished to bear witness to the Jews that he had nothing
further in common with them, because he intended to leave the temple, and then
to consume the whole city with burning. But lest this threat should be unheeded
by the Jews, God&#8217;s majesty was placed before them so fearfully that it
might strike even the obstinate with fear. Now I come to the words. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he saw again over the heads
of the cherubim a throne, whose color was like
sapphire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Instead of living creatures he
now puts cherubim, and there is no doubt that those living creatures of which he
formerly spoke were cherubim. But because the vision occurs in the temple, God
begins familiarly to explain to his servant what was previously too obscure. For
he had seen the four living creatures near the river Chebar, namely, in a
profane country. When therefore the Jews and Israelites were absent as exiles
far from the temple, it is no wonder that God did not appear so clearly to his
Prophet as he now does when brought into the temple. For although the Prophet
has not changed his place, yet he does not seem to have been transferred to
Jerusalem in vain, and to behold what was done in the temple. This is the reason
why he now calls those cherubim which he had before called simply living
creatures. But we have explained why four cherubim were seen, while only two
were in the sanctuary, namely, because the Jews were almost buried in gross
ignorance. They had long ago departed from the pursuit of sincere piety, and the
light of celestial doctrine had been almost extinct among them. Since,
therefore, the ignorance of the people was so gross, something rude must be put
before them, or otherwise they could not understand what they ought to
learn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is by no means doubtful that God obliquely
wishes to reprove that base ignorance, because it was not his fault that they
did not perceive in the law and the temple whatever was useful to be known for
their salvation. <i>When, </i>therefore, God changes this legal form, there is
no doubt he shows how degenerate the people was, just as if he had transfigured
himself. But we must also remember what I then said, that four cherubim were
offered to the Prophet that God might show that he embraced the whole world
under his own dominion. We saw a little while ago, that the Jews, While they
thought themselves already without God&#8217;s care<i>, </i>being thoroughly
callous, were so blind that they supposed at the same time that God exercised no
care over the world. In vain, therefore, in their perverse imaginations they
shut up God in heaven; he shows that he rules the whole universe, and that
nothing moves except by his secret power. Since then four cherubim are put
instead of two, it is just as if God showed that he reigned throughout the four
quarters of the globe, and that his power is extended in all directions, and
hence that it was the height of impiety for the Jews<i> </i>to imagine that he
had deserted the earth Thirdly, we must remark what has also been said before,
that the cherubim had four heads, that God might show that angelic motions
flourish in all creatures. But I shall repeat this last comment in its proper
place. I now only touch it shortly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now see why the Prophet says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was a throne whose
color was like sapphire,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the throne itself was above the
four cherubim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>because in truth God has
his angels at hand to obey him: hence they are placed under his feet, that we
may know that they are not independent, but are so subject to God that they
always depend upon his nod, and are borne wherever he commands them. This is the
reason </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>why they were placed under
the expanse where God&#8217;s throne was</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>As far as the expanse is concerned, it is the noun which Moses uses in
relating the creation of the world.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

but badly: the Latins imitated them when they used the expression
&#8220;firmament:<i>&#8221; </i>but it is taken for the heavens, and for the
whole space between us and heaven, and yet it is above the world. God shows his
throne above the expanse of heaven, not without himself, lest the Prophet should
conceive anything earthly. For we know how inclined men&#8217;s minds are to
their own fictions. But when God is mentioned, we cannot <i>conceive
</i>anything aright unless we raise all our senses above the whole world. God,
therefore, to raise up the mind of his Prophet, and to show himself at hand that
the Prophet may reverently attend to the oracles, and then that he may regard
the heavenly glory of God with becoming humility, interposed the expansion
between his throne and the earth. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the end of the vision is related, which I just
touched upon, since God determined utterly to destroy the city; but this is
described by a visible and external symbol. God therefore is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to have commanded the wan who was
clad in linen garments to fill his hands with coals, and to scatter them, on the
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, that he might cause a
general burning. Here, indeed, God&#8217;s name is not expressed, but shortly
afterwards the Prophet more clearly relates what he here touches so briefly and
so obscurely. It is evident that the person seated on the throne is here spoken
of, and we may collect from the context, that this command cannot be referred to
any but to God. But we must observe, that the angel commanded to mark the elect
now assumes a new character. And hence we collect that the angels were so the
ministers of God&#8217;s favor toward the faithful, that at the same time,
whenever they were commanded, they executed his vengeance; as a steward placed
over a large family, not only sustains the office of providing for the family,
in supplying it with food and clothing, but in chastising those who conduct
themselves sinfully and wickedly. Such, therefore, is the duty of God&#8217;s
angels. When God wishes to brand sinners with double shame, he often delivers
them up to the devil as his executioner, and when we are delivered into the
devil&#8217;s hand, this is a sign of extreme vengeance. But God by his angels
often exercises judgment against the reprobate, as examples <i>everywhere
</i>occur; but that is peculiarly remarkable, when the angel slew so many
thousands in the army of Sennacherib, that he raised the siege by which the
Assyrians oppressed Jerusalem.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) The same thing is now delivered by the Prophet. We saw the angel clad in
the linen garments become the protector of the faithful, to preserve them from
all injury. But now he is sent to scatter coals through the whole city, to
consume the stones and the wood, as well as the men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things seem to be contrary to each other, but
we show that there is nothing absurd in it, if God imposes a double character on
his angels. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He said, therefore,
to the man who was clothed, enter within the wheel under the
cherub</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here there is a change of
number, because the singular number cherub is put for cherubim. But I remarked
before that this is usual, and God proposed nothing else than to mark the place
where the fiery coals were taken which burnt up the city. The altar was never
without fire; for it was not lawful to use any kind of fire, since in this way
the sacrifices were contaminated.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;030612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
6:12, 13.) But that perpetual fire, which God wished to burn upon the altar,
regarded reconciliation to himself; for sins were expiated by sacrifices, and
therefore the fire on the altar was as it were the people&#8217;s life. But now
God signifies that he had a hidden fire within the wheels, which were near the
cherubim, or the four animals. But we have said, and it will be necessary to
repeat it again, that <i>by wheels </i>all agitations are represented which are
discerned under heaven, or revolutions, as they are usually called. But he saw
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wheels under the
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because when the wind rises,
when the sky is covered with clouds and mists, when the rain descends, and the
air is disturbed by lightnings, we think, when all these things happen, that
such motions and agitations take place naturally. But before this God wished to
teach us that great agitations are not blind, but are directed by secret
instinct, and <i>hence </i>the notion or inspiration of the angels, always
exists. Now, therefore, when God orders his angel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to take fire from the midst of
the wheel which was under the cherub</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>this only means that God has various means of destroying the city. Now the
wheels, as we saw before, were carried in different directions, so that they
flew throughout the city. Since, therefore, the fire was in the midst of the
wheels, while the angels transferred the wheels by their own secret motion,
hence we gather that the burning of the city was in the hand of God, and at the
same time in the temple. For the Prophet does not now see the wheels near the
river Chebar, but in the temple itself; and there is a tacit contrast, as I have
reminded you, between the fire by whose incense God was reconciled, and whence
also the sacrifices had their odor sweet and pleasing to God, and between this
fire, which should be destructive to the whole people. But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the angel had
entered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that we may know, as I have
said before, as soon as God has pronounced what he wishes to be done, that the
execution of it is at hand. Lastly, the Prophet here commends to us the effect
of his command, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the angel entered
immediately,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as God had commanded. It

the men entered, which looks only to the certainty of the prophecy. For we are
not here to seek any cunning speculations why they were on the right hand. It is
only intended to show that the way was open to the angel to approach directly to
God, and that the cherubim were disposed there to render their assistance; for
there ought to be an agreement between the angel who took the fire which he
scattered through the whole city, and the cherubim who carried all the angels.
Here the Prophet shows this agreement, because the cherubim were turned to the
right hand when he entered, so that God was at hand; then also the cherubim were
at. hand, and thus the wheels bore along the fire.</font><br></div>

God, as if the temple was full of darkness. And this afterwards is better

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet confirms what he lately
touched upon, viz., that the temple was filled with blackness, because God had
transferred his glory away. He says then,

God&#8217;s glory appeared above the
threshold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But the glory of God resided
in the sanctuary and in the very ark of the covenant; but now, when it advances
to the threshold, it is just as if he should extinguish the splendor of his
glory by which the temple was adorned, and transfer it elsewhere. But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the glory of Jehovah was
elevated from its place:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>these words
signify change of place: God is everywhere said to dwell between the cherubim,

removed elsewhere. Hence, therefore, it appears, that the temple was deprived of
God&#8217;s presence, and was in some sense stripped of its furniture; for
without God what remained? Hence that darkness which was formerly mentioned, and
is again repeated. The glory of Jehovah then was withdrawn: from whence? from
its own place and station, where it dwelt between the cherubim, and came to the
threshold of the temple: then he says, all was changed. For the temple in which
God&#8217;s glory formerly shone forth became full of darkness; but the
threshold of the house, which was as it were profane, was full of splendor: not
that God dwelt at the threshold, for this vision has another meaning, viz., that
God after leaving his temple appeared without it; for by the threshold he
signifies a place conspicuous to all. Now therefore we understand the design of
the Holy Spirit when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE the Prophet teaches the end of the vision. The
Jews thought that they should always be safe and secure under God&#8217;s
<i>presence; </i>they thought that the sacred fire on the altar availed for the
expiation of all wickedness. But God showed that he so resided in the temple
that he clothed himself with wrath against them, and that the cherubim were
keepers of his arms by which they were at length to be destroyed. We see,
therefore, that this false and perverse glowing by which the Jews were
intoxicated was cut from under them, since they thought that God was in some way
bound to themselves exclusively. Hence the angel is ordered to take fire and to
sprinkle it about the city, that it may be destroyed by the burning. But this
was necessary, because the Jews<i>, </i>while they for a long time obstinately
abused the forbearance of God, could not be induced to repent by any fear of his
wrath. For this reason this vision was shown to the Prophet. Then he says that
fire was given, but whence was it taken? <i>it was, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the midst of the
cherubim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When David prays to God, he

God, when inviting the faithful to himself, as if he stretched forth his hands
to them, had angels at hand who brought him in contact with men. Now the Prophet
teaches, that God&#8217;s presence was of no use to the Jews, because he was in
arms for their destruction; and the cherubim, who were formerly ministers of his
grace, were now at hand to execute his vengeance<i>, </i>since they extend fire
from hand to hand for the conflagration of the whole city. For he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was come who was clad in
linen garments, and stood near the wheels,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by which words he signifies, that angels were thoroughly prepared to obey
God&#8217;s commands in every particular. In men there is great delay and even
languor; but the Prophet assures us, that angels were ready for the performance
of their duty. As soon as God shows them what he wishes to be done, they have
their hands extended, and thus they are prepared to execute his will. For this
reason he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they stood

understand the great vigor of angels for action: but in the meantime it marked
the agreement of their agitation with the obedience which they offer to God. For
doubtless wings in angels represent direction, by which God testifies that the
angels have no proper or independent, motion, but are governed by his secret
instinct: for wings signify something terrestrial and human. And it is clear
that when wings were given to angels, by this symbol God&#8217;s secret
government was pointed out,

secret virtue of God, and had no motion in themselves; then that they were apt

wheels were added to each living creature. I have previously explained what the
wheels mean. I will now only allude to them; concerning the living creatures I
shall by and bye treat more fully. But the wheels are images of all the changes
which are discerned in the world. No more suitable figure can be chosen; for
nothing is stationary in the world, but revolutions, as we commonly call them,
are continually happening. Since, therefore, they are so changeable, nay even
tumultuous at times, profane men cannot understand how the world is governed by
the fixed counsel of God; but they fabricate for themselves a blind fortune:
hence God in concession to our weakness has represented to us, under the form of
wheels, all changes of things, all accidents, as they are called, and all
events; as if he were to say, that all things in the world are revolving and
changing, not only that all elements are agitated upwards and downwards, but
human events especially. Meanwhile he has corrected the error, while he has
conceded something to the rudeness of men. For we see manifold conversions which
appear to us under the form of a wheel: but meanwhile we indulge in too much
license, when we imagine a blind fortune. Hence the Prophet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw wheels near the
cherubim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, he saw those changes
by which men&#8217;s minds are disturbed, as if all things happened rashly in
the world. But he saw that the wheels did not revolve by their own force, but
are annexed to the angels, since all events depend on a first cause, namely, on
that secret ordinance and inspiration of God, by which the angels are moved, and
whence also they have their vigor. In this explanation nothing is forced,

<div><font face="Palatino">We have also explained this part. He says

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is one appearance to the

<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as I have remarked, after the Prophet has
granted that there are certain events of things as it were twisted and bending,
and that God acts through windings, he then shows that God does nothing rashly:
and that the events which we think tumultuous and confused have a certain
direction, and that too the best. For this reason he says, first that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wheels had set out, they did not
return, since each followed its own head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Interpreters do not agree on these words. For as to the turning of the head,
some translate it <i>&#8220;</i>the<i> </i>first,&#8221; and thus mean that in
whatever way the first cherub goes, the others follow him. But I rather think
that the wheels are compared with the cherubs themselves, and the singular noun
head is here put for heads: for we before saw that wheels were annexed to each
cherub, Therefore each wheel has its own head, that is, has a living creature by
which it is ruled. Hence the sense of the Prophet is, that the &#8216;wheels
turned on this side or on that, by any outward or sudden impulse, but were
governed by the cherubim themselves, which will explain this portion more
clearly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the wheels were full of
eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence we gather, that although by
the events of things God may seem to sport and to have various erratic circuits,
yet all things are governed by his inestimable wisdom: for this reason
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wheels are said to be full of
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet uses the word <i>flesh
</i>inappropriately for the very body of the wheels. But we know that the
language which he used in exile was not very elegant, and hence it is by no
means wonderful if it is rather rough and savors of asperity. Yet the sense is
not doubtful, since </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole
body of the wheels in their back and their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was all full of eyes: he next
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wheels
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not to mark anything
different, but afterwards when he speaks of the flesh, the back and the hands,
he names the wheels simply: as if he had said that they were full of eyes in
every part. Now we see how things contrary in appearance may be best reconciled.
For the events of things are as unstable as if any one kept turning&#8217; a
wheel: then they become complicated, as if wheel was within wheel: but in the
meantime God so tempers all things among themselves which seem to us confused,
that it may appear that he perceives best what is necessary to be done, and that
the events of things are full of eyes. But whence does this arise? This
clearness depends on the angelic inspiration, for the wheels are not turned in
different directions of their own accord, but each follows its own leader and
head. It is also said</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, in
appearance like the stone Tharsis</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, (beryl.)
</i>Jerome thought the Cilician sea was intended, and so translated it
sky-colored: but because we know that this name beryl occurs among the precious
stones, I therefore retain the simple sense. Now it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">By this verse the Prophet better confirms what I have
said, that the events of things are full of eyes, since they depend on the
secret commands of God. Because therefore nothing happens unless by God&#8217;s
command, hence it happens in the multiform changes of things that there is an
equable tenor with reference to God. He says therefore that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
cried</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or the angel, O <i>wheel. </i>We
know that wheels are properly without sense: but here the Prophet signifies that
God&#8217;s voice is heard by all creatures, so that not even the slightest
motion happens without that secret instinct. When the air is serene and calm, we
do not think that God&#8217;s voice reigns there, but we imagine some natural
cause: so also when the sky is clouded, when it rains, when storms rise, when
other changes happen, in some way or other we exclude God from these actions.
But the Prophet, on the contrary, says,

way of derision, but wished to testify that there was a certain hidden
inclination by which all creatures obey his command To this end therefore God
exclaims, O wheel, that we should not think that events are rashly moved, or
that any agitation arises without control, or that the elements are so gross
that they do not obey God, since his voice gives efficacy and vigor to
all.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now Ezekiel descends to the animals themselves, which
he now pronounces to be cherubim, yet under another form than that in the
sanctuary. We said in the first chapter why he saw four cherubim since only two
surrounded the ark of the covenant. This variation may seem absurd, for God was
accustomed to accommodate his visions to the forms of the law, that he might
hold the people in the simplicity of the law. But the reason which I brought
forward in the first chapter is by no means to be rejected, because in truth so
great was the grossness and rudeness of the people, that it was necessary to
bend aside from the first and genuine institution. God had been content with two
cherubim, and in that number doubtless he represented all angels; but he was
surrounded on the right hand and on the left that he might show the people that
he could never be wanting in power to bring them help. Now the Jews were so
stupified that they shut up God in heaven, because scarcely any recognition of
his providence then remained, as we have already seen. Since, therefore, the
Jews thus excluded God from the government of the world, he was obliged to use a
new form, different from that of the law, that they might really perceive that
God&#8217;s government extended over the four quarters of the world. And there
is no doubt that by the four living creatures God reminded them that nothing
took place in the world without his control. But when the world is described,
its four quarters or regions are put.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, therefore, we understand why the Prophet saw not
two cherubim only but four: the same reason for difference in the form of the
cherubim is also added. For the cherubim were like winged boys: but the Prophet
says, that each of the living creatures was furnished with four heads. This was
doubtless an assistance towards rousing&#8217; the people from their torpor,
because the Jews could not otherwise understand the meaning and the force of the
angelic inspiration by which God governs the whole world: hence after four
living creatures had been presented before the Prophet, four heads were also
given to each living creature, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the head of an ox, of a man, of a
lion, and of an eagle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We<i> </i>said in
the first chapter, that by these heads all living creatures were represented to
us: for although trees, and the sea, and rivers, and herbs, and the air, and
stars, and sun, are parts of the universe, yet in living beings there is some
nearer approach to God, and some clearer display of his energy: for there is
motion in a man, in an ox, in an eagle, and in a lion. These animals
<i>comprehend </i>within themselves all parts of the universe by that figure of
speech by which a part represents the whole. Meanwhile since angels are living
creatures we must observe in what sense God attributes to angels themselves the
head of a lion, an eagle, and a man: for this seems but little in accordance
with their nature. But he could not better express the inseparable connection
which exists in the motion of angels and all creatures. We have said, that
angels are not called the
powers</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f221</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of God in vain: now when a lion either
roars or exercises its strength, it seems to move by its own strength, so also
it may be said of other animals. But God here says, that the living creatures
are in some sense parts of the angels though not of the same substance, for this
is not to be understood of similarity of nature but. of effect. We are to
understand, therefore, that while men move about and discharge their duties,
they apply themselves in different directions to the objects of their pursuit,
and so also do wild beasts; yet there are angelic motions underneath, so that
neither men nor animals move themselves, but their whole vigor depends on a
secret inspiration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A difficult question remains, namely, why Ezekiel
says here that the first head was that of a cherub, while in the first chapter
he said it was that of an ox.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
10:10.) Some escape the difficulty by saying that it appeared at a distance like
an ox, but a nearer inspection showed it to be a cherub, But this is too forced,
so that I have no doubt that there is some difference in the vision; nor does
what he afterwards adds, that this was the living creature which he saw at the
river Chebar, oppose this; for he calls anything which is like another, and has
the same object, the same thing. Paul says their fathers in the desert ate the
same spiritual food, and drank the same spiritual drink.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:3, 4.) But we know how different was the symbol manna, and the
water flowing from the rock, from the sacred Supper which Christ left for us;
but as I have already said, since there is an affinity between the sacred
symbols, they are to be referred to the same scope. Thus Paul says, the same
drink and the same food, and Ezekiel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was the same living
creature.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Meanwhile, there is nothing
out of place in our saying that the vision is slightly changed, For when God
opened himself at first, the Prophet was on profane ground, now the vision is
added more in the form of the sanctuary, because he was seized by the Spirit,
that he might see the abominations by which the Jews had stained the temple, as
already stated. When therefore the face of an ox was presented to the Prophet,
near the river Chebar, that he might now understand that they were angels, or
living&#8217; cherubs, and that the four heads may not distract him, the face of
a cherub is presented to him; so that, being admonished by this sign, he may
determine that each living creature is nothing else than an angel or cherub,
although it differs from the received form, of which God had proposed to Moses
an example on the mount.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand why God turned aside from the
course prescribed in his law, when he offered this vision to his Prophet;
because, in truth, the people had so degenerated from all sense of piety, that
they could not be taught by the simple plan or rule of the law, but had need of
gross remembrancers. This is one explanation. Then again four living creatures
are employed, that God may signify that his energy is diffused through the whole
universe. Then, again, four heads are assigned to each living creature, that we
may know that no part of the world is free from his providence, and from that
secret inspiration which is <i>efficacious </i>through angels. Then as to the
last clause, where the face of an ox appeared to the Prophet before, now he
beholds that of a cherub, that he may understand that these living creatures are
nothing else than angels; but the reason why God endues his angels with a new
form, is because the slothfulness of the people was so great, that they did not
recognize what they ought to have been familiar with, for it was not God&#8217;s
fault that they had not imbibed the doctrine of piety from their earliest
childhood. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We shall afterwards explain in the proper place why
he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cherubim
ascended.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The first and principal scope
of this vision was that God would no longer dwell in the temple, because<i>
</i>he had determined to depart thence on account of the impious and wicked
profanations by which the temple had been contaminated. Now for this reason he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cherubim
ascended</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that was the living creature,
which he had seen near the river Chebar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He adds this for clearing up the vision, because if it had been offered only
once, the Jews might doubt its tendency, and its obscurity would take away their
taste for it, and render the prophetic teaching quite insipid. But since the
vision is repeated, God confirms and sanctions what otherwise had not been
sufficiently stamped upon the hearts of the people; for experience also teaches
us this, that we increase in faith and make further progress according as God
speaks with us again and again. For even if we seem to ourselves to follow up
what we have learnt from the Scriptures, yet if the same sentence is repeated,
we become still more familiar with it. Then again, if we read the same sentiment
in two or three Prophets, God brings forward more witnesses, that so the truth
may be better established; since we know our great propensity to doubt, we are
always fluctuating, and although the word of God has in it sufficient energy to
confirm us, we are still unsettled, unless our minds are propped up by various
supports. God therefore wished to place the same thing twice before the eyes of
his Prophet, that the former vision might make more impression not only on the
Prophet himself, but also upon all the Jews. For we said that although there was
some difference, yet there is no discordance in the Prophet&#8217;s saying that
the living creature was one and the same.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">WE began yesterday to explain the sentence of the
Prophet when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the
wheels were raised together with the living
creatures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we have shortly taught
that whatever we behold in creation so depends on angelic motion and
inspiration, that there is an inseparable connection between them. Now the<i>
</i>Prophet adds, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wheels
were not reversed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which phrase he
expresses their continual tenor. For it cannot happen that any agreement should
appear for a time without a sudden change occurring. But the Prophet says that
the wheels were so raised with the living creatures that they never departed
from them. Now we understand his intention. He had previously asserted the same
thing of the living creatures, and there was a kind of contradiction to be
solved which might otherwise occasion a scruple, for he said that the living
creatures were reversed and yet not reversed, but we can reconcile these two
things, because the living <i>creatures </i>never deviated from their prescribed
course and from a definite and settled space; meanwhile they were reversed,
because they ran like lightning and hastened quickly from one action to another.
Meanwhile the Prophet wished to teach, that in God&#8217;s works nothing is
abrupt, nothing cut off, nothing mutilated, but angels so direct all actions and
all events of things, that whatever God determines arrives at its own end. But
this does not prevent God from operating variously, and after at one goal from
beginning a new course. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As he just said that the wheels were obedient to the
movement of the living creatures, so he now says that they ceased with them. But
in this place it seems as if some incongruity might arise: for it is not correct
to say that angels ever rest. We know that their quickness and promptness in
executing God&#8217;s commands is celebrated.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:20, 21.) Then since angels are the powers of God, it follows that they never
cease from their office of working. For God never can rest; he sustains the
world by his energy, he governs everything however minute, so that not even a
sparrow falls to the ground without his decree.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:29.) And there is that known and celebrated sentence of Christ, My Father and
I work hitherto.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
5:17.) Since, therefore, God never rests from his works, how then can that
resting be explained of which the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when the angels stood, the wheels
also stood?</i> </font><font face="Palatino">I reply: it must be taken in a
human sense; for although God works continually by means of angels, yet he seems
sometimes to rest between. For he does not govern his works in any equable
manner, as for instance, the heavens are sometimes calm, and at others agitated,
so that a great variety appears in <i>God&#8217;s </i>works, from which we may
imagine that he is sometimes in vehement motion, and at others at perfect
repose. This, therefore, is the cessation of which the Prophet now speaks when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the living
creatures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>stood, and at the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>same time the wheels with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Experience also confirms this; for
God sometimes seems to mingle heaven and earth, and rouses us by unaccustomed
work, while at others the course of his works seems to flow like a placid river.
So that it is not absurd to say that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wheels stood with the living
creatures,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proceeded and were elevated with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of the living creature
was in the wheels,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I explained this
point, in the first chapter, but here it may be shortly explained, that the
spirit is here taken for secret vigor or instinct. The wheels are not properly
animated, because we said that the events of things are represented to us by
this word, and whatever seems to happen in the world; but their incomprehensible
vigor and agitation proceeds from God&#8217;s command, so that all creatures are
animated by angelic motion: not that there is a conversion of the angel into an
ox or a man, but because God exerts and diffuses his energy in a secret manner,
so that no creature is content with his own peculiar vigor, but is animated by
angels themselves. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet teaches us what is the principal
point in the vision, namely, that God had deserted the temple: for we, know with
what confidence the Jews boasted that they should be safe continually under the
protection of God. In consequence of the promise, that God&#8217;s temple should
be the place of his rest wherein he would dwell,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14,) they did not think it possible that God would ever leave them: so they
sinned without restraint; and while they drove him far away from them by their
crimes, yet they wished to have him in some way bound to them. This folly is
derided by Isaiah &#8212; Heaven is my seat, and earth is my foot. stool: what
house therefore will ye build for me?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:1.) God had commanded his temple to be built, and wished to have his earthly
dwelling, place there: but he says that his wish had been rendered nugatory: and
how? why when he promised that he would dwell in the temple, he wished his name
to be purely and reverently invoked there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Jews had polluted the temple in every way.
Hence they thought that God was shut up there in vain: because his liberality
did not tend to his partaking of the captivity of the Jews, but to his having
them in obedience to himself. Therefore Isaiah deservedly says, that the temple
became unfit for the use of God when it was profaned. So also we see in
Jeremiah: Do not trust in lying words, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of
Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4.) That repetition is used because they were so elated by their obstinacy.
The Jews resisted the Prophets, and as often as any threat was uttered against
them, they immediately fled to that asylum, the temple of the
Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason therefore the Prophet now relates,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the glory of God had
deserted the sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for otherwise
what we have seen would have been out of place: he was sent to scatter burning
through the whole city: in this way the temple would have been burnt, and God
would have been consumed by peculiar fire: here I speak after the common form,
because when the ark of the covenant is called the God of hosts,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;100602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 6:2,) how could it happen that the fire should destroy the ark, together
with all parts of the temple? But God himself meets them and shows them that the
temple was deprived of its glory when it was destroyed by the enemy. Afterwards
the temple was overthrown And in the Psalms its lamentable ruin is described,
how cruelly and proudly, and with what barbarous mockery the enemy insulted it,
(Psalm 74, and Psalm 79:) this was very disgraceful, and disturbed their weak
minds. Hence it was necessary to persuade the faithful that God no longer dwelt
in the temple, but that it remained only an empty spectacle, because he had
taken away his glory since the place was corrupted by so many defilements. Now
therefore we understand the design of the Prophet, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the glory of Jehovah had
departed from the threshold of the house, and stood above the
cherubim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But he had already said that
the cherubim had raised their wings, which he again confirms. Whence it follows,
that God with his angels, when the temple was left, deserted the Jews, so that
for the future they would boast themselves in vain to be safe under his
protection. Therefore he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the cherubim raised their
wings, and ascended from the earth before his
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Nor is this clause superfluous,
since it was difficult to persuade the Jews of what he said about his deserting
them. There was a celebrated oracle, &#8220;here will I dwell, since I have
chosen it.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14.) When they grasped at that, they thought that the sun would sooner fall
from heaven than God would leave that temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he saw it
clearly,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that no doubt might remain. If
any one should here ask, how that promise which I have mentioned agrees with
that departure which the Prophet here relates? the answer is easy, if we only
understand that God does not always work by human means, nor yet according to
our carnal perception. God often seems to act so abruptly that his beginning is
without an end: in fine, God seems sometimes to sport and to draw back his hand,
so that the event does not answer to the joyful beginnings. Since therefore,
according to our carnal senses, God&#8217;s works appear to be frustrated, it is
necessary to use such language: otherwise we should never understand how God
departed from the sanctuary, when he had chosen it in perpetuity. But he so
departed, that the place still remained sacred, and the temple stood before God
though it had been overthrown in the eyes of men. The visible appearance of the
temple was taken away, but meanwhile, since the temple was founded on the
promise of God, it stood among its ruins, as I have said. For this reason
Daniel, although solitude and devastation ought to avert his eyes and senses
from Judea, prayed in that direction, as if the temple had remained entire. And
why so? He looked at the promise.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
6:10.) And for this reason the Prophet said, after the return from the
captivity, that the glory of the second temple surpassed that of the first, as
the Prophet Haggai says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;370209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
2:9.) And we know with what copiousness and magnificence Isaiah discourses
concerning the splendor of the second temple and its inestimable glory.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
60:7.) We shall see also a similar doctrine at the end of this book. Since
therefore the temple stood before God, because it was founded on his promise,
this temporary desertion could not abolish what I have said concerning
God&#8217;s perpetual station.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">same thing also must be said concerning the kingdom:
that kingdom ought to stand while the sun and moon shone in heaven,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198937&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:37, 38,) this is true: and yet there was a sad interruption during many
years. For we know what a serious disgrace the last king suffered: then had all
dignity fallen to ruin, so that nothing could be seen but the horrible vengeance
of God. And yet that promise always had its own effect; as long as the sun and
moon shall stand, they shall be my faithful witnesses of the perpetuity of the
kingdom. Now then we understand in what sense God left his temple, and yet did
not in anywise break his promise. But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the glory of the God of Israel
stood at the eastern gate, but above it, so that it was raised up from the
earth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The meaning of that speech was, that the
Jews might know that God was no longer to be sought in that dwelling of wood and
stone, because he had not only left his seat, but had ascended upwards, that
they should have no more intercourse with him. Now it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats what we have seen before, namely, that one
vision was offered twice, because God wished to mark distinctly what otherwise
had been doubtful. The Prophet indeed was sufficiently persuaded that God had
appeared to him, but the confirmation of it was not in vain, because he would
have to sustain great conflicts. Meanwhile it must be observed, that the vision
was confirmed a second time, not for the private advantage of a single person,
but that this drawing attention to it might profit the whole people, or at any
rate render those without excuse who so despised the favor of God, so manifest
and so clearly laid open to them. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this was the living creature
which he had seen under the God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In the first chapter he related that there was a throne in the open
firmament of heaven, where he sat who was like a man in external form, and yet
was not a man. There we saw that the true and only God was alluded to, and yet
that this description could not apply to the Father, but necessarily belonged to
the Son. These two things then are to be borne in mind: and the Prophet here
takes away all doubt when he names
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of Israel like a
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which could not apply to the person
of the Father. That likeness then ought, to be agreed upon among the pious.
Controversy, therefore, on this point ought not be engaged in; for Sabellius,
who took away the distinction of persons, was sufficiently refuted by his own
extravagance. Since, therefore, the Father never put on the form or likeness of
man, and it is nowhere read in the Scriptures that. he is compared to a man, we
must explain this of Christ. And now Ezekiel bears witness
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he is the God of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see, therefore, how foolishly
the triflers of our day babble who desire to disturb the Churches by making
Christ a sort of deity transfused from the substance of the Father. They
confess, indeed, that he is God, but this confession is a mere
pretense,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since they say that the God of Israel
means God the Father, and that the title cannot apply to either the Son or the
Spirit. The Spirit, therefore, is mistaken when he says by the Prophet&#8217;s
mouth</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, the God of Israel appeared
in human form</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This place, therefore, is
remarkable for refuting that delusion by which foolish men fatigue themselves
and others: while they allow Christ to be God, yet they deprive him of his true
deity, because they say that it is derived from the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he knew them to be
cherubim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now although he knew that God
had appeared to him before, yet he had no certain knowledge concerning the
living creatures, for with regard to them he remained in suspense; but now after
God has familiarly explained to him the vision in the temple, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was taught that they were
cherubim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So what we said yesterday is
confirmed, that the face of the ox was changed into that of a cherub, so that
the Prophet understood that angels were pointed out under the form of cherubim,
even those which surrounded the ark of the covenant. Let us proceed

obscure or perplexed in this vision, since all things were mutually suitable.
For the remembrance of the vision which he had received remained in the
Prophet&#8217;s mind: but now when he is hurried into the temple, he recognizes
the same God and the same forms as those to which he had been accustomed. We see
then how he meets their perverseness, who had otherwise boasted that he had

intent on its own end or scope: because if the motion of the angels had been
turbulent, they had not been the ,servants of God. Finally, the Prophet

the Prophet shows that the state of the city was so corrupt that no hope of
pardon remained, since those who ought to be the eyes of the whole people were
involved in darkness. But he names the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>five and twenty
seniors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whence it is probable, that
this number was chosen in the midst of confusion, or that a definite number is
put for an indefinite; and I rather embrace this second view. Whatever it is, it
implies that those who held the reins of government were impious despisers of
God, and hence it is not surprising that impiety and defection from God and his
law had begun to increase among the whole people. But we must remark the
Prophet&#8217;s intention. For common soldiers are accustomed to consider their
commanders as a shield, as we this day see in the Papacy. For this is their last
refuge, since they think themselves guilty of no fault when they obey their holy
Mother Church. Such also formerly was the obstinacy of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, men always throw off all blame from
themselves, under pretense of error or ignorance. Hence the Prophet now shows
that the city was not free from God&#8217;s wrath, since it was corrupted by its
leaders and rulers; nay, that this was a cause of its destruction, since the
people were too easily led astray by perverse examples. Meanwhile, we must
notice the Prophet&#8217;s freedom, because he here fearlessly attacks the most
noble princes. He was, indeed, out of danger, because he was an exile: but it
seems that he was at Jerusalem when he uttered this prophecy. He shows,
therefore, his strength of mind, since he does not spare the nobles. Hence this
useful doctrine is collected, that those who excel in reputation and rank are
not free from blame if they conduct themselves wickedly, as we see happens in
the Papacy. For, as to the Pope himself, it is in his power to condemn the whole
world, while he exempts himself from all blame. And as to the Bishops, now
twenty or thirty witnesses are required, and afterwards even seventy: hence one
of those horned beasts could not be convinced, unless the whole people should
rise up: so also it was formerly. But here the Prophet shows, that however
eminent are those who are endued with power over the people, yet they are not
sacred nor absolved from all law by any peculiar privilege, since God freely
judges them by his Spirit, and reproves them by his Prophets. Lastly, if we wish
to discharge our duty rightly, especially when it consists of the office of
teaching, we should avoid all respect of persons, for those who boast that they
excel others are yet subject to the censures of God.. For this reason it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet explains what might be obscure
through their perverseness. He brings forward, therefore, what the impious
thought could be covered by many fallacies. For we know that hypocrites endeavor
to fix their eyes on God, and when they scatter their own clouds before
themselves, they think that he is blinded. For this reason Isaiah says, that God
also is wise,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
31:2,) and derides their cunning, since they think that they blind God&#8217;s
eyes whilst they conceal their sins with various coverings. Since, therefore,
the obstinacy of these men was so great., the Prophet here strips off their
mask; for they could be turned aside by perverse counsels to deny that they
deserved anything of the kind. But the Prophet here cuts away their pretenses,
because, in truth, their impiety was more than sufficiently evident, since they
boast that the time is not yet at hand, and, therefore, that they might build
houses at Jerusalem as in a time of ease and peace. As we saw in Jeremiah, the
time of the last destruction was approaching; everything remaining in the city
had now been destined to final ruin: and for this reason Jeremiah advised houses
to be built in Chaldea and in foreign lands, since the captives must spend a
long period there, even seventy years.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:5.) Since then the predicted time was now drawing on, it became extreme folly
in the people to oppose themselves, and to treat God&#8217;s threats as a
laughing-stock, and to boast that it was a time for building. Now, therefore, we
see what the Prophet blames and condemns in the five and twenty men who were
princes of the people, namely, that they hardened the people in obstinate
wickedness, and encouraged torpor, so that the Prophet&#8217;s threats were
unheeded. Since, therefore, they so stupified the people by their enticements,
and took away all sense of repentance, they also set aside all fear of
God&#8217;s wrath which had been denounced against them. The Prophet condemns
this depravity in their counsels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, in the second clause, this contempt appears more
detestable when they say, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem is the caldron, and
they are the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I do not doubt their
allusion to Jeremiah; for in the first chapter the pot was shown, but the fire
was from the north,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:13;) so then the Spirit wished to teach us, that the Chaldeans would come like
a fire to consume Jerusalem, as if a pot is placed on a large and constant fire,
even if it be full of water and flesh, yet its contents are consumed, and the
juice of the flesh is dried up by too long cooking. God had demonstrated this by
his servant Jeremiah: here the Jews deride and factiously elude what ought to
strike them with no light fear, unless they had been too slothful:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>say they, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we are the flesh
and Jerusalem is the caldron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>So they
seem to rate the Prophet Jeremiah, as if he were inconsistent, &#8212;
&#8220;What? do you threaten us with captivity? and meanwhile you say that this
city will be the pot and the Chaldeans the fire. If God wishes to consume us,
therefore let us remain within: thus we may build houses.&#8221; Now we
understand how they sought some appearance of inconsistency in the words of the
Prophet: as reprobate and profane men always take up arguments by which they may
diminish and extenuate all faith in heavenly doctrine, nay, even reduce it to
nothing if they could. The Prophet, therefore, provides a remedy for this evil,
as we have seen. But before he proceeds to it, he repeats their impious saying,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem is a caldron, and
the people flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They turned what had
been said to a meaning directly contrary, for the Prophet said that they should
burn since the Chaldeans would be like fire&#8217; but they said &#8212; well,
we shall be scorched, but that will be done lightly, so that we shall remain
safe to a good old age. Hence we understand how diabolical was their audacity,
who were so blinded by the just judgments of God, that they did not scruple
petulantly to blame even God himself, and to make a laughingstock of the
authority of his teaching. Thus we see in another way how faithfully Ezekiel had
discharged his duty: he had been created a Prophet: he had not to discharge his
office by himself, but was an assistant to Jeremiah. And we cannot otherwise
discharge our duty to God and his Church unless we mutually extend our hands to
each other, when ministers are mutually united and one studies to assist the
other. Ezekiel now signifies this when he professes himself the ally and
assistant of Jeremiah.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">YESTERDAY we saw that the Jews scurrilously eluded
the prophecies of Jeremiah, especially when he threatened them with God&#8217;s
wrath. For he had said, that a vision was offered to him, in which Jerusalem was
like a pot, and the fire lighted from the north. For a laughing-stock they said
that they could rest safely within the city, because they were not yet cooked
but raw, so that if that prophecy is true, said they, we shall not so quickly
depart from the city. For God foretold that we should be the flesh which was
about to be cooked: if this city is a caldron, we ought to remain here till we
are cooked: but this has not happened. Hence what Jeremiah pronounces is vain,
that we shall be dragged into exile, because these two things disagree, viz.,
God wishing us to rest in the city, and yet dragging us into a distant region.
Since it is so, Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy is vain; thus then they deceived
themselves. But God commands another Prophet of his to rise up against them. And
the repetition is emphatic,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesy, prophesy against
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For nothing is less tolerable than
that men should petulantly spurn God&#8217;s anger, which ought to inspire all
with fear. For if the mountains melt before him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
64:3,) if angels themselves tremble,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:9.) And we see also how God grows angry against such perverseness; especially
when he denounces, by the mouth of Isaiah, that this sin would be unpardonable.
I have called you, said he, to ashes and mourning: but, on the other hand, ye
have said, Let us eat and drink, and ye have turned my threats into a
laughing-stock. For this was your proverb, to-morrow we shall die: as I live,
your iniquity shall not go unpunished. God affirms by an oath, that he would
never be appeased by the impious and profane despisers of his judgments. For
this reason also he now repeats again, <i>prophesy, prophesy. </i>Let us go on

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet turns the impious scurrility of the
people into another sense, for they had corrupted what Jeremiah had said. They
knew what he meant by the pot and the flesh, but they thought they could avert
God&#8217;s wrath by their cleverness. Here the Prophet brings forward another
sense, not that of Jeremiah, nor that of the people, but a third. In the
twenty-fourth chapter he will again denounce them as like flesh, since God will
cast them into a pot to be cooked, so that even their bones should be consumed.
But here the Prophet only considers how he shall refute their wicked saying, by
which they think to catch Jeremiah in a snare, as they did not agree
sufficiently with his prophecy. What does he say, then? First,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the Spirit had fallen upon,
him, </i></font><font face="Palatino">that he might gain a hearing for his
prophecy; for if he had spoken from his own mind he might be rejected with
impunity; for the speakers ought to utter God&#8217;s word, and to be the organ
of his Spirit. The Pope boasts this to his followers, but the true and faithful
servants of God ought to do this in reality, namely, not to utter their own
comments, but to receive from God&#8217;s hands what they deliver to the people,
and thus to discharge their duty faithfully. To this end the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit fell upon
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For although he had been previously
endued with the gift of prophecy, yet as often as he exercised it this grace
ought, to be renewed; because it is not sufficient for us to be imbued once with
the illumination of the Holy Spirit, unless God works in us daily. Since,
therefore, he follows up his gifts in his servants while he uses their
assistance, hence it is not in vain that Ezekiel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit was still given to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because this gift was necessary for
every act. Afterward she expresses more dearly what he had said, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the Spirit had
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it signifies that what he
shortly subjoins had been dictated to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, therefore, he admonishes the Jews that they
should not foolishly promise themselves impunity, when they despised his
prophecies, since he does not speak from himself, but only relates what the
Spirit suggested and dictated.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus have ye spoken, O house of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>said he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I have known the risings of
your heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God here precisely urges the
Jews that they should not hope to obtain anything by turning their backs; for we
know how carelessly and boldly hypocrites reject all teaching, and do not
hesitate to strive with God, since they find many pretexts by which they excuse
themselves. Hence there would be no end, unless the<b> </b>Lord should racet
them, and with the supreme command and power of a judge, should show them that
subterfuges were vain, and make all their excuses idle, and of no moment. This
then is the Prophet&#8217;s meaning when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that whatever rose up in their
heart was known to God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But by these
words he implies, that they sought in vain a theater in the world, as if they
should succeed if they proved their cause before men: he says that it is vain,
because they must come into the court of heaven, where God will be the only
Judge. Now, when our thoughts are known to God, in vain we take up with this or
that; because God will not admit our subterfuges, nor will he allow himself to
be deluded by our smartness and cunning. Now, therefore, we see what the Prophet
means by saying that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God knows
what sprang up in the heart of the Jews,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>because, forsooth, they had never desisted from contending and quarreling by
their fallacies, so as to draw away all confidence from his prophecies. Hence we
see the utility of the doctrine, that we deceive ourselves in vain by acuteness,
so as to escape by our crooked imaginations, because God sees men&#8217;s
cunning, and while they desire to be ingenious, he seizes them, and shows the
vanity of what they think the greatest wisdom. So let us desire to approve
ourselves to God, and not esteem our deeds and plans according to our own sense
and judgment. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">NOW Ezekiel attacks, as it were, in close combat, the
buffoons who trifled with God by their jests, and brings forward that; sense
which I have just before touched on, and of which the <i>prophecy </i>of
Jeremiah was full, in a different manner to that. which they imagined. <i>Ye,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have slain
many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>the city was full of many
slaughters: therefore the pot was full of flesh; this flesh was cooked: there is
no longer any room in the vessel. You must therefore of necessity be cast forth
as froth, or as foul flesh, for which no vessel is found for cooking it. We see,
then, that the Prophet here treats them wittily, and plays off jests in answer
to them; meanwhile he strikes a deadly wound, when he shows that they joked so
petulantly to their own destruction, and boasted that Jeremiah was their
adversary. Hence he confirms the prophecy of Jeremiah, and yet he does not
interpret it, because Jeremiah had spoken properly and clearly, when he said
that they were flesh. The meaning was the same as if God were to pronounce that
he would consume them in the midst of the city. It happened as we have formerly
seen; for he scattered some of the people, and slew some with the sword, and
some with hunger. Whatever it is, the prophecy of Jeremiah will always be found
true, namely, that God had cooked the Jews with the fire of the Chaldees.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:13.) But since they had perverted that doctrine, the Prophet does not regard
the meaning of Jeremiah, but shows that they never profited while they turned
their backs on God. Ye shall not be flesh, says he, but your slain were flesh:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have refilled the
caldron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is the city with the
slain; now there is no room for you. What therefore remains, but that God should
cast you out as foul flesh? Neither will he cook you, says he, nor will he
consume you in a caldron, but where he has stretched you at full length on the
earth, there will he consume you. Now, therefore, we see how great a destruction
the Jews had brought upon themselves, when they took the liberty of joking and
jesting at the Prophets. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had filled the city with the
slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not mean that men had
been openly put to death in Jerusalem, but this form of speech embraces all
forms of injustice; for we know that God esteems those homicides who oppress
miserable men, overturn their fortunes, and suck innocent blood. Since, then,
God esteems all violence as slaughter, he properly says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the city was filled with the
slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Jews might object that no one
had brought violence upon them; they could not be convicted in the sight of men;
but when their wickedness was so gross among themselves, that they did not spare
the wretched, but cruelly afflicted them, he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the city was filled with the
slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now adds, when the city was
full of flesh there was no more place for them, and he now shows that although
Jeremiah had predicted that they should be cooked with the fire of the
Chaldeans, yet they had advanced so far in wickedness, that they were unworthy
of being cooked within the city. Hence, says he, a greater vengeance from God
awaits you, since ye proceed to provoke his anger more and more. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">We ought to join these verses together, because the
Prophet treats the same thing in many words. First
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he denounces that they should
perish by the sword since they feared the
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he admonishes
them, that even if God should draw them out of the city, yet Jeremiah&#8217;s
prophecy would prove true, since the Chaldeans would consume them as if the pot
was boiling on the fire. Lastly, he shows how frivolous was their cavil when
they said, &#8220;if we are flesh, we shall remain in the caldron.&#8221; But
the Prophet shows that they must not cavil like children with God, be<i>cause
</i>when he showed the caldron to his servant Jeremiah, he meant nothing else
than that the Jews should perish, since the Chaldeans would <i>come </i>to
consume them. But they had purposely perverted the Prophet&#8217;s sense, and
thought themselves clever and shrewd when they corrupted the heavenly doctrine.
First of all the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye
have feared the sword, and ye shall fall by the
sword:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> h</i>e afterwards adds the manner:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>says he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> will bring the sword
upon you, which ye feared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will draw you out from the
midst of it. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He declares the manner: namely,
that he will bring them into an open plain, that he may more easily slay them
there. If any should object, that this was not seething them in the city, the
answer is easy: that God did not restrict his wroth to one kind of punishment,
when he thus spoke by Jeremiah. For we know that the Prophets set before us
God&#8217;s judgments in various ways, and thus use various figures. Since
therefore the Prophets do not always teach in the same manner, it is not
surprising if, when he shortly shows that God&#8217;s wrath was near the Jews,
he used that simile: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the sword, and in the borders
of Israel shall I judge you.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here he clearly expresses what I lately touched upon.
It was indeed God&#8217;s judgment, when the Jews were drawn from the city in
which they thought they had a quiet nest: for when they were violently dragged
into exile, God exercised his judgments upon them: and from the time when he
deprived them of their country, then he already began to be their judge. But
here he begins to treat of a severer judgment. Although God had begun to
chastise the Jews when he expelled them from the city, yet he treated them more
severely in the boundaries of Israel; because when they came in sight of the
king of Babylon, then the king saw his</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">slain: then he himself was rendered blind and dragged
into Chaldea, and all the nobles slain. (2 Kings 25; Jeremiah 39.) Hence we may
gather that the people&#8217;s blood was poured out without discrimination. Now
therefore we understand what God means when he threatens
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to judge them in the borders of
Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is without their country.
Lastly, he here denounces a double penalty, first because God would east them
out of Jerusalem in which they delighted, and in which they said that they
should dwell so long that exile would be their first punishment: then he adds,
that he was not content with exile, but that a heavier punishment was at hand,
when they should be cast out of their country, and the land should cast; them
forth as a stench which it cannot bear.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will judge you therefore in the
borders of Israel:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, beyond the
holy land: for since one curse has already occurred in exile, still a harder and
more formidable revenge will await; you. Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall know that I am
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Doubtless Ezekiel reproves the sloth which was the
cause of such great contumacy: for they had never dared to contend so
perseveringly with God, unless their minds had been stupified; for were we to
reflect that we are striving with God, horror would immediately seize upon us;
for who labors under such madness as to dare to contend with God his maker? This
torpor, therefore, Ezekiel now obliquely reproves, when he says that the Jews
would know too late that they were dealing with God. Although therefore they
sinned through ignorance, it does not follow that they were without, excuse, for
whence arose their ignorance except from being inattentive to God? It sprang
first from carelessness: then that carelessness and security produced contempt,
and contempt sprang from their depraved lust of sinning. Since therefore they
determined to give themselves up to all manner of sinning, they put away as far
as possible all teaching: nay they willingly endeavored to stupify their own
consciences, and thus we see that depraved desire impelled them to contempt, and
contempt begat in them security, in which at length this ignorance plunged them.
Since therefore at the time it did not come into their mind to contend with God,
this does not extenuate their fault, because, as I have said, they had stupified
themselves with determined and spontaneous <i>wickedness.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile, it is by no means doubtful that God always
pricked them that they might feel themselves sinners, but the Prophet here
speaks of that knowledge which is called experimental. For the impious are said
to know God when, being struck by his hand, they unwillingly <i>acknowledge
</i>his power: because whether they will or not they feel him to be their judge.
But this <i>knowledge </i>does not profit them; nay even increases their
destruction. But we understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, that the <i>Jews
</i>were rebellious and despised God&#8217;s servants: because they pretended
that they had to do only with men, and covered themselves with darkness, lest
they should behold the light which was offered to their eyes. God pronounces
that they should know at length with whom they contended, as Zechariah says,
they shall see whom they have pierced;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;381210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
12:10;) that is, they shall know that it is I whom they have wounded, when they
so proudly despised my servants, and abjured all confidence<i> </i>in my
teaching. Hence also we gather that the minds of the impious were so confused,
that seeing they did not see; for when they experience God to be their judge,
they are compelled in reality to confess that they feel his hand: yet they
remain stupid, because they do not profit, as the Prophet had just now said,
&#8212; ye feared the sword. But they were careless, as we saw, and despised all
threats. Of what kind, then, is this fear which is remarked upon by the Prophet?
that of the impious forsooth, who while they make for themselves blandishments,
and fancy that they have made a covenant with death, as is said in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
48:22; and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
57:21,) and promise themselves freedom from punishment, even when a scourge is
passing through the land, yet tremble and are always ill-at-ease, because they
have no peace, as it is said elsewhere. In fine, we see the impious always
remaining careless and stupid: though they are careless, yet they tremble and
are tortured with secret impiety, since the severity of God urges them on. At
length he concludes, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem
should not be their caldron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but he
would punish them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the border

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats what he had said, that they would
acknowledge too late how impiously and wickedly they had despised the
prophecies: because this was to draw down God himself from heaven; for God
wishes that reverence which he exacts from us to be given to his own word.
Therefore men rage in contempt of his teaching, as if after the manner of giants
they wished to draw God down from heaven. But he expresses the cause more
clearly: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because indeed they have
not walked in his law and his precepts; but have entangled themselves in the
superstitions of the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we
see that God could not possibly be accused of too much rigor, because he
executed a judgment so heavy and severe against the Jews. For he had given them
the law. This was the greatest ingratitude, to reject the teaching, which ought
to be familiar to them, and at the same time to add to it the impious rites of
the Gentiles: this was to prefer the devil to God himself with full
deliberation. Hence God shows that although he would treat the Jews severely,
yet that his wrath was moderate compared with their sins: because nothing was
wanting to complete their impiety when they so rejected his law. When therefore
he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they did not walk in
the law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he takes this principle for
granted, that the law was not given in vain, but that in it the Jews were,
faithfully and clearly taught the right way, as also Moses says, &#8220;this<i>
</i>is the way, walk ye in it.&#8221; There is no doubt that Ezekiel referred to
that sentence of Moses, when he said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that the Jews did not
walk in the law, and did not perform the judgments of God.

<div><font face="Palatino">Since therefore God has shown the way, so that they
had no excuse for wandering, how great was their ingratitude in leaving the way
and willfully casting themselves into wanderings?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now comparison aggravates their crime, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they preferred the judgments
and rites of the Gentiles which were around
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because they had unbelieving
neighbors, God had opposed his law like a rampart to separate them from the
profane Gentiles. Since therefore they had so far approached these detestable
rites, and that too by rejecting utterly the law of God, do we not perceive that
they were worthy of severe punishment? Meanwhile let us observe, when God has
borne with us a long time, if we persist in our obstinacy, that nothing else is
left but the extinction of the light of doctrine, and that God should show
himself in some other manner. For the Prophet&#8217;s discourse is like a glass,
in which God represents himself. But when we shut our eyes and throw down the
glass and break it, then God shows himself in some other manner; that is, he no
longer thinks it right to show us his face, but teaches us by his hand, and
convinces us of our impious obstinacy by a proof of his power, because we were
unwilling to submit to his teaching. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is by no means doubtful that this Phalatias died
at the same time at which the vision was offered to God&#8217;s servant. We
shall see at the end of the chapter that the Prophet was always in exile; but
then he seemed to himself caught up into the temple, and seemed also to himself
to behold Phalatias dead. And yet it is possible that he died at his own home,
and not in the entrance or threshold of the temple. But we know that the vision
was not limited to places. As, therefore, Ezekiel was only by vision in the
temple, so also he saw the death of Phalatias; and in this way God began by a
kind of prelude to show that the slaughter of the city was at hand. For
Phalatias was one of the chief rulers, as was said in the first verse of this
chapter, and was doubtless a man of good reputation: hence his death was a
presage of a general destruction. Hence this exclamation of the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ah Lord God, wilt thou utterly
consume the remnant of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> for now
only a small number out of an immense multitude remained. Phalatias is seized,
and in this way he shows that destruction hangs over the whole people. Hence it
came to pass that the Prophet fell upon the earth astonished, and exclaimed that
it was by no means agreeable to God&#8217;s promises to destroy the remnant of
Israel. For some remnant ought to remain, as we often see in other places: even
in the general slaughter of the whole people, God always gave some hope that he
would not abolish his covenant. For this reason the Prophet now
exclaims.</font><br></div>

that we may willingly humble and renounce ourselves; and not only do thou
mitigate the punishments which otherwise hang over us, but also show thyself a
merciful and gracious Father towards us, until at length we enjoy the fullness
of thy fatherly love in thy heavenly kingdom, through Christ our Lord. &#8212;

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
TWENTY-NINTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IN the last Lecture the Prophet&#8217;s complaint and
lamentation on account of the death of Phalatias, was described to us. He had
heard indeed by the Spirit that Phalatias and others like him were impious
despisers of God, and corrupters of his whole worship: yet he exclaims when he
sees him dead, as if all things were lost. But we must remember that the Prophet
did not speak in his own
senses.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
F236</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He regards also the reputation and
dignity of Phalatias, for there is no doubt that he excelled the other elders,
as the greater of the people thought their own stability depended on his counsel
and prudence. Since, therefore, almost all thought Phalatias to be the support
of the city and kingdom, it is not surprising that the Prophet, according to the
common opinion, asks with wonder whether God is about to consume every remnant
of the people. And he alludes to the man&#8217;s name, For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">flp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>phelet, </i>is to escape; whence
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yfylp</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(phelitim) </i>is the name for survivors, and those who escape from any
danger or slaughter. Since, therefore, Phalatias carried in his very name
something of this kind, viz., if there was any hope of safety for them, it
resided in his person: for this reason the Prophet asks whether God will destroy
the remnant of his people. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God seems to rebuke the thoughtlessness of his
servant, or rather the error of the people, because we said that the Prophet
announced not what he privately thought, but what was commonly received.
Whatever it is, God answers his complaint as we saw, and shows that even if he
takes away from the midst the eminent and conspicuous, and those who seem to be
the supports of a city and kingdom, yet the Church does not perish on that
account, because he has hidden reasons why he preserves it, not in splendid and
magnificent pomp, as men call it, but that its safety may at length excite
admiration. The sum of the matter is, therefore, although not only Phalatias,
but all the councillors of the king, and all the leaders of the people should
perish, yet that God can work in weakness, so that the Church shall nevertheless
remain safe: and so he teaches that the remnant must not be sought in that rank
which was then conspicuous, but rather among men ordinary and despised. Now we
understand the intention of God in this answer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy brethren, thy brethren, and
the men of thy relationship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. H</i>e here
recalls his servant to the exiles and the captives, of whom he himself was one,
as if he would say that they were not cast out of the Church, as they were still
in some estimation. For God seemed to east them off when he banished them from
the promised land; but he now shows that they were reckoned among his sons
although disinherited from the land of Canaan. Hence he twice repeats the name
of brethren, and adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of thy
relationship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the Prophet might
rather reckon himself also to be among the number. Those who refer this to the
three exiles, weaken the vehemence of the passage, whilst they obtrude an
inappropriate comment, and turn away the reader from the genuine sense of the
Prophet. But rather, as I lately hinted,. God here chastises the Prophet because
he perversely restricts the body of the Church to the citizens at Jerusalem; as
if he said, although the Israelites are captives, yet do they seem to you
foreigners? and so will you not leave them a place in the Church? <i>They are,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy brethren, thy
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the men of thy
relationship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence the repetition is
emphatic, and tends to this purpose, that the Prophet may cease to measure
God&#8217;s grace by the safety of the city alone, as he had done. Because one
man had suddenly died, he thought that all must perish. Meanwhile he did not
<i>perceive </i>how he injured the miserable exiles, whom God had so expelled
from the land of Canaan, that yet some hope of pity remained, as all the
Prophets show, and as we shall soon see. This passage then is worthy of
observation, that we may learn not to estimate the state of the Church by the
common opinion of mankind. And so with respect to the splendor which too often
blinds the eyes of the simple. For it will so happen, that we think we have
found the Church where there is none, and we despair if it does not offer itself
to our eyes; as we see at this day that many are astonished by those magnificent
pomps which are conspicuous in the Papacy. There the name of &#8220;The
Church&#8221; keeps flying bravely in the face of all: there also its marks are
brought forward: the simple are attracted to the empty spectacle: so under the
name of the Church they are drawn to destruction; because they determine that
the Church is there where that splendor which deceives them is seen. On the
other hand, many who cannot discern the Church with their eyes and point to it
with the finger, accuse God of deceiving them, as if all the faithful in the
world were extinct. We must hold, therefore, that the Church is often
wonderfully preserved in its hiding &#8212; places: for its members are not
luxurious men, or such as win the veneration of the foolish by vain ostentation;
but rather ordinary men, of no estimation in the world. We have a memorable
example of this, when God recalls his own Prophet from the chief leaders at
Jerusalem, not to other leaders, who should attract men to wonder at themselves,
but to miserable exiles, whose dispersion rendered them despicable. He shows
therefore that some remnants were left even in Chaldea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to whom the inhabitants of
Jerusalem said, depart, ye far from the sanctuary of Jehovah, the land is given
to us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God inveighs against the
arrogance of the people, which remained at home quiet and careless. For he here
relates the words of the citizens of Jerusalem, because, forsooth, they
preferred themselves to the exiles, nay boasted that they were alienated from
the holy people because they had been dragged into exile, or had left the city
of their own accord. As to their saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>depart afar
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it ought not to be taken strictly
in the imperative mood; but the speech ought so to be understood, that while
they depart far from the sanctuary, the land will remain as an inheritance for
us. We see, therefore, that the citizens of Jerusalem pleased themselves, and
were satisfied with their own ease, since they still enjoyed their country,
worshipped God in the temple, and the name of a kingdom was still standing.
Since therefore they so enjoyed themselves, God shows that on the contrary they
were blinded with pride, since he had not entirely cast away his captives,
although he afflicted them with temporal punishment. But this their boasting was
<i>very </i>foolish, in congratulating themselves on their escape from exile.
For meanwhile what was their state? In truth their king&#8217; was treated with
ignominy, and we know what happened to themselves afterwards; for they were
reduced to such straits, that mothers devoured their children, and those
nourished in great, luxury consumed their dung. Nay even before the city was
besieged, what reason was left them for boasting in themselves! but we here
perceive how great was their obstinacy in which they hardened themselves against
the scourge of God. Hence they stupidly supposed that God could not subdue them.
Now what is their ferocity, that they insult over the miserable exiles as if
they were cast away far from God? since Ezekiel and Daniel and their companions
were among these exiles. We know that Daniel&#8217;s piety was so celebrated at
Jerusalem, that they all acknowledged him as the peculiar gift and ornament of
his age. When, therefore, Daniel was in such estimation for superior piety, how
could they erect their crests against him &#8212; since they were Conscious of
many crimes, profane, full of all defilements, addicted to cruelty, fraud, and
perjury, being foul in their abominations, and infamous in their
intemperance?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since therefore we see that they so boldly insulted
their brethren, can we wonder that at this day the Papists also are fierce,
because they retain the ordinary succession and the title of the Church, and
that they say that we are cast away and cut off from the Church, and so are
unworthy of enjoying either a name or a place among Christians? If, therefore,
at this day the Papists are so hot against us, there is no reason why their
haughtiness should disturb us; but in this mirror we may learn that it always
was so. But there was another reason why the citizens of Jerusalem said that
their captives were cast far away. For it was clear that their exile was the
just penalty for their crimes; but meanwhile how did they dare separate
themselves from others, when their life was more wicked? Lastly, since God had
already passed sentence upon them, their condition could not be really different
from theirs, concerning whom the judge had pronounced his opinion, but they were
deaf to all the Prophets&#8217; threats, so that they despised God, and hence
that boasting which treated all as foreigners who did not remain in the land of
Canaan. This passage also teaches us, that if God at any time chastises those
who profess the same religion with us, yet there is no reason why we should
entirely condemn them, as if they were desperate; for opportunity must be given
for the mercy of God. And we must diligently mark what follows. For after the
Prophet has related that the citizens of Jerusalem boasted when they thought
themselves the sole survivors, God answers on the contrary,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they were cast away far
among the nations, and dispersed among the lands, or through the lands,
therefore I shall be to them as a small
sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that God even here claims some place for
sinners in the Church, against whom he had exercised the rigor of his judgment.
He says, by way of concession,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they were cast away and
dispersed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was still with them for a
sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>nay, because they bore their
exile calmly and with equanimity, they pronounce this to be a reason why he
should pity them. For neither is their sentence so general that God overlooked
his own elect. This promise then ought not to be extended to all the captives
without discrimination, because we shall see that God included only a few.
Without doubt then, this was a peculiar promise which God wished to be a
consolation to his elect. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they bore
exile</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and dispersion with calmness and
composure, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore God would be
a sanctuary to them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But this was a
gracious approval of their modesty and subjection, because they not only
suffered exile but also dispersion, which was more severe. For if they had all
been drawn into a distant region this had been a severe trial, but still they
might have united more easily, had they not been dispersed. This second
punishment was the sadder to them, because they perceived in it the material for
despair, as if they could never be collected together again in one
body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">thus their wrestling with these temptations was a
sign of no little piety; and as some of the faithful did not demonstrate their
obedience at once, yet because God knows his own,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:19,) and watches for their safety, hence he here opposes to all their
miseries that protection on which their safety was founded. Because, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were dispersed through the
lands, hence,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be to them a small
sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The third person is here used. Interpreters make
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">f[m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
megnet, </i>mean the noun <i>toar, </i>and understand it as &#8220;a small
sanctuary,&#8221;<i> </i>although it may be taken for a paucity of men, and we
may, therefore, fairly translate it &#8220;a<i> </i>sanctuary of
security.&#8221; Although the other sense suits the passage best, that God would
be a small sanctuary to the captives, so there will be an antithesis between the
splendor of the visible temple and the hidden grace of God, which so escaped the
notice of the Chaldeans that they rather trod it under foot, and even the Jews
who still remained at Jerusalem despised it. The sanctuary, therefore, which God
had chosen for himself on Mount Zion, because it deservedly attracted all eyes
towards it, and the Israelites were always gazing at it, since it revealed the
majesty of God, might be called the magnificent sanctuary of God: nothing of the
sort was seen in the Babylonish exile: but God says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was to the captives as a
small</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or contracted
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This place answers to the 90th Psalm, where Moses says, Thou, O God, hast
always been a tabernacle to us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:1,) and yet God had not always either a temple or a tabernacle from which he
entered into a covenant with the fathers. But Moses there <i>teaches </i>what
God afterwards represented by a visible symbol, that the fathers really thought
that they truly lay hid under the shadow of God&#8217;s wings, and were not
otherwise safe and sheltered unless God protected them. Moses, therefore, in the
name of the fathers, celebrates the grace of God which was continual even before
the sanctuary was built. So also in this place God says by a figure,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was their
sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not that he had erected an
altar there, but because the Israelites were destitute of any external pledge
and symbol, he reminds them that the thing itself was not entirely taken away,
since God had his wings outstretched to cherish and defend them. This passage is
also worthy of notice, lest the faithful should despond where God has no
standard erected: although he does not openly go before them with royal ensigns
to preserve them, yet they need not conclude themselves altogether deserted; but
they should recall to remembrance what is here said of a <i>small sanctuary.
</i>God, therefore, although he does not openly exhibit his influence, yet he
does not cease to preserve them by a secret power, of which in this our age we
have a very remarkable proof. The world indeed thinks us lost as often as the
Church is materially injured, and the greater part become very anxious, as if
God had deserted them. Then let this promise be remembered as a remedy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is to the dispersed and cast
away a small sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>so that although
his hand is hidden, yet our safety proves that he has worked powerfully in our
weakness. We see then that this sense is most suitable, and contains very useful
doctrine. Yet the other sense will suit, that God is &#8220;the sanctuary of a
few,&#8221;<i> </i>because in that great multitude but few remain who are really
the people of God, for the greater part was ignorant of him; since then God does
not regard that multitude of the impious which was already within the Church,
but only here directs his discourse towards his own elect, it is not surprising
that he asserts them to be but few in number. Now it follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Now God expresses the effect of his grace. In the
last verse he had said that he would be a sanctuary. I have reminded you that
these words ought not to be understood of a visible place in which God was
worshipped, but of that hidden influence by which he cherishes his people. But
if the exile had been perpetual, that promise might seem vain. Why then did God
protect his people in exile, if he wished them to be consumed there? because
otherwise his covenant would have been in vain. Therefore lest any one should
object that God deceives his faithful ones, when he pronounces that he would be
their sanctuary, he now points out its result, viz., that he would restore them
to their country.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will collect you
from the people, and gather you from the nations to which ye have been, driven,
and I will give you the land of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Since therefore a return to their country was a certain pledge of
God&#8217;s love, hence he announces that they should at length return On the
whole the restitution of the Church is promised, which should confirm
God&#8217;s covenant. In it had been said to Abraham, I will give this land to
thee and to thy seed for ever.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
13:15; and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:8.) God, therefore, to show his covenant still remaining entire and secure,
which he had interrupted for a short time, here speaks concerning this
restoration. And as to the Prophet so often inculcating the name of God, and
relating his orders in God&#8217;s name, and directing his discourse to the
captives, this tends to confirm his message, because in such a desperate state
of things it was difficult to wait patiently for what the Prophet taught, viz.,
that a time would come when God would collect them again, and recall them home.
Hence the faithful were admonished that they must consider God&#8217;s power,
and put their trust in this prophecy. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he adds something more important &#8212; that
when the Israelites had returned to their country they would be sincere
worshippers of God, and not only offer sacrifices in the temple, but purge the
land of all its pollutions. Here also the Prophet admonishes them how great and
detestable was the impiety of the ten tribes, because they had contaminated the
land with idols. He does not here allude to the idols of the Gentiles, but
rather reproves the Israelites because they had contaminated with their
defilements the land which had been dedicated to God. Hence the Prophet exhorted
his countrymen to repentance, when he shows that they were not cast out of the
land before it was polluted; and therefore that they were justly punished for
their sacrilege. This is one point. Afterwards we must remark, that we then
truly and purely enjoy God&#8217;s blessings, when we direct their use to that
end which is here set before us, namely, pure and proper worship. Nothing more
frequently meets us than this teaching &#8212; that we have been redeemed by God
that we may celebrate his glory; that the Church was planted that in it he may
be glorified, and we may make known his attributes. Hence let us learn that
God&#8217;s benefits then issue in our safety, and are testimonies of his
paternal favor when they excite us to worship him. Thirdly, we must remark, that
we do not rightly discharge our duty towards God, unless when we purge his
worship from all stain and defilement. Many so worship God, that they corrupt
with vicious mixtures whatever obedience they seem to render. And to this day
even, those who seem to themselves very wise, are shamefully divided between God
and the devil, as if they could satisfy God with half their allegiance. Hence
let us learn from this passage, that God abhors such deceivers; for when he says
that the Israelites after their return should be devoted to piety, he indicates
it by this mark <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they shall take away all
their abominations, and all their idols from the

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As God had already spoken concerning the piety of the
Israelites, he shows that they could not forsake their sins until they were
renewed, and so born again by his Spirit. Therefore he seemed in the last verse
to praise the Israelites; but because men too eagerly claim as their own what
has been given them from above, now God claims to himself glow of their virtues,
of which he had formerly spoken. Their zeal in purging the land of all
abominations was worthy of praise; hence the survivors of the people of Israel
are deservedly celebrated, because they were impelled by the fervor of zeal to
free the worship of God from all corruptions; but lest they should boast, that
they had done it in their own strength, and from the impulse of their own
hearts, God now modifies his former assertions, and shows that such pursuit of
piety would exist among the Israelites, after he had regenerated them by his
Spirit. And this plea alone may suffice to refute the Papists, as often as they
seize upon such passages from the Scriptures, where God either exacts something
from his people, or proclaims their virtues. David does this; hence he does it
of his own free will: God requires this; hence it is in the will of men that
they are equal to the performance of all things. Thus they trifle. But we see
that the Prophet unites two things together, namely, the faithful elect of God
strenuously attending to their duty, and intent on promoting his glory, even
with ardor in the pursuit of his worship; and yet they were nothing by
themselves. Hence it is added immediately afterwards &#8212; I will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give them one heart, and will put
a new spirit in their breasts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we
must defer the rest to the next lecture.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, O Almighty God, that we may learn

promises which are common to us also, that we may wait till thy Church emerges
again from the darkness of death. Meanwhile, may we be content with thy help,
however weak as to outward appearance, till at length it shall appear that our
patience was not delusive, when we enjoy the reward of our faith and patience in
thy heavenly kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
THIRTIETH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last lecture, after Ezekiel had announced the
conversion of the people, at the same time he taught that the singular gift of
repentance would be bestowed: because when any one has turned aside from the
right way, unless God extends his hand, he will plunge himself even into the
deep abyss. Hence after a man has once left God, he cannot return to him by
himself. We then touched shortly on this doctrine: now a fuller explanation must
be added. As soon as we consider the Prophet&#8217;s words, we shall at once
understand the matter. God promises
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to give the people one
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some explain this of mutual
consent, but it does not suit in my opinion. In the third chapter of Zephaniah,
at verse 9,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;360309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
3:9) &#8220;one<i> </i>shoulder&#8221; is taken in this sense. For when the
Prophet says, that God would make all call upon him purely and worship with one
shoulder, he seems to mean that all should be unanimous, and that each would
excite, his neighbor. But in this place one heart is rather opposed to a divided
one; for the Israelites were distracted after vague errors. They ought to listen
to God&#8217;s precepts, and subject themselves to his law: thus they had been
content with him alone, and had addicted themselves entirely to true piety. But
their heart was distracted: as when a woman does not preserve her fidelity to
her husband, but is led away by her lusts, nothing is at rest in her. So also
when the people revolted from the law of God, it was like a wandering harlot. We
see, therefore, that the hearts of all the impious were divided and distracted,
and that nothing in them was simple or sincere. Now God promises that he would
take care that the people were not drawn aside after their superstitions, but
remained in pure and simple obedience to the law. If any one objects, that the
faithful endure a perpetual contest with the lusts of the flesh, and hence their
heart is divided, the answer is easy, that one heart is understood in the sense
of regeneration. For although the faithful feel a great contest within them, and
their heart is by no means whole, since it is agitated by many temptations, yet
as in the meantime they seriously aspire to God, their heart is said to be
entire, because it is not double or feigned. We understand then what the Prophet
means, and at chapter 36, (Jeremiah 36) where he repeats the same sentiment, for
one heart he puts a new spirit, as also he says a little afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will put a new spirit in their
bowels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>inward parts. </i>As by
the word heart he means affections, so also by the spirit he signifies the mind
itself and all its thoughts. the spirit of a man is often taken for the whole
soul, and then it comprehends also all the affections. But where the two are
joined together, as the heart and spirit, the heart is called the seat of all
the affections, it is in truth the very will of man, while the spirit is the
faculty of intelligence. For we know that there are two special endowments of
the mind: the first is its power of reasoning, and the next its being endued
with judgment and choice: afterwards we shall say how men have the faculty of
choosing and yet want free will. But this principle must be held, that the soul
of man excels first in intelligence or reason, then in judgment, on which choice
and will depend. We see, therefore, that by these words the Prophet testifies
that men have need of a complete renovation that they may return into the way
from which they once began to wander.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away the heart of
stone, or the stony heart, from their flesh, and will give them a heart of
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word flesh is here received
in a different sense; for the Prophet alludes to the heart, which we know to be
part of the human body, when he <i>says,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away the heart of
stone from their flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When God
regenerates his elect, he does not change either their flesh, or skin, or blood;
the spiritual and interior grace has no relation to their body: but the Prophet
speaks rather grossly, that he may conform his discourse to the state of a rude
and gross people. For flesh in the former clause meant the same as body: but at
the end of the &#8216;verse a fleshy heart is put for a flexible heart: an
opposition also must. be marked between the flesh and a stone: a stone by its
own hardness repels even the strongest blows of the hammers, and nothing can be
inscribed on it; but the fleshy heart by its softness admits whatever is
inscribed or engraven on it. The Prophet speaks grossly, as I have said, yet the
sense is by no means ambiguous: namely, since the Israelites were full of
obstinacy, God afterwards changed their heart, so that they became flexible and
obedient that is, by correcting their hardness he rendered their heart
soft.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may walk in my
statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>keep my
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall be my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now the Prophet more clearly
expresses how God would give his elect hearts of flesh instead of those of
stone, when he regenerates them by his Spirit, and when he forms them to obey
his law, so that they may willingly observe his commands, and efficiently
accomplish what he causes them to will. Now let us consider more attentively the
whole matter of which the Prophet treats. When God speaks of a stony heart, he
doubtless condemns all mortals of obstinacy. For the Prophet is not here
treating of a few whose nature differs from others, but as in a glass he puts
the Israelites before us, that we know what our condition is, when being
deserted by God we follow our natural inclinations. We collect, therefore, from
this place, that all have a heart of stone, that is, that all are so corrupt
that they cannot bear to obey God, since<i> </i>they are entirely carried away
to obstinacy. Meanwhile it is certain that this fault is adventitious: for when
God created man he did not bestow upon him a heart of stone, and as long as Adam
stood sinless, doubtless his will was upright and well disposed, and it was also
inclined to obedience to God. When therefore we say that our heart is of stone,
this takes its origin from the fall of Adam, and from the corruption of our
nature; for if Adam had been created with a hard and obstinate heart, that would
have been a reproach to God. But as we have said, the will of Adam was upright
from the beginning, and flexible to follow the righteousness of God; but when
Adam corrupted himself, we perished with him. Hence, therefore, the stony heart,
because we have put off that integrity of nature which God had conferred upon us
at the beginning. For whatever Adam lost we also lost by the fall: because he
was not created for his own self alone, but in his person God showed what would
be the condition of the human race. Hence after he had been spoiled of the
excellent gifts by which he was adorned, all his posterity were reduced to the
same want and misery. Hence our heart is stony; but through original depravity,
because we ought to attribute this to our father Adam, and not to throw the
fault of our sin and corruption on God. Finally, we see what the beginning of
regeneration is, namely, when God takes away that depravity by which we are
bound down. But two parts of regeneration must be marked, of which also the
Prophet treats.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God pronounces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he gives to his elect one
heart and new spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It follows,
therefore, that the whole soul is vitiated, from reason even to the affections.
The sophists in the Papacy confess that man&#8217;s soul is vitiated, but only
in part. They are also compelled to subscribe to the ancients, that Adam lost
supernatural gifts, and that natural ones were corrupted, but afterwards they
involve the light in darkness, and feign that some part of the reason remains
sound and entire, then that the will is vitiated only in part: hence it is a
common saying of theirs, that man&#8217;s free will was wounded and injured, but
that it did not perish. Now they define free will, the free faculty of choice,
which is joined with reason and also depends upon it. For the will by itself,
without the judgment, does not contain full and solid liberty, but when reason
governs and holds the chief power in the soul of man, then the will obeys and
forms itself after the <i>prescribed </i>rule: that is free will. The Papists do
not deny that free will is injured and wounded, but as I have already said, they
hold back something, as if men were partly right by their own proper motion, and
some inclination or flexible motion of the will remained as well towards good as
evil. Thus indeed they prate in the schools: but we see what the Holy Spirit
pronounces. For if there is need of a new spirit and a new heart, it follows
that the soul of man is not only injured in each part, but so corrupt that its
depravity may be called death and destruction, as far as rectitude is concerned.
But here a question is objected, whether men differ at all from brute beasts?
But experience proves that men are endued with some reason. I answer, as it is
said in the first chapter of John,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:5,) that light shines in darkness; that is, that some sparks of intelligence
remain, but so far from leading any man into the way, they do not enable him to
see it. Hence whatever reason and intelligence there is in us, it does not bring
us into the path of obedience to God, and much less leads by continual
perseverance to the goal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What then? These very sparks shine in the darkness to
render men without excuse. Behold, therefore, how far man&#8217;s reason
prevails, that he may feel self-convinced that no pretext for ignorance or error
remains to him. Therefore man&#8217;s intelligence is altogether useless towards
guiding his life aright. Perverseness more clearly appears in his heart. For
man&#8217;s will boils over to obstinacy, and when anything right and what God
approves is put before us, our affections immediately become restive and
ferocious; like a refractory horse when he feels the spur leaps up and strikes
his rider, so our will betrays its obstinacy when it admits nothing but what
reason and a sound intelligence dictates. I have already taught that man&#8217;s
reason is blind, but that blindness is not so perspicuous in us, because, as I
have said, God has left in us some light, that no excuse for error should
remain. It is not surprising, then, if God here promises
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would give a new
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because if we examine all the
affections of men, we shall find them hostile to God. For that passage of St.
Paul
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:9) is true, that all the thoughts of the flesh are hostile to God. Doubtless
he ],ere takes the flesh after his own manner, namely, as signifying&#8217; the
whole man as he is by nature and is born into the world. Since, therefore, all
our affections are hostile and repugnant to God, we see how foolishly the
schoolmen trifle, who feign that the will is injured, and so this weakness is to
them in the place of death. Paul says that he was sold under sin, that is, as
far as he was one of the sons of Adam: The law, he says, works in us sin,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:14,) I am sold and enslaved to sin. But what do they say? That sin indeed
reigns in us, but only in part, for there is some integrity which resists it.
How far they differ from St. Paul! But this passage also with sufficient
clearness refutes comments of this kind, where God
pronounces</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that newness of heart
and spirit is his own free gift</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Therefore Scripture uses the name of creation elsewhere, which is worthy of
notice. For as often as the Papists boast that they have even the least particle
of rectitude, they reckon themselves creators: since when Paul says that we are
born again by God&#8217;s Spirit, he calls us
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;
poi&gt;hma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>his fashioning or workmanship,
and explains that we are created unto good works.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:10.) To the same purpose is the language of the Psalm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19A003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
100:3,) he made us, not we ourselves. For he is not treating here of that first
creation by which we became men, but of that special grace by which we are born
again by the Spirit of God. If therefore regeneration is a creation of man,
whoever arrogates to himself even the least share in the matter, seizes so much
from God, as if he were his own creator, which is detestable to be heard of. And
yet this is easily elicited from the common teaching of
Scripture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they shall walk in my
statutes, and keep my precepts and do them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here the Prophet removes other doubts, by which Satan has endeavored to
obscure the grace of God, because he could not entirely destroy it. We have
already seen that the Papists do not entirely take away the grace of God; for
they are compelled to confess that man can do nothing except he is assisted by
God&#8217;s grace: that free will lies without vigor and efficacy until it
revives by the assistance of grace. Hence they have that in common with us, that
man, as he is corrupt, cannot even move a finger so as to discharge any duty
towards God. But here they err in two ways, because, as I have already said,
they feign that some-right motion remains in man&#8217;s will, besides that
there is sound reason in the mind; and they afterwards add that the grace of the
Holy Spirit is not efficacious without the concurrence or co-operation of our
free will. And here their gross impiety is detected. Hence they confess that we
are regenerated by the Spirit of God, because we should otherwise be useless to
think anything aright, namely, because weakness hinders us from willing
efficaciously. But, on the contrary, they imagine God&#8217;s grace to be
mutilated, but how? because God&#8217;s grace stirs us up towards ourselves, so
that we become able to wish well, and also to follow out and perfect what we
have willed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see, therefore, that when they treat of the grace
of the Holy Spirit, they leave man suspended in the midst. How far then does the
Spirit of God work within us? They say, that we may be able to will rightly and
to act rightly. Hence nothing else is given us by the Holy Spirit but the
ability: but it is ours to co-operate, and to strengthen and to establish what
otherwise would be of no avail. For what advantage is there in the ability
without the addition of the upright will? Our condemnation would only be
increased. But here is their ridiculous ignorance, for how could any one stand
even for a single moment, if God conferred on us only the ability. Adam had that
ability in his first creation, and. then he was as yet perfect, but we are
depraved; so that as far as the remains of the flesh abide in us which we carry
about in this life, we must strive with great difficulties. If therefore Adam by
and bye fell, although endued with rectitude of nature and with the faculty of
willing and of acting uprightly, what will become of us? for we have need not
only of Adam&#8217;s uprightness, and of his faculty of both willing and acting
uprightly, but we have need of unconquered fortitude, that we may not yield to
temptations, but be superior to the devil, and subdue all depraved and vicious
affections of the flesh, and persevere unto the end in this wrestling or
warfare. We see, therefore, how childishly they trifle who ascribe nothing else
to the grace of the Holy Spirit unless the gift of ability. And Augustine
expounds this wisely, and treats it at sufficient length in his book
&#8220;Concerning the gift of perseverance, and the predestination of the
saints;&#8221; for he compares us with the first Adam, and shows that
God&#8217;s grace would not be efficacious, except in the case of a single
individual, unless he granted us more than the ability. But what need have we of
human testimonies, when the Holy Spirit clearly pronounces by the mouth of his
Prophet what we here read? Ezekiel does not say: I will give them a. new spirit
or a new heart, that they may walk and be endued with that moderate faculty:
what then? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may walk in
my precepts, that they may keep my statutes, and perform, my
commands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see therefore that
regeneration extends so far that the effect follows, as also Paul teaches:
Complete, says he, your salvation with fear and trembling,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;503512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:12;) here he exhorts the faithful to the attempt. And truly God does not wish
us to be like stones. Let us strive therefore and stretch all our nerves, and do
our utmost towards acting uprightly: but Paul advises that to be done with fear
and trembling; that is, by casting away all confidence in one&#8217;s own
strength, because if we are intoxicated with that diabolical pretense that we
are fellow-workers with God, and that his grace is assisted by the motion of our
free will, we shall break down, and at length God will show how great our
blindness was. Paul gives the reason, because, says he, it is God who works both
to will and to accomplish.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;503813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:13.) He does not say there that it is God who works the ability, and who
excites in us the power of willing, but he says that God is the author of that
upright will, and then he adds also the effect; because it is not sufficient to
will unless we are able to execute. As to the word &#8220;power,&#8221;<i>
</i>Paul does not use it, for it would occasion dispute, but he says that God
works in all of us to accomplish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one object, that men naturally will and act<i>
</i>naturally by their own proper judgment and motion, I answer, that the will
is naturally implanted in man, whence this faculty belongs equally to the elect
and the reprobate. All therefore will, but through Adam&#8217;s fall it happens
that our will is depraved and rebellious against God: will, I say, remains in
us, but it is enslaved and bound by sin. Whence then comes an upright will? Even
from regeneration by the Spirit. Hence the Spirit does not confer on us the
faculty of willing: for it is inherent to us from our birth, that is, it is
hereditary, and a part of the creation which could not be blotted out by
Adam&#8217;s fall; but when the will is in us, God gives us to will rightly, and
this is his work. Besides, when it is said that he gives us the power of
willing, this is not understood generally, because it ought not to be extended
to the bad as well as to the good; but when Paul is treating of the salvation of
men, he deservedly assigns to God our willing uprightly. We now understand what
the Prophet&#8217;s words signify, and it seems that he denotes perseverance
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may walk
in my precepts, and keep my judgments and do
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. the</i> whole matter had been
explained in one word, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they
may walk in my statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>but because men
always sinfully consider how they may lessen the grace of God, and by
sacrilegious boldness endeavor to draw to themselves what belongs to him;
therefore that. the Prophet may better exclude all pride, he says that we must
attribute to God the walking in his precepts, preserving his statutes, and
obeying his whole law. Hence let us leave entirely his own praise to God, and
thus acknowledge that in our good works nothing is our own; and especially in
perseverance, let us reckon it God&#8217;s singular gift: and this is surely
necessary, if we consider how very weak we are, and with how many and what
violent attacks Satan continually urges us. First of all, we may easily fall
every moment, unless God sustain us: and then the thrusts of Satan by far exceed
our strength. If therefore we consider our condition without the grace of God,
we shall confess that in our good works the only part which is ours is the
fault, as also Augustine wisely makes this exception: for it is sufficiently
known that no work is so praiseworthy as not to be sprinkled with some fault.
Neither do the duties which we discharge proceed from a perfect love of God, but
we have always to wrestle that we may obey him. We seem then to contaminate our
deeds by this defect. There is then in our good works that very thing which
vitiates them, so that they are deservedly rejected before God. But when we
treat of uprightness and praise, we must learn to leave to God what is his own,
lest we wish to be partakers in sacrilege.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall be my people, and
I will be their God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Under these words
the Prophet doubtless includes that gratuitous pardon by which God reconciles
sinners to himself. And truly, it would not be sufficient for us to be renewed
in obedience to God&#8217;s righteousness unless his paternal indulgence, by
which he pardons our infirmities, is added. This is expressed more clearly by
Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:33,) and by our Prophet,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
36:25-27,) but it is the mark of a Scripture phrase. For as often as God
promises the sons of Abraham that they should be his people, that promise has no
other foundation than in his gratuitous covenant which contains the forgiveness
of sins. Hence it is as if the Prophet had added, that God would expiate all the
faults of his people. For our safety is contained in these two members, that God
follows us with his paternal favor, while he bears with us, and does not call us
up for judgment, but buries our sins, as is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
32:1, 2, Blessed is the man to whom God does not impute his
iniquities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows, on the other side, that all are wretched
and accursed to whom he does impute them. If any one object, that we have no
need of pardon when we do not sin, the answer is easy, that the faithful are
never so regenerated as to fulfill the law of God. They aspire to keep his
commands, and that too with a serious and sincere affection; but because some
defects always remain, therefore they are guilty, and their guilt cannot be
blotted out otherwise than by expiation when God pardons them. But we know that
there were under the law rites prescribed for expiating their sins: this was the
meaning of sprinkling by water and the pouring out of blood; but we know that
these ceremonies were of no value in themselves, except as far as they directed
the people&#8217;s faith to Christ. Hence, whenever our salvation is; treated
of, let these two things be remembered, that we cannot be reckoned God&#8217;s
sons unless he freely expiate our sins, and thus reconcile himself to us: and
then not unless he also rule us by his Spirit. Now we must hold, that what God
hath joined man ought not to separate. Those, therefore, who through relying on
the indulgence of God permit themselves to give way to sin, rend his covenant
and impiously sever it. Why so? because God has joined these two things
together, viz., that he will be propitious to his sons, and will also renew
their hearts, Hence those who lay hold of only one member of the sentence,
namely, the pardon, because God bears with them, and omit the other, are as
false and sacrilegious as if they abolished half of God&#8217;s covenant.
Therefore we must hold what I have said, namely, that under these words
reconciliation is pointed out, by which it happens that God does not impute
their sins to his own. Lastly, let us remark that the whole perfection of our
salvation has been placed in this, if God reckons us among his people. As it is
said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
33:12,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Happy<i> </i>is
the people to whom Jehovah is their God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There solid happiness is described, namely, when God
deems any people worthy of this honor of belonging peculiarly to himself. Only
let him be propitious to us, and then we shall not be anxious, because our
salvation is secure. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The phrase which the Prophet uses is indeed harsh: he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>goes after
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that some interpret this of
imitation: namely, since God promises that he will be an avenger if any of the
people conduct themselves after bad examples and unite in alliance with the
wicked, just as if they glued together their hearts and affections, but that is
harsh. The repetition is therefore superfluous, and the Prophet means nothing
else than that God will be avenged if the Israelites follow their own heart, so
as to walk in their own foulness and abominations. First of all we must
understand the reason why the Prophet uses this sentiment. God had liberally
poured out the treasures of his mercy, but since, hypocrites have always been
mixed with the good, at the same time that they confidently boast themselves
members of the Church, and use the name of God with great audacity; so that the
Prophet uses this threat that they may not think all the promises which we hear
of to belong to themselves promiscuously. For there were always many reprobate
among the elect people, because not all who sprang from father Abraham were true
Israelites.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:6, 7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since therefore it was so, the Prophet properly shows
here that what he had previously promised was peculiar to God&#8217;s elect, and
to the true and lawful members of the Church, but not to the spurious, nor to
the degenerate, nor to those who are unregenerated by the true and incorruptible
seed. This is the Prophet&#8217;s intention. But lest there might seem to be too
much rigor when God, as it were, armed comes down into the midst to destroy all
who do not repent, the Prophet here declares their crime &#8212; namely, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their heart walks after their
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, thine heart draws
itself, and so the word heart is twice repeated. It is indeed a superfluous
repetition but emphatic, when he says, that the heart of those who so
pertinaciously adhere to their own superstitions is then impelled by its own
self to new motions, so that by its continual tenor it goes always towards
superstitions. Hence I will be an avenger, says God. Hence as often as God
proposes to us testimonies of his favor, let each descend into himself and
examine all his affections. But when any one lays hold of his own vices let him
not please himself in them, but rather groan over them, and strive to renounce
his own affections that he may follow God: neither let him harden himself in
obstinacy, so that his heart may not proceed and rush continually towards evil,
as is here said.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Ezekiel repeats what we saw before, namely, that
God as he had chosen Mount Zion had at length rejected it, because that place
had been polluted by the many wickednesses of the people. The Jews fancied that
God was, as it were, held captive among them, and in this confidence they gave
themselves up to licentiousness. Hence the Prophet shows them that God was not
so bound to them as not to go wherever he pleased, and what is more, he
announces that he has migrated, and that the temple is deprived of his glory.
This indeed was almost incredible. For since God had pro-raised to dwell there
perpetually,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14,) his faithful ones could scarcely suppose that he would neglect his
promise, and desert the temple which he had chosen. But this interruption does
not interfere with his promise, which was always true and firm. God, therefore,
did not entirely desert Mount Zion, because the opposite promise concerning his
return must be kept. Since then the exile was temporary, and the temple was to
be restored after seventy years, these points may be reconciled: namely, that
God departed from it and yet the place remained sacred, so that after the lapse
of that time which God had previously determined, his worship should be restored
again in the temple and on Mount Zion. But he says, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had visibly gone out of the city
and the cherubim also:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, that God
was borne above the wings of the cherubim, as also the scripture elsewhere says:
and he does this, because the Jews were governed by external symbols, and when
the ark of the covenant was shut up in the sanctuary, no one could be persuaded
that God could be torn away from it. With this view the Prophet says,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here confirms what he had said at the
beginning, viz., that this vision was divinely presented and was not an empty
and deceptive specter. This prophecy was difficult of belief, so that all doubt
ought to be removed, lest any one should object that God was not the author of
the vision. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was raised up by the
Spirit of God and brought into Chaldea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>We have already asserted, that the Prophet did not change his place, though
I am unwilling to contend for this, if any one think otherwise. But still it
appears to me, that when the Prophet remained in exile he saw Jerusalem and the
other places about which he discourses, not humanly but by a prophetic spirit.
As then he had been carried to Jerusalem by the Spirit, so was he brought back
into exile. But Spirit is here opposed to nature, since we know that our
prospect is limited within a definite space. Now if the least obstacle occur our
sight will not pass over five or six paces. But when God&#8217;s Spirit
illuminates us, a new faculty begins to flourish in us, which is by no means to
be estimated naturally. We now see in what sense Ezekiel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was brought back into
Chaldea by the Spirit of God, </i></font><font face="Palatino">because he was in
truth like a man in an ecstasy. For he had been carried out of himself, but now
he is left in his ordinary state. And this is the meaning of these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in a vision in the Spirit of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For a vision is opposed to a
reality. For if the Prophet had been brought back by a vision, it follows that
he had not really been at Jerusalem so as to be brought back into Chaldea. Now
he meets the question which may be moved, viz.: &#8220;What<i> </i>was the
efficacy<i> </i>of the vision?<i>&#8221; </i>For the Prophet recalls us to the
power of the Spirit which we must not measure by our rule. Since, therefore, the
operation of the Spirit is incomprehensible, we need not wonder that the Prophet
was carried to Jerusalem in a vision, and afterwards brought back into
captivity. He adds </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the
vision departed from him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which words
he commends his own doctrine, and extols it beyond all mortal speeches, because
he separates between what was human in himself and what was divine when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vision departed from
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence the Prophet wishes himself to
be considered as twofold: that is, as a private man, and but one of many, for in
this capacity he had no authority as if he was to be heard in God&#8217;s stead.
But when the Spirit acted upon him, he wished to withdraw himself from the
number of men, because he did not speak of himself, nor treat of anything human,
or in a human manner, but the Spirit of God so flourished in him that he uttered
nothing but what was celestial and divine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he spoke all those words to
the captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or exiles. This passage
seems superfluous. For to what purpose had the Prophet been taught concerning
the destruction of the city, the overthrow of the kingdom, and the ruin of the
temple, unless to induce the Jews who still remained in the country to desist
from their superstition? But we must remember that the Prophet had a hard
contest with those exiles among whom he dwelt, as will more clearly appear in
the next chapter. For as the Jews boasted that they remained safe, and laughed
at the captives who had suffered themselves to be drawn away into a distant
land, so the exiles were weary of their miseries. For their condition was very
sorrowful when they saw themselves exposed to every reproach, and treated by the
Chaldeans servilely and insultingly. Since, then, this was their condition, they
roared among themselves and were indignant, since they had to bear the manners
of the Prophets, and especially Jeremiah. Since, therefore, the captives
repented of their lot, it was needful for the Prophet to restrain their
contumely. And this is the meaning of the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he related the words of
Jehovah to the captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Nor was this
admonition less needful for the exiles, than for the Jews who as yet remained
safe in the city. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
words which God caused him to see,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>improperly, but very appositely to the sense; for not only had God spoken,
but he had placed the thing itself before the eyes of the Prophet. Hence we see
why he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that words had been
shown to him that he might behold them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>I have already said that this language is improper for words, because it
applies to the sight, for eyes do not receive words, but cars. But here the
Prophet signifies that it was not the naked and simple word of God, but clothed
in an external symbol. Augustine says that a sacrament is a word made visible,
and he speaks correctly; because in baptism God addresses our eyes, when he
brings forward water as a symbol of our ablution and regeneration. In the Supper
also he directs his speech to our eyes, since Christ shows his flesh to us as
truly food, and his blood as truly drink, when bread and wine are set before us.
For this reason also the Prophet now <i>says,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he saw the word of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because it was clothed in outward
symbols. For God appeared to his Prophet, as I have said, and showed him the
temple, and there erected a theater, as it were, in which he beheld the whole
state of the city Jerusalem.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">Because God was about to give a command to his
servant, he wished to inspire him with fortitude of mind, lest, when he saw that
he was consuming his labor in vain, he should withdraw from his course. For we
know how severe is that temptation to God&#8217;s servants when they speak to
the deaf, and not only is their doctrine rejected but even refused with
ignominy. They think, therefore, that nothing is better than silence, because
where their word is so despised it only exposes the name of God to the
reproaches of the impious. Now then we understand for what purpose God
admonishes his Prophet about the contumacy of the nation. The Prophet had tried
enough, and more than enough, how unmanageable the Israelites were, but God
confirms by his judgment what the Prophet had discovered sufficiently in
practice. Then we must observe another reason, for God not only commanded his
Prophet what to say, but he added an outward symbol, as we shall see. But the
Prophet might object, that it would be ridiculous to take a staff, and scrip,
and hat, as a traveler about to commence a journey. Nor is it doubtful that the
Israelites derided through perverseness what he was doing, as a boyish
amusement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lest, therefore, the Prophet should think what he was
commanded to do absurd, God instructs him, and gives him the reason of his plan.
He says, therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of
Israel is rebellious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then he
expresses the greatness of their contumacy, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they are deaf, though endued
with ears: that they are blind, and yet do not want
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God here shows that the Israelites
could not defend their error, as if they had sinned without consideration; but
he assigns their neither hearing nor seeing to their obstinacy. And this must be
diligently remarked, because hypocrites, when convicted, catch as much as
possible at this excuse, that they fell through error or ignorance. But God on
the contrary here pronounces that the Israelites were blind and deaf, and shows
that their blindness was voluntary. When, therefore, unbelievers pretend that
they have not been illuminated by the Lord, it may be conceded to them that they
are blind and deaf: but we must often proceed beyond this, since their own
obstinacy is the fountain of their blindness and deafness: and God blinds them,
because they will not admit the light offered them, but stop their ears. In
God&#8217;s judgments, indeed, the causes do not always appear, for we sometimes
see a whole nation Minded without any reason apparent to us; but as far as the
ten tribes are concerned, there can be no excuse for their error, since they
were brought up from childhood in God&#8217;s law, so that their pride and
contempt caused God to reject them. Hence they were so stupified that they
neither saw with their eyes nor heard with their ears. And this the Prophet
expresses significantly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
hear not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>since they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>he does not say, because their
senses do not penetrate to the secrets of God, are not sufficiently acute, are
not endued with such great prudence; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, because they have
stupified themselves. Hence it happens that they neither hear nor see. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Now God instructs his Prophet in what he wishes him
to do: he orders him to take vessels for journeying, that is, he orders him to
prepare for a long journey, even for exile: for exile is the subject here. But
he who is compelled to leave home to go into a foreign land, collects whatever
he can carry with him, namely, his clothes, shoes, hat, scrip, and staff, and
other things of that kind, if he have even a little money. Therefore the Prophet
is advised to gird himself for his journey, by which he represents the character
of those who were just about to be dragged into exile. For this reason he is
ordered </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to prepare for himself
vessels for traveling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Latins call
garments as well as other goods &#8220;vessels:<i>&#8221; </i>whence
proverbially to collect goods is to remove baggage in a military phrase, or to
take away one&#8217;s stuff. But he orders this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be done in the
day-time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the Israelites may see
what is done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to remove from one place to
another</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As I have said, this might
appear puerile. Cicero describes those legal
fictions,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
f246</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> how those who went to law about a field
when called upon to plead, had, so to speak, an imaginary way of going to see
it; for since it was too troublesome to the judge to mount his horse and ride
over various fields, they retained an ancient and customary ceremony: the
plaintiff said, the land which you say is yours, I claim for myself and say is
mine, and if you wish to dispute with me legally, I summon you to the spot: the
defendant replied, as you summon me there, I in return answer your summons. The
judge then arose and moved from his place, and so an imaginary action took
place. Cicero derides that by-play, and says it is unworthy of the gravity of a
court of law. But such was the action of the Prophet; he took his hat, cloak,
staff, and shoes, and other things, and changed his place as if he were moving.
But he only went a short distance. But God previously had said, that he was
dealing with a perverse nation, and so had need of such assistances. And we must
remark the particle, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if by chance
they should see, because they are a rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For here God as it were suspends
the event of his teaching, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if perhaps they should
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And the reason is added, because
the hardness of the people was so great, that they could scarcely be turned to
obedience by any discourses or signs. Meanwhile let us learn from this place,
that we must still go on, although success does not answer to our labor, when we
spend our strength for God. And this instruction is peculiarly necessary,
because when God imposes on us any duty, we dispute with ourselves as to its
result, and thus all energy flags, because we are seldom willing to put forth a
finger unless we perceive a prosperous issue. Because, therefore, we are always
too attentive to the fruit of our labor, hence this passage should be diligently
regarded, when God sends his Prophet and yet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if by chance they should
listen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Whatever may be the event, we
must obey God; if our labor should not profit, yet God wishes us to obey him. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel is verbose in this narration. But in the
beginning of the book we said, that because the teacher was sent to men very
slow and stupid, he therefore used a rough style. We added also, that he had
acquired it partly from the custom of the region in which he dwelt. For the
people declined by degrees from the polish of their language, and hence it
happens that the Prophet&#8217;s diction is not quite pure, but is intermixed
with something foreign. As to the subject itself there is no ambiguity, since
God repeats </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he should dig
through a wall, and bring out his vessels by himself before their
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here follows another part of the
vision, namely, that there should be no free egress but that the Jews would
desire to depart by stealth. First, therefore, it is shown to the Prophet, that
the Jews who when secure at Jerusalem boasted that all was well with them,
should be exiles; then, that it would not be in their power to go forth when
they wished, unless perhaps they stealthily <i>escaped </i>the hands of the
enemy through their hiding-place, as thieves escape by digging through a wall.
Then the application will follow, but yet it was worth while to state what God
intended by this vision. Afterwards everything is embraced.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In their
sight,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt bear upon thy
shoulder,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, thou shalt be
prepared and girt for a journey
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a traveler, and this shall be
done in the day-time: but in darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> thou shalt bring
them forth: after thy vessels have been prepared, wait for the evening: in the
darkness afterwards thou shalt go forth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here
he shows what I have already touched upon, when necessity expelled the Jews from
their country, that their departure would not be free, because they would be
well off if&#8217; they could snatch themselves away from the sight of their
enemies in hiding-places and the darkness of the night.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt hide thy
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and the clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither shalt thou look upon the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means the same thing. Anxiety and
trembling is marked by this phrase, as when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt hide thy
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it signifies that the Jews should
be so perplexed that they should fear every event which happened. For those who
fear everything veil their faces, as is well known. But this trembling is better
expressed when he says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> thou
shaft not look upon the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For those
who are in haste do not dare to bend down their eyes the least in either one
direction or another, but are carried along to the place to which they are
going, and press forward with their eyes, because they cannot hasten with their
feet as quickly as they desire. Hence they seize their way, as it were, with
their eyes. This is the reason why God says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt not look upon the
earth, because I have set thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a sign to the house of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here God meets the petulance of
those who otherwise would laugh at what the Prophet was doing: what do you mean
by that fictitious emigration? why do you not rest at home? why do you here
frighten us with an empty spectacle? God, therefore, that the Jews should not
obstinately despise what he shows them, adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the Prophet was a sign or a
wonder to the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
wonder is here taken in its genuine sense, though sometimes it has an
unfavorable meaning. We say that anything portentous is disagreeable: but a
<i>&#8220;</i>portent<i>&#8221; </i>properly designates any sign of the future.
When therefore men predict what is hidden, it is called a portent. And this is
the meaning of Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:18,) where he says, Behold me, and the children whom God has given me, for
signs and wonders. He puts
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>athoth, &#8220;signs,&#8221; </i>in the first place, then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ytpwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mophthim, </i>&#8220;portents.&#8221; Here the Prophet speaks in the
singular: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have given thee for a
wonder.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But since Isaiah treats of the
rest of the faithful, he then uses signs and portents; since Isaiah seems to
imply something more, namely, that the people were so stupid that they so feared
and abhorred God&#8217;s servants, as if they had met, with a prodigy. Here,
therefore, the depravity of the people is to be marked, because when they saw
any pious and sincere worshipper of God they turned away their eyes as from a
formidable prodigy. But now the Prophet speaks simply, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he had been placed for a prodigy
to the house of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>because in truth
this action was a presage of that future captivity which the Jews did not fear
for themselves, and which was also incredible to the Israelites; whence that
penitence and weariness of which I have spoken. But I do not object if any think
that the Prophet speaks of a portent, because the Israelites were struck with
astonishment; but the former sense is far more apposite. In this way then God
distinguishes the action of the Prophet from all empty spectacles, and so
vindicates his servant from all opprobrium. Meanwhile he signifies that although
the Prophet was despised, yet that he would be true, and at the same time the
avenger of contempt. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet relates that he had executed what
God had commanded: nor did it escape him that this action would be exposed to
many jeers and reproaches. But he esteemed nothing of equal moment with pleasing
God: hence we must remark the Prophet&#8217;s alacrity in executing God&#8217;s
commands. For since to ingenuous natures nothing is more distasteful than
<i>reproach, </i>he might <i>reject </i>the burden imposed upon him, because it
provoked the laughter of all men. But because God was otherwise pleased he did
as he was ordered. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he carried away his vessels,
as it were vessels of captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or of
migration, and that in the day-time: as if he said that he had prepared whatever
was necessary for the journey, as if he saw that a long march, even exile was
before him. This then was the reason why he prepared his goods in the day-time.
Now it follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at evening he dug
through the wall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This belongs to the
second clause, that the Israelites might understand that all egress was blocked
up to the Jews, so that no safety remained but in concealed flight. He says
also, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>whence it appears to be done
suddenly and tumultuously. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he went out in darkness, and
carried things on his shoulder</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;
namely, </i>that he may confirm what we have so often said, that the Jews had no
hope of safety except under cover of the night: because they were besieged on
every side, and could not move on one side or the other, lest the enemy should
seize them. This is the reason why the Prophet says,

<div><font face="Palatino">We gather from these words of the Prophet, that he
was himself derided when he began to migrate: then that he dug through the wall
by night secretly, and thus carried away his baggage. For those who think that
the Israelites enquired about this, as if it were unknown to them, do not
sufficiently consider the Prophet&#8217;s words. For the repetition of the
epithet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rebellious
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is not in vain; for if this
question had proceeded from mere folly, God would not have called them
rebellious. This epithet, then, refers to the present passage, and thus we may
determine that the Israelites asked the Prophet deridingly, what does this mean?
For he seemed to them to be trifling, and thus they jeered at him; for we know
the audacity of the nation in despising their Prophets. It is not, then, to be
wondered at, when they obtained a plausible ground for it, if they commented
rather freely upon what the Prophet was doing. We said yesterday &#8216;that
this seemed a childish spectacle. Hence the Israelites seemed, not without
reason, to reject what the Prophet was doing as a thing of nought. But God does
not suffer his servants to be reviled in this way. He now signified to the
Prophet that his calling ought to be deservedly held sacred. Since therefore
Ezekiel bore certain marks of the prophetic office, although at first sight his
conduct could not appear serious, yet the people ought to have enquired
modestly. For whatever we know to flow from God should be reverently received
without controversy. But if there is any obscurity we may wonder and enquire
into it; but as I have said, docility and modesty ought always to precede. But
what did the Israelites do? they enquired, indeed, the meaning of the
Prophet&#8217;s conduct, but only to reject it with ridicule. For this reason
God is angry, and announces himself a severe avenger of that audacity, because
they persecuted the sacred Prophet. Hence this must be read emphatically<i>
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what doest
thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if they said that the Prophet
was foolish, and carried and prepared his goods, and dug through the wall, in
vain, since all these things were of no moment. But the answer, when it shows
that God is greatly offended with such trifling, sufficiently demonstrates that
they did not ask the question through ignorance, or want of thought, but through
mere wantonness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this prophecy relates to the
prince, and the whole house of Israel which is in the midst of
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Without doubt he understands the
king, as we shall soon see: nor does he speak of any king indefinitely, but
points out Zedekiah, as will be immediately evident from circumstances. He says,
therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this
burden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or this sorrowful prophecy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>looks towards the prince, and to
the house of Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which dwell at
Jerusalem. But it is probable that some had fled that they might not fall into
the hands of the enemy, since Jerusalem was a safe receptacle for them. The
captives thought themselves bad managers, because they had not followed those
leaders, since Jerusalem was a safe refuge for them, and hence the greater
sorrow at their captivity. Hence God pronounces that the Israelites were
comprehended with their king in this prophecy. It is indeed true that this was a
common name to all the posterity of Abraham; for the twelve tribes sprung from
the patriarch Jacob, but it was then becoming customary for the ten tribes to
retain the name of Israel, and for that of Judah to have their own proper and
peculiar name. Afterwards he confirms his teaching,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was as a sign to
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We explained this expression
yesterday, showing how the Prophet was placed before them as a sign, so that God
represented what was as yet unknown to them; for signs divinely sent are called
portents, when they foretell what no one would expect to happen. God, indeed,
often shows what he is going&#8217; to do by many, yet ordinary signs; but an
extraordinary one, which cannot be considered natural, is called a portent. So
therefore the Prophet is ordered to say to the Israelites
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he was to them for a
wonder</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, to reprove their
obstinacy, which, as we have said, was the cause of their impious contempt. For
it was no part of their religion for a Prophet to deride them, so that they
should suppose him to be trifling with them, as if frightening children about
nothing. God, therefore, that the Israelites might at length be roused up at his
own time, pronounces his servant to be a wonder to them. And we gather from the
reason which is added, what the name portent meant in yesterday&#8217;s lecture.
For he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as I have done, so
shall it be done to you;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, what
you now think to be child&#8217;s play, shall be seriously fulfilled in
yourselves. For the Prophet seemed to act a part, like a player, and on this
account was derided. He now declares that it should not be fabulous, since the
Israelites, who were left in Judea among the Jews, and the king himself, should
not act a part; for God would compel them to collect their baggage, and to take
flight by stealth in the darkness of the night, which he follows up through the
whole verse. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into banishment and
exile</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they go.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">When therefore the Prophet was commanded to
collect and prepare his goods, he was a sign of the exile of which he now
speaks. But the explanation of the second part is added.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We have said that two things were shown, both the
people&#8217;s exile and their clandestine flight: the Prophet now speaks again
about this trembling. He says therefore, that not only the vulgar and the dregs
of the people would be so anxious that they would endeavor to escape secretly
and carry their own baggage; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prince
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, their king would be
subject to such ignominy: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
prince himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall carry on his
shoulder.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many followed him, as we have
seen, and at length he was seized with a great company, as the Prophet will
shortly subjoin, and being&#8217; caught in the desert of Jericho, he was
dragged by the enemy before their king: but here mention is made of the king
alone, because it was almost incredible that the enemy could not be reconciled.
For surrender often appeases even the most hostile enemies; it often preserves
kings, although an extended carnage may take place; and we know that kings are
often preserved on account of their dignity, after they have been led in
triumph. What therefore the Prophet pronounces concerning king Zedekiah does not
imply any escape of the multitude from similar punishment: but because the king
himself, together with his subjects in general, would be compelled to escape by
stealth, and would be sure to fall into the hands of the enemy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prince who is in the midst of
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the midst of
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are taken in a different sense
from that in which the Israelites were lately said to be in the midst of the
people who inhabited Jerusalem, because they had been mixed with the Jews from
the time when they had dwelt within their territories. But he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their prince was in the
midst</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in another sense, because in truth
the eyes of all were turned towards him, as if when a standard is erected, it is
beheld by all, and retains the whole multitude in their ranks, so also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king was in the
midst</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the people might not
disperse, for a miserable dispersion follows when the head is taken away. But
the intention of the Holy Spirit must be observed. For the Jews, as we have
formerly seen, were hardened in their wickedness by the false pretense that God
would always maintain his dwelling among them. For it had been said of the
throne of David, that it should stand as long as the sun and moon should shine
in the heavens.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198936&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:36, 37.) And hence Jeremiah&#8217;s lamentable complaint: the Christ, or
anointed of God, in whose breath our life consisted.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;250420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:20.) The Prophet does not speak there after the usual mode, and obtrusively
remind God of his promise, as hypocrites do, but he has respect to God&#8217;s
counsel. For David, since he was a type of Christ, was truly the soul of the
people, even among the Gentiles, as he is there reckoned to be. For they not
only looked to their king for safety while included within the city walls, but
although dispersed among the nations, they still hoped to be safe under their
monarch&#8217;s shadow. But their confidence was perverse, since they had
impiously departed from the true worship of God. Hence the Prophet, to deprive
them of that vain source of pride and boasting, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now their king was in the midst
of them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>but it would not always be so,
for God would drive him out, and even compel him to fly into secret
hiding-places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall hide his face, that he
shall not see the ground with his eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This also was accomplished, the sacred history narrates. For Zedekiah
escaped through the gardens by subterraneous passages: he thought the enemy
would be ignorant of his flight, but he was seized.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 25:4, 5; and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
39:4, 5.) We see, then, the meaning of this concealment of his face or
countenance, namely, because Zedekiah distrusted any he might meet. But this was
very bitter, and also base and disgraceful, for a king so to conceal himself,
and not to dare to look upon the ground with his eyes. And now something far
more disastrous follows.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">That was no slight slaughter, when Zedekiah at
length, in his desperation, thought of flight, and thus descended into hidden
trenches, as if seeking life in the tomb: thus was he reduced to extremities.
But the Prophet now adds, that it would be useless,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because notwithstanding this he
should be taken by his enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Besides,
what God executed by means of the Chaldeans he properly transfers to himself.
The Chaldeans laid their snares when advised of the king&#8217;s flight: they
knew its direction, and hence they apprehended him. So God announces himself as
the author: I, says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will
stretch out my net.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This we know, that
the Chaldeans did not leave their own country of their own accord, nor carry on
the war in their own strength, nor take the king by their own counsel; but the
whole affair was under the government of heaven. Men lent their aid, and seemed
to carry&#8217; on the work by their own labor; but unless God had provided for
the event, all their endeavors had proved fruitless. Hence, as God had stirred
up the Chaldeans to exact punishment from the king and the people, so he raised
their minds to confidence, then he strengthened them to persist in the siege of
the city, and afterwards opened their eyes, and sent persons to disclose the
plans of the king, so that he might be seized in a cave, as it really happened.
The whole of this was done by the secret providence of God. So diligently ought
we to observe those places in which God shows that what seems to be the work of
men is really his own. Even likeness does not want its weight; for we seem
always to have some refuge in perplexity, and on whatever side we look around,
some hope deceives us. But God announces that he has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nets
spread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which we are surrounded on
every side: hence when we seem to have a way of escape, God has hidden nets in
which he encloses us. So that this place compares God to a hunter, and ourselves
to wild beasts; for when a huntsman follows wild beasts, they seek for a way of
escape and rush out there, but they are caught in nets: so also when we endeavor
to elude God&#8217;s hands, we are entrapped and held by him: because when we
wish to withdraw ourselves from his providence, we deserve that blindness which
leads us to rush on our own destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will spread my net for him, and
he shall be taken in my snares, I will lead him
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet shows by degrees
how formidably God&#8217;s vengeance should alight on Zedekiah and the whole
people. It was already most miserable to be taken by the enemy and subjected to
their lust and cruelty. If he had been slain, this would have been accomplished
in a single moment, but God wished him to be drawn into exile; meanwhile he says
that he should die at Babylon, without seeing the city, both of which were
accomplished. Zedekiah then wasted away in exile, for he lay even to his death
in filth and defilement. And although he was buried, as we saw in Jeremiah, yet
this condition was most sorrowful &#8212; to fear through one&#8217;s whole
lifetime some fresh wrath of an enemy. Then he was barbarously and inhumanly
treated: his eyes were put out on the journey; and here it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall not see
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and yet he shall arrive there
<i>and die </i>there. Afterwards he saw his sons strangled in his sight: then
his eyes were dug out &#8212; a spectacle more grievous than death. Now we may
reflect on the kind of life a man must spend in exile, in prison, and in chains
&#8212; since he was bound with chains, as the sacred narrative informs us
&#8212; there to consume away by a slow death in a foul prison and in total
darkness; yet all this happened to Zedekiah. We see then how God thunders
against the Israelites, who thought themselves hardly treated in exile, since
they might have remained safe at Jerusalem.</font><br></div>

Zedekiah had many soldiers as a garrison, and accustomed the people to bear
arms, yet all this would not profit him, since God would disperse all the guards
in whom he trusted. He says then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would scatter to every
wind all who were around Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For
unbelievers were deceived when they saw the king surrounded by auxiliaries, and
the people of the city trained to warfare: and since Zedekiah was so armed for
the defense of the city, they thought it could never be taken by the Chaldeans.
God, therefore, here first of all teaches that the war was carried on under his
auspices, and then that there was no doubt of his taking the city. He does not
speak of the Chaldeans, lest unbelievers should institute a comparison &#8212;
&#8220;it is true indeed that the Chaldeans are besieging the city with a strong
and numerous army, but the city is impregnable, and besides it is defended with
great spirit, and the king has forces sufficiently strong for his
defense.&#8221; Lest this opinion should foolishly deceive the disbelievers, God
comes into the field and turns their attention away from the Chaldeans. For this
reason he ascribes to himself the conduct of the enemy: hence we gather that
profane nations are in God&#8217;s hands, since he not only governs them by the
spirit of regeneration, but compels even the impious, who desire to abolish his
authority, to obey his commands. God does not draw his sword from heaven, nor do
angels openly appear with drawn swords; the Chaldeans do that; but as it is said
in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:15,) Shall the ax boast itself against its owner? Since thus the vigor of the
Chaldeans was nothing in itself, God armed them and then afforded them the
success which he wished. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God insults both Jews and Israelites who had
united themselves. He says that he would so display his power that they should
be compelled to acknowledge him, but to their own destruction. Experimental
knowledge is sometimes attributed to the faithful; because when we are too slow,
God shows us his power by sure proofs. But what is here said ought to be
restricted to the reprobate and abandoned, who do not acknowledge God except in
death. Yet Zedekiah was not entirely without the fear of God: he reverenced
Jeremiah, and the seed of piety was not altogether extinct in his mind. As
regards the people, inasmuch as they offered the daily sacrifice, they certainly
cherished some opinion of God&#8217;s favor, and also of his power. But because
they despised the Prophets, they were altogether unsubdued, and made a
laughing-stock of their threats, and for this cause they are said not to
acknowledge God. And we must diligently notice this. For the impious do not
think themselves so stupid as to refuse to God his just honor; but yet when God
calls them they turn their backs: when he sets before them his message, even for
their own advantage, they are not only deaf and stop their ears, but they are
even riotous, and deride all his threats like idle stories. But it is certain
that no knowledge of God can flourish when such contempt of his doctrine
prevails. For this reason he says now, at
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>length the Jews shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because this contempt hindered
them from ascribing praise to God for his power; for they had been terrified by
even his nod. Jeremiah had assiduously instructed them in God&#8217;s word, but
they were so hardened that they treated it as a thing of nought. The threat then
is most grievous: as if God had said, When I smite you with my hand, you shall
feel me to be God. Let us learn then to acknowledge God betimes by faith,
because this is the fitting opportunity for salutary knowledge. Let us not abuse
his patience while he rages against us with a stretched out hand, and pursues us
fiercely. Sometimes, indeed, he chastises his own people for their good, but
when it comes to pass that there is no hope of repentance to the reprobate, then
he reduces them to nothing. Now it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that God here speaks of the faithful, whom
he had determined to preserve in the very midst of death. And certainly there is
some mitigation of his former vengeance. But it is not in harmony with the rest
to understand the faithful here, for he is speaking of the people in general.
But as we have already seen that the slaughter of the city was such that God
scattered the remnant to the four winds, and this the Prophet confirms. We must
hold, then, first of all, that this promise was not directed peculiarly to the
elect or to God&#8217;s Church, but rather that God is showing that exile will
not be the end of woes to the captives, although they will not be directly cut
to pieces. Their condition, indeed, might seem preferable, but God pronounces
that he would be inexorable towards them. Although all should not perish by the
sword, or famine, or pestilence, and some remnant should be left, that will
happen, says he, not because I am going to be reconciled to them, but that I may
spread their crimes among the Gentiles. For when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may
narrate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does not mean that they
would be witnesses to their own sins, as the pious are accustomed, as we shall
see elsewhere, to extol the mercy of God, and candidly to confess their faults
before men. He does not mean that kind of confession which is a sign of
repentance, but rather a real
speech.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> 
F257</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For that exile uttered with a loud
voice, that those men were abandoned whom God treated with such hostility. He
had chosen the people, was the guardian of the city, and would have <i>been
</i>their perpetual preserver, if their perverseness had not prevented it. Hence
their being destitute of his aid, their being deprived of all their goods, their
being treated tyrannically by their enemies, this made their extreme wickedness
clearly appear. <i>They narrated, </i>then, not by words but by their actual
position, their own sins to the Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, therefore, we understand the intention of God:
although some remained alive and unconcerned by either the sword, or famine, or
pestilence, yet they were cursed, since their expulsion to a distance served no
other purpose than that of spreading their disgrace and rendering them
detestable, so flint the profane Gentiles acknowledged that they deserved
vengeance for their wickedness. Therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall narrate among the
Gentiles all their abominations, and they shall know that I am
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again he repeats that
sentiment, that they should know too late what they had despised: since God had
acted towards them as a father, and they had not acknowledged his favor; and at
length they should be compelled to feel him as their judge, even to their
eternal destruction.</font><br></div>

name with the humility and reverence becoming&#8217; to thy children, so that we

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is now ordered to represent the famine
which awaited the Jews in both the siege and exile. But this prophecy ought to
be especially referred to the time of the siege; for the Jews were in continual
fear, and thought that by means of their garrison they would be impregnable. But
as the Lord had often removed this trust from them, so he does now: hence
therefore that miserable anxiety and fear, so that they never ate their bread
but in fear, nor drank their water but in confusion. For a besieged city always
fears for itself, and then the enemy so harasses them that fatigue at length
compels the besieged to surrender. And it is probable, since the army of the
Chaldees could often attempt to take the city with ease and without any great
loss, that the Jews would daily be subject to fresh terrors, so that they could
neither eat bread nor drink water except in anxiety and confusion. But because
simple and unadorned teaching would not have been effective among the ten tribes
and the Jews, hence an outward symbol is added. The Prophet therefore is the
image of the besieged people, and hence he is ordered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to eat his bread with
trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that the spectacle might the
more affect these slow and slothful men. By and bye the application follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt say to the people of
the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I do not doubt that he here
means the ten tribes: hence the land signifies Chaldea, and those regions
through which the exiles were dispersed. As we have before seen, it was to their
advantage to hear this, because they thought that the Jews remaining at home
were treated well, and themselves miserably. Hence not only their complaint but
even their outcry against God and his servants, especially Jeremiah. This then
is the reason why the Prophet is obliged to utter his discourse to the
captives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But afterwards it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem concerning the land of
Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, those remaining in the
land of Israel. We here see that the land of Israel is distinguished from the
other land, of which mention was lately made. Those who dwelt at Jerusalem
remained quiet in their own inheritance; and hence their condition was esteemed
better, because nothing is more sad than exile and captivity. But God pronounces
them more miserable than the captives, who had already been relieved from the
principal part of their miseries.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
eat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their bread in
pain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or torture,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and shall drink their water in
desolation:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he does not repeat the same
words which he had formerly used, but shortly shows that the Jews boasted in
vain that they were still in safety: because very soon the enemy will press upon
them, so that they should not be able to eat a mouthful of bread in peace.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the land may be
reduced</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from plenty to
devastation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>some translate, after its
plenty, which is forced and far-fetched; for the Prophet means that the land
would be desert and empty through exhaustion: for plenty, as we well know, means
an abundance of all things. Judea was then reduced from plenty to want, when the
enemies plundered whatever it contained, and so the region was despoiled of its
wealth. The reason follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the violence of those who
dwell in it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain this
erroneously of the Chaldees, because they lost the whole land through their
rapacity. For the Prophet rather advises that this vengeance of God was just,
because in truth all the Jews were given up to violence, cruelty, and rapacity.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">smj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chemes, </i>signifies all kinds of injury, but usually means violence and
rapine. Hence we understand the Prophet&#8217;s intention, namely, that the Jews
suffered this slaughter deservedly, because the just reward of their wickedness
was measured out to them. And thus Ezekiel represses all complaints, in which
they too freely indulged, as if God was treating them too roughly and hardly.
Therefore he shortly teaches them that he would not spare them any longer. It

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same sentiment. He had threatened
destruction to Jerusalem and its citizens: he now adds the other cities of Judah
which were still inhabited. Lastly, he speaks of the whole land, as if he said
that no single corner should suppose itself free from slaughter, since
God&#8217;s vengeance should attack it as well as the cruelty of enemies through
all regions. Jerusalem was the head of the whole nation; Ezekiel predicts its
siege, and after that it became easy to overthrow and spoil other cities, so
that the whole region was rendered subject to the lust of the enemies. He
afterwards adds what we have noticed previously,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall know that I am

death. But as their impiety had stupified them, so that they carelessly despised
not only the Prophet&#8217;s teaching, but the very judgments of God, when he
openly punished them, this knowledge is not mentioned without reason. When
therefore God puts forth his hand for the last time to chastise them, he says
that his power should be so manifest among them, that it should no longer escape
them; but yet they were so hardened in their depravity that they almost entirely
forgot God. For a contrast is always to be observed between that

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God inveighs against that gross ridicule which
prevailed everywhere among the Jews. For when the Prophets had been threatening
them so long, this their earnestness was so far from leading them to repentance,
that they became more obstinate and callous. Since they persisted in this
obstinacy, and boasted in their <i>escape, and </i>through <i>confidence </i>in
their freedom from punishment, re-belied more and more against God, the Prophet
is ordered to repress this their boasting. It was monstrous indeed for a people
who had imbibed from childhood the teaching of the law and the Prophets, thus to
break forth against God as if he had spoken falsely by his Prophets. For this
was their boasting: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Oh! the days
are prolonged: therefore every vision has passed away and
failed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From this delay they argued that
they had no cause for fear, since whatever Jeremiah and the rest had predicted
had passed away. We perceive then how unbelievers turn the patience of God into
material for obduracy and stupidity. God spares them, gives them leisure, and
invites them to repentance; but what do they do? They count the days and years,
and when they see that God does not immediately, execute the judgment which he
had uttered by his servants, they laugh at it, and esteem the Prophet&#8217;s
words as idle fables. Such, then, was the impiety against which the Prophet
inveighs, saying, <i>what is this? </i>The question implies detestation, for God
here wonders at the sloth, nay fury of the people, because it dared thus to
vomit forth its blasphemies with open mouth:&#8217; for what remains when God is
supposed to be false both in his promises and his threatenings? In this way all
religion is abolished. Nor is it surprising that God detests so monstrous a
thing, while he asks how it can happen that the Israelites break forth into such
madness: <i>what, </i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
the meaning of this your proverb</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>He
seems to include his servant among the others, because he was one of the people:
hence he participates in that which did not belong to him personally. Moreover,
this passage must be diligently noticed, when the impious conclude that they
have no occasion to fear, because their days are protracted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is, as I have said, a sign of extreme folly, but
it is not surprising if they imagine God to be false to his word and his threats
to be in vain, because his hand does not instantly appear, since they treat his
teaching without the slightest respect. Since, therefore, unbelievers are never
afraid unless terrified by the power of God, and are never in the slightest
degree moved, it is not surprising that they think it entirely illusory, when
they see him at rest while his words still resound in men&#8217;s ears. Hence
the language of the Apostle should come to mind, that Noah built the ark by
faith, because he feared the hidden judgment of God of which he had been
admonished, as if the whole deluge was before his eyes, in which he saw the
whole world immersed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews

to fear the whole of his instructions that delay may not lead us into such sloth
as this.</font><br></div>

was more and more inflamed by their contempt. And the impious, by pretending
that he is not true to his word, produce the effect of hastening the
accomplishment of those judgments which otherwise God was prepared to suspend.
Lastly, the impious stimulate God to exercise his vengeance, while they infer
that they have escaped through delay, and that the vision was so fleeting and
evanescent that they provoke him purposely to a contest. For the confirmation of
this sentiment follows directly,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God deprives the Jews of another source of
confidence; for they flattered themselves, and had their own agitators, that is
false Prophets, who puffed them up with flatteries: hence when they heard
prophecies of sadness they despised them, and afterwards hardened themselves as
if the Prophets had frightened them needlessly. Every one was too much inclined
to this besotted confidence, but, as I have said, enticements were added, by
which the flatterers deceived them. For the false Prophets said, that God would
not be so severe, and that those predictions about the destruction of the city
and temple were at variance with many promises. We see then that the Prophets
were despised by the voluntary contumacy of the people, and also by the perverse
acts of the false Prophets. Afterwards God asserted,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the days
approached</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that there should be no more
vision of vanity, </i></font><font face="Palatino">not that the false Prophets
were altogether removed, but because their mouth was stopped, since the event
had proved their wickedness. Since then the people were made ashamed by
slaughter, in this sense and for this reason it is said, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecies of vanity must be
taken away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>divination of flattery from the

ease and shade they promised themselves a prosperous delivery from their
miseries. For when the people were dragged out of the city into exile, some were
slain, others spoiled of their fortunes and treated ignominiously, then the
character of those Prophets appeared who had nursed the perverse confidence of
the people by their vain enticements. Now we understand the Prophet&#8217;s
genuine sense. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the last verse. there is some obscurity
in the context of the words, but as to the general sense, the Prophet wishes to
teach simply that what even God had spoken should be shortly accomplished, since
God wishes to assert his own fidelity by the execution of the vengeance which he
had threatened by his servants. The Prophet here means, that it is not right to
separate God&#8217;s word from its effect, because God who speaks is not divided
against himself. Whenever he opens his mouth, he stretches out his hand to
fulfill his words. Now we understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; and hence we
may collect the usefulness of this teaching. For, because God&#8217;s word seems
cold to us and to be dissipated into air, we must always consider his hand.
Whenever the Prophets speak, let God come before our eyes, and let him come not
merely with bare words, but armed with his power, as if his hand was in some way
included in his word. This is the meaning of the whole verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I Jehovah will utter a word, and
whatever I shall utter that will I do: it shall be no lower delayed,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but, as I have often said, it shall return,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nay in your days, O rebellious
house, I will do what I have spoken by my
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he expresses what might
yet appear doubtful. For since a thousand years are with God as one day, the
time might be thought near, even if the city had not been taken and destroyed
with the temple for thirty years. But now God, after the manner of men, defines
the time to be near, because those who were then alive should see the
accomplishment of the prophecies which they had despised. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here indeed such detestable blasphemy as we lately
heard is not condemned in the Jews: but oblique ridicule, the tendency of which
was first of all to weaken all confidence in Prophecy, and then to get rid of
all heavenly doctrine. Those who are now condemned by the Prophet did not dare
to bluster against God with swollen cheeks, but when others concluded the
Prophecies to be vain and frivolous, because the time was put off, they said
&#8212; it may happen that God will accomplish what he has denounced against us
by his servant: meanwhile let us feast securely as we shall be dead before these
things can happen. We see, therefore, that there were two classes of men: some
who utterly rejected God&#8217;s Prophets, and wantonly derided their threats:
this gross impiety has been already exposed. But others neither openly nor
distinctly pronounced God to be a liar, but put far away from them the
performance of the prophetic announcement. We see that the former were so
abandoned, that they all but openly derided God, so as to turn away all fear
from their own feelings since God prorogued the time. For Jeremiah had spent his
strength in vain for many years in daily summoning them by a loud trumpet to
God&#8217;s tribunal, and in setting the Chaldeans before their eyes. Since he
effected nothing, Ezekiel is chosen, and after he has inveighed against a fouler
impudence in despising God, he now attacks the hypocrite who had not yet
proceeded so far as to vilify God by the use of words. But as I have just
remarked, the gliding down from this security to open contempt of God is easy.
Those then who feign themselves quiet and without danger, since God patiently
delays his judgments, at length determine him to be content with his own ease,
and not to regard human affairs. Let us then be on our guard against the snares
of Satan; and not only abhor the foul blasphemy of which the Prophet speaks, but
as soon as God threatens us, let us prevent his judgment, and not promise
ourselves a long period of escape, which may render us so stupid as to deprive
us of all fear.</font><br></div>

The explanation which CALVIN gives of the meaning of these singular Disclosures
is indeed very adverse to our modern ideas of those physical laws by which the
Almighty governs the universe; and they will no; perhaps be easily adopted by
those who have been inspired with the philosophy of Bacon and Newton. The reader

Villalpandus, two Jesuits, published at Rome in 1596 and 1604, by the permission
of their superiors, illustrates this tenth chapter very copiously, and displays
great diligence, erudition, and accuracy. Another valuable exegetical exposition
of this chapter is given by OEcolampadius in his <i>Comment. in omn. libr.
Prophet., </i>edit. 1558; he occupies eighteen folio pages with an elaborate
comment under the title <i>&#8220;Expositio mysterii quod hac visione
adumbratur,&#8221; </i>in which he sees <i>Christus dominus glorioe. </i>and
<i>gratia est firmamentum justitioe Christi. </i>The discussion of the Cherubim
is very complete, though it may be well to consult the article in Kitto&#8217;s
<i>Biblical Cyclopedia </i>on the word &#8220;Cherub.&#8221; Rosenmuller, in his
valuable <i>Scholia, </i>makes constant use of the Arable and Syriac versions,
quotes fully from the Greek. of Theodoret,. and diligently compares the Hebrew
Codices of Kennicott and De Rossi, as well as the Greek texts of the Roman

Augustine&#8217;s Homily on John, 89, bk. 19, <i>com. Faust. </i>CALVIN, as well
as other Commentators, often felt great difficulty in separating the human
element from the divine, while interpreting the Prophets. He has expressed it
feelingly while interpreting this last verse of the eleventh chapter. It is
confessedly most difficult to draw the line rigidly between the direct agency of
God and the subservient instrumentality of man. The spiritual teaching delivered
by the Prophets evidently needed some visible and tangible means of conveyance
to the outward senses of the recipients; but who shall mark off any palpable
boundary between spirit and grace &#8212; the mind of God, and the regenerated
mind of the Prophet? If there are no harsh transitions and sudden breaks in the
natural world, so in the spiritual and moral, the limits between the essentially
divine and the clearly human are at present untraceable by mortal vision. As the
revelations to Ezekiel were progressive, differing in immediate character and
object, so together with them something extrinsic was needed, to become a
suitable vehicle for the majesty and purity of the truth conveyed. Neither the
Prophet nor his countrymen could bear the naked effulgence of the divine
messages; they were too luminous and dazzling for their sin-burdened souls, and
thus they needed a condescending adaptation to their many infirmities. The pure
and colorless water of life, instinct though it be with the spirit of Deity,
comes to us tinctured with the peculiarity of the earthen vessel through which
it flows. Our attention ought often to be dragon to this while reading Ezekiel.
The Almighty not only condescends to his infirmities, but to those of the
captives among whom he dwelt, so that the pure light of prophetic manifestation
becomes tinged in passing through a two-fold medium, before it reaches us, among
&#8220;the isles of the Gentiles.&#8221; And while we cannot give the reader any
formal rules for testing the soundness of CALVIN&#8217;S interpretations, we
must appeal to that sound mind, that cultivated scholarship, and that Christian
tact, which is the result of experience, in discriminating between the chaff and
the wheat. Ordinary faculties, chastened by severe and patient study, combined
with holy and Christian views of Divine truth as a whole, will suffice for
deciding on such abstruse questions with a sufficient degree of precision and
correctness.</font><br></div>

The reader may profitably peruse the comment of CEcolampadius on this chapter.
He spiritualizes it more than Calvin, and treats it allegorically, thus giving
it a personal and practical bearing on ourselves. He says, &#8220;Unica et
perpetua allegoria est, propter contemptum verbi Dei instare captivitatem
conscientiarum, et alienationem a Jerusalem, a vero Dei cultu, qui est iu
spiritu et veritate; unde servilia opera peccatorum in sabbatismo Christi
vetantur.&#8221; His explanations are always sound, and his practical
reflections very instructive.</font><br></div>
