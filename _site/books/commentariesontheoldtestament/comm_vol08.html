NOTICE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Book Of Psalms, viewed merely as a poetical
composition, has very high claims on our attention. Men of the most<b>
</b>refined and cultivated taste have often been attracted to the<b> </b>study
of it from the poetical beauties with which it abounds, and have admitted, in
this respect, the superiority of its claims. The greatest of our English poets
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
thus speaks of these sacred songs:"Not in their divine argument alone, but in
the very critical art of composition, they may be easily made appear over all
the kinds of lyric poesy to be incomparable." Another elegant scholar
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
speaking on the same subject, says, "In lyric flow and fire, in crushing force
and majesty, that seems still to echo the awful sounds once heard beneath the
thunder clouds of Sinai, the poetry of the ancient Scriptures is the most superb
that ever burned within the breast of man."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
the intrinsic excellence of this Book gives it still higher claims on our
attention. written under the influence of the Spirit of inspiration, its
subject-matter is worthy of its celestial origin. In general, it contains
details of the national history of the Jewish people, records of particular
portions of the life and experience of individuals, and predictions of future
events. Each of these heads embraces a wide field, and they include
illustrations of every religions truth which it is necessary for us to know,
exemplifications of every devout feeling which it is our duty to cherish, and
examples of every spiritual conflict which it is possible for us to experience.
We meet with many disclosures of the greatness, majesty, and perfections of the
only true God; his government of the world; and his special care over his chosen
people. We meet with the varied exercises of the regenerated soul, and behold it
at one time offering up fervent supplications to the Hearer of prayer, at
another celebrating his perfections and works; at one time giving utterance to
the ardent breathings of love to God, and trust in him, at another struggling
with unbelief and corruption; at one time mourning under the divine chastisement
on account of sin, at another rejoicing in a sense of forgiving<b> </b>mercy,
and enjoying the peace which passeth all understanding. We have presented to us
many wonderful predictions concerning the Messiah, his humiliation, sufferings,
death, resurrection, and ascension to his Fatherright hand; his work in heaven
as the intercessor of his people, and his authority as universal King; the
effusion of the influences of the Holy Spirit, and the conversion of all nations
to the faith of the Gospel. In short, we have unfolded to our view the final
judgment, the gathering of all the righteous to God, and the eternal exclusion
of the wicked from happiness and from
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These and similar topics which are set
forth in the noblest strains of poetry, and in a diction whose magnificence and
sublimity correspond to the importance and grandeur of the sentiments,
constitute the materials of this Book; and while they afford an incontestable
proof that it Is inspired, that it does not consist of the creations of mere
human genius, but is an emanation from heaven, they show that its character and
tendency are altogether different from the character and tendency of the most
admired poetry, which the genius of heathen nations has ever produced. It
ministers to no depraved passion; it fosters no fictitious virtue; it disdains
to offer its delicious incense at the shrine of degrading superstition. It
teaches the most exalted piety, and the purest morality. It tends only to refine
and exalt the nature of man, to elevate the soul to God, and inspire it with the
admiration and love of his character, to curb the passions, purify the
affections, and excite to the cultivation of whatsoever things are true, honest,
just, pure, lovely, and of good report. It has guided the saint in doubt and
difficulty; it has nerved him for self-denial and suffering; it has imparted
support and comfort to him in the hour of death. This Book has accordingly been
highly appreciated by the best of men in every age, and they have labored to
find expressions in which to set forth its excellence. Athanasius styles it, "An
epitome of the whole Scriptures;" Basil, "A compendium of all theology;" Luther,
"A little Bible, and the summary of the Old Testament;" Melancthon, "The most
elegant work extant in the world;" and for Calvin's estimate of its value we
refer to the excellent preface with which he introduces this department of his
labors to the attention of the reader.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Calvin's
Commentary On The Psalms, a new Translation of which is now in course of being
presented to the English reader, is distinguished by many of the excellencies
which have acquired for his Commentaries on other parts of Scripture so great
reputation. In this, as in his other Commentaries, his first and great object is
to ascertain the mind of the Holy Spirit. To ascertain this, he proceeds on the
principle laid down by Melancthon, "that Scripture cannot be understood
theologically, unless it be first understood grammatically." Before his time the
mystical and allegorical method of explaining the Scriptures was very prevalent;
according to which, the interpreter, dwelling very little or not at all upon the
literal sense, sought for hidden and allegorical meanings. But rejecting this
mode of interpretation, which contributed little to the right understanding of
the word of God, and according to which the meaning was made to depend entirely
upon the fancy of the interpreter, Calvin set himself to the investigation of
the grammatical and literal sense, by a careful examination of the Hebrew test,
and by a diligent attention to the drift and intention of the writer's
discourse.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This principle of interpretation
cannot be too highly commended. It should first engage the attention of the
commentator; and when it is neglected, the fundamental principle of sacred
criticism is violated. Calvin was deeply alive to its importance. His only
defect lies in his acting upon it too exclusively. Many of the Psalms, in
addition to the literal meaning, have a prophetical, evangelical, and spiritual
sense. While referring primarily to David and the nation of Israel, they have,
at the same time, a reference to Christ and the New Testament Church, founded on
the fact that the former were typical of the latter. Calvin, indeed, explains
some of the Psalms on this principle. But he applies the principle less
frequently than he might have done, without contravening the canons of sound
hermeneutics. His great aversion to the mystical method of interpretation, and
to the absurd and<i> </i>extravagant lengths to which it was carried by the
Fathers, perhaps made him err on the other extreme of confining his attention
too much to the literal meanings and directing his attention too little to the
prophetical and spiritual character of the Book, and to the reference which it
has to Christ and the Church. In consequence of this, his expositions have less
unction, and contain less of rich evangelical sentiment, than would otherwise
have distinguished them. There are, however, two principles of evangelical truth
which he is at pains to inculcates whenever a fit opportunity presents itself
&#8212;the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ without the works of the
Law; and the necessity of personal holiness in order to
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Another excellence of this commentary
is its practical character. The author does not confine himself to the dry and
lifeless detail of mere grammatical praxis, as if he had been commenting on a
Greek or Roman classic. He turns all his explanations to practical account, and
thus his work exhibits a happy combination of critical and philological remark
with practical exposition.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, again, we find
displayed the sound and penetrating judgment for which Calvin has been
universally admired. This is manifest in the judicious selection which he makes
from amongst a variety of interpretations of that which is evidently the true
one, or which appears to be the most probable. Sometimes he pronounces a certain
interpretation to be meagre and unsatisfactory. At other times, he simply states
hit preference of one interpretation to another, when, after careful
examinations it appeared to him to have the balance of arguments in its favor;
without, however, expressing any decided opposition to the other, when the view
which he preferred to it was supported only bit a slight preponderance of
evidence. At other times, he does not decide between different interpretations,
showing that with respect to certain words and expressions he had not come to a
fixed opinion. In all these instances,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he generally shows much penetration and
judgment. He is, no doubt, sometimes mistaken in his interpretation of
particular passages. But when it is considered that the Scriptures had long been
a sealed book, and that his helps were few and imperfect compared with those
which we now possess, the wonder is, that he should have succeeded so well in
bringing out their true meaning. This was chiefly owing to vigor and acuteness
of intellects combined with a sound and discriminating judgment. These, indeed,
were the mental qualities by which he was peculiarly distinguished. We meet with
no flashes of poetry, no brilliant coruscation of fancy, giving evidence of a
powerful imagination. The eloquent passages which occur are the eloquence of
reason, not the bursts of imagination. But his strength of thought, the vigor
and perspicacity of his intellect, the extraordinary power of his judgment,
command our willing admiration.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since this
commentary was first published, a great number of Translations of The Psalms, as
well as numerous critical and explanatory works upon them, have made their
appearance, while much new light has been thrown upon many passages from more
extensive philological research, from an attention to the parallelism of Hebrew
poetry,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and from the fuller information which we
now possess, by the discoveries of modern travelers, of the natural history,
customs, and mannered of the East, to which frequent allusion is made in The
Psalms. But such id the acuteness of judgment, and success in discovering the
mind of the Spirit which distinguish these prelections, that they are not
superseded by any modern Commentary on the same subject:and though it is nearly
three centuries since they were written, there are few separate works on The
Psalms from which the student of the present day, who wishes critically to
examine them, will derive more important
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor is Calvin's impartiality and
integrity as an interpreter less apparent in this Work than his judgment. It
being his first and leading object to ascertain the mind of the Holy Spirit, he
came to the Word of God not for the purpose of finding arguments to establish
some preconceived opinion or theory, but in the humble character of a learner,
and we never find him perverting or twisting a passage to support even those
doctrines which he most deeply cherished. So far from doing this, he not
infrequently gives up a text which has been explained by other commentators as a
proof of some important doctrine, and which he would have viewed in the same
light had it not been for his aversion to put on Scripture a forced
construction, and his determination rigidly to adhere to the principles of fair
and logical interpretation. For example, these words in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:7,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Jehovah hath said unto
me,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Thou art my Son; this day have
I begotten thee,"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">have been quoted by Augustine and many other eminent
divines, in proof of the eternal generation of the Son of God. But as Paul, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:33, explains them as receiving their fulfillment in the resurrection of
Christ, Calvin sets them aside from the class of proofs which support the
doctrine of an eternal generation, although he held that
doctrine,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and considers them as referring merely to
the manifestation afforded of Christ's Sonship by his resurrection from the
dead.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Again,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
8:5, etc.,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou hast made him a
little lower than God, and hast crowned him with glory and honor,"
etc.,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">has been often explained as prophetic of the
temporary humiliation and subsequent exaltation of Christ, an opinion which is
supported by reasons far from contemptible; but Calvin, judging from the scope
of the passage, considers it as exclusively referring to man, and that when Paul
quotes it in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:7, and applies it to Christ, he applies it to him only by way of
accommodation.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Again, these words in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
33:6,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"By the word of Jehovah
were the heavens established, and all the host of them by the spirit of his
mouth,"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">have been viewed by many judicious divines as a proof
of the Trinity, "Jehovah," denoting the Father, "the word of Jehovah," the Son,
and "the spirit of Jehovah's mouth," the Holy Spirit; but while Calvin admits
that the "word of Jehovah" means the Eternal Word, the only begotten Son of God,
yet reasoning from the sense which the phrase, "the spirit of Jehovah's mouth,"
ordinarily bears in Scripture, he argues that it does not there mean the third
person of the adorable Trinity, but simply <i>sermo, speech, </i>although there
were no truths which he held more firmly, and regarded as more essential to the
Christian system, than the doctrines of the Trinity and of the Divinity of the
Holy Spirit.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "It is very possible," says Tholuck,
"that in following this direction of mind, he may have unnecessarily sacrificed
this and the other proof text; still the principle upon which he proceeded is in
all cases to be approved." This commentary, again, bears evident marks of the
learning of its author. His intimate acquaintance with the Hebrew language, the
knowledge of which is of so much importance to the interpretation of the Old
Testament Scriptures, is everywhere apparent. Father Simon, whom the acrimony of
controversy led to indulge too much in depreciating and abusing those who
differed from him, asserts, indeed, that Calvin was so ignorant of the Hebrew
language, that he knew nothing more than the letters. But we have only to
examine his Commentary on The Psalms, not to speak of his Commentaries on other
parts of the Old Testament, to be convinced that his knowledge of the Hebrew
language was accurate and minute, considering the age in which he lived He
frequently enters into a critical examination of the original text, and
manifests by his philological remarks, brief though they be, an intimate
acquaintance with that language; arriving, in his interpretations, at the same
results to which a more profound exegesis and a more minute attention to
philology have conducted modern critics. Often, when he does not professedly
criticise the Hebrew text, or make his statements in the form of criticisms the
Hebrew scholar will perceive that his remarks are founded upon a close attention
to the strict meaning of the Hebrew words, and that he frequently states their
precise import with much force, felicity, and delicacy of expression. Nor is
proof wanting, from this Commentary, that Calvin had traveled over the whole
field of knowledge, in so far as it had been explored in his day. From ancient
and modern systems of philosophy, from civil and ecclesiastical history, as well
as from the Greek and Roman classical he draws materials, and shows how he could
employ with ease and power, and yet without the least ostentation or pedantry,
his varied acquisitions for the illustration of sacred
truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In short this Work is pervaded by earnest
piety and much Christian experience. Its whole tone evinces it to be the fruit
of a soul which felt the deep workings of piety; of a Soul in which the love of
God was extreme, which sought its rest and happiness in him alone, which
recognised his hand and providence in every event, which confided in him in all
circumstances, which looked to him as a Father and a friend for every blessing,
and which, in all its powers, was consecrated with entire devotedness to Christ
and the Gospel. It everywhere, too, bespeaks the man of large religious
experience. Whether the author comments on the plaintive songs in which grief
pours forth its bitterness, or on the triumphant and joyful songs in which the
perfections and providence of God, individual and national deliverances are
celebrated; whether he speaks of David's religious exercises, or of the trials
of his life, or of his inward conflicts, we perceive a mind which had itself
experienced much of what it illustrates. This experience eminently qualified
Calvin to be an interpreter of The Psalms. Placed often in circumstances similar
to those of David, as he graphically describes in his Preface, he was thus
enabled accurately to conceive of David's train of thinking, to see things as it
were with his eyes, to trace the complexion and character of his feelings, and
thus to portray them in so just and natural a manner, that we are almost ready
to think, in perusing the description of them, that they are described by David
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This Work has been translated from the
original Latin, and collated with the French version, which was written by the
author himself. The French edition which has been used, and which was doubtless
the last corrected under the author's eye, was printed in 1563, and is described
on the title-page as "So carefully revised, and so faithfully compared with the
Latin version, that it may be considered a new translation." While the
Translator has made the Latin version his text book, he has throughout carefully
collated it with the French version, by which he has been greatly aided in
giving a clearer and fuller representation of his author's meaning. The French
version having made its appearance after the Latin, and being written in
Calvin's native tongue, in which he might be expected to write with greater ease
than in a dead language, admired though his Latin works are for the purity of
their classic diction, it contains numerous expansions of thought and
expression, by which he removes the occasional obscurities of the Latin version,
which is written in a style more compressed and concise. Sometimes, though not
often, we meet with a complete sentence in the French version which is not to be
found in the Latin; but the cases are of frequent occurrence, in which, by
inserting into the French version a clause at the beginning, the middle, or the
end of a sentence, which does not occur in the Latin, he explains what is
obscure in the latter version, or introduces a new thought or expresses his
meaning with greater clearness and with greater copiousness of language. These
additional clauses the Translator has introduced into the text in their Proper
place, and indicated them by adding the original French in the form of notes at
the foot of the page. He, however, sometimes translates from the French version
where it seems fuller and more perspicuous than the Latin, without indicating
this by foot-notes. In a few instances, where the expression in the two versions
is different, he has given the expression of both, retaining that of the Latin
version in the texts and transferring that of the French to the foot of the
page.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect to the principle on which he
has proceeded in the task of translating, it is sufficient simply to state, that
he has endeavored to express the meaning of his author in language as true to
the original as possible, avoiding being too literal on the one hand, and too
loose on the other; as this, in his apprehension, is the method by which a
translator can best succeed in faithfully representing to the reader the sense
as well as the style and manner of his
author.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Calvin's version of the Sacred Text has
been given in preference to that of our English Bible, as this was necessary to
the clear understanding of his illustrations. The two versions, however, nearly
resemble each other:often our English version is an accurate translation of
Calvin's, at other times the marginal readings which are in some of our English
Bibles. He, however, not infrequently differs from both; and in some instances,
though not in all, where he does differ, his translation appears to be superior
in accuracy, and places the sentiment of the original in a clearer light, and
with greater effect than is done in our English version. The Scriptural
quotations which he makes have been given in the words of our English Bible,
except in those cases in which his argument required his own translation of the
passage to be retained.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This Work was translated
into English some years after its first appearance by Arthur Golding, whose
translation was published at London in 1571. Arthur Golding, who was of a
gentleman's family and a native of London, was one of the most distinguished
translators of the Roman classics in the age of Queen Elizabeth, when the
translation of these valuable works of antiquity into the English language
employed every pen. He translated Justin's History, Caesar's Commentaries,
Ovid's Metamorphoses, Seneca's Benefits, and other classic authors; as well as
various modern French and Latin works, among which are a number of Calvin's
writings, besides The Psalms. His only original work appears to have been, "A
Discourse upon the Earthquake that happened through the Realme of Englande, and
other places of Christendom, the sixt of Aprill 1580," published in 16mo. "It is
to be regretted," says Warton, "that he gave so much of his time to
translation."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Golding was no doubt a good classical
scholar, and well acquainted with the style of Calvin; but as his translation
was executed nearly three hundred years ago, it every where abounds with words
and phrases which are become antiquated and obsolete, from the great change
which the English language has undergone since that period. Being on this
account frequently very obscure, often unintelligible, it fails in giving a just
representation to an English reader of the present day of Calvin's work, and
leads him to form a less favorable estimate of its value than is due to its high
merits. Besides, Golding does not appear to have seen the French version, which
affords to a translator so much assistance in the faithful representation of
Calvin's meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect to the Notes with
which this Translation is accompanied, they are intended to enable the reader
clearly to understand the meaning of such of Calvin's philological remarks and
criticisms as are obscure, from the brevity with which they are stated; or to
exhibit Calvin's merits as a commentator, by showing how frequently his
interpretations are adopted and supported by the most eminent Biblical critics,
or to illustrate the Sacred Text, by showing the precise meaning of the Hebrew
words, or by explaining some portion of natural history, or some eastern custom
or manner to which there is an allusion. The ancient versions afford important
assistance in the explanation of difficult passages, and their rendering of
particular texts has been occasionally given when this contributes to elucidate
them, or to throw light on Calvin's observations. Of these versions the
Septuagint, the Vulgate, and Jerome's, are the only ones which he appears to
have consulted, and to the first he frequently
refers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As the Translations of The Calvin
Society are intended for the whole Christian community, it has been deemed out
of place to enter upon theological questions on which difference of opinion
exists among the various denominations of the Christian community. In making
these Notes, the Editor has often compared Calvin's translation of the Sacred
Text with the original Hebrew, and with the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Jerome's
versions. He has also consulted a considerable number of critical works on The
Psalms by some of the most eminent Biblical scholars who have written on this
book, either as a separate undertaking, or in common with the other books of
Scripture. Of the rich stores of erudition thus supplied he has freely made use;
as in the course of the work he has carefully marked his authorities, as this
will give greater weight to his statements. Many of the authors who are quoted
were men of distinguished learning, judgment, and piety, possessed a profound
acquaintance with the Hebrew language, and had devoted years of laborious study
to the investigation of the meaning of this sacred book; and it is wonderful to
find how closely the results of Calvin's investigations, even on the most
difficult passages harmonise with the results to which modern critics guided by
the principles of accurate hermeneutics, have arrived. This has often forced
itself upon the attention of the Editor, and the more he has compared Calvin's
criticisms and interpretations with the labors of these learned men, the higher
has been raised his admiration of the ingenuity, penetration, learning, and
critical acumen of this great commentator. Not a few, indeed, of the most
beautiful interpretations which are to be found in Commentaries and critical
works were first given forth by Calvin, although the source in which they
originated has been forgotten. It may here be stated that the examination of the
philology of the Sacred Text, and of critical works on the subject, has led the
Editor to observe how closely Calvin often adheres in his interpretations to the
import of the original Hebrew, and enabled him in many cases in the course of
the translation to represent the meaning of his author more correctly than he
could otherwise have done as well as to avoid mistakes into which Golding has
sometimes fallen, evidently from his not being acquainted with the philology of
the passage, or the criticism which Calvin briefly states or refers took and
which it is difficult for the reader clearly to understand, unless he find it
more fully stated in some other critical
work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Editor has to express his obligations
to two of his friends who materially aided in the preparation of the latter part
of this volume,&#8212;the late Revelation Alexander Duncan, A.M., formerly of
Dundee, and the Revelation James M'lean, whose able translation of several of
the Psalms left him little more to do than the labor of revision and annotation.
The Editor and the Society have also been much indebted to the Revelation Thomas
M'crie, Professor of Divinity, Edinburgh, not only in general for the benefit of
his experience, but also for the trouble he has taken in examining the sheets of
this Volume while passing through the press, and for many important suggestions.
The Editor has great satisfaction in thus publicly acknowledging his
obligations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>A facsimile </i>of the

<div><font face="Palatino">IT may, peraduenture, be thought in respect of the
matter wherof this woork treateth, that it ought rather to haue bin dedicated to
som of my very good Lords, the Lords Spirituall, or to some of the Clergie, all
to whom such things seeme to perteine more peculiarly, by reason of theyr charge
and calling. Which opinions as I purpose not to encounter, but rather most
willingly submit my selfe and my doings to the iudgement and reformation of such
reuerend Fathers and learned men, as God hath put ill trust with the care of his
flock, and the charge of his Church within this Realms euen so forasmuch as the
things which the Holy Ghost vttereth in the Sacred Scriptures belong
indifferently unto all men, of what estate, degrees sex, age, or calling, so
euer they be, without exception:I haue at this time set all other respects and
considerations aside, and only had an eye to my dutie towards your
Lordship.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And bicause my continuall troubles and
sutes in the Lawe (as yit vnended after more than three yeeres trauel) haue
bereft mee of the greatest part of my timer, so as I could not dispatch things
with such expedition as otherwise I might haue done; my care and indeuer hath
bin too recompence mine ouerlong silence with goodnes of matter, that might
redound to the furtherance of our Christen common weale, and also be meete for
your Lordship too looke vpon. But you, perchaunce, according too the noble
courage and disposition of your yeeres, doo looke I should presente vntoo you
some Historie of the Conquestes and affaires of mightie Princes, some treatise
of the government of common weales, some description of the platte of the whole
Earth, or some discourse of chiualrie and feates of Armes. These things are, in
deede, meete studies for a noble manne, and in their season right necessary for
the common welth; but as nowe I present vntoo your honor muche greater things
that is, to wit, true Religyon, true Godlynesse, true Vertue, wythout the whych,
neyther force, policie, nor freend ship, are of any value, neyther can any
common weale any Cities any householde, or any company, bee wel gouerned, or
haue any stable and long continuance. These be the things wherin your Lordship
may do God, your Prince, and your Cuntrie, best seruice, and which do giue true
nobilitie, or rather are the very nobilitie it
self.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The greater that you are of birth and
calling, the more doo these things belong vnto you. The greater gifts of Nature,
the mo graces of mind, the mo worldly benefites that God hath bestowed vppon
you, the more are you bound to be thankful vnto him. But thankful you cannot bee
without the true knoweledge of him, neyther can you know him rightly but by his
woord. For his sword is the lanterne of your feete, and the light of your
steppes. Whosoeuer walked without it, walketh but in darkenesse, though he were
otherwise as sharpe sighted <i>as Linceus </i>or <i>Argus</i>, and had all the
sciences artes, conning, eloquence, and wisedome of the worlde. No sound and
substantiall truthe is too bee founde any where els saue onely there. And,
therfore, the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of Moyses, willeth you that the lawe of
God (that is to say, his word and doctrine) shoulde not departe from your mouth,
but that you should bynde it about your wrists, imbroyder it vpon your garments
ingraue it vpon the postes of your house, and write it in the tables of your
hart. And Dauid, speaking by the same spirite, exhorteth you by his owne example
to set your whole delight in it, too occupy your selfe in it day and night, too
lay it vp in your hart, too set more store by it than by riches, to be mindeful
of it, to make it your counsayler, to stick too it, too talke of it afore Kings
and greate men, to loue it, too make your songs of it, to remember it night and
day, too count it sweeter than Hony, too take it as an heritage, and too make it
the ioy of your hart. Neyther is it without cause that GOD calleth so ofte vppon
Magistrates and noble men by name, that they should be diligent in his worde.
For looke how muche the greater burthen and charge lyeth vpon their shoulders
and the greater accounte they haue to make afore him; so muche the greater
wisedome and knoweledge haue they need of, which are not to be atteyned
elsewhere than in his lawe. I beseeche your Lordship consider how God hath
placed you vpon a high stage in the eyes of all men, as a guide, patterne,
insample, and leader vnto others if your vertues be vncounterfayted, if your
religion be sound and pure, if your doings be according to true godliness you
shalbe a stay to your cuntrie, a comforte too good men, a bridle too euil men, a
ioy too your freends, a corzie too your enemies, and an increace of honor to
your owne house. But if you should become eyther a counterfayt Protestant, or a
peruerse Papist, or a colde and carelesse newter, (which God forbid,) the harme
could not be expressed which you should do to your natiue Cuntrie. For (as
<i>Cicero, </i>no lesse truely than wisely affirmeth, and as the sorrowfull
dooings of our Present dayes do too certeinly auouch) greate men hurt not the
common weale so much by beeing euil in respect of themselues, as by drawing
others vnto euil by their euil example. I assure your Lordshippe I write not
these things as though I suspected you to be digressed from that soundnes and
sinceritie wherein you were continually trayned and traded vnder that vigilant
<i>Vlisses </i>of our common welth, sometyme your Lordship's carefull <i>Chyron
or Phoenix, </i>and nowe your faithful <i>Patroclus, </i>or <i>as </i>though I
mistrusted your Lordship to be degenerated from the excellent towardnes, which
by foreward proof hath giuen glad foretokens, and (I trust also) luckye hansels
of an honorable age too ensue; but bycause the loue that I owe to God and his
religion, the care that I haue of the church and my natiue cuntrie, the dutie
wherin Nature hath bound mee to your Lordship, and (which is an occasion too
make all good and honest men look about them) the perilousnes of this present
time, wherin all meanes possible are practiced to ouerthrowe Christe's kingdom
and to abolishe all faithfullnes from among men, make mee to feare and forecast,
not so much what is true, as what may bee noysome and hurtful; and, therfore, I
seek rather too profite by wholesome admonition, than to delight by pleasant
speeches. These be no dayes of daliance; for Sathan, the workmaster of all
mischeef, being greued that his own king dome draweth to an end, not onely goeth
about like a roring Lyon too <i>deuoure folke by </i>open force, but also like a
slie Serpent setteth snares and pitfalles innumerable, to intrap men and bring
them to destruction by policie laying wayt for all men, but specially for such
as are of high estate, as who alwayes carye greatest nombers with them which
waye so euer they incline. Hee turneth himselfe intoo mo shapes than euer did
<i>Proteus:</i>and suche as himselfe is, suche are his ministers. First and
foremost the obstinate and stubborneharted <i>Papistes, </i>the sworne enemies
of God, the pestilent poyson of mankinde, and the very welsprings of all error,
hipocrisie, and vngraciousnes, (who, while they beare sway, bee more cruel than
Beares, Wolues, and Tigres; and when they bee kept vnder, more deceitfull than
<i>Cerastes </i>and <i>Crocodyles; </i>and at all times more mischeuous than the
Diuel himselfe,) labor with tooth and nayle too winde their owne trash into
credit with all men, and to bring the heauenly doctrine of the Gospel in
hatred.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Ageine, the <i>Atheistes, </i>which say
in their hartes there is no God; and the <i>Epicures, </i>which depriue God of
his prouidence in gouerning the world, as though hee eyther vnderstoode not what
is doone vppon Earth, or els cared not for mennes affaires:seeke they not by all
meanes possible too weede all Religion, all feare of God, all remorse of
conscience out of mennes harts? Out of these rootes spring other impes, no lesse
perniciouse than the stockes of whiche they come, men of all Religions,
Shippemen that canne sayle with all wethers, Carpenters that can hewe with bothe
handes, Laddes that canne holde with the Hare and hunt with the Hounde, and (as
the Scripture termeth them) time-seruers and menpleasers. Of which torte be the
picthank Preests of <i>Hammon, </i>who, with the venemouse blaste of their
filthie flattery, corrupt the wel instructed mindes of our <i>Alexranders</i>,
(that is<i> </i>to say, of our noble men,) by bearing them in hand, that they
bee the sonnes of <i>Iupiter, </i>add making them beleeue themselues too bee
Gods, yea, sometimes before they be scarce men. These, after the maner of
<i>Panthers </i>and <i>Mermaides</i>, astonne the senses with a deadly sweetnes,
and work destruction by delighting. Moreouer, to the further withdrawing of
men's minds from the estimation of the sound Religion, it falleth out that euen
in the outward face of the Church there be many Hipocrites, many looce liuers,
many Sectaries, and many wranglers, whiche pretending the countenance of
Chryste's flock, but beeing in deede the Deuil's hirelings, confessing GOD with
their mouth, but denying him in their works, cause his holy, pure, and reuerend
doctrine to bee slaundered and ill-spoken of among the <i>Gentiles,</i> (that
is, too wit, among the <i>Papist </i>and worldlings,) and so alienate men from
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The ignorant sort also deeming things
vntowardly by the outward shew, charge the Gospell with the faultes of men,
which it reprooueth and bringeth too lyght, as who would Say, that hee whiche
bewrayeth a Murtherer, or rebuketh an Adulterer, were too bee counted an
offender in the same caces, bicause hee discouereth their wickednesse, too the
intent too haue it punished or redressed. And these are stumbling-blocks common
to all sortes of men; but more peculiar to great menne are those that I spake of
in the third place, and also these ensuing, namely, noblenesse of birth, renowne
of Aunceters, fauor of their Prince, freendship of their peeres, awe of their
inferiours, great alyances, greate retinewes depending vpon them, libertie aboue
the common rate, welth, honor, riches, ease, sumptuouse fare, costly apparel,
gorgeouse buildings, attendaunce of seruants, and suche other like, whiche as
they bee the singuler good giftes and benefites of God bestowed vpon them for
their comfort, to the end they should the more loue him and imbrace his
truthe:so Sathan abusing the infirmitie and corruption of man's nature, dooth in
many menne wrest them all too a contrary ende, namely, too the proude contempt
and impugning, or at leastwise to the carelesse neglecting of God's true
Religion and seruice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As for the fraylnesse of
youth it self, the open manaces and priuie practizes of <i>Antichrist, </i>the
common hatred and disdeine of the Worlde ageinst the sincere worshippers of God,
the hardnesse and aduersities which they endure in this life, and infinite other
by matters whiche are no small hinderances too the proceeding of the Gospel, I
wil not stand too intreat of them. For doubtlesse, although <i>Antichrist
</i>were abolished although Sathan were a sleepe, although the world were at one
with vs. although wicked counsel were vtterly put too silence, although no euil
example were giuen vs. although no outwarde stumbling-blocke were cast in our
waye; yit haue wee one thing in our selues and of our selues, (euen originall
sinne, concupiscence, or lust,) which neuer ceaseth too egge vs and allure vs
from God, and too staine vs with all kinde of vnclennes, according as Sainct
Iames sayth:Every man is tempted of his owne lust. This is the breth of the
venemouse <i>Cockatrice </i>which hath infected the whole offspring of <i>Adam.
</i>This is the sting of that olde Serpent whose wounds neither <i>Chyron,
Aesculupius, </i>nor <i>Apollo, </i>can heale, no, nor any wight in Heauen or
Earth, saue onely God. This is the bitter fountaine <i>Exampeus, </i>which with
his brackishnesse marreth the sweete Riuer <i>Hipanis, </i>that is<i> </i>to
say, the flowing streame of all God's graces, benefited and gifts in
vs.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Good cause haue we therfore to bee
forewarned and continually admonished to beware of the mischeef that is armed
with so many weapons and policies to anoy:specially considering how the
operation therof is to slea both bodie and soule, and to drown them togither in
to endles damnation. For this I dare be bolde to say vpon the warrant of assured
truthe, that whosoeuer is but lightly blasted with the poyson of Papistrie, is
the vnapter to all the duties of true vertue and godlines, like as a Cripple or
lame man is the vnmeeter and vnabler for the affaires of this life. But as for
him that is throughly saped in it, and hathe digested it into his bowels, and
hath setled the roots of it in the bottome of his hart; depending vpon the
<i>Antichrist </i>of <i>Rome </i>as vpon the mouth of God, He can neyther be the
faithful seruant of God, nor a hartie Subiect too his Prince, nor a good and
sound member of the common welth, vntill hee haue done as the Snake dooth when
he commeth to engender with the Lamprey.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For the
better manifestation of all the which things I besech your good Lordship to
peruse this present books, which doubtlesse, for the exceellency therof, not
onely deserueth more singular commendation than man's wit is able to yeeld, but
also is worthy too be had continually in all mennes hands, or rather too bee
printed in their hartes. For if you haue an eye too the Authors, it was written
by Prophets, Preestes, and Kinges, inspired with the Holye Ghost, the fountaine
of an vnderstanding, wysedom, and truth, and auouched onto vs by Christie the
Sonne of the euellasting God. Or if you haue an eye to the matter, it conteineth
a treatise of the Doctrine of lyfe and euerlasting Saluation, the particulars
wherof are as many as are the points of true Religion and holinesse to Godward,
or the points of faithfull meening and honest dealing too manward. And these
things are common to it with the residue of holy
Scripture.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The thing that is peculiar to it, is
the maner of the handling of the matters wherof it treateth. For whereas other
partes of holy writ (whither they be historicall, morall, iudiciall,
ceremoniall, or propheticall) do commonly set down their treatises in open and
plaine declarations; this parte consisting of them all, wrappeth vp things in
types and figures, describing them finder borowed personages, and oftentimes
winding in matters by preuention, speaking of thinges too come as if they were
past or present, and of things past as if they were in dooing, and euery man is
made a bewrayer of the secretes of his owne hart. And forasmuche as it
consisteth cheefly of prayer and thanksgiving, or (which comprehendeth them
bothe) of inuocation, whiche is a communication with God, and requireth rather
an earnest and deuout lifting vp of the minde, than a loud or curious vtterance
of the voice:there be many vnperfect sentences, many broken speeches, and many
displaced words, according as the voice of the partie that prayed was eyther
preuented with the swiftnesse of his thoughtes, or interrupted with vehemency of
ioy or greef, or forced to surcease through infirmities that hee might recouer
newe strength and cheerfulnesse, by interminding God's former promises and
benefites. Notwithstanding, the obscuritie of those places is not so great but
that it may be easely ouercome, by such as, when they pray, doo vtterly
sequester their mindes from all earthly imaginations and fleshly conceits, and
after a sort forsaking their bodies for the time, do mount vppe aboue the world
by faith, and present themselues before the heauenly throne of grace, to seek
the vnspeakable and inestimable comfort of their
soules.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Suche are the conteints, and suche is
the maner or disposition of the ground-worke of this booke, that is to say, of
the Psalmes themselues. Whervnto (for the better vnderstanding of them) heere is
added an exposition or Commentarie written in Latin by that learned Clerk and
faithful minister of Chryst in the church of <i>Geneua, </i>Master <i>Iohn
Caluin, </i>whose worthy praise and commendation, his owne manifolde woorks
moste peinfully, sincerely, and soundly set foorth too the greate furtherance
and profite of the whole Christen common weale, doo better declare than my pen
can vtter or my wit deuice. And among the reste of them, it is thoughte of most
learned men, that next vntoo his Institutions, this presente volume beareth the
Bel, bothe for varietie of matter, substantialnes of doctrine, depth of
iudgement, and perfectnesse of penning. For it is not puffed vp with vaine sound
of emptie woords, nor with Rhetorical inlarging of painted sentences, but it is
stuffed with piththy and grounded matter, such as plainly sheweth him too haue
bin a man indued with the Spirite of God, and also well practized and tryed in
the affaires and troubles of this world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What is
to bee thought of the translation of it, that I remitte to your Lordship's
fauourable acceptation, vnder whose Antesigne it is my desire that it may fight
in the defense and maintenance of the true religion ageinst Antichrist and his
wicked members. Onely thus muche I may safely say of it, that in all pointes (to
the vttermoste of my power, and according to the abilitie which God hath giuen
me to edifie withall) I haue sincerely performed the dutie of a faithfull
Interpreter, rather indeuering too lay foorth things plainlye (yea, and
sometimes also homely and grossely) too the vnderstanding of many, than too
indyte things curyously too the pleasing of a fewe. For in this and suche other
workes, the rude and ignorant haue more interest than the learned and skillful.
If any thing be amisse, (as I dare not presume too vpholde that nothing hath
escaped mee in so great a woorke,) my hartie desire is, that the same may be
amended by such as are of sound iudgement and knowledge in God's woorde, so as
no inconuenience may ensue of it too the churche of Christ. And look what I
request in the behalfe of this present booke, the same do I request for all
other books whiche I haue or (by God's grace and permission) shall heerafter put
foorth for the edifying of Chrystes flock:for I knowe how suche things are the
woork of God and not of man.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What remayneth
then, but that your Lordship, framing your selfe according to the rule of God's
most holy word, should hie you apace to the atteinment of the true honor and
immortall glory, by subduing sinne, the world, and the Deuil, the <i>Hectors
</i>that cannot bee vanquished but by a christen <i>Achilles; </i>and by your
good guyding bring many vnto Christ, that in the end you may receiue the rewarde
of true and perfect blissednesse, euen the everlasting salvation of the soule,
whiche is the faire <i>Helen </i>for whose safetie it behooueth all good men too
endure, not tenne yeeres warre, but continuall warre all their life long. To the
furtherance wherof, God hath by householde alyance lincked vnto your Lordship a
long experienced <i>Nestor, </i>whose counsaile and footsteps if you folowe, no
doubte but you shalbee bothe happie in your selfe, and singularly profitable to
your common welth; and moreouer, God shall blisse you with plentiful and godly
issue by your vertuous and deerbeloued Spouse, to continew the honor and
renoavne of your noble house after the happy knitting vp of bothe your yeeres,
which I pray God may bee many in<i> </i>vnseperable loue, like the loue of

PREFACE</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JOHN
CALVIN</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>TO THE GODLY AND INGENUOUS READERS,
GREETING.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IF the reading of these my Commentaries confer as
much benefit on the Church of God as I myself have reaped advantage from the
composition of them, I shall have no reason to regret that I have undertaken
this work. Having expounded here, in our small school, the Book of Psalms, about
three years ago, I thought that I had by this means sufficiently discharged my
duty, and had resolved not to publish to the world what I had familiarly taught
those of my own household. And, in fact, before I had undertaken to expound this
book in my lectures, at the request of my brethren, I said what was true, that I
had kept away from this subject, because that most faithful teacher of the
Church of God, Martin Bucer, had labored in this field with such singular
learning, diligence, fidelity, and success, that at least there was not so great
need that I should put my hand to the work. And had the Commentaries of
Wolphangus Musculus at that time been published, I would not have omitted to do
them justice, by mentioning them in the same way, since he too, in the judgment
of good men, has earned no small praise by his diligence and industry in this
walk. I had not yet come to the end of the book, when, lo! I am urged by renewed
solicitations not to suffer my lectures, which certain persons had carefully,
faithfully, and not without great labor, taken down, to be lost to the world. My
purpose still remained unaltered; only I promised what for a long time I had
been thinking of, to write something on the subject in the French language, that
my countrymen might not be without the means of being enabled to understand so
useful a book when perusing it. Whilst I am thinking of making this attempt,
suddenly, and contrary to my first design, it occurred to me, by what impulse I
know not, to compose in Latin, only as it were in the way of trial, an
exposition of one Psalm. When I found that my success corresponded to my desire
far beyond what I had ventured to anticipate, I was encouraged, and accordingly
began to make the same attempt in a few other Psalms. On perceiving this, my
intimate friends, as if in this way they held me bound, urged me with the
greater confidence not to desist from my course. One reason which made me comply
with their solicitations, and which also had from the commencement induced me to
make this first attempt, was an apprehension that at some future period that had
been taken down from my lectures, might be published to the world contrary to my
wishes or at least without my knowledge. I can truly say, that I was drawn to
execute this work rather from such an apprehension, than led to it from my own
free will. At the same time, as I continued to prosecute the work, I began to
perceive more distinctly that this was by no means a superfluous undertaking,
and I have also felt from my own individual experience, that to readers who are
not so exercised, I would furnish important assistance in understanding The
Psalms. The wearied and resplendid riches which are contained it this treasury
it is no easy matter to express in words; so much so, that I well know that
whatever I shall be able to say will be far from approaching the excellence of
the subject. But as it is better to give to my readers some taste, however
small, of the wonderful advantages they will derive from the study of this book,
than to be entirely silent on the point, I may be permitted briefly to advert to
a matter, the greatness of which does not admit of being fully unfolded. I have
been accustomed to call this book, I think not inappropriately, "An Anatomy of
all the Parts of the Soul;" for there is not an emotion of which any one can be
conscious that is not here represented as in a mirror. Or rather, the Holy
Spirit has here drawn to the life all the griefs, sorrows, fears, doubts, hopes,
cares, perplexities, in short, all the distracting emotions with which the minds
of men are wont to be agitated. The other parts of Scripture contain the
commandments which God enjoined his servants to announce to us. But here the
prophets themselves, seeing they are exhibited to us as speaking to God, and
laying open all their inmost thoughts and affections, call, or rather draw, each
of us to the examination of himself in particulars in order that none of the
many infirmities to which we are subject, and of the many vices with which we
abound, may remain concealed. It is certainly a rare and singular advantage,
when all lurking places are discovered, and the heart is brought into the light,
purged from that most baneful infection, hypocrisy. In short, as calling upon
God is one of the principal means of securing our safety, and as a better and
more unerring rule for guiding us in this exercise cannot be found elsewhere
than in The Psalms, it follows, that in proportion to the proficiency which a
man shall have attained in understanding them, nill be his knowledge of the most
important part of celestial doctrine. Genuine and earnest prayer proceeds first
from a sense of our need, and next, from faith in the promises of God. It is by
perusing these inspired compositions, that men will be most effectually awakened
to a sense of their maladies, and, at the same time, instructed in seeking
remedies for their cure. In a word, whatever may serve to encourage us when we
are about to pray to God, is taught us in this book. And not only are the
promises of God presented to us in it, but oftentimes there is exhibited to us
one standing, as it were, amidst the invitations of God on the one hand, and the
impediments of the flesh on the other, girding and preparing himself for
prayer:thus teaching us, if at any time we are agitated with a variety of
doubts, to resist and fight against them, until the soul, freed and disentangled
from all these impediments, rise up to God; and not only so, but even when in
the midst of doubts, fears, and apprehensions, let us put forth our efforts in
prayer, until we experience some consolation which may calm and bring
contentment to our minds.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although distrust may shut the gate
against our prayers, yet we must not allow ourselves to give way, whenever our
hearts waver or are agitated with inquietude, but must persevere until faith
finally come forth victorious from these conflicts. In many places we may
perceive the exercise of the servants of God in prayer so fluctuating, that they
are almost overwhelmed by the alternate hope of success and apprehension of
failure, and gain the prize only by strenuous exertions. We see on the one hand,
the flesh manifesting its infirmity; and on the other, faith putting forth its
power; and if it is not so valiant and courageous as might be desired, it is at
least prepared to fight until by degrees it acquire perfect strength. But as
those things which serve to teach us the true method of praying aright will be
found scattered through the whole of this Commentary, I will not now stop to
treat of topics which it will be necessary afterwards to repeat, nor detain my
readers from proceeding to the work itself. Only it appeared to me to be
requisite to show in passing, that this book makes known to us this privilege,
which is desirable above all others &#8212; that not only is there opened up to
us familiar access to God, but also that we have permission and freedom granted
us to lay open before him our infirmities which we would be ashamed to confess
before men. Besides there is also here prescribed to us an infallible rule for
directing us with respect to the right manner of offering to God the sacrifice
of praise, which he declares to be most precious in his sight, and of the
sweetest odour. There is no other book in which there is to be found more
express and magnificent commendations, both of the unparalleled liberality of
God towards his Church, and of all his works; there is no other book in which
there is recorded so many deliverances nor one in which the evidences and
experiences of the fatherly providence and solicitude which God exercises
towards us are celebrated with such splendor of diction, and yet with the
strictest adherence to truth, in short, there is no other book in which we are
more perfectly taught the right manner of praising God, or in which we are more
powerfully stirred up to the performance of this religious exercise. Moreover
although The Psalms are replete with all the precepts which serve to frame our
life to every part of holiness, piety, and righteousness, yet they will
principally teach and train us to bear the cross; and the bearing of the cross
is a genuine proof of our obedience, since by doing this, we renounce the
guidance of our own affections and submit ourselves entirely to God, leaving him
to govern us, and to dispose of our life according to his will, so that the
afflictions which are the bitterest and most severe to our nature, become sweet
to us, because they proceed from him. In one word, not only will we here find
general commendations of the goodness of God, which may teach men to repose
themselves in him alone, and to seek all their happiness solely in him; and
which are intended to teach true believers with their whole hearts confidently
to look to him for help in all their necessities; but we will also find that the
free remission of sins, which alone reconciles God towards us and procures for
us settled peace with him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is so set forth and magnified, as that
here there is nothing wanting which relates to the knowledge of eternal
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if my readers derive any fruit
and advantage from the labor which I have bestowed in writing these
Commentaries, I would have them to understand that the small measure of
experience which I have had by the conflicts with which the Lord has exercised
me, has in no ordinary degree assisted me, not only in applying to present use
whatever instruction could be gathered from these divine compositions, but also
in more easily comprehending the design of each of the writers. And as David
holds the principal place among them, it has greatly aided me in understanding
more fully the complaints made by him of the internal afflictions which the
Church had to sustain through those who gave themselves out to be her members,
that I had suffered the same or similar things from the domestic enemies of the
Church. For although I follow David at a great distance, and come far short of
equaling him; or rather, although in aspiring slowly and with great difficulty
to attain to the many virtues in which he excelled, I still feel myself
tarnished with the contrary vices; yet if I have any things in common with him,
I have no hesitation in comparing myself with him. In reading the instances of
his faith, patience, fervor, zeal, and integrity, it has, as it ought, drawn
from me unnumbered groans and sighs, that I am so far from approaching them; but
it has, notwithstanding, been of very great advantage to me to behold in him as
in a mirror, both the commencement of my calling, and the continued course of my
function; so that I know the more assuredly, that whatever that most illustrious
king and prophet suffered, was exhibited to me by God as an example for
imitation. My conditions no doubt, is much inferior to his, and it is
unnecessary for me to stay to show this. But as he was taken from the sheepfold,
and elevated to the rank of supreme authority; so God having taken me from my
originally obscure and humble condition, has reckoned me worthy of being
invested with the honorable office of a preacher and minister of the gospel.
When I was as yet a very little boy, my father had destined me for the study of
theology. But afterwards when he considered that the legal profession commonly
raised those who followed it to wealth this prospect induced him suddenly to
change his purpose. Thus it came to pass, that I was withdrawn from the study of
philosophy, and was put to the study of law. To this pursuit I endeavored
faithfully to apply myself in obedience to the will of my father; but God, by
the secret guidance of his providence, at length gave a different direction to
my course. And first, since I was too obstinately devoted to the superstitions
of Popery to be easily extricated from so profound an abyss of mire, God by a
sudden conversion subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was
more hardened in such matters than might have been expected from one at my early
period of life Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness I
was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress therein, that
although I did not altogether leave off other studies, I yet pursued them with
less ardor. I was quite surprised to find that before a year had elapsed, all
who had any desire after purer doctrine were continually coming to me to learn,
although I myself was as yet but a mere novice and tyro. Being of a disposition
somewhat unpolished and bashful, which led me always to love the shade and
retirement, I then began to seek some secluded corner where I might be withdrawn
from the public view; but so far from being able to accomplish the object of my
be desire, all my retreats were like public schools. In short, whilst my one
great object was to live in seclusion without being known, God so led me about
through different turnings and changes, that he never permitted me to rest in
any place, until, in spite of my natural disposition, he brought me forth to
public notice. Leaving my native country, France, I in fact retired into
Germany, expressly for the purpose of being able there to enjoy in some obscure
corner the repose which I had always desired, and which had been so long denied
me. But lo! whilst I lay hidden at Basle, and known only to a few people, many
faithful and holy persons were burnt alive in France; and the report of these
burnings having reached foreign nations, they excited the strongest
disapprobation among a great part of the Germans, whose indignation was kindled
against the authors of such tyranny. In order to allay this indignation, certain
wicked and lying pamphlets were circulated, stating that none were treated with
such cruelty but Anabaptists and seditious persons, who by their perverse
ravings and false opinions, were overthrowing not only religion but also all
civil order. Observing that the object which these instruments of the court
aimed at by their disguises, was not only that the disgrace of shedding so much
innocent blood might remain buried under the false charges and calumnies which
they brought against the holy martyrs after their death, but also, that
afterwards they might be able to proceed to the utmost extremity in murdering
the poor saints without exciting compassion towards them in the breasts of any,
it appeared to me, that unless I opposed them to the utmost of my ability, my
silence could not be vindicated from the charge of cowardice and treachery. This
was the consideration which induced me to publish my Institute of the Christian
Religion. My objects were, first, to prove that these reports were false and
calumnious, and thus to vindicate my brethren, whose death was precious in the
sight of the Lord; and next, that as the same cruelties might very soon after be
exercised against many unhappy individuals, foreign nations might be touched
with at least some compassion towards them and solicitude about them. When it
was then published, it was not that copious and labored work which it now is,
but only a small treatise containing a summary of the principal truths of the
Christian religion, and it was published with no other design than that men
might know what was the faith held by those whom I saw basely and wickedly
defamed by those flagitious and perfidious flatterers. That my object was not to
acquire fame, appeared from this, that immediately after I left Basle, and
particularly from the fact that nobody there knew that I was the author.
Wherever else I have gone, I have taken care to conceal that I was the author of
that performance; and I had resolved to continue in the same privacy and
obscurity, until at length William Farel detained me at Geneva, not so much by
counsel and exhortation, as by a dreadful imprecation, which I felt to be as if
God had from heaven laid his mighty hand upon me to arrest me. As the most
direct road to Strasburg, to which I then intended to retire, was as shut up by
the wars, I had resolved to pass quickly by Geneva, without staying longer than
a single night in that city. A little before this, Popery had been driven from
it by the exertions of the excellent person whom I have named, and Peter Viret;
but matters were not yet brought to a settled state, and the city was divided
into unholy and dangerous factions. Then an individual who now basely
apostatised and returned to the Papists, discovered me and made me known to
others. Upon this, Farel, who burned with an extraordinary zeal to advance the
gospel, immediately strained every nerve to detain me. And after having learned
that my heart was set upon devoting myself to private studies for which I wished
to keep myself free from other pursuits, and finding that he gained nothing by
entreaties, he proceeded to utter an imprecation that God would curse my
retirement, and the tranquillity of the studies which I sought, if I should
withdraw and refuse to give assistance, when the necessity seas so urgent. By
this imprecation I was so stricken with terror, that I desisted from the journey
which I had undertaken; but sensible of my natural bashfulness and timidity, I
would not bring myself under obligation to discharge any particular office.
After that, four months had scarcely elapsed, when, on the one hand, the
Anabaptists began to assail us, and, on the other, a certain wicked apostate,
who being secretly supported by the influence of some of the magistrates of the
city, was thus enabled to give us a great deal of trouble. At the same time, a
succession of dissensions fell out in the
city</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which strangely afflicted us. Being, as
I acknowledge, naturally of a timid, softer and pusillanimous disposition, I was
compelled to encounter these violent tempests as part of my early training; and
although I did not sink under themes yet I was not sustained by such greatness
of mind, as not to rejoice more than it became me, when, in consequence of
certain commotions, I was banished from Geneva. By this means set at liberty and
loosed from the tie of my vocational I resolved to live in a private station,
free from the burden and cares of any public charge, when that most excellent
servant of Christ, Martin Bucer, employing a similar kind of remonstrance and
protestation as that to which Farel had recourse before, drew me back to a new
station. Alarmed by the example of Jonas which he set before me, I still
continued in the work of teaching. And although I always continued like myself,
studiously avoiding celebrity;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet I was carried, I know not how, as it
were by force to the Imperial assemblies, where, willing or unwilling, I was
under the necessity of appearing before the eyes of many. Afterwards, when the
Lord having compassion on this city, had allayed the hurtful agitations and
broils which prevailed in it, and by his wonderful power had defeated both the
wicked counsels and the sanguinary attempts of the disturbers of the Republic,
necessity was imposed upon me of returning to my former charge, contrary to my
desire and inclination. The welfare of this church, it is true, lay so near my
heart, that for its sake I would not have hesitated to lay down my life; but my
timidity nevertheless suggested to me many reasons for excusing myself from
again willingly taking upon my shoulders so heavy a burden. At length, however,
a solemn and conscientious regard to my duty, prevailed with me to consent to
return to the flock from which I had been torn; but with what grief, tears,
great anxiety and distress I did this, the Lord is my best witness, and many
godly persons who would have wished to see me delivered from this painful state,
had it not been that that which I feared, and which made me give my consent,
prevented them and shut their mouths. Were I to narrate the various conflicts by
which the Lord has exercised me since that time, and by what trials he has
proved me, it would make a long history. But that I may not become tedious to my
readers by a waste of words, I shall content myself with repeating briefly what
I have touched upon a little before, that in considering the whole course of the
life of David,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it seemed to me that by his own
footsteps he showed me the way, and from this I have experienced no small
consolation. As that holy king was harassed by the Philistines and other foreign
enemies with continual wars, while he was much more grievously afflicted by the
malice and wickedness of some perfidious men amongst his own people, so I can
say as to myself, that I have been assailed on all sides, and have scarcely been
able to enjoy repose for a single moment, but have always had to sustain some
conflict either from enemies without or within the Church. Satan has made many
attempts to overthrow the fabric of this Church; and once it came to this, that
I, altogether feeble and timorous as I am, was compelled to break and put a stop
to his deadly assaults by putting my life in danger, and opposing my person to
his blows. Afterwards, for the space of five years, when some wicked libertines
were furnished with undue influence, and also some of the common people,
corrupted by the allurements and perverse discourse of such persons, desired to
obtain the liberty of doing whatever they pleased, without controls I was under
the necessity of fighting without ceasing to defend and maintain the discipline
of the Church. To these irreligious characters. and despisers of the heavenly
doctrine, it was a matter of entire indifference, although the Church should
sink into ruin, provided they obtained what they sought, &#8212; the power of
acting just as they pleased. Many, too, harassed by poverty and hunger, and
others impelled by insatiable ambition or avarice and a desire of dishonest
gain, were become so frantic, that they chose rather, by throwing all things
into confusion, to involve themselves and us in one common ruin, than to remain
quiet by living peaceably and
honestly.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> During the whole of this lengthened
period, I think that there is scarcely any of the weapons which are forged in
the workshop of Satan, which has not been employed by them in order to obtain
their object. And at length matters had come to such a state, that an end could
be put to their machinations in no other way than cutting them off by an
ignominious death; which was indeed a painful and pitiable spectacle to me. They
no doubt deserved the severest punishment, but I always rather desired that they
might live in prosperity, and continue safe and untouched; which would have been
the case had they not been altogether incorrigible, and obstinately refused to
listen to wholesome admonition. The trial of these five years was grievous and
hard to bear; but I experienced not less excruciating pain from the malignity of
those who ceased not to assail myself and my ministry with their envenomed
calumnies. A great proportion of them, it is true, are so blinded by a passion
for slander and detraction, that to their great disgracers they betray at once
their impudence, while others, however crafty and cunning, cannot so cover or
disguise themselves as to escape being shamefully convicted and disgraced; yet
when a man has been a hundred times found innocent of a charge brought against
him, and when the charge is again repeated without any cause or occasion, it is
an indignity hard to bear. Because I affirm and maintain that the world is
managed and governed by the secret providence of God, a multitude of
presumptuous men rise lip against me, and allege that I represent God as the
author of sin. This is so foolish a calumny, that it would of itself quickly
come to nothing, did it not meet with persons who have tickled ears, and who
take pleasure in feeding upon such discourse. But there are many whose minds are
so filled with envy and spleen, or ingratitude, or malignity, that there is no
falsehood, however preposterous, yea, even monstrous, which they do not receive,
if it is spoken to them. Others endeavor to overthrow God's eternal purpose of
predestination, by which he distinguishes between the reprobate and the elect;
others take upon them to defend free will; and forthwith many throw themselves
into their ranks, not so much through ignorance as by a perversity of zeal which
I know not how to characterise. If they were open and avowed enemies who brought
these troubles upon me, the thing might in some way be borne. But that those who
shroud themselves under the name of brethren, and not only eat Christ's sacred
bread, but also administer it to others, that those, in short, who loudly boast
of being preachers of the gospel, should wage such nefarious war against me, how
detestable is it? In this matter I may very justly complain with
David,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Yea, mine own familiar
friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel
against me,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
41:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For it was not an enemy
that reproached me; but it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance. We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God
in
company,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
55:12, 13, 14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others circulated ridiculous
reports concerning my treasures; others, of the extravagant authority and
enormous influence which they say I possess; others speak of my delicacies and
magnificence. But when a man is content with scanty food and common clothing and
does not require from the humblest more frugality than he shows and practices
himself, shall it be said that such an one is too sumptuous, and lives in too
high a style? As to the power and influence of which they envy me, I wish I
could discharge this burden upon them; for they estimate my power by the
multitude of affairs, and the vast weight of labors with which I am overwhelmed.
And if there are some whom I cannot persuade whilst I am alive that I am not
rich, my death at length will prove it. I confess, indeed, that I am not poor;
for I desire nothing more than what I have. All these are invented stories, and
there is no color whatever for any one of them; but many nevertheless are very
easily persuaded of their truth, and applaud them; and the reason is, because
the greatest part judge that the only means of cloaking their enormities is to
throw all things into disorder, and to confound black and white; and they think
that the best and shortest way by which they can obtain full liberty to live
with impunity just as they please, is to destroy the authority of Christ's
servants. In addition to these, there are "the hypocritical mockers in feasts,"
of whom David complains,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
35:16;) and I mean by these not only lick-dish characters who seek a meal to
fill their belly,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but all those who by false reports seek
to obtain the favor of the great. Having been long accustomed to swallow such
wrongs as these, I have become almost hardened; yet when the insolence of such
characters increased I cannot but sometimes feel my heart wounded with bitter
pangs. Nor was it enough that I should be so inhumanly treated by my neighbors.
In addition to this, in a distant country towards the frozen ocean, there was
raised I know not how, by the frenzy of a few, a storm which afterwards stirred
up against me a vast number of persons, who are too much at leisure, and have
nothing to do but by their bickering to hinder those who are laboring for the
edification of the Church.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I am still speaking of the internal
enemies of the Church&#8212;of those who, boasting mightily of the gospel of
Christ, nevertheless rush against me with greater impetuosity than against the
open adversaries of the Church, because I do not embrace their gross and
fictitious notion concerning a carnal way of eating Christ in the sacrament; and
of whom I may protest, after the example of David, "I am for peace; but when I
speak, they are for war,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
120:7.) Moreover, the cruel ingratitude of all of them is manifest in this, that
they scruple not to assail both in flank and rear a man who strenuously exerts
himself to maintain a cause which they have in common with him and whom
therefore they ought to aid and succor. Certainly, if such persons were
possessed of even a small portion of humanity, the fury of the Papists which is
directed against me with such unbridled violence, would appease the most
implacable animosity which they may bear towards me. But since the condition of
David was such, that though he had deserved well of his own people, he was
nevertheless bitterly hated by many without a cause, as he complains in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:4, "I restored that which I took not away," it afforded me no small
consolation when I was groundlessly assailed by the hatred of those who ought to
have assisted and solaced me, to conform myself to the example of so great and
so excellent a person. This knowledge and experience have been of much service
in enabling me to understand The Psalms, so that in my meditations upon them, I
did not wander, as it were, in an unknown region. My readers, too, if I mistake
not, will observe, that in unfolding the internal affections both of David and
of others I discourse upon them as matters of which I have familiar experience.
Moreover, since I have labored faithfully to open up this treasure for the use
of all the people of God, although what I have done has not been equal to my
wishes, yet the attempt which I have made deserves to be received with some
measure of favor. Still I only ask that each may judge of my labors with justice
and candour, according to the advantage and fruit which he shall derive from
them. Certainly, as I have said before, in reading these Commentaries, it will
be clearly seen that I have not sought to please, unless in so far as I might at
the same time be profitable to others. And, therefore, I have not only observed
throughout a simple style of teaching, but in order to be removed the farther
from all ostentation, I have also generally abstained from refuting the opinions
of others, although this presented a more favorable opportunity for plausible
display, and of acquiring the applause of those who shall favor my book with a
perusal. I have never touched upon opposite opinions, unless where there was
reason to fear, that by being silent respecting them, I might leave my readers
in doubt and perplexity. At the same time, I am sensible that it would have been
much more agreeable to the taste of many, had I heaped together a great mass of
materials which has great show, and acquires fame for the writer; but I have
felt nothing to be of more importance than to have a regard to the edification
of the Church. May God, who has implanted this desire in my heart, grant by his
grace that the success may correspond
thereto!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>Geneva, July 22,

1.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He who collected the Psalms into one volume, whether
Ezra or some other person, appears to have placed this Psalm at the beginning,
by way of preface, in which he inculcates upon all the godly the duty of
meditating upon the law of God. The sum and substance of the whole is, that they
are blessed who apply their hearts to the pursuit of heavenly wisdom; whereas
the profane despisers of God, although for a time they may reckon themselves
happy, shall at length have a most miserable
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
1:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Blessed is the man who
walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,
nor sitteth in the seat of the scorner. <b>2.</b> But his delight is in the law

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is the
man.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The meaning of the Psalmist, as I have
stated above, is, that it shall be always well with God's devout servants, whose
constant endeavor it is to make progress in the study of his law. The greater
part of mankind being accustomed to deride the conduct of the saints as mere
simplicity, and to regard their labor as entirely thrown away, it was of
importance that the righteous should be confirmed in the way of holiness, by the
consideration of the miserable condition of all men without the blessing of God,
and the conviction that God is favorable to none but those who zealously devote
themselves to the study of divine truth. Moreover, as corruption has always
prevailed in the world, to such a degree, that the general character of men's
lives is nothing else but a continual departure from the law of God, the
Psalmist, before asserting the blessedness of the students of the divine law,
admonishes them to beware of being carried away by the ungodliness of the
multitude around them. Commencing with a declaration of his abhorrence of the
wicked, he teaches us how impossible it is for any one to apply his mind to
meditation upon God's laws who has not first withdrawn and separated himself
from the society of the ungodly. A needful admonition surely; for we see how
thoughtlessly men will throw themselves into the snares of Satan; at least, how
few comparatively there are who guard against the enticements of sin. That we
may be fully apprised of our danger, it is necessary to remember that the world
is fraught with deadly corruption, and that the first step to living well is to
renounce the company of the ungodly, otherwise it is sure to infect us with its
own pollution.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As the prophet, in the first
place, enjoins the godly to beware of temptations to evil, we shall follow the
same order. His affirmation, that they are blessed who have no fellowship with
the ungodly, is what the common feeling and opinion of mankind will scarcely
admit; for while all men naturally desire and seek after happiness, we see how
securely they can indulge themselves in their sins, yea, that those of them who
have departed farthest from righteousness, in the gratification of their lusts,
are accounted happy, because they obtain the desires of their heart. The
prophet, on the contrary, here teaches that no man can be duly animated to the
fear and service of God, and to the study of his law, until he is firmly
persuaded that all the ungodly are miserable, and that they who do not withdraw
from their company shall he involved in the same destruction with them. But as
it is no easy matter to shun the ungodly with whom we are mingled in the world,
so as to be wholly estranged from them, the Psalmist, in order to give the
greater emphasis to his exhortation, employs a multiplicity of
expressions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the first place, he forbids us
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walk in their
counsel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; in the second place, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand in their
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and, lastly, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sit in their
seat</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The sum
of the whole is, that the servants of God must endeavor utterly to abhor the
life of ungodly men. But as it is the policy of Satan to insinuate his deceits,
in a very crafty way, the prophet, in order that none may be insensibly
deceived, shows how by little and little men are ordinarily induced to turn
aside from the right path. They do not, at the first step, advance so far as a
proud contempt of God but having once begun to give ear to evil counsel, Satan
leads them, step by step, farther astray, till they rush headlong into open
transgression. The prophet, therefore, begins with counsel, by which term I
understand the wickedness which does not as yet show itself openly. Then he
speaks of the way, which is to be understood of the customary mode or manner of
living. And he places at the top of the climax the seat, by which metaphorical
expression he designates the obduracy produced by the habit of a sinful life. In
the same way, also, ought the three phrases, to walk, to stand, and to sit, to
be understood. When a person willingly walks after the gratification of his
corrupt lusts, the practice of sinning so infatuates him, that, forgetful of
himself, he grows hardened in wickedness; and this the prophet terms standing in
the way of sinners. Then at length follows a desperate obstinacy, which he
expresses by the figure of sitting. Whether there is the same gradation in the
Hebrew words

<i>letsim</i>, that is to say, a gradual increase of evil, I leave to the
judgment of others.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To me it does not appear that there is,
unless perhaps in the last word. For those are called scorners who, having
thrown off all fear of God, commit sin without restraint, in the hope of
escaping unpunished, and without compunction or fear sport at the judgment of
God, as if they would never be called to render up an account to him. The Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chataim</i>, as it signifies the openly wicked, is very properly joined with
the term way, which signifies a professed and habitual manner of
living.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And if, in the time of the Psalmist, it
was necessary for the devout worshippers of God to withdraw themselves from the
company of the ungodly, in order to frame their life aright, how much more in
the present day, when the world has become so much more corrupt, ought we
carefully to avoid all dangerous society that we may be kept unstained by its
impurities. The prophet, however, not only commands the faithful to keep at a
distance from the ungodly, from the dread of being infected by them, but his
admonition farther implies, that every one should be careful not to corrupt
himself, nor abandon himself to
impiety.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> A man may not have contracted defilement
from evil examples, and yet come to resemble the wicked by spontaneously
imitating their corrupt manners.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second
verse, the Psalmist does not simply pronounce those happy who fear God, as in
other places, but designates godliness <i>by the study of the law,</i> teaching
us that God is only rightly served when had law is obeyed. It is not left to
every man to frame a system of religion according to his own judgment, but the
standard of godliness is to be taken from the Word of God. When David here
speaks of <i>the law,</i> it ought not to be understood as if the other parts of
Scripture should be excluded, but rather, since the whole of Scripture is
nothing else than an exposition of the law, under it as the head is comprehended
the whole body. The prophet, therefore, in commending the law, includes all the
rest of the inspired writings. He must, therefore, be understood as meaning to
exhort the faithful to the reading of the Psalms also. From his characterising
the godly as delighting in the law of the Lord, we may learn that forced or
servile obedience is not at all acceptable to God, and that those only are
worthy students of the law who come to it with a cheerful mind, and are so
delighted with its instructions, as to account nothing more desirable or
delicious than to make progress therein. From this love of the law proceeds
constant meditation upon it, which the prophet mentions on the last clause of
the verse; for all who are truly actuated by love to the law must feel pleasure
in the diligent study of it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
1:3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i> </i>He shall be like a
tree planted by the rivers of waters, that bringeth his fruit in his season;
whose leaf shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall
prosper.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist here illustrates,
and, at the same time, confirms by a metaphor the statement made in the
preceding verse; for he shows in what respect those who fear God are to be
accounted happy, namely, not because they enjoy an evanescent and empty
gladness, but because they are in a desirable condition. There is in the words
an implied contrast between the vigor of a tree planted in a situation well
watered, and the decayed appearance of one which, although it may flourish
beautifully for a time, yet soon withers on account of the barrenness of the
soil in which it is placed. With respect to the ungodly, as we shall afterwards
see,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193735&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:35) they are sometimes like "the cedars of Lebanon." They have such an
overflowing abundance of wealth and honors, that nothing seems wanting to their
present happiness. But however high they may be raised, and however far and wide
they may spread their branches, yet having no root in the ground, nor even a
sufficiency of moisture from which they may derive nourishment, the whole of
their beauty by and by disappears, and withers away. It is, therefore, the
blessing of God alone which preserves any in a prosperous condition. Those who
explain the figure of the faithful bringing forth their fruit in season, as
meaning that they wisely discern when a thing ought to be done so as to be done
well, in my opinion, show more acuteness than judgment, by putting a meaning
upon the words of the prophet which he never intended. He obviously meant
nothing more than that the children of God constantly flourish, and are always
watered with the secret influences of divine grace, so that whatever may befall
them is conducive to their salvation; while, on the other hand, the ungodly are
carried away by the sudden tempest, or consumed by the scorching heat. And when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he bringeth forth his
fruit in
season</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he expresses the full maturity of the
fruit produced, whereas, although the ungodly may present the appearance of
precocious fruitfulness, yet they produce nothing that comes to
perfection.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
1:4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> The ungodly are not so; but
are like the chaff which the wind driveth
away.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist might, with propriety,
have compared the ungodly to a tree that speedily withers, as Jeremiah likens
them to the heath which grows in the wilderness,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:6) But not reckoning this figure sufficiently strong, he debases them by
employing another, which represents them in a light still more contemptible:and
the reason is, that he does not keep his eye on the prosperous condition of
which they boast for a short time, but his mind is seriously pondering on the
destruction which awaits them, and will at length overtake them. The meaning,
therefore, is, although the ungodly now live prosperously, yet by and by they
shall be like chaff; for when the Lord has brought them low, he shall drive them
hither and thither with the blast of his wrath. Besides, by this form of speech,
the Holy Spirit teaches us to contemplate with the eye of faith, what might
otherwise seem incredible; for although the ungodly man rise high, and appear to
great advantage, like a stately tree, we may rest assured that he will be even
as chaff or refuse, whenever God chooses to cast him down from his high estate,
with the breath of his mouth.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
1:5-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> Therefore the ungodly shall
not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
<b>6.</b> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the
ungodly shall perish. 	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">In the fifth verse,
the prophet teaches that a happy life depends on a good conscience, and that,
therefore, it is not wonderful, if the ungodly suddenly fall from the happiness
of which they fancied themselves in possession. And there is implied in the
words a kind of concession; the prophet tacitly acknowledges that the ungodly
please and enjoy themselves, and triumph during the reign of moral disorder in
the world; just as robbers revel in the woods and caves, when beyond the reach
of justice. But he assures us, that things will not always remain in their
present state of confusion, and that when they shall have been reduced to proper
order, these ungodly persons shall be entirely deprived of their pleasures, and
feel that they were infatuated when they thought themselves happy. We now see
how the Psalmist pronounces the ungodly to be miserable, because happiness is
the inward blessing of a good conscience. He does not deny, that before they are
driven to judgment, all things succeed well with them; but he denies that they
are happy unless they have substantial and steadfast integrity of character to
sustain them:for the true integrity of the righteous manifests itself when it
comes at length to be tried. It is indeed true, that the Lord daily executes
judgment, by making a distinction between the righteous and the wicked, but
because this is done only partially in this life, we must look higher if we
desire to behold<i> the assembly of the righteous,</i> of which mention is here
made.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Even in this world the prosperity of the
ungodly begins to pass away as often as God manifests the tokens of his
judgment; (for then, being awakened out of sleep, they are constrained to
acknowledge, whether they will or no, that they have no part with the assembly
of the righteous;) but because this is not accomplished always, nor with respect
to all men, in the present state, we must patiently wait for the day of final
revelation, in which Christ will separate the sheep from the goats. At the same
time, we must maintain it as a general truth, that the ungodly are devoted to
misery; for their own consciences condemn them for their wickedness; and, as
often as they are summoned to give an account of their life, their sleep is
broken, and they perceive that they were merely dreaming when they imagined
themselves to be happy, without looking inward to the true state of their
hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, as things appear to be here
driven about at the mercy of chance, and as it is not easy for us, in the midst
of the prevailing confusion, to acknowledge the truth of what the Psalmist had
said, he therefore presents to our consideration the grand principle, that God
is the Judge of the world. Granting this, it follows that it cannot but be well
with the upright and the just, while, on the other hand, the most terrible
destruction must impend over the ungodly. According to all outward appearance,
the servants of God may derive no advantage from their uprightness; but as it is
the peculiar office of God to defend them and take care of their safety, they
must be happy under his protection. And from this we may also conclude that, as
he is the certain avenger of wickedness, although, for a time, he may seem to
take no notice of the ungodly, yet at length he will visit them with
destruction. Instead, therefore, of allowing ourselves to be deceived with their
imaginary felicity, let us, in circumstances of distress, have ever before our
eyes the providence of God, to whom it belongs to settle the affairs of the
world, and to bring order out of confusion.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
2</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David boasts that his kingdom, though assailed by a
vast multitude of powerful enemies, would, notwithstanding, be perpetual,
because it was upheld by the hand and power of God. He adds, that in spite of
his enemies, it would be extended even to the uttermost ends of the earth. And,
therefore, he exhorts kings and other rulers to lay aside their pride, and
receive, with submissive minds, the yoke laid upon them by God; as it would be
vain for them to attempt to shake it off. All this was typical and contains a
prophecy concerning the future kingdom of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
2:1-3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Why do the nations rise
tumultuously, and the peoples murmur in vain? <b>2.</b> The kings of the earth
have confederated, and the princes have assembled together, against Jehovah and
against his Christ.<b> 3.</b> Let us break of their bonds, and cast away their
yoke from us.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">WE know how many conspired
against David, and endeavored to prevent his coming to the throne, and from
their hostile attempts, had he judged according to the eye of sense and reason,
he might have been so full of apprehension, as forthwith to have given up all
hope of ever becoming king. And, doubtless, he had often to struggle sorrowfully
with very grievous temptations. But, as he had the testimony of an approving
conscience, that he had attempted nothing rashly nor acted as ambition and
depraved desire impel many to seek changes in the government of kingdoms; as he
was, on the contrary, thoroughly persuaded that he had been made king by divine
appointment, when he coveted no such thing, nor even thought of
it;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he encouraged himself by strong
confidence in God against the whole world, just as in these words, he nobly
pours contempt both on kings and their armies. He confesses, indeed, that he had
a sore battle to fight, inasmuch as it was no small party, but whole nations
with their kings, who had conspired against him; but he courageously boasts that
their attempts were vain, because they waged war, not against mortal man, but
against God himself. It is not certain from the words, whether he speaks only of
enemies in his own kingdom, or extends his complaints to foreign invaders. But,
since the fact was, that enemies rose up against him in all quarters, and that
as soon as he had settled the disturbances among his own people, the neighboring
states, in their turn, became hostile to him, I am disposed to think that both
classes of enemies are meant, Gentiles as well as Jews. It would be a strange
mode of expression to speak of many nations and people when only one nation was
meant, and to speak of many kings when he had in eye Saul only. Besides, it
agrees better with the completeness of the type to suppose that different kinds
of enemies were joined together; for we know that Christ had not only to do with
enemies in his own country, but likewise with enemies in other nations; the
whole world having entered into a common conspiracy to accomplish his
destruction. The Jews, indeed, first began to rage against Christ as they had
formerly done against David; but afterwards the same species of madness seized
upon other nations. The sum is, that although those who endeavored to overthrow
him might be strengthened by powerful armies, yet their tumults and counsels
would prove vain and ineffectual.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By attributing
to the people commotion and uproar, and to kings and rulers the holding of
assemblies, to take counsel, he has used very appropriate language. Yet he
intimates that, when kings have long and much consulted together, and the people
have poured forth their utmost fury, all of them united would make nothing of
it. But we ought carefully to mark the ground of such confidence, which was,
that he had not thrust himself forward to be king rashly, or of his own accord,
but only followed the call of God. From this he concludes, that in his person
God was assailed; and God could not but show himself the defender of the kingdom
of which he was the founder. By honoring himself with the title of Messias, or
the Anointed, he declares that he reigned only by the authority and command of
God, inasmuch as the oil brought by the hand of Samuel made him king who before
was only a private person. David's enemies did not, indeed, think they were
making a violent attack against God, yea, they would resolutely deny their
having any such intention; yet it is not without reason that David places God in
opposition to them, and speaks as if they directly levelled their attacks
against him, for by seeking to undermine the kingdom which he had erected, they
blindly and ferociously waged war against Him. If all those are rebels against
God who resist the powers ordained by him, much more does this apply to that
sacred kingdom which was established by special
privilege.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it is now high time to come to
the substance of the type. That David prophesied concerning Christ, is clearly
manifest from this, that he knew his own kingdom to be merely a shadow. And in
order to learn to apply to Christ whatever David, in times past, sang concerning
himself, we must hold this principle, which we meet with everywhere in all the
prophets, that he, with his posterity, was made king, not so much for his own
sake as to be a type of the Redeemer. We shall often have occasion to return to
this afterwards, but at present I would briefly inform my readers that as
David's temporal kingdom was a kind of earnest to God's ancient people of the
eternal kingdom, which at length was truly established in the person of Christ,
those things which David declares concerning himself are not violently, or even
allegorically, applied to Christ, but were truly predicted concerning him. If we
attentively consider the nature of the kingdom, we will perceive that it would
be absurd to overlook the end or scope, and to rest in the mere shadow. That the
kingdom of Christ is here described by the spirit of prophecy, is sufficiently
attested to us by the apostles, who, seeing the ungodly conspiring against
Christ, arm themselves in prayer with this doctrine,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
4:24.) But to place our faith beyond the reach of all cavils, it is plainly made
manifest from all the prophets, that those things which David testified
concerning his own kingdom are properly applicable to Christ. Let this,
therefore, be held as a settled point, that all who do not submit themselves to
the authority of Christ make war against God. Since it seems good to God to rule
us by the hand of his own Son, those who refuse to obey Christ himself deny the
authority of God, and it is in vain for them to profess otherwise. For it is a
true saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He that honoureth not
the Son, honoureth not the</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Father
which hath sent him," (John 5:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is of great importance to hold fast this
inseparable connection, that as the majesty of God hath shone forth in his only
begotten Son, so the Father will not be feared and worshipped but in his
person.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A twofold consolation may be drawn from
this passage:&#8212; First, as often as the world rages, in order to disturb and
put an end to the prosperity of Christ's kingdom, we have only to remember that,
in all this there is just a fulfillment of what was long ago predicted, and no
changes that can happen will greatly disquiet us. Yea, rather it will be highly
profitable to us to compare those things which the apostles experienced with
what we witness at the present time. Of itself the kingdom of Christ would be
peaceable, and from it true peace issues forth to the world; but through the
wickedness and malice of men, never does it rise from obscurity into open view
without disturbances being excited. Nor is it at all wonderful, or unusual, if
the world begin to rage as soon as a throne is erected for Christ. The other
consolation which follows is, that when the ungodly have mustered their forces,
and when, depending on their vast numbers, their riches, and their means of
defense, they not only pour forth their proud blasphemies, but furiously assault
heaven itself, we may safely laugh them to scorn, relying on this one
consideration, that he whom they are assailing is the God who is in heaven. When
we see Christ well nigh overwhelmed with the number and strength of his enemies,
let us remember that they are making war against God over whom they shall not
prevail, and therefore their attempts, whatever they may be, and however
increasing, will come to naught, and be utterly ineffectual. Let us learn,
farther, that this doctrine runs through the whole gospel; for the prayer of the
apostles which I have just quoted, manifestly testifies that it ought not to be
restricted to the person of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us
break,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc. This is a
prosopopoeia,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in which the prophet introduces
his-enemies as speaking; and he employs this figure the better to express their
ungodly and traitorous design. Not that they openly avowed themselves rebels
against God, (for they rather covered their rebellion under every possible
pretext, and presumptuously boasted of having God on their side;) but since they
were fully determined, by all means, fair or foul, to drive David from the
throne, whatever they professed with the mouth, the whole of their consultation
amounted to this, how they might overthrow the kingdom which God himself had set
up. When he describes his government under the metaphorical expressions of
bonds, and a yoke, on the persons of his adversaries, he indirectly condemns
their pride. For he represents them speaking scornfully of his government, as if
to submit to it were a slavish and shameful subjection, just as we see it is
with all the enemies of Christ who, when compelled to be subject to his
authority reckon it not less degrading than if the utmost disgrace were put upon
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
2:4-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> He who dwelleth in heaven
will laugh at them; the
Lord</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
will have them in derision. <b>5.</b> Then will he speak to them in his wrath,
and vex them in his sore displeasure. <b>6.</b> I have anointed my King upon my
holy hill of Sion.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">After David has told us
of the tumult and commotions, the counsels and pride, the preparation and
resources the strength and efforts of his enemies, in opposition to all these he
places the power of God alone, which he concludes would be brought to bear
against them, from their attempting to frustrate his decree. And, as a little
before, by terming them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kings of
the earth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he expressed their feeble and
perishable condition; so now, by the lofty title of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that dwelleth in
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he extols the power of God, as
if he had said, that power remains intact and unimpaired, whatever men may
attempt against it. Let them exalt themselves as they may, they shall never be
able to reach to heaven; yea, while they think to confound heaven and earth
together, they resemble so many grasshoppers, and the Lord, meanwhile,
undisturbed beholds from on high their infatuated evolutions. And David ascribes
laughter to God on two accounts; first, to teach us that he does not stand in
need of great armies to repress the rebellion of wicked men, as if this were an
arduous and difficult matter, but, on the contrary, could do this as often as he
pleases with the most perfect ease. In the second place, he would have us to
understand that when God permits the reign of his Son to be troubled, he does
not cease from interfering because he is employed elsewhere, or unable to afford
assistance, or because he is neglectful of the honor of his Son; but he
purposely delays the inflictions of his wrath to the proper time, namely, until
he has exposed their infatuated rage to general derision. Let us, therefore,
assure ourselves that if God does not immediately stretch forth his hand against
the ungodly, it is now his time of laughter; and although, in the meantime, we
ought to weep, yet let us assuage the bitterness of our grief, yea, and wipe
away our tears, with this reflection, that God does not connive at the
wickedness of his enemies, as if from indolence or feebleness, but because for
the time he would confront their insolence with quiet contempt. By the adverb
then, he points to the fit time for exercising judgment, as if he had said,
after the Lord shall have for a time apparently taken no notice of the
malpractices of those who oppose the rule of his Son, he will suddenly change
his course, and show that he retards nothing with greater abhorrence than such
presumption.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, he ascribes speech to
God, not for the purpose of instructing his enemies, but only to convict them of
their madness; indeed, by the term <i>speak,</i> he means nothing else than a
manifestation of Godwrath, which the ungodly do not perceive until they feel it.
The enemies of David thought it would be the easiest thing in the world for them
to destroy one who, coming from a mean shepherd's cot, had, in their
view,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> presumptuously assumed the sovereign
power. The prophecy and anointing of Samuel were, in their estimation, mere
ridiculous pretences. But when God had at length overthrown them, and settled
David on the throne, he, by this act, spoke not so much with his tongue as with
his hand, to manifest himself the founder of David's kingdom. The Psalmist
hereon then, refers to speaking by actions, by which the Lord, without uttering
a single word, makes manifest his purpose. In like manner, whenever he defends
the kingdom of his Son against the ungodly, by the tokens and inflictions of his
wrath, although he does not speak a single word, yet in effect he speaks enough
to make himself understood.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David afterwards, speaking in the name
of God, shows more clearly how his enemies were guilty of wickedly fighting
against God himself in the hatred which they bore towards him whom God had made
king. The sum is this: Wicked men may now conduct themselves as wickedly as they
please, but they shall at length feel what it is to make war against heaven. The
pronoun <i>I</i> is also emphatical, by which God signifies that he is so far
exalted above the men of this world, that the whole mass of them could not
possibly obscure his glory in the least degree. As often, then, as the power of
man appears formidable to us, let us remember how much it is transcended by the
power of God. In these words there is set before us the unchangeable and eternal
purpose of God effectually to defend, even to the end, the kingdom of his Son,
of which he is the founder; and this may well support our faith amidst the
troublous storms of the world. Whatever plots, therefore, men may form against
it, let this one consideration be sufficient to satisfy us, that they cannot
render ineffectual the anointing of God. Mention is here made of mount Sion in
express terms, not because David was first anointed thereon but because at
length, in God's own time, the truth of the prophecy was manifested and actually
established by the solemn rite of his consecration. And although David in these
words had a regard to the promise of God, and recalled the attention of himself
and others to it, yet, at the same time, he meant to signify that his own reign
is holy and inseparably connected with the temple of God. But this applies more
appropriately to the kingdom of Christ, which we know to be both spiritual and
joined to the priesthood, and this is the principal part of the worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
2:7-8	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> I will declare the decree:
The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
<b>8.</b> Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
possession.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will declare,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">etc. David, to take away all pretense of
ignorance from his enemies, assumes the office of a preacher in order to publish
the decree of God; or at least he protests that he did not come to the throne
without a sure and clear proof of his calling; as if he had said, I did not,
without consideration, publicly go forward to usurp the kingdom, but I brought
with me the command of God, without which, I would have acted presumptuously, in
advancing myself to such fin honorable station. But this was more truly
fulfilled in Christ, and doubtless, David, under the influence of the spirit of
prophecy, had a special reference to him. For in this way all the ungodly are
rendered inexcusable, because Christ proved himself to have been endued with
lawful power from God, not only by his miracles, but by the preaching of the
gospel. In fact, the very same testimony resounds through the whole world. The
apostles first, and after them pastors and teachers, bore testimony that Christ
was made King by God the Father; but since they acted as ambassadors in Christ's
stead, He rightly and properly claims to himself alone whatever was done by
them. Accordingly, Paul
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:17) ascribes to Christ what the ministers of the gospel did in his name. "He
came," says he, "and preached peace to them that were afar off, and to them that
were nigh." Hereby, also, the authority of the gospel is better established
because, although it is published by others, it does not cease to be the gospel
of Christ. As often therefore, as we hear the gospel preached by men, we ought
to consider that it is not so much they who speak, as Christ who speaks by them.
And this is a singular advantage, that Christ lovingly allures us to himself by
his own voice, that we may not by any means doubt of the majesty of his
kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On this account, we ought the more
carefully to beware of wickedly refusing the edict which he publishes,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art my
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">. David, indeed could with propriety be
called the son of God on account of his royal dignity, just as we know that
princes, because they are elevated above others, are called both gods and the
sons of God. But here God, by the singularly high title with which he honors
David, exalts him not only above all mortal men, but even above the angels. This
the apostle
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:5) wisely and diligently considers when he tells us this language was never
used with respect to any of the angels. David, individually considered, was
inferior to the angels, but in so far as he represented the person of Christ, he
is with very good reason preferred far above them. By the Son of God in this
place we are therefore not to understand one son among many, but his only
begotten Son, that he alone should have the pre-eminence both in heaven and on
earth. When God says, I have begotten thee, it ought to be understood as
referring to men's understanding or knowledge of it; for David was begotten by
God when the choice of him to be king was clearly manifested. The words this
day, therefore, denote the time of this manifestation; for as soon as it became
known that he was made king by divine appointment, he came forth as one who had
been lately begotten of God, since so great an honor could not belong to a
private person. The same explanation is to be given of the words as applied to
Christ. He is not said to be begotten in any other sense than as the Father bore
testimony to him as being his own Son. This passage, I am aware, has been
explained by many as referring to the eternal generation of Christ; and from the
words this day, they have reasoned ingeniously as if they denoted an eternal act
without any relation to time. But Paul, who is a more faithful and a better
qualified interpreter of this prophecy, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:33, calls our attention to the manifestation of the heavenly glory of Christ
of which I have spoken. This expression, to be begotten, does not therefore
imply that he then began to be the Son of God, but that his being so was then
made manifest to the world. Finally, this begetting ought not to be understood
of the mutual love which exists between the Father and the Son; it only
signifies that He who had been hidden from the beginning in the sacred bosom of
the Father, and who afterwards had been obscurely shadowed forth under the law,
was known to be the Son of God from the time when he came forth with authentic
and evident marks of Sonship, according to what is said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:14, "we have seen his glory, as of the only begotten of the Father." We must,
at the same time, however, bear in mind what Paul teaches,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:4) that he was declared to be the Son of God with power when he rose again
from the dead, and therefore what is here said has a principal allusion to the
day of his resurrection. But to whatever particular time the allusion may be,
the Holy Spirit here points out the solemn and proper time of his manifestation,
just as he does afterwards in these words</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"This is the day which
the Lord hath made;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we will rejoice
and be glad in it."

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ask of

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:5) to "glorify him with the glory which he had with him before the world
was;" yet the more obvious meaning is, that the Father will deny nothing to his
Son which relates to the extension of his kingdom to the uttermost ends of the
earth. But, in this wonderful matter, Christ is introduced as presenting himself
before the Father with prayers, in order to illustrate the free liberality of
God in conferring upon men the honor of constituting his own Son governor over
the whole world. As the eternal Word of God, Christ, it is true, has always had
in his hands by right sovereign authority and majesty, and as such can receive
no accessions thereto; but still he is exalted in human nature, in which he took
upon him the form of a servant. This title, therefore, is not applied to him
only as God, but is extended to the whole person of the Mediator; for after
Christ had emptied himself there was given to him a name which is above every
name, that before him every knee should bow,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;502609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:9) David, as we know, after having obtained signal victories reigned over a
large extent of territory, so that many nations became tributaries to him; but
what is here said was not fulfilled in him. If we compare his kingdom with other
monarchies it was confined within very narrow boundaries. Unless, therefore, we
suppose this prophecy concerning the vast extent of kingdom to have been uttered
in vain and falsely, we must apply it to Christ, who alone has subdued the whole
world to himself and embraced all lands and nations under his dominion.
Accordingly, here, as in many other places, the calling of the Gentiles is
foretold, to prevent all from imagining that the Redeemer who was to be sent of
God was king of one nation only. And if we now see his kingdom divided,
diminished, and broken down, this proceeds from the wickedness of men, which
renders them unworthy of being under a reign so happy and so desirable. But
although the ingratitude of men hinders the kingdom of Christ from prospering it
does not render this prediction of none effect, inasmuch as Christ collects the
dispersed remnants of his people from all quarters, and in the midst of this
wretched desolation, keeps them joined together by the sacred bond of faiths so
that not one corner only, but the whole world is subjected to his authority.
Besides, however insolently the ungodly may act, and however they may reject his
sovereignty, they cannot, by their rebellion, destroy his authority and power.
To this subject also belongs what immediately
follows:</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
2:9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b> Thou shalt break them with a
rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter's
vessel.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">This is expressly stated to teach
us that Christ is furnished with power by which to reign even over those who are
averse to his authority, and refuse to obey him. The language of David implies
that all will not voluntarily receive his yoke, but that many will be
stiff-necked and rebellious, whom notwithstanding he shall subdue by force, and
compel to submit to him. It is true, the beauty and glory of the kingdom of
which David speaks are more illustriously displayed when a willing people run to
Christ in the day of his power, to show themselves his obedient subjects; but as
the greater part of men rise up against him with a violence which spurns all
restraint, it was necessary to add the truth, that this king would prove himself
superior to all such opposition. Of this unconquerable power in war God
exhibited a specimen, primarily in the person of David, who, as we know,
vanquished and overthrew many enemies by force of arms. But the prediction is
more fully verified in Christ, who, neither by sword nor spear, but by the
breath of his mouth, smites the ungodly even to their utter
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may, however, seem wonderful
that, while the prophets in other parts of Scripture celebrate the meekness, the
mercy, and the gentleness of our Lord, he is here described as so rigorous,
austere, and full of terror. But this severe and dreadful sovereignty is set
before us for no other purpose than to strike alarm into his enemies; and it is
not at all inconsistent with the kindness with which Christ tenderly and sweetly
cherishes his own people. He who shows himself a loving shepherd to his gentle
sheep, must treat the wild beasts with a degree of severity either to convert
them from their cruelty, or effectually to restrain it. Accordingly in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:5, after a commendation is pronounced upon the obedience of the godly Christ
is immediately armed with power to destroy, in the day of his wrath, kings and
their armies who are hostile to him. And certainly both these characters are
with propriety ascribed to him: for he was sent by the Father to cheer the poor
and the wretched with the tidings of salvation, to set the prisoners free, to
heal the sick, to bring the sorrowful and afflicted out of the darkness of death
into the light of life,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
61:1) and as, on the other hand, many by their ingratitude, provoke his wrath
against them, he assumes, as it were, a new character, to beat down their
obduracy. It may be asked, what is that iron scepter which the Father hath put
into the hand of Christ, wherewith to break in pieces his enemies? I answer, The
breath of his mouth supplies to him the place of all other weapons, as I have
just now shown from Isaiah. Although, therefore, Christ move not a finger, yet
by his speaking he thunders awfully enough against his enemies, and destroys
them by the rod of his mouth alone. They may fret and kick, and with the rage of
a madman resist him never so much, but they shall at length be compelled to feel
that he whom they refuse to honor as their king is their judge. In short, they
are broken in pieces by various methods, till they become his footstool. In what
respect the doctrine of the gospel is an iron rod, may be gathered from Paul's
Epistle to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:4) where he teaches that the ministers of Christ are furnished
with spiritual weapons to cast down every high thing which exalteth itself
against Christ, etc. I allow that even the faithful themselves may be offered in
sacrifice to God, that he may quicken them by his grace, for it is meet we
should be humbled in the dust, before Christ stretch forth his hand to save us.
But Christ trains his disciples to repentance in such a way as not to appear
terrible to them; on the contrary, by showing them his shepherd's rod, he
quickly turns their sorrow into joy; and so far is he from using his iron rod to
break them in pieces, that he rather protects them under the healing shadow of
his hand, and upholds them by his power. When David speaks, therefore, of
breaking and bruising, this applies only to the rebellious and unbelieving who
submit to Christ, not because they have been subdued by repentance, but because
they are overwhelmed with despair. Christ does not, indeed, literally speak to
all men; but as he denounces in his word whatever judgments he executes upon
them, he may be truly said to slay the ungodly man with the breath of his mouth,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:8.) The Psalmist exposes to shame their foolish pride by a
beautiful similitude; teaching us, that although their obstinacy is harder than
the stones, they are yet more fragile than <i>earthen vessels.</i> Since,
however, we do not see the enemies of the Redeemer immediately broken in pieces,
but, on the contrary, the Church herself appears rather to be like the frail
earthen vessel under their iron hammered the godly need to be admonished to
regard the judgments which Christ daily executes as presages of the terrible
ruin which remains for all the ungodly, and to wait patiently for the last day,
when he will utterly consume them by the flaming fire in which he will come. In
the meantime, let us rest satisfied that he "rules in the midst of his
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
2:10-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b> And now, O ye kings, be
wise; and ye judges of the earth be instructed. <b>11.</b> Serve Jehovah with
fear, and rejoice with trembling.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">David
having, as a preacher of the judgments of God, set forth the vengeance which God
would take upon his enemies proceeds now, in the character of a prophet and
teacher, to exhort the unbelieving to repentance, that they may not, when it is
too late, be compelled to acknowledge, from dire experience, that the divine
threatenings are neither idle nor ineffectual. And he addresses by name kings
and rulers, who are not very easily brought to a submissive state of mind, and
who are, besides, prevented from learning what is right by the foolish conceit
of their own wisdom with which they are puffed up. And if David spare not even
kings themselves, who seem unrestrained by laws, and exempted from ordinary
rules, much more does his exhortation apply to the common class of men, in order
that all, from the highest to the lowest, may humble themselves before God. By
the adverb now, he signifies the necessity of their speedy repentance, since
they will not always be favored with the like opportunity. Meanwhile, he tacitly
gives them to understand, that it was for their advantage that he warned them,
as there was yet room for repentance provided they made haste. When he enjoins
them to be wise, he indirectly condemns their false confidence in their own
wisdom as if he had said, The beginning of true wisdom is when a man lays aside
his pride, and submits himself to the authority of Christ. Accordingly, however
good an opinion the princes of the world may have of their own shrewdness, we
may be sure they are arrant fools till they become humble scholars at the feet
of Christ. Moreover, he declares the manner in which they were to be wise, by
commanding them to serve the Lord with fear. By trusting to their elevated
station, they flatter themselves that they are loosed from the laws which bind
the rest of mankind; and the pride of this so greatly blinds them as to make
them think it beneath them to submit even to God. The Psalmist therefore, tells
them, that until they have learned to fear him, they are destitute of all right
understanding. And certainly, since they are so much hardened by security as to
withdraw their obedience from God, strong measures must at the first be employed
to bring them to fear him, and thus to recover them from their rebelliousness.
To prevent them from supposing that the service to which he calls them is
grievous, he teaches them by the word rejoice how pleasant and desirable it is,
since it furnishes matter of true gladness. But lest they should, according to
their usual way, wax wanton, and, intoxicated with vain pleasures, imagine
themselves happy while they are enemies to God, he exhorts them farther by the
words with fear to an humble and dutiful submission. There is a great difference
between the pleasant and cheerful state of a peaceful conscience, which the
faithful enjoy in having the favor of God, whom they fear, and the unbridled
insolence to which the wicked are carried, by contempt and forgetfulness of God.
The language of the prophet, therefore, implies, that so long as the proud
profligately rejoice in the gratification of the lusts of the flesh, they sport
with their own destruction, while, on the contrary, the only true and salutary
joy is that which arises from resting in the fear and reverence of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

his wrath is kindled in a moment. O blessed are all who put their trust in
him.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">David expresses yet more distinctly
what kind of fear and service God requires. Since it is the will of God to reign
by the hand of his Son, and since he has engraved on his person the marks and
insignia of his own glory, the proper proof of our obedience and piety towards
him is reverently to embrace his Son, whom he has appointed king over us,
according to the declaration,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He that honoureth not

<div><font face="Palatino">The term kiss refers to the solemn token or sign of
honor which subjects were wont to yield to their sovereigns. The sum is, that
God is defrauded of his honor if he is slot served in Christ. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb</font><font face="Palatino">
Bar, signifies both a son and an elect person; but in whatever way you take it,
the meaning will remain the same. Christ was truly chosen of the Father, who has
given him all power, that he alone should stand pre-eminent above both men and
angels. On which account also he is said to be "sealed" by God,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:27) because a peculiar dignity was, conferred upon him, which removes him to a
distance from all creatures. Some interpreters expound it, <i>kiss or embrace
what is pure</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is a strange and rather forced
interpretation. For my part, I willingly retain the name of son, which answers
well to a former sentence, where it was said, "Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee."</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows immediately after
is a warning to those who despise Christ, that their pride shall not go
unpunished, as if he had said, As Christ is not despised without indignity being
done to the Father, who hath adorned him with his own glory, so the Father
himself will not allow such an invasion of his sacred rights to pass unpunished.
And to teach them to beware of vainly deceiving themselves with the hope of a
lengthened delay, and from their present ease indulging themselves in vain
pleasures, they are plainly told that his wrath will be kindled <i>in a
moment</i>. For we see, when God for a time connives at the wicked, and bears
with them, how they abuse this forbearance, by growing more presumptuous,
because they do not think of his judgments otherwise, than according to sight
and feeling. Some interpreters, I know, explain the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">f[mk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Camoat</i>, which we have rendered, <i>in a moment</i>, in a different way,
namely, that as soon as God's wrath is kindled in even a small degree, it will
be all over with the reprobate. But it is more suitable to apply it to time, and
to view it as a warning to the proud not to harden themselves in their stupidity
and indifference, nor flatter themselves from the patience of God, with the hope
of escaping unpunished. Moreover, although this word appears to be put for the
purpose of giving a reason of what goes
before,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> namely, why those who refuse to kiss the
Son shall perish, and although the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki</i>, signifies more frequently <i>for</i> than <i>when</i>, yet I am
unwilling to depart from the commonly received translation, and have thought it
proper to render the original word by the adverb <i>when</i>, which denotes both
the reason and time of what is predicated. Some explain the phrases, <i>to
perish from the way</i>, as meaning, a perverse way, or wicked manner of
listing. Others resolve it thus, lest your way perish, according to that saying
of the first psalm, the way of the ungodly shall perish. But I am rather
inclined to attach to the words a different meaning, and to view them as a
denunciation against the ungodly, by which they are warned that the wrath of God
will cut them off when they think themselves to be only in the middle of their
race. We know how the despisers of God are accustomed to flatter themselves in
prosperity, and run to great excess in riot. The prophet, therefore, with great
propriety, threatens that when they shall say, Peace and safety, reckoning
themselves at a great distance from their end, they shall be cut off by a sudden
destruction,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;520503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 5:3)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The concluding sentence of
the psalm qualifies what was formerly said concerning the severity of Christ;
for his iron rod and the fiery wrath of God would strike terror into all men
without distinction, unless this comfort had been added. Having, therefore
discoursed concerning the terrible judgment which hangs over the unbelieving, he
now encourages God's faithful and devout servants to entertain good hope, by
setting forth the sweetness of his grace. Paul likewise observes the same order,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:6) for having declared that vengeance was in readiness against
the disobedient, he immediately adds addressing himself to believers "When your
obedience is fulfilled." Now, we understand the meaning of the Psalmist. As
believers might have applied to themselves the severity of which he makes
mention, he opens to them a sanctuary of hope, whither they may flee, in order
not to be overwhelmed by the terror of God's
wrath;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> just as Joel
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel

which of itself is terrible to men,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> immediately subjoins the comfort,
Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For it appears to
me that this exclamation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed
are all they that put their trust in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should be read as a distinct sentence by
itself. The pronoun him may be referred as well to God as to Christ, but, in my
judgment, it agrees better with the whole scope of the psalm to understand it of
Christ, whom the Psalmist before enjoined kings and judges of the earth to
kiss.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
3.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, although driven from his kingdom, and pressed
down with utter despair of relief from every earthly quarter, ceases not to call
upon God, and supports himself from his promise against the greatest terrors,
against the mockery and cruel assaults of his enemies; and, finally, against
death itself, which then forced itself upon his consideration. In the end of the
psalm, he congratulates himself and the whole Church on the happy issue of
all.</font><br></div>

Son</i></b></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"><b><i>
fa35</i></b></font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How bitter David's sorrow was under the conspiracy of
his own household against him, which arose from the treachery of his own son, it
is easy for every one of us to conjecture from the feelings of nature. And when,
in addition to this, he knew that this disaster was brought upon him by God for
his own fault in having defiled another man's wife, and for shedding innocent
blood, he might have sunk into despair, and been overwhelmed with anguish, if he
had not been encouraged by the promise of God, and thus hoped for life even in
death. From his making no allusion here to his sins, we are led to infer, that
only one part of his prayers is comprised in this psalm; for as God punished him
expressly on account of his adultery, and his wicked treachery towards Uriah,
there can be no doubt that he was at first distressed with grievous and dreadful
torments of mind. But after he had humbled himself before God, he took courage;
and being well assured of having obtained forgiveness, he was fully persuaded
that God was on his side, and knew that he would always preside over his
kingdom, and show himself its
protector.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But he, nevertheless, complained of his
son, and of the whole faction involved in the conspiracy, because he knew that
they wickedly rose up for the purpose of frustrating the decree of God. In like
manner, if at any time God makes use of wicked and mischievous men, as scourges
to chastise us, it becomes us first diligently to consider the cause, namely,
that we suffer nothing which we have not deserved, in order that this reflection
may lead us to repentance. But if our enemies, In persecuting us,
rather</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> fight against God than against us, let
the consideration of their doing so be immediately followed by the confident
persuasion of our safety under the protection of him, whose grace, which he hath
promised to us, they despise and trample under
foot.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
3:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> O Lord, how are my

There is no help for him in God.
Selah.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">Sacred history teaches that David
was not only dethroned, but forsaken by almost all men; so that he had well nigh
as many enemies as he had subjects. It is true there accompanied him in his
flight a few faithful friends; but he escaped in safety, not so much by their
aid and protection as by the hiding-places of the wilderness. It is therefore
not wonderful though he was affrighted by the great numbers who were opposed to
him, for nothing could have taken place more unlooked for, on his part, than so
sudden a rebellion. It was a mark of uncommon faith, when smitten with so great
consternation, to venture freely to make his complaint to God, and, as it were,
to pour out his soul into his bosom.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And certainly the only remedy for
allaying our fears is this, to cast upon him all the cares which trouble us; as,
on the other hand, those who have the conviction that they are not the objects
of his regard, must be prostrated and overwhelmed by the calamities which befall
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the third verse he expresses more
distinctly, and more emphatically, the pride of his enemies in deriding him as a
castaway, and as a person whose circumstances were past hope. And he means, that
their boldness increased hereupon, because they were confident he had been
rejected by God. Perhaps, in these words also, their ungodliness is indirectly
referred to, inasmuch as they made no account of the help of God in preserving
the king whom he had chosen. And this second view is the more probable, for
Absalom did not flatter himself with the hope of the favor of God, but, entirely
disregarding him, hoped for victory from his own power. David, therefore,
expressly introduces both him and the rest as speaking after this manner, to
show that it was by a monstrous and outrageous contempt of God that they were
driven to such fury against him, as if they made no account whatever of the fact
of his having been often wonderfully delivered from the greatest dangers. The
ungodly, when they rise up to destroy us, may not openly break forth into such
daring presumption as to maintain it to be impossible for us to derive any
advantage from the favor of God; yet, as they either ascribe every thing to
fortune, or hold the opinion that a man's success will be in proportion to his
strength, and therefore fearlessly rush forward to gain their object, by all
means, whether right or wrong, as if it would be equally the same, whether God
is angry with or favorable towards them, it is evident that they set no value
whatever upon the favor of God, and mock at the faithful as if it would avail
them nothing to be under the care and protection of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The translation of some, <i>Many say </i>OF
<i>my soul, </i>does not give the true meaning of this passage. The letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
lamed is indeed sometimes used as meaning <i>of </i>in Hebrew, but David here
intended to express something more, namely, that his heart was in a manner
pierced with the mockery of his enemies. The word <i>soul, </i>therefore, in my
opinion, here signifies the seat of the affections. And it has a corresponding
meaning in a passage which we shall meet with in another Psalm,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
35:3,) "Say to my soul, I am thy salvation." David thus teaches us by his own
example, that although the whole world, with one voice, should attempt to drive
us to despair, instead of listening to it, we ought rather to give ear to God
alone, and always cherish within us the hope of the salvation which he hath
promised; and as the ungodly use their endeavors to destroy our souls, we ought
to defend them by our prayers. With respect to the word <i>Selah,
</i>interpreters are not agreed. Some maintain it is a mark of affirmations and
has the same signification as truly or amen. Others understand it as meaning
<i>for ever. </i>But as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lls</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>Selal, </i>from which it is derived, signifies <i>to lift up, </i>we incline
to the opinion of those who think it denotes the lifting up of the voice in
harmony in the exercise of singing. At the same time, it must be observed, that
the music was adapted to the sentiment, and so the harmony was in unison with
the character or subject-matter of the song; just as David here, after having
complained of his enemies for shamefully laughing to scorn his hope, as if the
protection of God would be of no avail to him, fixes the attention on this
blasphemy, which severely wounded his heart, by the use of the word <i>Selah;
</i>and as a little after, when he has added a new ground of confidence with
regard to the safety of his person, he repeats the same
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
3:3-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> And thou, Jehovah, art a
shield for me, my glory, and he that exalteth my head. <b>4.</b> I have cried to
the lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill.
Selah.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The copulative <i>and </i>should be
resolved into the disjunctive particle but, because David employs language full
of confidence, in opposition to the hardihood and profane scoffings of his
enemies,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and testifies that whatever they may
say, he would nevertheless rely upon the word of God. It besides appears that he
had previously entertained an assured hope of deliverance, from the circumstance
of his here making no mention of his present calamity as a chastisement
inflicted upon him by the hand of God; but rather depending upon the divine aid,
he courageously encounters his enemies, who were carrying on an ungodly and
wicked war against him, seeing they intended to depose a true and lawful king
from his throne. In short, having acknowledged his sin before, he now takes into
consideration only the merits of the present cause. And thus it becomes the
servants of God to act when molested by the wicked. Having mourned over their
own sins, and humbly betaken themselves to the mercy of God, they ought to keep
their eyes fixed on the obvious and immediate cause of their afflictions, that
they may entertain no doubt of the help of God when undeservedly subjected to
evil treatment. Especially when, by their being evil entreated, the truth of God
is opposed, they ought to be greatly encouraged, and glory in the assurance that
God without doubt will maintain the truth of his own promises against such
perfidious and abandoned characters. Had it been otherwise with David, he might
seem to have claimed these things to himself groundlessly, seeing he had
deprived himself of the approbation and help of God by offending
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But being persuaded that he was not
utterly cut off from the favor of God, and that God's choice of him to be king
remained unchanged, he encourages himself to hope for a favorable issue to his
present trials. And, in the first place, by comparing God to <i>a shield, </i>he
means that he was defended by his power. Hence also he concludes, that God
<i>was his glory, </i>because he would be the maintainer and defender of the
royal dignity which he had been pleased to confer upon him. And, on this
account, he became so bold that he declares he would walk with unabashed
brow.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With my voice have I cried
unto the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here informs us that
he had never been so broken by adversity, or cast down by impious
scornings,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as to be prevented from addressing his
prayers to God<i>. </i>And it was an infallible proof of his faith to exercise
it by praying even in the midst of his distresses. Nothing is more unbecoming
than sullenly to gnaw the bit with which we are bridled, and to withhold our
groaning from God,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if, indeed we have any faith in his
promise. Nor is there a redundancy of expression in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have cried with my
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David distinctly mentions his
voice, the better to express that how much soever the ungodly might rage against
him, he was by no means struck dumb, but pronounced, in a loud and distinct
voice, the name of his God; and to do this was a difficult matter under so
grievous and severe a temptation. He also particularly mentions his voice, in
order to show that he opposes the voice of prayer to the tumultuous outcries of
those who either blame fortune or curse God, or give way to excessive
complainings; those in short, who with passionate confusion pour forth their
immoderate sorrow. But David's meaning appears to me to be principally this,
that amidst the blasphemies of his enemies by which they endeavored to overwhelm
his faith, he was not put to silence, but rather lifted up his voice to God,
whom the ungodly imagined to have become his enemy. He adds that he cried not in
vain, to encourage all the godly to the like constancy. As to the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from</i> <i>the hill of his
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, which signifies the same
things <i>from his holy hill, </i>it is improperly explained of heaven, as has
been done by some. Heaven, I indeed confess, is often called, in other places,
God's holy palace; but here David has doubtless a reference to the ark of the
covenant, which at that time stood on Mount Sion. And he expressly affirms that
he was heard from thence, though he had been compelled to flee into the
wilderness. The Sacred History relates,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;101524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 25:24,) that when Abiathar the priest commanded the ark to be carried by
the Levites, David would not suffer it. And in this the wonderful faith of the
holy man appears conspicuous. He knew that the Lord had chosen Sion to be the
dwelling place of the ark, but he was, notwithstanding, willing rather to be
torn from that sacred symbol of the divine presence, (which was painful to him
as if his own bowels had been torn from him,) than make any innovation not
sanctioned by the will of heaven. Now, he boasts, that although he was deprived
of the sight of the ark, and notwithstanding the distance to which he was
removed from it, God was near him to listen to his prayers. By these words he
intimates that he kept a due medium, inasmuch as he neither despised the visible
sign, which the Lord had appointed on account of the rudeness of the times, nor
by attaching a superstitious importance to a particular place, entertained
carnal conceptions of the glory of God. Thus, he did not idly scatter words
which would vanish into air, as unbelievers are wont to do, who pray also but
are in doubt to what place they ought to direct their speech. David turned
himself directly towards the tabernacle, whence God had promised to be merciful
to his servants. Hence the confidence with which he prayed; and this confidence
was not without success. In our day, since there is fulfilled in Christ what was
formerly shadowed forth by the figures of the law, a much easier way of approach
to God is opened up for us, provided we do not knowingly and willingly wander
from the way.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
3:5-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> I laid me down and slept, I
awaked; for the lord sustained me. <b>6.</b> I will not be afraid of ten
thousands of people, who have set their camps against me on all
sides.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">According to the usage of the
Hebrews, these words, which are in the past tense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I laid me down and
slept</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>are taken sometimes for the
future, <i>I will lie down and
sleep.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If we retain the reading of the
verb in the past tense, David expresses a wonderful and almost incredible
steadfastness of mind in that he slept so soundly in the midst of many deaths,
as if he had been beyond the reach of all danger. He had doubtless been tossed
amidst the merciless waves of anxiety, but it is certain their violence had been
allayed by means of faith, so that however much he was disquieted, he reposed in
God. Thus the godly never fail in ultimately proving victorious over all their
fears, whereas the ungodly, who do not rely upon God, are overwhelmed with
despair, even when they meet with the smallest perils. Some think there is here
a change of tenses; and, therefore, translate the verbs into the fixture tense,
<i>I</i> <i>will lay me down and will sleep, and will awake, </i>because
immediately after a verb of the future is subjoined,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall uphold
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But as he expresses, by these last
words, a continuous act, I thought it unnecessary to change the tenses in the
three first verbs. Still we ought to know, that this confidence of safety is not
to be referred peculiarly to the time of his affliction, or, at least, is not to
be limited to it:for, in my judgment, David rather declares how much good he had
obtained by means of faith and prayer; namely the peaceful and undisturbed state
of a well regulated mind. This he expresses metaphorically when he says, that he
did the ordinary actions of life without being disturbed by fear. "I have not
lain," says he, "waking and restless on my bed; but I have slept soundly,
whereas such manner of sleeping does not generally happen to those who are full
of thought and fear." But let us particularly notice that David came to have
this confidence of safety from the protection of God, and not from stupidity of
mind. Even the wicked are kept fast asleep through an intoxication of mind,
while they dream of having made a covenant with death. It was otherwise with
David, who found rest on no other ground but because he was upheld by the power
of God, and defended by his help. In the next verse, he enlarges upon the
incalculable efficacy of this confidence, of which all the godly have some
understanding, from their experience of the divine protection. As the power of
God is infinite, so they conclude that it shall be invincible against all the
assaults, outrages, preparations, and forces of the whole world. And, indeed,
unless we ascribe this honor to God, our courage shall be always failing us. Let
us, therefore, learn, when in dangers, not to measure the assistance of God
after the manner of man, but to despise whatever terrors may stand in our way,
inasmuch as all the attempts which men may make against God, are of little or no
account.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, O

boasted of his quiet state, it would now appear he desires of the<i> </i>Lord to
be preserved in safety during the whole of his life; as if he had said, Lord,
since thou hast overthrown my enemies, grant that this thy goodness may follow
me, and be continued even to the end of my course. But because it is no uncommon
thing for David, in the Psalms, to mingle together various affections, it seems
more probable, that, after having made mention of his confidence in God, he
returns again to make the same prayers as at the
beginning.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He therefore asks to be preserved,
because he was in eminent peril. What follows concerning <i>the smiting of
</i>his enemies, may be explained in two ways: either that in praying he calls
to his remembrance his former victories, or that having experienced the
assistance of God, and obtained the answer of his prayers, he now follows it up
by thanksgiving: and this last meanings I am much inclined to adopt. In the
first place, then, he declares that he fled to God for help in dangers, and
humbly prayed for deliverance, and after salvation had been granted him, he
gives thanks, by which he testifies, that he acknowledged God to be the author
of the deliverance which he had
obtained.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

Min, </i>some not improperly translate this clause, <i>Salvation is</i> <i>of
the Lord. </i>I, however consider the natural and obvious meaning to be simply
this, that salvation or deliverance is only in the hands of God. By these words,
David not only claims the office and praise of saving for God alone, tacitly
opposing his power to all human succor; but also declares, that although a
thousand deaths hang over his people, yet this cannot render God unable to save
them, or prevent him from speedily sending forth without any effort, the
deliverance which he is always able to impart. In the end of the psalm, David
affirms that this was vouchsafed, not so much to him as an individual, as to the
whole people, that the universal Church, whose welfare depended on the safety
and prosperity of his kingdom, might be preserved from destruction. David,
therefore, acknowledges the dispersion of this wicked conspiracy to have been
owing to the care which God had about the safety of his Church. From this
passage we learn, that the Church shall always be delivered from the calamities
which befall her, because God who is able to save her, will never withdraw his
grace and blessing from her.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
4.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After David in the beginning of the psalm has prayed
to God to help him, he immediately turns his discourse to his enemies, and
depending on the promise of God, triumphs over them as a conqueror. He,
therefore, teaches us by his example, that as often as we are weighed down by
adversity, or involved in very great distress, we ought to meditate upon the
promises of God, in which the hope of salvation is held forth to us, so that
defending ourselves by this shield, we may break through all the temptations
which assail us.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician on Neginoth. A psalm of David.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain at what time this psalm was composed.
But from the tenor of it, it is conjectured, with probability, that David was
then a fugitive and an exile. I therefore refer it to the time when he was
persecuted by Saul. If, however, any person is disposed rather to understand it
as referring to the time when he was compelled by the conspiracy of Absalom to
secure his safety by flight, I will not greatly contend about the matter. But
as, a little after, he uses an expression, namely, "How long?" (verse
3)</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which indicates that he had a lengthened
struggle, the opinion which I have already brought forward is the more probable.
For we know with what varied trials he was harassed, before he obtained complete
deliverance, from the time when Saul began to be his enemy. Concerning the words
which are contained in this verse, I shall only make one or two brief
observations. Some translate the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">htnm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Lamnetsah, for ever</i>;<i> </i>and they say that it was the commencement of
a common song, to the tune of which this psalm was
composed:</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but this I reject as a forced translation. Others, with more truth, are of
opinion, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxnm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Menetsah, </i>signifies one who excels and surpasses all others. But because
expositors are not agreed as to the particular kind of excellence and dignity
here spoken of, let it suffice, that by this word is denoted the chief master or
president of the band.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I do not approve of rendering the word,
<i>conqueror; </i>for although it answers to the subject-matter of the present
psalm, yet it does not at all suit other places where we shall find the same
Hebrew word used. With respect to the second word, <i>Neginoth, </i>I think it
comes from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;gn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Nagan, </i>which signifies to strike or sound; and, therefore, I doubt not,
but it was an instrument of music. Whence it follows, that this psalm was
designed to be sung, not only with the voice, but also with musical instruments,
which were presided over, and regulated by the chief musician of whom we have
just now spoken.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
4:1	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Answer me when I cry, O God
of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged me in distress; have pity upon me, and
hear my prayer.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">In these words there is<i>
</i>shown the faith of David, who, although brought to the uttermost distress,
and indeed almost consumed by a long series of calamities, did not sink under
his sorrow; nor was he so broken in heart as to be prevented from betaking
himself to God his deliverer. By his praying, he testified, that when utterly
deprived of all earthly succor, there yet remained for him hope in God.
Moreover, he calls him<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
God of his righteousness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is the
same thing as if he had called him the vindicator of his
right;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and he appeals to God, because all men
everywhere condemned him, and his innocence was borne down by the slanderous
reports of his enemies and the perverse judgments of the common people. And this
cruel and unjust treatment which David met with, ought to be carefully marked.
For while nothing is more painful to us than to be falsely condemned, and to
endure, at one and the same time, wrongful violence and slander; yet to be
ill<i> </i>spoken of for<i> </i>doing well, is an affliction which daily befalls
the saints. And it becomes them to be so exercised under it as to turn away from
all the enticements of the world, and to depend wholly upon God alone.
<i>Righteousness</i>, therefore, is here to be understood of a good cause, of
which David makes God the witness, while he complains of the malicious and
wrongful conduct of men towards him; and, by his example, he<i> </i>teaches us,
that if at any time our uprightness is not seen and acknowledged by the world,
we ought not on that account to despond, inasmuch as we have one in heaven to
vindicate our cause. Even the heathen have said there is no better stage for
virtue than a man's own conscience. But it is a consolation far surpassing this,
to know when men vaunt themselves over us wrongfully, that we are standing in
the view of God and of the angels. Paul, we know, was endued with courage
arising from this source,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:5) for when many evil reports were spread abroad concerning him
among the Corinthians, he appeals to the judgment-seat of God. Isaiah also,
fortified by the same confidence,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
50:6 and following verse) despises all the slanders by which his enemies
calumniated him. If, therefore, we cannot find justice anywhere in the world the
only support of our patience is to look to God, and to rest contented with the
equity of his judgment. It may, however, be asked by way of objection, Since all
the purity of men is mere pollution in the sight of God, how can the godly dare
to bring forward their own righteousness before him? With respect to David, it
is easy to answer this question. He did not boast of his own righteousness
except in reference to his enemies, from whose calumnies he vindicated himself.
He had the testimony of a good conscience that he had attempted nothing without
the call and commandment of God, and therefore he does not speak rashly when he
calls God the protector and defender of his right. Hence we learn that David
honored God with this title of praise, in order the more readily to set him in
contrast with the whole world. And as he asks twice to be heard, in this there
is expressed to us both the vehemence of his grief and the earnestness of his
prayers. In the last clause of the verse, he also shows whence he expected to
obtain what he needed, namely, from the mercy of God. And certainly, as often as
we ask anything from God, it becomes us to begin with this, and to beseech him,
according to his free goodness, to relieve our
miseries.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast enlarged
me when I was in distress.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think
that David here promises himself what he had not yet experienced; and in the
exercise of hope anticipates the manifestations of God's grace with which he
should afterwards be favored. But, in my opinion, he rather mentions the
benefits which he formerly received from God, and by these strengthens himself
against the time to come. Thus the faithful are accustomed to call to their
remembrance those things which tend to strengthen their faith. We shall,
hereafter meet with many passages similar to this, where David, in order to give
energy to his faith against terrors and
dangers,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> brings together the many experiences
from which he had learned that God is always present with his own people and
will never disappoint their desires. The mode of expression which he here
employs is metaphorical, and by it he intimates that a way of escape was opened
up to him even when he was besieged and enclosed on every side. The distress of
which he speaks, in my opinion, refers not less to the state of his mind than to
circumstances of outward affliction; for David's heart was not of such an iron
mould as to prevent him from being cast into deeper mental anguish by
adversity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
4:2-3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b> O ye sons of men, how long
will ye try to turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and
seeking after lying? Selah <b>3.</b> But know that Jehovah hath chosen for
himself one who is merciful:Jehovah will hear when I call upon
him.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O ye sons of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The happy result of the prayer of David
was, that resuming courage, he was able not only to repel the fury of his
enemies, but also to challenge them on his part, and fearlessly to despise all
their machinations. That our confidence, therefore, may remain unshaken, we
ought not, when assailed by the wicked, to enter into conflict without being
furnished like David with the same armor. The sum is, that since God was
determined to defend David by his own power, it was in vain for all the men in
the world to endeavor to destroy him; however great the power which they
otherwise might have of doing him injury. By calling those whom he addresses the
sons, not of Adam, or of some common persons but <i>of men, </i>he seems by the
way to reprove their pride.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I do not agree with certain Jewish
expositors who think that nobles or men of rank are meant. It is rather an
ironical concession of what they claimed to themselves, by which he ridicules
their presumption, in esteeming themselves to be noble and wise, whereas it was
only blind rage which impelled them to wicked enterprises. In the words <i>how
long, </i>he condemns their perverse obstinacy; for what he means, is not that
they were stirred up against him merely by some sudden impulses, but that the
stubborn purpose of injuring him was deeply fixed in their hearts. Had not their
maliciousness deprived them of their understanding, the many instances in which
God had proved himself to be David's defender would have compelled them to
desist from their attempts against him. But as they were fully determined to
disgrace <i>him </i>whom God had exalted to the royal throne he asks them, How
long they will persevere in their endeavors
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to turn his glory into
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And it is to be observed that
although loaded with every kind of reproach, both among the high and the low he
yet courageously keeps fast hold of the glory or the honor of royalty which God
had graciously promised him, or had conferred upon him, and is fully persuaded
that God will at length vindicate his right to it, however much his enemies
might wickedly endeavor to blot and obscure it by treating his pretensions with
derision and scorn.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long
will ye love vanity?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words, he
partly reproaches his enemies for the wicked and perverse passions with which he
saw them to be impelled, although they falsely pretended to be actuated by a
godly zeal; and he partly derides their folly in flattering themselves with the
hope of success while fighting against God. And it is a most pointed rebuke.
Even when the ungodly rush headlong into all manner of wickedness with the
grossest</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> malice, they soothe themselves with
deceitful flatteries in order not to be disturbed with the feelings of remorse.
David, therefore, cries out, that wilfully to shut their eyes and varnish their
unrighteousness with deceitful colors, would avail them nothing. The ungodly may
indeed flatter and delude themselves, but when they are brought in good earnest
to the trial, it will be always manifest that the reason why they are deceived
is, because from the beginning they were determined to deal deceitfully. Now,
from this place, we ought to take a shield of invincible steadfastness as often
as we see ourselves overmatched in prudence and subtlety by the wicked. For with
whatever engines they assault us, yet if we have the testimony of a good
conscience, God will remain on our side, and against him they shall not prevail.
They may greatly excel in ingenuity, and possess much power of hurting us, and
have their plans and subsidiary aid in the greatest readiness, and be very
shrewd in discernment, yet whatever they may invent, it will<i> </i>be but lying
and vanity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know that Jehovah hath set
apart, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a confirmation of
the preceding verse, for it shows that the cause of David's boldness consisted
in this, that he depended upon God, the founder of his kingdom. And surely we
may then safely triumph over our enemies when we are assured of having the call
of God to the office which we hold, or the work in which we are engaged.
Accordingly, David does not here boast of his own strength, or riches, or armies
by which he obtained the kingdom. But as he was chosen by God, he intimates that
the many attempts of his enemies against him would be without success, because
they would find from experience, that God, whose power they could not
successfully resist, was against them. In the first place, he says that he was
<i>set apart </i>by God, by which he means that he was advanced to the throne,
not by the will of man, or by his own ambition, but by the appointment of God.
The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Phalah, </i>signifies to separate, and it here refers to separation to honor
and dignity; as if he had said you admit no one as king but he who is chosen by
your own suffrages, or who pleases you; but it is the peculiar prerogative of
God to make choice of whom he will. By the word <i>merciful </i>or <i>bountiful,
</i>he doubtless vindicates his right to be king, from the fact that this was a
quality which belonged to himself; it is as if he had produced the mark or badge
of his calling. For it was truly said in the old proverb, Mercy is the virtue
most suitable for kings. Now, God usually furnishes those whom he reckons worthy
of having this honor conferred upon them, with the endowments requisite for the
exercise of their office, that they may not be as dead idols. Some understand
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dysj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chasid, </i>in a passive sense, not as denoting a beneficent person, but one
who is placed on the throne by the favor of God. As, however, I meet with no
examples of this signification of the word in Scripture, I think it safer to
follow the common interpretation, which is this:God has chosen a king, who
answers to the character which should be possessed by all who are called to fill
such an exalted station, in as much as he is merciful and beneficent. Hence, he
infers that he would be heard by God as often as he called upon him; for God
principally proves his faithfulness in this, that he does not forsake the work
of his own hands, but continually defends those whom he has once received into
his favor. Hence, we are taught fearlessly to proceed in our path; because
whatever we may have undertaken according to his will, shall never be
ineffectual. Let this truth then, obtain a fixed place in our minds, that God
will never withhold his assistance from those who go on sincerely in their
course. Without this comfort, the faithful must inevitably sink into despondency
every moment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
4:4-5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> Tremble then, and sin

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tremble
then.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Now he exhorts his enemies to
repentance, if peradventure, their madness was not wholly incorrigible. In the
first place, he bids them <i>tremble, </i>or <i>be troubled</i>;<i> </i>a<i>
</i>word by which he rebukes their stupidity in running headlong in their wicked
course, without any fear of God, or any sense of danger. And certainly the great
presumption of all the ungodly in not hesitating to engage in war against God,
proceeds from their being hardened through an infatuated security; and by their
thoughtlessness, they render themselves stupid, and become more obdurate by
forgetting both God and themselves, and following whithersoever lust leads them.
He tells them that the best remedy to cure their rage, and prevent them from
<i>sinning </i>any longer, would be to awaken from their lethargy and begin to
be afraid and tremble; as if he had said, As soon as you shall have shaken off
your drowsiness and insensibility, your desire of sinning will abate; for the
reason why the ungodly are troublesome to the good and the simple, and cause so
much confusion, is because they are too much at peace with
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He afterwards admonishes them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to commune with their own heart

account of themselves at leisure, and as it were, in some place of deep
retirement;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> an exercise which is opposed to their
indulgence of their unruly passions. In the end of the verse he enjoins them
<i>to be still. </i>Now, it is to be observed, that the cause of this stillness
is the agitation and trembling, of which he before made mention. For if any have
been hurried into sin by their infatuated recklessness, the first step of their
return to a sound mind is to awaken themselves from their deep sleep to
fearfulness and trembling. After this follows calm and deliberate reflection;
then they consider and reconsider to what dangers they have been exposing
themselves; and thus at length they, whose audacious spirits shrink at nothing,
learn to be orderly and peaceable, or, at least, they restrain their frantic
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To commune upon
one's bed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a form of expression taken
from the common practice and experience of men. We know that, during our
intercourse with men in the day time, our thoughts are distracted, and we often
judge rashly, being deceived by the external appearance; whereas in solitude, we
can give to any subject a closer attention; and, farther, the sense of shame
does not then hinder a man from thinking without disguise of his own faults.
David, therefore, exhorts his enemies to withdraw from those who witnessed and
judged of their actions on the public stage of life, and to be alone, that they
may examine themselves more truthfully and honestly. And this exhortation has a
respect to us all; for there is nothing to which men are more prone than to
deceive one another with empty applause, until each man enter into himself, and
commune alone with his own heart. Paul, when quoting this passage in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:26, or, at least when alluding to the sentiment of David, follows the
Septuagint, "Be ye angry and sin not." And yet he has skilfully and beautifully
applied it to his purpose. He there teaches us that men, instead of wickedly
pouring forth their anger against their neighbors, have rather just cause to be
angry with themselves, in order that, by this means, they may abstain from sin.
And, therefore, he commands them rather to fret inwardly, and be angry with
themselves; and then to be angry, not so much at the persons, as at the vices of
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sacrifice
ye.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many are of opinion that David
exhorts his enemies to give some evidence of their repentance; and I certainly
admit, that sacrifices were partly enjoined for the purpose of inducing men to
walk in newness of life. But when I consider the character of the men who
opposed David, I am satisfied that he here censures their hypocrisy, and beats
down their groundless boasting. David, when he wandered as a fugitive in
deserts, or in caves, or on mountains, or in the regions beyond his own country,
might seem to have been separated from the Church of God; and certainly he was
commonly accounted as a corrupt member cut off from the body and the communion
of the saints. Meanwhile the ark of the covenant was in the hands of his
enemies, they kept possession of the temple, and they were the first in offering
sacrifices. They, therefore, vaunted themselves against David with the same
boldness and presumption with which we know hypocrites to have been always
puffed up. Nor is it to be doubted, but they proudly abused the name of God as
if they only had been his true
worshippers.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4) rebukes the ungodly, because of the false confidence which they placed in
the temple of the Lord; so David also denies that God is pacified by mere
outward ceremonies, since he requires pure sacrifices. There is in the words an
implied contrast between the sacrifices of righteousness, and all those vain and
spurious rites</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with which the counterfeit worshippers
of God satisfy themselves. The sum, therefore, is, "You boast of having God on
your side, because you have free access to his altar to offer your sacrifices
there with great pomp; and because I am banished from the Holy Land, and not
suffered to come to the temple, you think that I am not an object of the divine
care. But you must worship God in a far different manner, if you would expect
any good at his hand; for your unclean sacrifices with which you pollute his
altar, so far from rendering him favorable to you, will do nothing else but
provoke his wrath." Let us learn from this passage, that, in contending with the
corrupters of true religion, who may have the name of God continually in their
mouth, and vaunt themselves on account of their observance of his outward
worship, we may safely rebuke their boasting, because they do not offer the
right sacrifices. But, at the same time, we must beware lest a vain pretense of
godliness foster in us a perverse and ill founded confidence, in place of true
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
4:6-7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> Many say, Who will show us

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many
say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some are of opinion that David here
complains of the cruel malice of his enemies, because they greedily sought for
his life. But David, I have no doubt, compares the sole wish with which his own
heart was burning, to the many desires with which almost all mankind are
distracted. As it is not a principle held and acted upon by ungodly men, that
those only can be truly and perfectly happy who are interested in the favor of
God, and that they ought to live as strangers and pilgrims in the world, in
order through hope and patience to obtain, in due time, a better life, they
remain contented with perishing good things; and, therefore, if they enjoy
outward prosperity, they are not influenced by any great concern about God.
Accordingly, while, after the manner of the lower animals, they grasp at various
objects, some at one thing, and some at another, thinking to find in them
supreme happiness, David, with very good reason, separates himself from them,
and proposes to himself an end of an entirely opposite description. I do not
quarrel with the interpretation which supposes that David is here complaining of
his own followers, who, finding their strength insufficient for bearing the
hardships which befell them, and exhausted by weariness and grief, indulged in
complaints, and anxiously desired repose. But I am rather inclined to extend the
words farther, and to view them as meaning that David, contented with the favor
of God alone, protests that he disregards, and sets no value on objects which
others ardently desire. This comparison of the desire of David with the desires
of the world, well illustrates this important
doctrine,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the faithful, forming a low
estimate of present good things, rest in God alone, and account nothing of more
value than to know from experience that they are interested in his favor. David,
therefore, intimates in the first place, that all those are fools, who, wishing
to enjoy prosperity, do not begin with seeking the favor of God; for, by
neglecting to do this, they are carried about by the various false opinions
which are abroad. In the second place, he rebukes another vice, namely, that of
gross and earthly men in giving themselves wholly to the ease and comforts of
the flesh, and in settling down in, or contenting themselves with, the enjoyment
of these alone, without thinking of any thing
higher.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whence also it comes to pass, that as
long as they are supplied with other things according to their desire, they are
altogether indifferent about God, just as if they had no need of him. David, on
the contrary, testifies, that although he may be destitute of all other good
things, the fatherly love of God is sufficient to compensate for the loss of
them all. This, therefore, is the purport of the whole:"The greater number of
men greedily seek after present pleasures and advantages; but I maintain that
perfect felicity is only to be found in the favor of
God."</font><br><font face="Palatino">David uses the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The light of God's
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to denote his serene and
pleasant countenance &#8212; the manifestations of his favor and love; just as,
on the other hand, the face of God seems to us dark and clouded when he shows
the tokens of his anger. This light, by a beautiful metaphor, is said to be
<i>lifted up, </i>when, shining in our hearts, it produces trust and hope. It
would not be enough for us to be beloved by God, unless the sense of this love
came home to our hearts; but, shining upon them by the Holy Spirit, he cheers us
with true and solid joy. This passage teaches us that those are miserable who do
not, with full resolution, repose themselves wholly in God, and take
satisfaction therein,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> even although they may have an
overflowing abundance of all earthly things; while, on the other hand, the
faithful, although they are tossed amidst many troubles, are truly happy, were
there no other ground for it but this, that God's fatherly countenance shines
upon them, which turns darkness into light, and, as I may say, quickens even
death itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast given more joy to
my heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By<i> </i>another comparison
he better expresses and illustrates the strength of his affection, showing that,
having obtained the good which he had longed for, he does not in the least
degree envy the wealth and enjoyments of others, but is altogether contented
with his own lot. The sum is, that he had more satisfaction in seeing the
reconciled countenance of God beaming upon him, than if he had possessed garners
full of corn, and cellars full of
wine.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Interpreters are not agreed as to the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t[m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
me-eth, </i>which we have translated, <i>in the time. </i>Some give this
rendering, <i>Thou hast put gladness into my heart, </i>Since The Time
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that their corn and wine
increased</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if David had said, I
rejoice when I see mine enemies prospering in the
world.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the former translation appears to me
much more suitable; according to which David declares, that he rejoices more in
the favor of God alone, than earthly men rejoice when they enjoy all earthly
good things, with the desire of which they are generally inflamed. He had
represented them as so bent upon, and addicted to, the pursuit of worldly
prosperity, as to have no great care about God; and now he adds, that their joy
in the abundance and increase of their wine and corn is not so great as is his
joy in a sense of the divine goodness alone. This verse contains very profitable
instruction. We see how earthly men, after they have despised the grace of God,
and plunged themselves over head and ears in transitory pleasures, are so far
from being satisfied with them, that the very abundance of them inflames their
desires the more; and thus, in the midst of their fullness, a secret uneasiness
renders their minds uncomfortable. Never, therefore, shall we obtain undisturbed
peace and solid joy until the favor of God shine upon us. And although the
faithful also desire and seek after their worldly comforts, yet they do not
pursue them with immoderate and irregular ardor; but can patiently bear to be
deprived of them, provided they know themselves to be the objects of the divine
care.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
4:8	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> I will lay me down, and will
sleep together in peace; for thou, Lord, hast placed me alone
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa64</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in safety.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">He concludes, by stating, that
as he is protected by the power of God, he enjoys as much security and quiet as
if he had been defended by all the garrisons on earth. Now, we know, that to be
free from all fear, and from the torment and vexation of care, is a blessing to
be desired above all other things. This verse, therefore, is a confirmation of
the former sentence, intimating that David justly prefers the joy produced by
the light of God's fatherly love before all other objects for inward peace of
mind certainly surpasses all the blessings of which we can form any conception.
Many commentators explain this place as expressing David's hope, that his
enemies will be reconciled to him, so that he may sleep with them in peace, God
having granted him the peculiar privilege of being able to rest without being
disturbed or disquieted by any man. But in my judgment the proper meaning is
this, that he will live as quietly and securely alone, as in the midst of a
great host of men, because God defends him for in the words, <i>I will sleep
together, </i>I consider the particle <i>as </i>to be understood, as if the
reading were <i>as together, </i>that is to say, as with a multitude. Some refer
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddbl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lebadad, alone, </i>to God, translating the words thus, <i>Thou alone, O
Lord, hast set me in safety; </i>but this I do not at all approve, because, by
taking away the contrast between these two words, <i>together </i>and <i>alone,
</i>much of the beauty of the sentence is<i> </i>lost. In short, David boasts
that the protection of God alone was sufficient, and that under it he sleeps as
securely, although destitute of all human guardianship, as if he had had many to
keep watch and ward continually over him, or as if he had been defended on all
sides by a great company. Let us therefore, learn from his example, to yield
this honor to God &#8212; to believe, that although there may appear no help for
us from men, yet under his hand alone we are kept in peace and safety, as if we
were surrounded by a great host.</font><br></div>

brings forward the intolerable malice of his enemies, showing how inconsistent
it would be with the character of God, were they to be left unpunished. He next
speaks of his own faith and patience, and even comfort; having no doubt whatever
of a happy issue. Finally, he concludes, that when he shall be delivered, the
benefits resulting from his deliverance would not be limited to himself, but
would extend to all the godly.</font><br></div>

presume not positively to determine whether David, in this psalm, bewails the
wrongs which he suffered from his enemies at some particular time, or whether he
complains generally of the various persecutions with which, for a long time, he
was harassed under Saul. Some of the Jewish commentators apply the psalm even to
Absalom; because, by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bloody
and deceitful man</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"> they think Doeg and
Ahithophel are pointed out. To me, however, it appears more probable, that when
David, after the death of Saul, had got peaceable possession of the kingdoms he
committed to writing the prayers which he had meditated in his afflictions and
dangers. But to come to the words:&#8212; First, he expresses one thing in three
different ways; and this repetition denotes the strength of his affection, and
his long perseverance in prayer. For he was not so fond of many words as to
employ different forms of expression, which had no meaning; but being deeply
engaged in prayer, he represented, by these various expressions, the variety of
his complaints.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It therefore signifies, that he prayed
neither coldly nor only in few words; but that, according as the vehemence of
his grief urged him, he was earnest in bewailing his calamities before God; and
that since it did not immediately appear what would be their issue, he
persevered in repeating the same complaints. Again, he does not expressly state
what he desires to ask from
God:</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa68</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but there is a greater force in this kind of suppression, than if he had spoken
distinctly. By not uttering the desires of his heart, he shows more emphatically
that his inward feelings, which he brought with him before God, were such that
language was insufficient to express them. Again, the word <i>cry</i>, which
signifies a loud and sonorous utterance of the voice, serves to mark the
earnestness of his desire. David did not cry out as it were into the ears of one
who was deaf; but the vehemence of his grief and his inward anguish, burst forth
into this cry. The verb </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgh
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>hagah, </i>from which the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gygh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hagig, speech, </i>which the prophet here uses, is derived, means both <i>to
speak distinctly, </i>and<i> to whisper or to mutter. </i>But the second sense
seems better suited to this passage.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> After David has said in general, that
God hears his words, he seems, immediately after, for the purpose of being more
specific, to divide them into two kinds, calling the one obscure or indistinct
moanings, and the other loud crying.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the first he means a confused
muttering, such as is described in the Song of Hezekiah, when sorrow hindered
him from speaking distinctly, and making his voice to be heard. "Like a crane,
or a swallow, so did I chatter; I did mourn as a dove,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:14.)</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If, then, at any time we are either
backward to pray, or our devout affections begin to lose their fervor, we must
here seek for arguments to quicken and urge us forward. And as by calling God
<i>his King </i>and <i>his God, </i>he intended to stir up himself to entertain
more lively and favorable hopes with respect to the issue of his afflictions,
let us learn to apply these titles to a similar use, namely, for the purpose of
making ourselves more familiar with God. At the close, he testifies that he does
not sullenly gnaw the bit, as unbelievers are accustomed to do; but directs his
groaning to God:for they who, disregarding God, either fret inwardly or utter
their complaints to men, are not worthy of being regarded by him. Some translate
the last clause thus, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I pray
to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but to me it seems rather to be
the reason which David assigns for what he had said immediately before, and that
his purpose is, to encourage himself to trust in God, by assuming this as a
general principle that whoever call upon God in their calamities never meet with
a repulse from him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
5:3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> O that thou wouldst hear my
voice in the morning; O Jehovah, in the morning will I direct unto thee, and I
will keep watch.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The first sentence may
also be read in the future tense of the indicative mood, <i>Thou shalt hear my
prayer. </i>But,<i> </i>in my opinion, the verb is rather in the optative mood,
as<i> </i>I have translated it. Having besought God to grant his requests, he
now entreats him to make haste. Some think he alludes to the morning prayers
which were wont to be joined with the daily sacrifices in the temple, according
to the appointment of the law. Although I do not disapprove of this opinion, yet
I have no doubt but that, constrained by the weariness of a somewhat lengthened
delay, he wishes his deliverance to be hastened; as if he had said, "As soon as
I awaken this will be the first subject of my thoughts. Therefore, O Lord, delay
no longer the help of which I stand in need, but grant immediately my desires."
The expression, <i>To direct unto God, </i>I take to signify the same thing as
directly to approach to God. Many, as if the language were elliptical, supply
the words, <i>my prayer. </i>But in my judgment, David rather intends to declare
that he was not turned hither and thither, nor drawn different ways by the
temptations to which he was exposed, but that to betake himself to God was the
settled order of his life. There is, in the words, an implied contrast between
the rambling and uncertain movements of those who look around them for worldly
helps, or depend on their own counsels and the direct leading of faith, by which
all the godly are withdrawn from the vain allurements of the world, and have
recourse to God alone. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;r[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arac, </i>signifies to set in order or dispose, and sometimes to dress or
make fit. This sense is very suitable to the passage, in which David plainly
declares it to be his determination not to be drawn away in any degree from his
orderly course into the indirect and circuitous paths of error and sin, but to
come directly to God. By the word, <i>watch, </i>he conveys the idea of hope and
patience as well as of anxiety. As
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsapah, </i>in Hebrew means, <i>to wait for, </i>as well as <i>to look for,
</i>David, I have no doubt, intended to say, that after he had disburdened his
cares into the bosom of God, he would, with an anxious mind, look out, as it
were, like a sentinel, until it should appear, that in very deed God had heard
him. No doubt, in the exercise of longing, there is always implied some degree
of uneasiness; but he who is looking out for the grace of God with anxious
desire, will patiently wait for it. This passages therefore, teaches us the
uselessness of those prayers to which there is not added that hope which may be
said to elevate the minds of the petitioners into a
watch-tower.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

wickedness of his enemies an argument to enforce his prayer for the divine favor
towards him. The language is indeed abrupt, as the saints in prayer will often
stammer; but this stammering is more acceptable to God than all the figures of
rhetoric, be they ever so fine and glittering. Besides, the great object which
David has in view, is to show, that since the cruelty and treachery of his
enemies had reached their utmost height, it was impossible but that God would
soon arrest them in their course. His reasoning is grounded upon the nature of
God. Since righteousness and upright dealing are pleasing to him, David, from
this, concludes that he will take vengeance on all the unjust and wicked. And
how is it possible for them to escape from his hand unpunished, seeing he is the
judge of the world? The passage is worthy of our most special attention. For we
know how greatly we are discouraged by the unbounded insolence of the wicked. If
God does not immediately restrain it, we are either stupified and dismayed, or
cast down into despair. But David, from this, rather finds matter of
encouragement and confi-dence. The greater the lawlessness with which his
enemies proceeded against him, the more earnestly did he supplicate preservation
from God, whose office it is<i> </i>to destroy all the wicked, because he hates
all wickedness. Let all the godly, therefore, learn, as often as they have to
contend against violence, deceit, and injustice, to raise their thoughts to God
in order to encourage themselves in the certain hope of deliverance, according
as Paul also exhorts them in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:5, "Which is," says he, "a manifest token of the righteous
judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
ye also suffer:seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation
to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with us." And
assuredly he would not be the judge of the world if there were not laid up in
store with him a recompense for all the ungodly. One use, then, which may be
made of this doctrine is this, &#8212; when we see the wicked indulging
themselves in their lusts, and when, in consequence, doubts steal into our minds
as to whether God takes any care of us, we should learn to satisfy ourselves
with the consideration that God, who hates and abhors all iniquity, will not
permit them to pass unpunished, and although he bear with them for a time, he
will at length ascend into the judgment-seat, and show himself an avenger, as he
is the protector and defender of his
people.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Again, we may infer from this passage
the common doctrine, that God, although he works by Satan and by the ungodly,
and makes use of their malice for executing his judgments, is not, on this
account, the author of sin, nor is pleased with it because the end which he
purposes is always righteous; and he justly condemns and punishes those who, by
his mysterious providence, are driven whithersoever he
pleases.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the 4th verse some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ra</i>, in the masculine gender, for a wicked man; but I understand it rather
of wickedness itself David declares simply, that there is no agreement between
God and unrighteousness. He immediately after proceeds to speak of the men
themselves, saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the foolish
shall not stand in thy sight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and it is
a very just inference from this, that iniquity its hateful to God, and that,
therefore, he will execute just punishment upon all the wicked. He calls
those<i> fools, </i>according to a frequent use of the term in Scripture, who,
impelled by blind passion, rush headlong into sin. Nothing is more foolish, than
for the ungodly to cast away the fear of God, and suffer the desire of doing
mischief to be their ruling principle; yea, there is no madness worse than the
contempt of God, under the influence of which men pervert all right. David sets
this truth before himself for his own comfort; but we also may draw from it
doctrine very useful in training us to the fear of God; for the Holy Spirit, by
declaring God to be the avenger of wickedness, puts a bridle upon us, to
restrain us from committing sin, in the vain hope of escaping with
impunity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
5:7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> And I, in the multitude [or
abundance] of thy mercy, will enter into thy house; I will worship in thy holy
temple in thy fear.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">Some think that the
word <i>and, by </i>which this sentence is joined to the preceding, is put for
but; as if David, comparing himself with the ungodly, declared and assured
himself that God would be merciful to him, while he abhorred and would destroy
the wicked. But I leave it to my readers to judge whether it does not suit the
passage better to consider this verse as an inference from what goes before,
which might be put in this form:"O Lord, thou canst not bear with the wicked;
when, therefore, I am saved out of their hands by thy power, I will come to
present myself before thee in thy temple, to give thee thanks for the
deliverance which thou hast vouchsafed to me." If the former interpretation be
preferred, then the prophet, by simply commending his own piety towards God,
separates himself from the class of whom he spoke. The scope of the passage
leads us to understand him as promising to give thanks to God. He had before
spoken of his enemies as hated of God; and now, being persuaded that God will
keep him in safety, he calls himself to the exercise of gratitude.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I</i> <i>will come into thy
temples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he, in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the multitude of thy
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as<i> </i>if he had said, I may
now seem to be in a condition almost desperate, but by the favor of God, I shall
be kept in perfect safety. This passage, therefore, teaches us, that when we are
afflicted by the most distressing temptations, we ought to set the grace of God
before our eyes, in order thereby to be supported with the hope of the divine
interposition amidst the greatest dangers. Farther, as our carnal minds either
wickedly undervalue the grace of God, or put the low estimate upon it which is
commonly put by the world, let us learn to extol its wonderful greatness, which
is sufficient to enable us to overcome all fears. The primary object of David
was to encourage himself in the assured hope of preservation from the mercy of
God; but at the same time he shows, that upon obtaining deliverance, he will be
grateful to God for it, and keep it in remembrance. And as hypocrites, in giving
thanks to God, do nothing else but profane his name, inasmuch as they themselves
are unholy and polluted, he therefore resolves to come in <i>the fear of God,
</i>in order to worship him with a sincere and upright heard. Again, we may
hence draw the general truth, that it is only through the goodness of God that
we have access to him; and that no man prays aright but he who, having
experienced his grace, believes and is fully persuaded that he will be merciful
to him. The fear of God is at the same time added, in order to distinguish
genuine and godly trust from the vain confidence of the
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

righteousness which adorns thy character; and do this because of my adversaries;
for the saints, impelled by the wicked practice and deceitful arts of the
ungodly, are in danger of turning aside from the right way. This meaning is
unquestionably a pious and a useful one. But the other interpretation is more
suitable, which views the words as a prayer that God would lead his servant in
safety through the midst of the snares of his enemies, and open up to him a way
of escape, even when, to all appearance, he was caught and surrounded on every
side. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The righteousness of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>therefore, in this passage, as in
many others, is to be understood of his faithfulness and mercy which he shows in
defending and preserving his people. Consequently, in <i>thy righteousness
</i>means the same thing as <i>for </i>or <i>according to thy righteousness.
</i>David, desiring to have God as the guide of his path, encourages himself in
the hope of obtaining his request, because God is righteous; as if he had said,
Lord, as thou art righteous, defend me with thine aid, that I may escape from
the wicked plots of my enemies. Of the same import is the last clause of the
verse, where he prays that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
way of God may be made straight before his
face,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in other words, that he might be
delivered by the power of God from the distresses with which he was so
completely surrounded, that, according to the judgment of the flesh, he never
expected to find a way of escape. And thus he acknowledges how impossible it was
for him to avoid being entangled in the snares of his
enemies,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> unless God both gave him wisdom, and
opened up for him a way where no way is. It becomes us, after his example, to do
the same thing; so that distrusting ourselves when counsel fails us, and the
malice and wickedness of our enemies prevail, we may betake ourselves speedily
to God, in whose hands are the issues of death, as we shall see afterwards,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there is no faithfulness
in their mouth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He still repeats the
same complaints which he made before, in order thereby to render his enemies the
more odious in the sight of God, and to call forth in his own behalf the mercy
of God, who has promised to succor those who are unjustly oppressed. And this is
to be particularly attended to, that the more our enemies manifest their cruelty
against us, or the more wickedly they vex us, we ought, with so much the greater
confidence, to send up our groanings to heaven, because God will not suffer
their rage to proceed to the uttermost, but will bring forth their malice and
wicked devices to the light. In the first place, he accuses them of treachery,
because they speak nothing uprightly, or in sincerity; and the cause which he
assigns for this is, that inwardly they are full of iniquity. He next compares
them to sepulchres, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their throat
is an open sepulcher;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if he had said,
they are devouring gulfs;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> meaning by this, their insatiable desire
of shedding blood. In the close of the verse, he again speaks of their
deceitfulness. From all this we conclude, that the wrongs with which he was
tried were of no ordinary kind, but that he had to contend with enemies the most
wickedly who had neither humanity nor moderation. Being so miserably oppressed,
he not only perseveres in prayer, but finds ground of hope even from the
confusion and apparent hopelessness of his outward
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:13,) in quoting this passage, extends it to all mankind, both Jews and
Gentiles, he does not give to it a meaning of greater latitude than the Holy
Spirit intended to give. Since he takes it as an undeniable point, that under
the person of David, there is here described to us the church, both in the
person of Christ, who is the head, and in his members, it follows that all those
ought to be reckoned among the number of his enemies, who have not been
regenerated by the Spirit of God, whether they are without the pale of the
visible church, or within it. For David, in this passage, does not summons
either the Assyrians or the Egyptians to the judgment-seat of God, but the
degenerate Jews, who, being circumcised in the flesh, gloried in their descent
from the holy lineage of Abraham. Paul, therefore, does not wrest these words
from their genuine meaning when he applies them to all mankind, but asserts,
with truth, that David showed in them what is the character of the whole human
family by nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>

<i>asam, </i>signifies <i>to cut up or to destroy, </i>as well as <i>to sin,
</i>and is taken metaphorically for <i>to err, </i>or <i>be deceived, </i>either
of these senses is suitable in this passage; but, as David immediately after
subjoins, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them fall from
their counsels,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I have no doubt but this first
prayer is allied and similar to the second. I therefore join these two clauses
together, as the cause and the effect. In the first, he prays that God would
deprive them of their understanding, and drive them into error; and in the
second, he prays that, as the effect of this, their counsels might come to
nought, in other words, that their undertakings might prove
unsuccessful.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For how is it that the ungodly take
counsel in vain, and are carried hither and thither without consideration or
judgment, and become so basely obstinate, if it is not because the Lord takes
them unawares in their own craftiness, breaks their artful schemes, intoxicates
them with the spirit of phrenzy and giddiness, so that they act foolishly even
in the smallest matters? If, therefore, we are afraid of the snares and deceits
of men, and if we find those who desire to do us mischief to be clear-headed and
sharp-witted persons, let us remember, that it is the continual office of God to
strike with stupidity and madness those who are wise to commit iniquity. Thus it
will come to pass, that although we may be asleep the Lord will dissipate with
the breath of his mouth their devices, be they never so subtle, and, in the end,
expose them to the mockery of the whole world. In short, David wishes God to lay
his hand upon his enemies, and to put a stop to their wicked deliberations. And
in fact it is necessary that God bring to nothing the schemes which the wicked
cunningly devise, since it is Satan, the contriver of all deceits, who suggests
to them all their methods of doing mischief. By praying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them fall from their
counsels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means that they may not
obtain or accomplish what they had determined. Again, he prays to God to punish
them as they deserved, because, in wrongfully and wickedly making war against an
innocent person, they <i>rebelled against God. </i>The proud, indeed, never
think of this, that the poor, whom they afflict and despise, are of such
estimation in the sight of God, that he feels himself insulted and injured in
their persons:for they do not imagine that the blows aimed at them are struck
against heaven, any more than if they trampled a little dust or clay under their
feet. But God bestows upon his servants the inestimable reward of taking their
cause into his own hand. Whoever, therefore, has an approving conscience, and
does not turn aside from his uprightness, although troubled wrongfully, has no
reason to doubt of his warrant to improve God as a buckler against his
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

rejoice, etc., </i>or in the optative mood,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let all
rejoice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc.;</i> for in both ways the
meaning of the prophet will be the same; namely, that if God deliver him, the
fruit of this deliverance will be common to all the godly; as if he had said
Lord, if thou succourest me, the goodness which thou conferrest upon me will not
rest on me alone, but will extend to all thy servants:for this will serve the
more to confirm their faith, and make them praise thy name the more. In order,
therefore, to induce God to grant him deliverance, he employs as an argument the
end or effect which it would produce, inasmuch as it would stir up all the godly
to exercise greater trust in God, and encourage them to give praise and thanks
to him. This passage teaches us, that we are ungrateful to God if we do not take
encouragement and comfort from whatever blessings he confers upon our
neighbours, since by these he testifies that he will always be ready to bestow
his goodness upon all the godly in common. Accordingly the reason of<i> </i>this
joy is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because the Lord
will cover</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or <i>protect them. </i>As
often as God bestows any blessings upon any of the faithful, the rest, as I have
said before, ought to conclude that he will show himself beneficent towards
them. Again, this passage teaches us, that true joy proceeds from no other
source than from the protection of God. We may be exposed to a thousand deaths,
but this one consideration ought abundantly to suffice us, that we are covered
and defended by the hand of God. And this will be the case, if the vain shadows
of this world do not so beguile us as to excite us to take shelter under them.
We ought also particularly to notice the statement, that those who trust in the
Lord <i>love his name. </i>The remembrance of God must be sweet to us, and fill
our hearts with joy, or rather ravish us with love to him, after he has caused
us to taste of his goodness; as, on the other hand, all unbelievers wish the
name of God to be buried, and shun the remembrance of him with
horror.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou, 0 Jehovah, wilt
bless the righteous.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here
confirms the concluding sentence of the preceding verse, namely, that all the
servants of God in common will take support to their faith from what he had
experienced, for he would have us from one example to form our judgment of the
immutability and perpetuity of God's grace towards all the godly. Again, by this
he teaches us that there is no true and right joy but that which is derived from
the sense of God's fatherly love. The word, <i>to bless, </i>in Hebrew, (when we
speak of this as the act of men,) signifies to wish happiness and prosperity to
any one, and to pray for him;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but when it is spoken of as the act of
God, it signifies the same thing as to prosper a man, or to enrich him
abundantly with all good things; for since the favor of God is efficacious, his
blessing of itself produces an abundance of every good thing. The name
<i>righteous </i>is not restricted to any one man, but signifies in general all
the servants of God. Those, however, who are called righteous in Scripture, are
not so called on account of the merit of their works, but because they aspire
after righteousness; for after God has received them into his favor, by not
imputing their sins to them, he accepts their upright endeavors for perfect
righteousness. What follows is of the same import as the preceding clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt crown them with thy
free favor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or good will,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as with a
shield</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist's meaning is, that
the faithful shall be completely defended on all sides, since he will, in no
case, withhold from them his grace, which is to them an invincible fortress, and
brings along with it certain safety. The word, <i>to crown, </i>which the
Psalmist employs, often denotes in Hebrew, <i>ornament </i>or <i>glory; </i>but
as there is added the similitude of a shield, I have no doubt but he uses it
metaphorically for, <i>to fortify </i>or <i>to compass
about.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning, therefore, is, that
however great and various may be the dangers which besiege the righteous, they
shall, notwithstanding, escape, and be saved, because God is favorable to
them.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
6.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, being afflicted by the hand of God,
acknowledges that he had provoked the Divine wrath by his sins, and, therefore,
in order to obtain relief, he prays for forgiveness. At the same time, he
regrets, that by being taken out of the world, he would be deprived of an
opportunity of praising God. Then, having obtained confidence, he celebrates the
grace of God, and directs his discourse to his enemies, who triumphed over his
calamities.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician on Neginoth, upon the eighth. A song of David.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The name of <i>Song </i>shows that David composed
this psalm, in which he describes the passionate workings of his grief in the
time of his troubles after he had obtained deliverance from the evils which he
deplores. What the kind of chastisement was of which he speaks is<i>
</i>uncertain. Those who restrict it to bodily disease do not adduce in support
of their opinion any<i> </i>argument of sufficient weight. They insist on the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
amal, </i>which occurs in verse third, where he says, "I am weak," which indeed
signifies to be sick; but it is more probable that it is here used
metaphorically. They allege that Hezekiah, after his recovery from sickness,
sung in the same strains as are here recorded, concerning death. But in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116, where no mention is made of bodily disease, the same complaint is uttered
by the Psalmist in the name of the whole Church. We can, indeed, gather from
these words that the life of David was in the utmost danger, but it may have
been some other kind of affliction than bodily sickness under which he labored.
We may, therefore, adopt this as the more certain interpretation, that he had
been stricken by some severe calamity, or that some punishment had been
inflicted upon him, which presented to his view on every side only the shadow of
death. It ought also to be considered, that this psalm was not composed at the
very time when he presented to God the prayers recorded in it; but that the
prayers which he had meditated and uttered in the midst of his dangers and
sadness were, after he had obtained respite, committed to writing. This explains
why he joins the sorrow with which he certainly had struggled for a time with
the joy which he afterwards experienced. With respect to the word <i>eighth,
</i>as we have before said that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twnygn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
Neginoth, </i>signifies a musical instrument, I do not know whether it would be
correct to say, that it was a harp of eight strings. I am rather inclined to the
opinion that it refers to the tune, and points out the particular kind of music
to which the psalm was to be sung.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> However, in a matter so obscure and of
so little importance I leave every one at liberty to form his own
conjecture.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
6:1	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Jehovah, rebuke me not in
thine anger, and chastise me not in thine
indignation.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The calamity which David now
experienced had, perhaps, been inflicted by men, but he wisely considers that he
has to deal with God. Those persons are very unsuitably exercised under their
afflictions who do not immediately take a near and a steady view of their sins,
in order thereby to produce the conviction that they have deserved the wrath of
God. And yet we see how thoughtless and insensible almost all men are on this
subject; for while they cry out that they are afflicted and miserable, scarcely
one among a hundred looks to the hand which strikes. From whatever quarter,
therefore, our afflictions come, let us learn to turn our thoughts instantly to
God, and to acknowledge him as the Judge who summons us as guilty before his
tribunal, since we, of our own accord, do not anticipate his judgment. But as
men, when they are compelled to feel that God is angry with them, often indulge
in complaints full of impiety, rather than find fault with themselves and their
own sins, it is to be particularly noticed that David does not simply ascribe to
God the afflictions under which he is now suffering, but acknowledges them to be
the just recompense of his sins. He does not take God to task as if he had been
an enemy, treating him with cruelty without any just cause; but yielding to him
the right of rebuking and chastening, he desires and prays only that bounds may
be set to the punishment inflicted on him. By this he declares God to be a just
Judge in taking vengeance on the sins of
men.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as soon as he has confessed that he
is justly chastised, he earnestly beseeches God not to deal with him in strict
justice, or according to the utmost rigour of the law. He does not altogether
refuse punishment, for that would be unreasonable; and to be without it, he
judged would be more hurtful than beneficial to him:but what he is afraid of is
the wrath of God, which threatens sinners with ruin and perdition. To anger and
indignation David tacitly opposes fatherly and gentle chastisement, and this
last he was willing to bear. We have a similar contrast in the words of
Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:24,) "O Lord," says he, "correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger."
God is, indeed, said to be angry with sinners whenever he inflicts punishment
upon them, but not in the proper and strict sense, inasmuch as he not only
mingles with it some of the sweetness of his grace to mitigate their sorrow, but
also shows himself favorable to them, in moderating their punishment, and in
mercifully drawing back his hand. But, as we must necessarily be stricken with
terror whenever he shows himself the avenger of wickedness, it is not without
cause that David, according to the sense of the flesh, is afraid of his anger
and indignation. The meaning therefore is this:I indeed confess, O Lord, that I
deserve to be destroyed and brought to nought; but as I would be unable to
endure the severity of thy wrath, deal not with me according to my deserts, but
rather pardon my sins, by which I have provoked thine anger against me. As
often, then, as we are pressed down by adversity, let us learn, from the example
of David, to have recourse to this remedy, that we may be brought into a state
of peace with God; for it is not to be expected that it can be well or
prosperous with us if we are not interested in his favor. Whence it follows,
that we shall never be without a load of evils, until he forgive us our
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

<i>anger </i>and <i>indignation </i>he did not mean cruelty or undue severity,
but only such judgment as God executes upon the reprobate, whom he does not
spare in mercy as he does his own children. If he had complained of being
unjustly and too severely punished, he would now have only added something to
this effect:Restrain thyself, that in punishing me thou mayest not exceed the
measure of my offense. In betaking himself, therefore, to the mercy of God
alone, he shows that he desires nothing else than not to be dealt with according
to strict justice, or as he deserved. In order to induce God to exercise his
forgiving mercy towards him, he declares that he is ready to
fail:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy upon me, O
Jehovah, for I am weak</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As I have said
before, he calls himself weak, not because he was sick, but because he was cast
down and broken by what had now befallen him. And as we know that the design of
God in inflicting punishment upon us, is to humble us; so, whenever we are
subdued under his rod, the gate is opened for his mercy to come to us. Besides,
since it is his peculiar office to heal the diseased to raise up the fallen, to
support the weak, and, finally, to give life to the dead; this, of itself, is a
sufficient reason why we should seek his favor, that we are sinking under our
afflictions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After David has protested that he
placed his hope of salvation in the mercy of God alone, and has sorrowfully set
forth how much he is abased, he subjoins the effect which this had in impairing
his bodily health, and prays for the restoration of this
blessing:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heal me, O
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And<i> </i>this is the order
which we must observe, that we may know that all the blessings which we ask from
God flow from the fountain of his free goodness, and that we are then, and then
only, delivered from calamities and
chastisements,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when he has had mercy upon us. &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For my bones are
afraid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This confirms what I have just
now observed, namely, that, from the very grievousness of his afflictions, he
entertained the hope of some relief; for God, the more he sees the wretched
oppressed and almost overwhelmed, is just so much the more ready to succor them.
He attributes fear to his <i>bones, </i>not because they are endued with
feeling, but because the vehemence of his grief was such that it affected his
whole body. He does not speak of his flesh, which is the more tender and
susceptible part of the corporeal system, but he mentions his bones, thereby
intimating that the strongest parts of his frame were made to tremble for fear.
He next assigns the cause of this by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my soul is greatly
afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The connective particle <i>and,
</i>in my judgment, has here the meaning of the causal particle <i>for, </i>as
if he had said, so severe and violent is the inward anguish of my heart, that it
affects and impairs the strength of every part of my body. I do not approve of
the opinion which here takes <i>soul </i>for life, nor does it suit the scope of
the passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou, O Jehovah, how
long?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This elliptical form of expression
serves to express more strongly the vehemence of grief, which not only holds the
minds of men bound up, but likewise their tongues, breaking and cutting short
their speech in the middle of the sentence. The meaning, however, in this abrupt
expression is doubtful. Some, to complete the sentence, supply the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wilt thou afflict me, or continue
to chasten me</i>?</font><font face="Palatino"> Others read, <i>How long wilt
thou delay thy mercy</i>? But what is stated in the next verse shows that this
second sense is the more probable, for he there prays to the Lord to look upon
him with an eye of favor and compassion. He, therefore, complains that God has
now forsaken him, or has no regard to him, just as God seems to be far of from
us whenever his assistance or grace does not actually manifest itself in our
behalf. God, in his compassion towards us, permits us to pray to him to make
haste to succor us; but when we have freely complained of his long delay, that
our prayers or sorrow, on this account, may not pass beyond bounds we must
submit our case entirely to his will, and not wish him to make greater haste
than shall seem good to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
6:4-5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> Return, O Lord, deliver my
soul; save me for thy mercy's sake. <b>5.</b> For in death there is no

thee?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa87	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return, O
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the preceding verses the
Psalmist bewailed the absence of God, and now he earnestly requests the<b>
</b>tokens of his presence, for our happiness consists in this, that we are the
objects of the Divine regard, but we think he is alienated front us, if he does
not give us some substantial evidence of his care for us. That David was at this
time in the utmost peril, we gather from these words, in which he prays both for
the deliverance of his soul, as it were, from the jaws of death, and for his
restoration to a state of safety. Yet no mention is made of any bodily disease,
and, therefore, I give no judgment with respect to the kind of his affliction.
David, again, confirms what he had touched upon in the second verse
<i>concerning the mercy of God, </i>namely, that this is the only quarter from
which he hopes for
deliverance:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Save me for thy
mercy's sake</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Men will never find a
remedy for their miseries until, forgetting their own merits, by trusting to
which they only deceive themselves, they have learned to betake themselves to
the free mercy of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in death there is no
remembrance of thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After God has
bestowed all things freely upon us, he requires nothing in return but a grateful
remembrance of his benefits. To this gratitude reference is made when David
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there will be no
remembrance of God in death, nor any celebration of his praise in the
grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>His meaning is, that if, by the
grace of God, he shall be delivered from death, he will be grateful for it, and
keep it in remembrance. And he laments, that if he should be removed out of the
world, he would be deprived of the power and opportunity of manifesting his
gratitude, since in that case he would no longer mingle in the society of men,
there to commend or celebrate the name of God. From this passage some conclude,
that the dead have no feeling, and that it is wholly extinct in them; but this
is a rash and unwarranted inference, for nothing is here treated of but the
mutual celebration of the grace of God, in which men engage while they continue
in the land of the living. We know that we are placed on the earth to praise God
with one mind and one mouth, and that this is the end of our life. Death, it is
true, puts an end to such praises; but it does not follow from this, that the
souls of the faithful, when divested of their bodies, are deprived of
understanding, or touched with no affection towards God. It is also to be
considered, that, on the present occasion, David dreaded the judgment of God if
death should befall him, and this made him dumb as to singing the praises of
God. It is only the goodness of God sensibly experienced by us which opens our
mouth to celebrate his praise; and whenever, therefore, joy and gladness are
taken away, praises also must cease. It is not then wonderful if the wrath of
God, which overwhelms us with the fear of eternal destruction, is said to
extinguish in us the praises of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this
passage, we are furnished with the solution of another question, why David so
greatly dreaded death, as if there had been nothing to hope for beyond this
world. Learned men reckon up three causes why the fathers under the law were so
much kept in bondage by the fear of death. The first is, because the grace of
God, not being then made manifest by the coming of Christ, the promises, which
were obscure, gave them only a slight acquaintance with the life to come. The
second is, because the present life, in which God deals with us as a Father, is
of itself desirable. And the third, because they were afraid lest, after their
decease, some change to the worse might take place in religion. But to me these
reasons do not appear to be sufficiently solid. David's mind was not always
occupied by the fear he now felt; and when he came to die, being full of days
and weary of this life, he calmly yielded up his soul into the bosom of God. The
second reason is equally applicable to us at the present day, as it was to the
ancient fathers, inasmuch as God's fatherly love shines forth towards us also
even in this life, and with much more illustrious proofs than under the former
dispensation. But, as I have just observed, I consider this complaint of David
as including something different, namely, that feeling the hand of God to be
against him, and knowing his hatred of
sin,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he is overwhelmed with fear and involved
in the deepest distress. The same may also be said of Hezekiah, inasmuch as he
did not simply pray for deliverance from death, but from the wrath of God, which
he felt to be very awful,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:3.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
6:6-7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> I have become wearied in my
groaning; I make my bed to swim</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> every night; I water my couch with my
tears.<b> 7.</b> Mine eye hath waxed dim for vexation; it hath waxed old among
my persecutors.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">These forms of expression
are hyperbolical, but it must not be imagined that David, after the manner of
poets, exaggerates his sorrow;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but he declares truly and simply how
severe and bitter it had been. It should always be kept in mind, that his
affliction did not proceed so much from his having been severely wounded with
bodily distress; but regarding God as greatly displeased with him, he saw, as it
were, hell open to receive him; and the mental distress which this produces
exceeds all other sorrows. Indeed, the more sincerely a man is devoted to God,
he is just so much the more severely disquieted by the sense of his wrath; and
hence it is that holy persons, who were otherwise endued with uncommon
fortitude, have showed in this respect the greatest softness and want of
resolution. And nothing prevents us at this day from experiencing in ourselves
what David describes concerning himself but the stupidity of our flesh. Those
who have experienced, even in a moderate degree, what it is to contend with the
fear of eternal death, will be satisfied that there is nothing extravagant in
these words. Let us, therefore, know that here David is represented to us as
being afflicted with the terrors of his
conscience,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and feeling within him torment of no
ordinary kind, but such as made him almost faint away, and lie as if dead. With
respect to the words, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mine eye hath waxed
dim</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for grief of mind easily makes its way to
the eyes, and from them very distinctly shows itself. As the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qt[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
athak, </i>which I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it hath waxed
old</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>sometimes signifies to depart from
one's place, some expound it, that the goodness of his eyesight was lost, and
his sight, as it were, had vanished. Others understand by it that his eyes were
hidden by the swelling which proceeds from weeping. The first opinion, however,
according to which David complains of his eyes failing him, as it were, through
old age, appears to me the more simple. As to what he adds, <i>every night,
</i>we learn from it that he was almost wholly wasted away with protracted
sorrow, and yet all the while never ceased from praying to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
6:8-10	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> Depart from me, all ye
workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. <b>9.</b>
The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will
receive</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> my prayer. <b>10.</b> Let all mine
enemies be put to shame and greatly confounded; let them turn back, and be
ashamed suddenly.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa93	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino">After David has disburdened his
griefs and troubles into the bosom of God, he now, as it were, assumes a new
character. And, without doubt, he had been afflicted with long-continued
despondency of spirit before he could recover himself, and attain to such a
degree of assurance as he here
displays;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for we have already seen that he
had spent many nights in continual weeping. Now, the more he had been distressed
and wearied by the long delay of his deliverance, with so much the more alacrity
does he stir up himself to sing of victory. Directing his discourse against his
adversaries, he represents it as not the least part of his temptations that
ungodly men triumphed over him, and derided him as lost, and in a hopeless
condition; for we know with what insolence their pride and cruelty magnify
themselves against the children of God, when they see them oppressed under the
cross. And to this Satan moves them, in order to drive the faithful to despair,
when they see their hope made the subject of mockery. This passage teaches us,
that the grace of God is the only light of life to the godly; and that, as soon
as He has manifested some token of his anger, they are not only greatly afraid,
but also, as it were, plunged into the darkness of death; while, on the other
hand, as soon as they discover anew that God is merciful to them, they are
immediately restored to life. David, it is to be noticed, repeats three times
that his prayers were heard, by which he testifies that he ascribes his
deliverance to God, and confirms himself in this confidence, that he had not
betaken himself to God in vain. And if we would receive any fruit from our
prayers, we must believe that God's ears have not been shut against them. By the
word <i>weeping,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he not only indicates vehemence
and earnestness, but also intimates that he had been wholly occupied in mourning
and sorrowful lamentations. The confidence and security which David takes to
himself from the favor of God ought also to be noticed. From this, we are taught
that there is nothing in the whole world, whatever it may be, and whatever
opposition it may make to us,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which we may not despise, if we are
fully persuaded of our being beloved by God; and by this also we understand what
his fatherly love can do for us. By the adverb <i>suddenly, </i>he signifies,
that when there is apparently no means of delivering the faithful from
affliction, and when all seems desperate or hopeless, then they are delivered by
the power of God contrary to all expectation. When God suddenly changes men's
afflicted condition into one of joy and happiness, he thereby manifests more
illustriously his power, and makes it appear the more
wonderful.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
7</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, loaded with unjust calumny, calls upon God to
be his advocate and defender, and commits his innocence to the Divine
protection. In the first place, he protests that his conscience did notaccuse
him of the wickedness laid to his charge. Secondly, he shows how greatly it
concerns the glory of God that he should execute judgment against the ungodly.
Thirdly, to inspire his mind with confidence, he seriously reflects upon the
goodness and righteousness of God, and sets before him the divine promises.
Lastly, as if he had obtained the desire of his heart, he derides the folly and
the vain attempts of his enemies; or rather, depending upon the aid of God, he
assures himself that all their endeavours against him shall turn to their own
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Shiggaion of David,
which he sung unto
Jehovah,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>upon the
words of Cush the Benjamite.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the word <i>Shiggaion, </i>the Jewish
interpreters are not agreed. Some understand it to mean a musical instrument. To
others it seems to be a tune to which a song is set. Others suppose it to have
been the beginning of a common song, to the tune of which David wished this
psalm to be sung. Others translate the Hebrew word, <i>delight, </i>or
<i>rejoicing.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The second opinion appears to me
the most probable, namely, that it was some kind of melody or song, as if one
should term it Sapphic or Phaleucian
verse.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I do not contend about a matter of
so small importance. Again, the psalm is said to have been composed upon the
<i>words of Cush. </i>I<i> </i>cannot subscribe to the interpretation, (although
it is the commonly received one,) that words here mean <i>affairs, </i>or
<i>business. </i>To put<i> word </i>for a <i>matter, </i>or<i> an affair,
</i>is, I allow, a common form of speech among the Jews; but as David a little
after declares that he was falsely accused of some crime, I doubt not but he
here speaks of the accusation or calumny itself, of which, as I judge, Cush,
some one of Saul's kindred, was the author, or, at least, the instrument who
preferred and circulated it. The opinion of some who say that Saul is here
spoken of under a fictitious name, is not supported by any argument of
sufficient weight. According to them, David avoided calling him by his own name,
in order to spare the royal dignity. David, I admit, had great reverence for the
holy anointing; but as he expressly names Saul in other places where he
reprehends him not less severely, and paints him in colours no less black than
he does in this psalm, why should he suppress his name here, and not in these
passages? In my opinion, therefore, he here expresses by his proper name, and
without figure, a wicked accuser, who had excited hatred against him by falsely
charging him with some crime, and who had either been bribed by the king to do
this, or, currying the royal favour, had calumniated David of his own accord;
for David, we know, was very much slandered, as if he had been ungrateful and
treacherous towards the king, his father-in-law. Saul, indeed, belonged to the
tribe of Benjamin. We do not, however, think that he is the person here
mentioned, but that it was one of Saul's relations, one who belonged to the same
tribe with him, who falsely accused
David.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
7:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>. O Jehovah, my God, in thee
do I trust:save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. <b>2</b>.
Lest he seize upon my soul as a lion, and tear it in pieces, while there is none
to deliver it.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">At the commencement of the
psalm, David speaks of having many enemies, and in the second verse he specifies
some one in the singular number. And certainly, since the minds of all men were
inflamed against him, he had very good reason for praying to be delivered from
all his persecutors. But as the wicked cruelty of the king, like a firebrand,
had kindled against him, though an innocent person, the hatred of the whole
people, he had good reason also for turning his pen particularly against him.
Thus, in the first verse, he describes the true character of his own
circumstances&#8212;he was a persecuted man; and, in the second verse, the
fountain or cause of the calamity he was enduring. There is great emphasis in
these words which he uses in the beginning of the Psalms
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah my Godly in thee do I
trust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb, it is true, is in the
past tense in the Hebrew; and, therefore, if literally translated, the reading
would be, <i>In thee have I trusted; </i>but as the Hebrews often take one
<i>tense for </i>another,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I prefer to translate it in the present,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee I do
trust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>especially since it is abundantly
evident that a continued act, as it is termed, is denoted. David does not boast
of a confidence in God, from which he had now fallen, but of a confidence which
he constantly entertained in his afflictions. And this is a genuine and an
undoubted proof of our faith, when, being visited with adversity, we,
notwithstanding, persevere in cherishing and exercising hope in God. From this
passage, we also learn that the gate of mercy is shut against our prayers if the
key of faith do not open it for us. Nor does he use superfluous language when he
calls Jehovah </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for by setting up this as a bulwark
before him, he beats back the waves of temptations, that they may not overwhelm
his faith. In the second verses by the figure of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
lion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he represents in a stronger light
the cruelty of Saul, as an argument to induce God to grant him assistance, even
as he ascribes it to Him as his peculiar province to rescue his poor sheep from
the jaws of wolves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

Selah.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here David, to induce God to show
him favour, protests that he is molested unjustly, and without being guilty of
any crime. To give his protestation the greater weight, he uses an imprecation.
If he has done any wrong, he declares his readiness to bear the blame; yea, he
offers to endure the severest punishment, if he is not altogether innocent of
the crime of which all men thought him almost convicted. And by entreating God
to succour him upon no other condition than this, that his integrity should upon
trial be found to be untarnished, he teaches us, by his example, that as often
as we have recourse to God, we must make it our first care to be well assured in
our own consciences with respect to the righteousness of our cause; for we do
him great wrong if we wish to engage him as the advocate and defender of a bad
cause. The pronoun <i>this </i>shows that he speaks of a thing which was
generally known; whence we may conclude, that the slander which had been raised
by Cush was spread far and wide. And as David was condemned, by the false
reports and unrighteous judgments which men advanced against him, and saw no
remedy on earth, he betakes himself to the judgment-seat of God, and contents
himself with maintaining his innocence before the heavenly Judge; an example
which all the godly should imitate, in order that, in opposition to the
slanderous reports which are spread against them, they may rest satisfied with
the judgment of God alone. He next declares more distinctly, that he had
committed no crime. And in the fourth verse, he mentions two particulars in
self-vindication; first, That he had done no wrong to any one; and, secondly,
That he had rather endeavoured to do good to his enemies, by whom
notwithstanding he had been injured without any just cause. I, therefore,
explain the fourth verse thus: If I have wronged any man that was at peace with
me, and have not rather succoured the unworthy, who persecuted me without a
cause, etc. Since David was hated of almost all men, as if ambition to reign had
impelled him perfidiously to rise up in rebellion against Saul, and to lay
snares for the monarch to whom he was bound by the oath of
allegiances</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the first part of the verse, he
clears himself of such a foul slander. The reason, perhaps, why he calls Saul
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>him that was at peace with
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, that on account of his royal
dignity his person ought to be sacred, and secure from
danger,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that it should be unlawful to make
any hostile attempt against him. This phrase, however, may be understood
generally, as if he had said, No one who has meekly restrained himself from
injuring me, and has conducted himself kindly towards me, can with truth
complain that I have ever injured him in a single instance. And yet it was the
general persuasion, that David, in the midst of peace, had stirred up great
confusion, and caused war. From this it is just so much the more manifest, that
David, provided he enjoyed the approbation of God, was contented with the
consolation arising from this, though he should have comfort from no other
source.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second clause of the fourth
verse, he proceeds farther, and states, that he had been a friend, not only to
the good, but also to the bad, and had not only restrained himself from all
revenge, but had even succoured his enemies, by whom he had been deeply and
cruelly injured. It would certainly not be very illustrious virtue to love the
good and peaceable, unless there were joined to this self-government and
gentleness in patiently bearing with the bad. But when a man not only keeps
himself from revenging the injuries which he has received, but endeavours to
overcome evil by doing good, he manifests one of the graces of a renewed and
sanctified nature, and in this way proves himself to be one of the children of
God; for such meekness proceeds only from the Spirit of adoption. With respect
to the words:as the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">xlj</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>chalats, </i>which I have translated <i>to delivers </i>signifies <i>to
divide </i>and <i>to separate, </i>some, to prevent the necessity of supplying
any word to make out the sense,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> thus explain the passage, <i>If I have
withdrawn myself from my persecutors, in order not to succour them. </i>The
other interpretation, however, according to which the verb is rendered <i>to
deliver </i>or <i>rescue from </i>danger, is more generally received; because
the phrase, <i>to separate </i>or<i> set aside, </i>is<i> </i>applied to those
things which we wish to place in safety. And thus the negative word <i>not
</i>must be supplied, an omission which we will find not unfrequently occurring
in The Psalms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let mine enemy
pursue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a striking proof of the
great confidence which David had in his own integrity, when he is willing to
endure any kind of punishment, however dreadful, provided he should be found
guilty of any crime. If we could bring a good conscience like this before God,
his hand would be more quickly stretched forth to afford us immediate
assistance. But as it often happens that those who molest us have been provoked
by us, or that we burn with the desire of revenge when offended, we are unworthy
of receiving succour from God; yea, our own impatience shuts the gate against
our prayers. In the first place, David is prepared to be given over to the will
of his enemies, that they may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seize his life, and throw it down
to the ground;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then to be publicly
exhibited as an object of their mockery, so that, even after he is dead, he may
lie under eternal disgrace. Some think that the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwbk</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>kebod, </i>which we have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
is here to be taken for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and thus there will be three words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>signifying the same thing. But it appears to me, that the meaning of the
passage will be fuller if we refer the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to<i> </i>his memory, or his good name, as if he had said, Let my enemy not
only destroy me, but, after having put me to death, let him speak of me in the
most reproachful terms, so<i> </i>that my name may be buried in mire or
filth.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
7:6-8	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>. Arise, O Jehovah, in thine

me.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, O
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David here sets the anger of
God in opposition to the rage of his enemies; and when we are
</font><font face="Palatino" size="0">Id </font><font face="Palatino">in similar
circumstances we should act in the same manner. When the ungodly are inflamed
against us, and cast forth their rage and fury to destroy us, we ought humbly to
beseech God to be inflamed also on his side; in other words, to show in truth
that he has, no less zeal and power to preserve us, than they have inclination
to destroy us. The word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is taken in a figurative sense, for <i>to ascend into a judgment-seat, or
</i>rather <i>to prepare one's self to make resistance; </i>and it is here
applied to God, because, while he delays to succour us, we are very apt to think
him asleep. Accordingly, David also, a little after, beseeches him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
awake</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it seemed on the part of God
something like the forgetfulness of sleep to give no assistance to an individual
who was so much afflicted and oppressed on all
hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the end of the verse he shows that he
asks nothing but what is according to the appointment of God. And this is the
rule which ought to be observed by us in our prayers; we should in every thing
conform our requests to the divine will, as John also instructs us,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:14.) And, indeed, we can never pray in faith unless we attend, in the
first place, to what God commands, that our minds may not rashly and at random
start aside in desiring more than we are permitted to desire and pray for.
David, therefore, in order to pray aright, reposes himself on the word and prose
mise of God; and the import of his exercise is this:Lord, I am not led by
ambition, or foolish headstrong passion, or depraved desire, inconsiderately to
ask from thee whatever is pleasing to my flesh; but it is the clear light of thy
word which directs me, and upon it I securely depend. Since God, of his own good
pleasure, had called him to be one day king, it belonged to him to defend and
maintain the rights of the man whom he had chosen for his servant. David's
language, therefore, is the same as if he had said, "When I was well contented
with my humble condition in private life, it was thy pleasure to set me apart to
the honourable station of being a king; now, therefore, it belongs to thee to
maintain this cause against Saul and his associates who are using their efforts
to defeat thy decree in making war upon me." The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>urah, </i>which we have rendered <i>awake
thou,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>might also be taken transitively
for to <i>build up, </i>or<i> to establish </i>the right of David. The sum of
the whole, however, comes to this, that David, trusting to the call of God,
beseeches him to stretch forth his hand for his relief. The faithful must,
therefore, take care not to exceed these bounds, if they desire to have God
present with them to maintain and preserve
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And a congregation of peoples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some
limit this sentence exclusively to the people of Israel, as if David promised
that, as soon as he should ascend the throne, he would endeavour to reunite
together, in the pure worship of God, the people who before had been as it were
in a state of dispersion. Under the reign of Saul, religion had been neglected,
or such an unrestrained license in wickedness had prevailed, that few paid any
regard to God. The meaning, therefore, according to these expositors, is
this:Lord, when thou shalt have constituted me king, the whole people, who have
so basely gone astray from thee,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> shall return from their wanderings and
disorderly courses to thee and to thy service, so that all shall know that thou
rulest in the midst of them, and shall worship thee as their only King. But I am
rather inclined to view this as language which has a respect in common to many
nations. David here speaks in high terms of the effects resulting from his
deliverance, the report of which would be spread far and wide, and his words
are, as if he had said, "Lord, when thou shalt have put me in peaceable
possession of the kingdom, this will not only be a benefit conferred on me
personally, but it will be a common lesson to many nations, teaching them to
acknowledge thy just judgment, so that they shall turn their eyes to thy
judgment-seat."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David here alludes to the practice of a
people who surround their king, as in a circle, when he holds a solemn assembly.
In the same sense, he adds immediately after, that God, who, for a time, lay
still and kept silence, would raise himself on high that not only one or two,
but whole nations, might behold his
glory:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on account of this
return thou on
high</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa109</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is in these words, a tacit
comparison, that although it might not be necessary to have a regard to one man
alone, it is requisite that God should keep the world in the fear and reverence
of his judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah shall judge the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This sentence is closely
connected with the preceding verse. David had prayed God to show himself as
judge to the nations; and now he takes it for a certain and admitted truth, that
it is the peculiar office of God to judge the nations:for the word put in the
future tense, and rendered </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>denotes here a continued act; and
this is the signification of the future tense in general sentences. Besides, he
does not here speak of one nation only, but comprehends all nations. As he
acknowledges God to be the judge of the whole world, he concludes a little after
from this, that he will maintain his cause and right. And as often as we seem to
be forsaken and oppressed, we should recall this truth to our remembrance, that
as God is the governor of the world, it is as utterly impossible for him to
abdicate his office as to deny himself. From this source there will flow a
continual stream of comfort, although a long succession of calamities may press
upon us:for from this truth we may assuredly conclude, that he will take care to
defend our innocence. It would be contrary to every principle of just reasoning
to supposes that he who governs many nations neglects even one man. What happens
with respect to the judges of this world can never take place with respect to
him; he cannot, as may be the case with them, be so occupied about great and
public affairs as to neglect, because unable to attend to them, the concerns of
individuals.  He again brings into new
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
integrity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that he may not seem, after
the example of hypocrites to make the name of God a mere pretext for the better
furthering of his own purposes. Since God is no respecter of persons, we cannot
expect him to be on our side, and to favour us, if our cause is not good. But it
is asked, how can David here boast of his own integrity before God, when in
other places he deprecates God entering into judgment with him? The answer is
easy, and it is this:The subject here treated of is not how he could answer if
God should demand from him an account of his whole life; but, comparing himself
with his enemies, he maintains and not without cause, that, in respect of them,
he was righteous. But when each saint passes under the review of God's judgment,
and his own character is tried upon its own merits, the matter is very
different, for then the only sanctuary to which he can betake himself for
safety, is the mercy of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

the first place, prays that God would restrain the malice of his enemies, and
bring it to an end; from which it follows, that his affliction had been of long
duration. Others suppose that this is rather a dreadful imprecation, and they
explain the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rmg</font><font face="Palatino">
, <i>gamar, </i>somewhat differently. Instead of rendering it to <i>cease,
</i>and <i>to come to an end, </i>as I have done, they understand it <i>to make

consume.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Thus,<i> </i>according to them,
David wishes that God would cause the mischief which the wicked devise to fall
upon their own heads: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the
wickedness of the wicked consume them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But, in my opinion, the former interpretation is the more simple, namely,
that David beseeches God to bring his troubles to a termination. Accordingly
there follows immediately after the corresponding prayer
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Direct thou the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>establish him; </i>for
it is of little importance which of these two readings we adopt. The meaning is,
that God would re-establish and uphold the righteous, who are wrongfully
oppressed, and thus make it evident that they are continued in their estate by
the power of God, notwithstanding the persecution to which they are
subjected.&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God
searcheth the hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Hebrew
copulative is here very properly translated by the causal particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>since David, without doubt, adds this clause as an argument to enforce his
prayer. He now declares, for the third time, that, trusting to the testimony of
a good conscience, he comes before God with confidence; but here he expresses
something more than he had done before, namely, that he not only showed his
innocence, by his external conduct, but had also cultivated purity in the secret
affection of his heart. He seems to set this confidence in opposition to the
insolence and boasting of his enemies, by whom, it is probable, such calumnies
had been circulated among the people concerning him, as constrained him in his
deep affliction to present his heart and reins to be tried by God. Perhaps,
also, he speaks in this manner, in order to divest them of all those plausible
but false and deceitful pretenses, which they made use of for the purpose of
deceiving men, and if they succeeded in doing this they were
satisfied.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He shows that, although they might
triumph before the world, and receive the applause of the multitude, they,
nevertheless, gained nothing, inasmuch as they would, by and by, have to make
their appearance before the judgment-seat of God, where the question would not
be, What were their titles? or, What was the splendour of their actions? but how
it stood as to the purity of their
hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
shield</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is<i> </i>not wonderful that
David often mingles meditations with his prayers, thereby to inspire himself
with true confidence. We may go to God in prayer with great alacrity; but our
fervour, if it does not gather new strength, either immediately fails or begins
to languish. David, therefore, in order to continue in prayer with the same
ardour of devotion and affection with which he commenced, brings to his
recollection some of the most common truths of religion, and by this means
fosters and invigorates his faith. He declares, that as God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saves the upright in
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he is perfectly safe under his
protection. Whence it follows, that he had the testimony of an approving
conscience. And, as he does not simply say <i>the righteous, </i>but<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the upright in
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he appears to have an eye to that
inward searching of <i>the heart and reins </i>mentioned in the preceding verse.
</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God judgeth the righteous
etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Others read, <i>God is a righteous
Judge, and God is angry every day. </i>The words will certainly admit of this
sense; but as the doctrine is fuller according to the first reading, I have
preferred following it, as I see it is more approved of by the most learned
divines, and, besides, it is more suitable to the subject which David is now
considering. As Saul and his accomplices had, by their calumnious reports, so
far succeeded in their wicked design as to have produced a general prejudice
against David, so that he was condemned by almost the whole people, the holy man
supports himself from this one consideration, that whatever may be the confusion
of things in the world, God, notwithstanding, can easily discern between the
righteous and the wicked. He, therefore, appeals from the false judgments of men
to Him who can never be deceived. It may, however, be asked, How does the
Psalmist represent God <i>as judging every day, </i>when we see him delaying
punishment frequently for a long time? The sacred writings certainly most justly
celebrate his long-suffering; but, although he exercises patience long, and does
not immediately execute his judgments, yet, as no time passes, yea, not even a
day, in which he does not furnish the clearest evidence that he discerns between
the righteous and the wicked, notwithstanding the confusion of things in the
world, it is certain that he never ceases to execute the office of a judge. All
who will be at the trouble to open their eyes to behold the government of the
world, will distinctly see that the patience of God is very different from
approbation or connivance. Surely, then, his own people will confidently betake
themselves to him every day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
7:12-14	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>. If he turn not, he will

fa0115	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If he turn
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These verses are usually explained
in two ways. The meaning is, that if David's enemies should persevere in their
malicious designs against him, there is denounced against them the vengeance
which their obstinate wickedness deserves. Accordingly, in the second clause,
they supply the name of
<i>God,&#8212;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If he turn not,
GOD will whet his
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if it had been said, If my
enemy do not repent,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he shall, at length, feel that God is
completely armed for the purpose of maintaining and defending the righteous. If
it is understood in this sense, the third verse is to be considered as a
statement of the cause why God will thus equip himself with armour, namely,
because the ungodly, in conceiving all kinds of mischief, in travailing to bring
forth wickedness, and in at length bringing forth deceit and falsehood, directly
assail God, and openly make war upon him. But, in my judgment, those who read
these two verses in one continued sentence, give a more accurate interpretation.
I am not, however, satisfied that even they fully bring out the meaning of the
Psalmist. David, I have no doubt, by relating the dreadful attempts of his
enemies against him, intended thereby to illustrate more highly the grace of
God; for when these malicious men, strengthened by powerful military forces, and
abundantly provided with armour, furiously rushed upon him in the full
expectation of destroying him, who would not have said that it was all over with
him? Moreover, there is implied in the words a kind of irony, when he pretends
to be afraid of their putting him to death. They mean the same thing as if he
had said, "If my enemy do not alter his purpose, or turn his fury and his
strength in another direction, who can preserve me from perishing by his hands?
He has an abundant supply of arms, and he is endeavouring, by all methods, to
accomplish my death." But Saul is the person of whom he particularly speaks, and
therefore he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath made
fit his arrows for the persecutors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
implies that Saul had many agents in readiness who would willingly put forth
their utmost efforts in seeking to destroy David. The design of the prophet,
therefore, was to magnify the greatness of the grace of God, by showing the
greatness of the danger from which he had been delivered by
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Moreover, when it is here said, if
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he do not return,
returning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>does not signify repentance
and amendment in David's enemy, but only a change of will and purpose, as if he
had said, "It is in the power of my enemy to do whatever his fancy may
suggest."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whence it appears the more clearly,
how wonderful the change was which suddenly followed contrary all expectation.
When he says that Saul had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared the instruments of death
for his bow,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates that he was
driving after no ordinary thing, but was fully determined to wound to death the
man whom he shot at. Some, referring the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqlwd</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>doulekim, </i>which we have rendered <i>persecutors, </i>to <i>arrows,
</i>have rendered it <i>burning,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because it has also this
signification;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0121</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the translation which I have given
is the more appropriate. David complains that he had reason to be afraid, not
only of one man, but of a great multitude, inasmuch as Saul had armed a powerful
body of men to pursue and persecute a poor
fugitive.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, he shall
travail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David has hitherto shown how
great and formidable the danger was which was near him. In this verse, laughing
to scorn the presumptuous and foolish attempts of Saul, and his magnificent
preparations, he declares that they had failed of accomplishing their
object.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the demonstrative adverb <i>Behold,
</i>he enhances the wonder, inasmuch as such a result fell out, on his part
altogether unlooked for.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after he has
travailed to bring forth wickedness, like as he had conceived
mischief</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>at length there comes forth
only empty wind and vanity, because God frustrated his expectations, and
destroyed all these wicked attempts.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0123</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Iniquity and mischief are here put for
every kind of violence and outrage</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which Saul intended to inflict upon
David. Some interpreters think that the order of the words is inverted, because
<i>travailing to bring forth is </i>put before <i>conceiving; </i>but I think
that the words have their proper place if you explain them thus:Behold, he shall
travail to bring forth wickedness, for he hath conceived mischief; that is to
say, as he long ago devised with himself my<i> </i>destruction, so he will do
his utmost to put his design into execution. David afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath brought forth
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This implies that Saul had
been disappointed in his expectation; as Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
26:18,) in like manner, speaks of unbelievers "bringing forth wind," when their
success does not correspond to their wicked and presumptuous attempts. As often,
therefore, as we see the ungodly<i> </i>secretly plotting our ruin, let us
remember that they speak falsehood to themselves; in other words deceive
themselves, and shall fail in accomplishing what they devise in their
hearts.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0125</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If, however, we do not perceive that
they are disappointed in their designs until they are about to be brought forth,
let us not be cast down, but bear it with a spirit of patient submission to the
will and providence of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
7:15-16	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>. He hath digged a pit,

which he hath made. <b>16</b>. His wickedness shall return upon his own head,
and his violence shall descend upon his own
crown.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">Here David says not only that their
wicked devices were without success, but that, by the wonderful providence of
God, the result was the very opposite of what had been contemplated. He sets
this forth in the first place metaphorically, by employing the figure of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a pit and a
ditch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then he expresses the same
thing in simple terms without figure, declaring, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mischief intended for others
returned upon the head of him who had devised
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is no doubt that it was a
common proverb among the Jews, He who hath digged a pit falleth into it; which
they quoted when they meant to say, that wicked and crafty men are caught in the
snares and traps which they have set for others, or that the contrivers of the
ruin of others perish by their own
devices.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa0127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is a twofold use of this
doctrine:the first place, however skilled in craft our enemies may be, and
whatever means of doing mischief they may have, we must nevertheless look for
the issue which God here promises, that they shall fall by their own sword. And
this is not a thing which happens by chance; but God, by the secret direction of
his own hand, causes the evil which they intend to bring upon the innocent to
return upon their own heads. In the second place, If at any time we are
instigated by passion to inflict any injury upon our neighbours, or to commit
any wickedness, let us remember this principle of retributive justice, which is
often acted upon by the divine government, that those who prepare a pit for
others are cast into it themselves; and the effect will be, that every one, in
proportion as he would consult his own happiness and welfare, will be careful to
restrain himself from doing any injury, even the smallest, to
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.

deliverances which he vouchsafes to his servants is, that they may render to him

acknowledge the deliverance which he had received, and at the same time affirms
that his preservation from death was the undoubted and manifest work of God. He
could not, with truth, and from the heart, have ascribed to God the praise of
his deliverance, if he had not been fully persuaded that he had been preserved
otherwise than by the power of man. He, therefore, not only promises to exercise
the gratitude which was due to his deliverer, but he confirms in one word what
he has rehearsed throughout the psalm, that he is indebted for his life to the
grace of God, who had not suffered Saul to take it from him. <i>The
righteousness of God </i>is here to be understood of his faithfulness which he
makes good to his servants in defending and preserving their lives. God does not
shut up or conceal his righteousness from our view in the secret recesses of his
own mind, but manifests it for our advantage when he defends us against all
wrongful violence, delivers us from oppression, and preserves us in safety
although wicked men make war upon us and persecute us.</font><br></div>

beginning of some famous and well-known song, I do not take upon me to
determine. Those who think that the psalm is so called because it was composed
in the city of Gath, give a strained and far-fetched explanation of the matter.
Of the other three opinions, of which I have spoken, it is not of much
importance which is adopted. The principal thing to be attended to is what the
psalm itself contains, and what is the design of it. David, it is true, sets
before his eyes the wonderful power and glory of God in the creation and
government of the material universe; but he only slightly glances at this
subject, as it were, in passing, and insists principally on the theme of God's
infinite goodness towards us. There is presented to us in the whole order of
nature, the most abundant matter for showing forth the glory of God, but, as we
are unquestionably more powerfully affected with what we ourselves experience,
David here, with great propriety, expressly celebrates the special favor which
God manifests towards mankind; for this, of all the subjects which come under
our contemplation, is the brightest mirror in which we can behold his glory. It
is, however, strange why he begins the psalm with an exclamation, when the usual
way is first to give an account of a thing, and then to magnify its greatness
and excellence. But if we remember what is said in other passages of Scripture,
respecting the impossibility of expressing in words the works of God, we will
not be surprised that David, by this exclamation, acknowledges himself unequal
to the task of recounting them. David, therefore, when reflecting on the
incomprehensible goodness which God has been graciously pleased to bestow on the
human race, and feeling all his thoughts and senses swallowed up, and
overwhelmed in the contemplation, exclaims that it is a subject worthy of
admiration, because it cannot be set forth in
words.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Besides, the Holy Spirit, who directed
David's tongue, doubtless intended, by his instrumentality, to awaken men from
the torpor and indifference which is common to them, so that they may not
content themselves with celebrating the infinite love of God and the innumerable
benefits which they receive at his hand, in their sparing and frigid manner, but
may rather apply their whole hearts to this holy exercise, and put forth in it
their highest efforts. This exclamation of David implies, that when all the
faculties of the human mind are exerted to the utmost in meditation on this
subject,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they yet come far short of
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The <i>name</i> of God, as I explain it, is
here to be understood of the knowledge of the character and perfections of God,
in so far as he makes himself known to us. I do not approve of the subtle
speculations of those who think the name of God means nothing else but God
himself. It ought rather to be referred to the works and properties by which he
is known, than to his essence. David, therefore, says that the earth is full of
the wonderful glory of God, so that the fame or renown thereof not only reaches
to the heavens, but ascends far above them. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tenah, </i>has been rendered by some in the preterite tense, <i>hast set,
</i>but in my judgment, those give a more accurate translation who render it in
the infinitive mood, <i>to place </i>or <i>to set; </i>because the second clause
is just an amplification of the subject of the first; as if he had said, the
earth is too small to contain the glory or the wonderful manifestations of the
character and perfections of God. According to this view,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,

the subject which he had undertaken to discourse
upon,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> declaring, that the providence of God,
in order to make itself known to mankind, does not wait till men arrive at the
age of maturity, but even from the very dawn of infancy shines forth so brightly
as is sufficient to confute all the ungodly, who, through their profane contempt
of God, would wish to extinguish his very

<i>kephi, in the mouth, </i>cannot be admitted, because it improperly weakens
the emphasis which David meant to give to his language and discourse. The
meaning, therefore, is, that God, in order to commend his providence, has no
need of the powerful eloquence of
rhetoricians,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nor even of distinct and formed
language, because the tongues of infants, although they do not as yet speak, are
ready and eloquent enough to celebrate it. But it may be asked, In what sense
does he speak of children as the proclaimers of the glory of God? In my
judgment, those reason very foolishly who think that this is done when children
begin to articulate, because then also the intellectual faculty of the soul
shows itself. Granting that they are called babes, or infants, even until they
arrive at their seventh year, how can such persons imagine that those who now
speak distinctly are still hanging on the breast? Nor is there any more
propriety in the opinion of those who say, that the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for babes and
sucklings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are here put allegorically for
the faithful, who, being born again by the Spirit of God, no longer retain the
old age of the flesh. What need, then, is there to wrest the words of David,
when their true meaning is so clear and suitable? He says that babes and
sucklings are advocates sufficiently powerful to vindicate the providence of
God. Why does he not entrust this business to men, but to show that the tongues
of infants, even before they are able to pronounce a single word, speak loudly
and distinctly in commendation of God's liberality towards the human race?
Whence is it that nourishment is ready for them as soon as they are born, but
because God wonderfully changes blood into milk? Whence, also, have they the
skill to suck, but because the same God has, by a mysterious instinct, fitted
their tongues for doing this? David, therefore, has the best reason for
declaring, that although the tongues of all, who have arrived at the age of
manhood, should become silent, the speechless mouth of infants is sufficiently
able to celebrate the praise of God. And when he not only introduces babes as
witnesses and preachers of God's glory, but also attributes <i>mature strength
</i>to their mouth, the expression is very emphatic. It means the same thing as
if he had said, These are invincible champions of God who, when it comes to the
conflict, can easily scatter and discomfit the whole host of the wicked
despisers of God, and those who have abandoned themselves to impiety.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa120</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We should observe against whom he imposes upon infants the office of defending
the glory of God, namely, against the hardened despisers of God, who dare to
rise up against heaven to make war upon God, as the poets have said, in olden
time, of the giants.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa121</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Since,

their hardihood endeavor to do violence to heaven itself, David in mockery of
them brings into the field of battle against them the mouths of infants, which
he says are furnished with armor of sufficient strength, and endued with
sufficient fortitude, to lay their intolerable pride
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa124</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

necessity of making war with great power to overcome the faithful, who willingly
hearken to his voice, and manifest a ready obedience, as soon as he gives the
smallest intimation of his will. The providence of God, I confess, shines forth
principally for the sake of the faithful, because they only have eyes to behold
it. But as they show themselves willing to receive instruction, God teaches them
with gentleness; while, on the other hand, he arms himself against his enemies,
who never submit themselves to him but by constraint. Some take the word
<i>founded </i>as meaning, that, in the very birth or generation of man, God
lays foundations for manifesting his own glory. But this sense is too
restricted. I have no doubt that the word is put for <i>to establish, </i>as if
the prophet had said, God needs not strong military forces to destroy the
ungodly; instead of these, the mouths of children are sufficient for his
purpose.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyb&ccedil;h</font><font face="Palatino">,

the conjugation <i>Hiphil </i>of the neuter verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shabath, </i>which signifies <i>to cease. </i>But it is often taken
metaphorically for <i>to destroy, </i>or <i>to reduce to nothing, </i>because
destruction or death brings to an end. Others translate it, <i>that thou mayest
restrain, </i>as if David meant that they were put to silence, so that they
desisted from cursing or reviling God. As, however, there is here a beautiful
allusion to a hostile combat, as I have a little before explained, I have
preferred the military phrase, <i>to put to flight. </i>But it is asked, How
does God put to flight his enemies, who, by their impious slanders and
detractions, do not cease to strike at, and violently to rush forward to oppose
all the proofs of a Divine Providence which daily manifest
themselves?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I answer, They are not routed or
overthrown in respect of their being compelled to become more humble and
unassuming; but because, with all their blasphemies and canine barkings, they
continue in the state of abasement and confusion to which they have been
brought. To express the whole in a few words:so early as the generation or birth
of man the splendor of Divine Providence is so apparent, that even infants, who
hang upon their mothers' breasts, can bring down to the ground the fury of the
enemies of God. Although his enemies may do their utmost, and may even burst
with rage a hundred times, it is in vain for them to endeavor to overthrow the
strength which manifests itself in the weakness of infancy. A desire of revenge
reigns in all unbelievers, while, on the other hand, God governs his own
children by the spirit of meekness and
benignity:</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa127</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but, according to the scope of the present passage, the prophet applies this
epithet, <i>the avenger, </i>to the despisers of God, who are not only cruel
towards man, but who also burn with frantic rage to make war even against God
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have now discharged the duty of a
faithful interpreter in opening up the mind of the prophet. There is only one
difficulty remaining, which is this, that Christ
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:16) seems to put upon this passage a different meaning, when he applies it to
children ten years old. But this difficulty is easily removed. Christ reasons
from the greater to the less in this manner; If God has appointed children even
in infancy the vindicators of his glory, there is no absurdity in his making
them the instruments of showing forth his praise by their tongues after they
have arrived at the age of seven years and
upwards.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

fa129	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino">As the Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>has often the same meaning as <i>because </i>or <i>for, </i>and
simply affirms a thing, both the Greek and the Latin fathers have generally read
the fourth verse as if it were a complete sentence by itself. But it is,
doubtless, closely connected with the following verse; and, therefore, the two
verses ought to be joined together. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ki, </i>might be very properly translated into the disjunctive particle,
<i>although, </i>making the meaning to be this:Although the infinite majesty of
God shines forth in the heavenly bodies, and justly keeps the eyes of men fixed
on the contemplation of it, yet his glory is beheld in a special manner, in the
great favor which he bears to men, and in the goodness which he manifests
towards them. This interpretation would not be at variance with the scope of the
passage; but I choose rather to follow the generally received opinion. My
readers, however, must be careful to mark the design of the Psalmist, which is
to enhance, by this comparison, the infinite goodness of God; for it is, indeed,
a wonderful thing that the Creator of heaven, whose glory is so surpassingly
great as to ravish us with the highest admiration, condescends so far as
graciously to take upon him the care of the human race. That the Psalmist makes
this contrast may be inferred from the Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>enosh, </i>which we have rendered <i>man, </i>and which expresses the frailty
of man rather than any strength or power which he
possesses.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see that miserable men, in moving
upon the earth, are mingled with the vilest creatures; and, therefore, God, with
very good reason, might despise them and reckon them of no account if he were to
stand upon the consideration of his own greatness or dignity. The prophet,
therefore, speaking interrogatively, abases their condition, intimating that
God's wonderful goodness is displayed the more brightly in that so glorious a
Creator, whose majesty shines resplendently in the heavens, graciously
condescends to adorn a creature so miserable and vile as man is with the
greatest glory, and to enrich him with numberless blessings. If he had a mind to
exercise his liberality towards any, he was under no necessity of choosing men
who are but dust and clay, in order to prefer them above all other creatures,
seeing he had a sufficient number in heaven towards whom to show himself
liberal.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whoever, therefore, is not astonished
and deeply affected at this miracle, is more than ungrateful and stupid. When
the Psalmist calls the heavens
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God's
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the works of his
fingers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he has a reference to the same
subject, and intends to illustrate it. How is it that God comes forth from so
noble and glorious a part of his works, and stoops down to us, poor worms of the
earth, if it is not to magnify and to give a more illustrious manifestation of
his goodness? From this, also, we learn, that those are chargeable with a very
presumptuous abuse of the goodness of God, who take occasion from it to be proud
of the excellence which they possess, as if they had either obtained it by their
own skill, or as if they possessed it on account of their own merit; whereas
their origin should rather remind them that it has been gratuitously conferred
upon those who are otherwise vile and contemptible creatures, and utterly
unworthy of receiving any good from God. Whatever estimable quality, therefore,
we see in ourselves, let it stir us up to celebrate the free and undeserved
goodness of God in bestowing it upon us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
verb, at the close of the third verse, which others translate <i>to prepare,
</i>or <i>to found, </i>or <i>to establish, </i>I have thought proper to render
<i>to arrange; </i>for the Psalmist seems to have a reference to the very
beautiful order by which God has so appropriately distinguished the position of
the stars, and daily regulates their course. When it is said, <i>God is mindful
of man, </i>it signifies the same thing as that he bears towards him a fatherly
love, defends and cherishes him, and extends his providence towards him. Almost
all interpreters render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dqp</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
pakad, </i>the last word of this verse, <i>to visit; </i>and I am unwilling to
differ from them, since this sense suits the passage very well. But as it
sometimes signifies <i>to remember, </i>and as we will often find in the Psalms
the repetition of the same thought in different words, it may here be very
properly translated <i>to remember; </i>as if David had said, This is a
marvellous thing, that God thinks upon men, and remembers them
continually.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

infinite goodness of God towards men, in showing himself near to them, and
mindful of them. In the first place, he represents them as adorned with so many
honors as to render their condition not far inferior to divine and celestial
glory. In the second place, he mentions the external dominion and power which
they possess over all creatures, from which it appears how high the degree of
dignity is to which God hath exalted them. I have, indeed, no doubt but he
intends, by the first,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the distinguished endowments which
clearly manifest that men were formed after the image of God, and created to the
hope of a blessed and immortal life. The reason with which they are endued, and
by which they can distinguish between good and evil; the principle of religion
which is planted in them; their intercourse with each other, which is preserved
from being broken up by certain sacred bonds; the regard to what is becoming,
and the sense of shame which guilt awakens in them, as well as their continuing
to be governed by laws; all these things are clear indications of pre-eminent
and celestial wisdom. David, therefore, not without good reason, exclaims that
mankind are adorned with glory and honor. <i>To be crowned, </i>is here taken
metaphorically, as if David had said, he is clothed and adorned with marks of
honor, which are not far removed from the splendor of the divine majesty. The
Septuagint render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Elohim, </i>by <i>angels, </i>of which I do not disapprove, since this name,
as is well known, is often given to angels, and I explain the words of David as
meaning the same thing as if he had said, that the condition of men is nothing
less than a divine and celestial state. But as the other translation seems more
natural, and as it is almost universally adopted by the Jewish interpreters, I
have preferred following it. Nor is it any sufficient objection to this view,
that the apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:7) quoting this passage, says, <i>little less than the angels, </i>and not
<i>than God;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for we know what freedoms the apostles
took in quoting texts of Scripture; not, indeed, to wrest them to a meaning
different from the true one but because they reckoned it sufficient to show, by
a reference to Scripture, that what they taught was sanctioned by the word of
God, although they did not quote the precise words. Accordingly, they never had
any hesitation in changing the words, provided the substance of the text
remained unchanged.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is another question
which it is more difficult to solve. While the Psalmist here discourses
concerning the excellency of men, and describes them, in respect of this, as
coming near to God, the apostle applies the passage to the humiliation of
Christ. In the first place, we must consider the propriety of applying to the
person of Christ what is here spoken concerning all mankind; and, secondly, how
we may explain it as referring to Christ's being humbled in his death, when he
lay without form or beauty, and as it were disfigured under the reproach and
curse of the cross. What some say, that what is true of the members may be
properly and suitably transferred to the head, might be a sufficient answer to
the first question; but I go a step farther, for Christ is not only the first
begotten of every creature, but also the restorer of mankind. What David here
relates belongs properly to the beginning of the creation, when man's nature was
perfect.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But we know that, by the fall of Adam,
all mankind fell from their primeval state of integrity, for by this the image
of God was almost entirely effaced from us, and we were also divested of those
distinguishing gifts by which we would have been, as it were, elevated to the
condition of demigods; in short, from a state of the highest excellence, we were
reduced to a condition of wretched and shameful destitution. In consequence of
this corruption, the liberality of God, of which David here speaks, ceased, so
far, at least, as that it does not at all appear in the brilliancy and splendor
in which it was manifested when man was in his unfallen state. True, it is not
altogether extinguished; but, alas! how small a portion of it remains amidst the
miserable overthrow and ruins of the fall. But as the heavenly Father hath
bestowed upon his Son an immeasurable fullness of all blessings, that all of us
may draw from this fountain, it follows that whatever God bestows upon us by him
belongs of fight to him in the highest degree; yea, he himself is the living
image of God, according to which we must be renewed, upon which depends our
participation of the invaluable blessings which are here spoken of. If any
person object that David first put the question, What is man? because God has so
abundantly poured forth his favor upon a creature, so miserable, contemptible,
and worthless; but that there is no cause for such admiration of God's favor for
Christ, who is not an ordinary man, but the only begotten Son of God. The answer
is easy, and it is this:What was bestowed upon Christ's human nature was a free
gift; nay, more, the fact that a mortal man, and the son of Adam, is the only
Son of God, and the Lord of glory, and the head of angels, affords a bright
illustration of the mercy of God. At the same time, it is to be observed, that
whatever gifts he has received ought to be considered as proceeding from the
free grace of God, so much the more for this reason, that they are intended
principally to be conferred upon us. His excellence and heavenly dignity,
therefore, are extended to us also, seeing it is for our sake he is enriched
with them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What the apostle therefore says in
that passage concerning the abasement of Christ for a short time, is not
intended by him as an explanation of this text; but for the purpose of enriching
and illustrating the subject on which he is discoursing, he introduces and
accommodates to it what had been spoken in a different sense. The same apostle
did not hesitate, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6, in the same manner to enrich and to employ, in a sense different from
their original one, the words of Moses in

Paul's declaration in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:8, in which he does not so much explain the meaning of the text,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:18) as he devoutly applies it, by way of accommodation, to the person of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast set him
over.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now comes to the second
point, which I have just now spoken of, namely, that from the dominion over all
things which God has conferred upon men, it is evident how great is the love
which he has borne towards them, and how much account he has made of them. As he
does not stand in need of any thing himself, he has destined all the riches,
both of heaven and earth, for their use. It is certainly a singular honor, and
one which cannot be sufficiently estimated, that mortal man, as the
representative of God, has dominion over the world, as if it pertained to him by
right, and that to whatever quarter he turns his eyes, he sees nothing wanting
which may contribute to the convenience and happiness of his life. As this
passage is quoted by Paul in his First Epistle to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461527&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:27) where he discourses concerning the spiritual kingdom of
Christ, some may object and say, that the meaning he puts upon it is very
different from the sense which I have given. But it is easy to answer this
objection, and the answer which I give to it is this, That generally the whole
order of this world is arranged and established for the purpose of conducing to
the comfort and happiness of men. In what way the passage may properly apply to
Christ alone, I have already declared a little before. The only thing which now
remains to be considered is, how far this declaration extends &#8212; that all
things are subjected to men. Now, there is no doubt, that if there is any thing
in heaven or on earth which is opposed to men, the beautiful order which God had
established in the world at the beginning is now thrown into confusion. The
consequence of this is, that mankind, after they were ruined by the fall of
Adam, were not only deprived of so distinguished and honorable an estate, and
dispossessed of their former dominion, but are also held captive under a
degrading and ignominious bondage. Christ, it is true, is the lawful heir of
heaven and earth, by whom the faithful recover what they had lost in Adam; but
he has not as yet actually entered upon the full possession of his empire and
dominion. Whence the apostle concludes, that what is here said by
David</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> will not be perfectly accomplished
until death be abolished. Accordingly, the apostle reasons in this manner, "If
all things are subdued to Christ, nothing ought to stand in opposition to his
people. But we see death still exercising his tyranny against them. It follows
then, that there remains the hope of a better state than the present." Now, this
flows from the principle of which I have spoken, that the world was originally
created for this end, that every part of it should tend to the happiness of man
as its great object. In another part of his writings, the apostle argues on the
same principle, when, in order to prove that we must all stand at the last day
before the judgment-seat of Christ, he brings forward the following passage, ,
Unto me every knee shall bow,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:10.) In this syllogism, what Logicians call the minor proposition must be
supplied,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa139</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> namely, that there are still too many
who proudly and obstinately cast off his yoke, and are averse to bow the knee in
token of their submission to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
8:7-9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> All sheep and oxen, and
also the beasts of the fields; <b>8.</b> The birds of the air, and ,he fish of
the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. <b>9.</b> O
Jehovah, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the
earth!	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The preceding question, with respect
to the extent of man's dominion over the works of God, seems not yet to be fully
answered. If the prophet here declares, by way of exposition, to what extent God
has put all things in subjection to us, this subjection, it seems, must be
restricted to what contributes to the temporal comfort and convenience of man
while he continues in this world. To this difficulty I answer, That the Psalmist
does not intend in these verses to give a complete enumeration of all the things
which are subjected to man's dominion, and of which he had spoken generally in
the preceding verse, but he brings forward an example of this subjection only in
one part or particular; yea, he has especially chosen that part which affords a
clear and manifest evidence of the truth he intended to establish, even to those
whose minds are uncultivated and slow of apprehension. There is no man of a mind
so dull and stupid but may se if he will be at the trouble to open his eyes,
that it is by the wonderful providence of God that horses and oxen yield their
service to men, &#8212; that sheep produce wool to clothe theme &#8212; and that
all sorts of animals supply them with food for their nourishment and support,
even from their own flesh. And the more that this dominion is apparent, the more
ought we to be affected with a sense of the goodness and grace of our God as
often as we either eat food, or enjoy any of the other comforts of life. We are,
therefore, not to understand David as meaning that it is a proof that man is
invested with dominion over <i>all </i>the works of God, because he clothes
himself with the wool and the skins of beasts, because he lives upon their
flesh, and because he employs their labor for his own advantage; for this would
be inconclusive reasoning. He only brings forward this as an example, and as a
mirror in which we may behold and contemplate the dominion over the works of his
hands, with which God has honored man. The sum is this:God, in creating man,
gave a demonstration of his infinite grace and more than fatherly love towards
him, which ought justly to strike us with amazement; and although, by the fall
of man, that happy condition has been almost entirely ruined, yet there is still
in him some remains of the liberality which God then displayed towards him,
which should suffice to fill us with admiration. In this mournful and wretched
overthrow, it is true, the legitimate order which God originally established no
longer shines forth, but the faithful whom God gathers to himself, under Christ
their head, enjoy so much of the fragments of the good things which they lost in
Adam, as may furnish them with abundant matter of wonder at the singularly
gracious manner in which God deals with them. David here confines his attention
to God's temporal benefits, but it is our duty to rise higher, and to
contemplate the invaluable treasures of the kingdom of heaven which he has
unfolded in Christ, and all the gifts which belong to the spiritual life, that
by reflecting upon these our hearts may be inflamed with love to God, that we
may be stirred up to the practice of godliness, and that we may not suffer
ourselves to become slothful and remiss in celebrating his
praises.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Psalm
9</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, after having recounted the former victories
which he had gained, and exalted in lofty strains the grace and power of God in
their happy issue, now again, when he sees new enemies and dangers rising up,
implores the protection of the same God by whom he had before been delivered,
and beseeches him to overthrow the pride of his enemies.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief

<div><font face="Palatino">This inscription is variously explained. Some
translate it, <i>Upon the death of Laben, </i>and are of opinion that he was one
of the chief captains of David's enemies. Others are inclined to think it was
rather a fictitious name, and that Goliath is the person spoken of in this
psalm. According to others, it was a musical instrument. But to me it seems a
more correct, or, at least, (as I am accustomed to speak when the matter is
obscure,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa140</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a more probable opinion, that it was
the beginning of some well-known song, to the tune of which the psalm was
composed. The disputes of interpreters as to what victory David here celebrates,
in my judgment, are unnecessary, and serve no good purpose. In the first place,
their opinion that it is a song of victory, in which David simply gives thanks
to God, is confuted, and shown to be erroneous from the scope of the psalm. The
greater part is indeed occupied in singing the praises of God, but the whole
ought to be considered as a prayer; in which, for the purpose of elevating his
mind to confidence in God, he calls to his remembrance, according to his usual
manner, by what wonderful displays of the power of God he had formerly been
delivered from the violence and power of his enemies. It is therefore a mistake
to limit to one victory this thanksgiving, in which he intended to comprehend
many deliverances.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will praise the

way, to induce God to succor him in the calamities with which he was now
afflicted. As God continues his favor towards his own people without
intermission, all the good he has hitherto done to us should serve to inspire us
with confidence and hope, that he will be gracious and merciful to us in the
time to come.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is, indeed, in these words a
profession of gratitude for the favors which he has received from
God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but, in remembering his past mercies,
he encourages himself to expect succor and aid in future emergencies; and by
this means he opens the gate of prayer. <i>The whole heart </i>is taken for an
upright or sincere heart, which is opposed to a double heart. Thus he
distinguishes himself not only from gross hypocrites, who praise God only with
their lips outwardly, without having their hearts in any way affected, but also
acknowledges that whatever he had hitherto done which was commendable, proceeded
entirely from the pure grace of God. Even irreligious men, I admit, when they
have obtained some memorable victory, are ashamed to defraud God of the praise
which is due to him; but we see that as soon as they have uttered a single
expression in acknowledgement of the assistance God has afforded them, they
immediately begin to boast loudly, and to sing triumphs in honor of their own
valor, as if they were under no obligations whatever to God. In short, it is a
piece of pure mockery when they profess that their exploits have been done by
the help of God; for, after having made oblation to Him, they sacrifice to their
own counsels, skill, courage, and resources. Observe how the prophet Habakkuk,
under the person of one presumptuous king, wisely reproves the ambition which is
common to all,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
1:16.) Yea, we see that the famous generals of antiquity, who, upon returning
victorious from some battle, desired public and solemn
thanksgivings</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa145</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to be decreed in their name to the
gods, thought of nothing less than of doing honor to their false deities; but
only abused their names under a false pretense, in order thereby to obtain an
opportunity of indulging in vain boasting, that their own superior prowess might
be acknowledged.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David, therefore, with good reason,
affirms that he is unlike the children of this world, whose hypocrisy or fraud
is discovered by the wicked and dishonest distribution which they make between
God and themselves,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> arrogating to themselves the greater
part of the praise which they pretended to ascribe to God. He praised God with
his whole heart, which they did not; for certainly it is not praising God with
the whole heart when a mortal man dares to appropriate the smallest portion of
the glory which God claims for himself. God cannot bear with seeing his glory
appropriated by the creature in even the smallest degree, so intolerable to him
is the sacrilegious arrogance of those who by praising themselves, obscure his
glory as far as they can.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will tell of all thy marvellous works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here David confirms what I have already said, that he does not treat in this
psalm of one victory or one deliverance only; for he proposes to himself in
general all the miracles which God had wrought in his behalf, as subjects of
meditation. He applies the term <i>marvellous </i>not to all the benefits which
he had received from God, but to those more signal and memorable deliverances in
which was exhibited a bright and striking manifestation of the divine power. God
would have us to acknowledge him as the author of all our blessings; but on some
of his gifts he has engraven more evident marks in order the more effectually to
awaken our senses, which are otherwise as if asleep or dead. David's language,
therefore, is an acknowledgement that he was preserved of God, not by ordinary
means, but by the special power of God, which was conspicuously displayed in
this matter; inasmuch as he had stretched forth his hand in a miraculous manner,
and above the common and usual
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I will rejoice and exult in thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Observe how the faithful praise God sincerely and without hypocrisy, when
they do not rest on themselves for happiness, and are not intoxicated with
foolish and carnal presumption, but rejoice in God alone; which is nothing else
than to seek the matter of their joy from the favor of God, and from no other
source, since in it perfect happiness consists.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will rejoice in
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We ought to consider how great is
the difference and opposition between the character of the joy which men
endeavor to find in themselves, and the character of the joy which they seek in
God. David, the more forcibly to express how he renounces every thing which may
keep hold of or occupy him with vain delight, adds the word <i>exult, </i>by
which he means that he finds in God a full and an overflowing abundance of joy,
so that he is not under the necessity of seeking even the smallest drop in any
other quarter. Moreover, it is of importance to remember what I have previously
observed, that David sets before himself the testimonies of the divine goodness
which he had formerly experienced, in order to encourage himself with the more
alacrity to lay open his heart</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to God, and to present his prayers
before him. He who begins his prayer by affirming that God is the great source
and object of his joy, fortifies himself before-hand with the strongest
confidence, in presenting his supplications to the hearer of
prayer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While my enemies are turned
back.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words he assigns the
reason why he undertakes to sing the praises of God, namely, because he
acknowledges that his frequent victories had been achieved, not by his own
power, nor by the power of his soldiers, but by the free favor of God. In the
first part of the verse he narrates historically how his enemies were
discomfited or put to flight; and then he adds, what faith alone could enable
him to say, that this did not take place by the power of man or by chance, but
because God fought for him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa149</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and stood against them in the battle.
He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and are put to flight </i>At
Thy Presence</font><font face="Palatino">. David therefore acted wisely, when,
upon seeing his enemies turn their backs, he lifted up the eyes of his mind to
God, in order to perceive that victory flowed to him from no other source than
from the secret and incomprehensible aid of God. And, doubtless, it is He only
who guides the simple by the spirit of wisdom, while he inflicts madness on the
crafty, and strikes them with amazement, &#8212; who inspires with courage the
faint and timid, while he causes the boldest to tremble with fear, &#8212; who
restores to the feeble their strength, while he reduces the strong to weakness,
&#8212; who upholds the fainthearted by his power, while he makes the sword to
fall from the hands of the valiant; - and, finally, who brings the battle to a
prosperous or disastrous issue, just as he pleases. When, therefore, we see our
enemies overthrown, we must beware of limiting our view to what is visible to
the eye of sense, like ungodly men, who, while they see with their bodily eyes,
are yet blind; but let us instantly call to our remembrance this truth, that
when our enemies turn back, they are put to flight by the presence of the
Lord.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa151</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The verbs, <i>fall </i>and <i>put to
flight, </i>in the Hebrew, are in the future tense, but I have translated them
in the present, because David anew presents to his own view the goodness of God
which had formerly been manifested towards
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
9:4-5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> For thou hast maintained my
right and my cause; thou sittest upon the throne a righteous
judge.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <b>5.</b> Thou hast rebuked the
nations; thou hast destroyed the wicked; thou hast blotted out their name for
ever and ever.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist proceeds a step
farther in the 4th verse, declaring that God stretched forth his hand to give
him succor, because he was unrighteously afflicted by his enemies. And surely if
we desire to be favored with the assistance of God, we ought to see to it that
we fight under his standard. David, therefore, calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a judge of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or,<i> </i>which is the
same thing, <i>a righteous judge; </i>as if he had said, God has acted towards
me according to his ordinary manner and constant principle of acting, for it is
his usual way to undertake the defense of good causes. I am more inclined to
render the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou sittest a
just judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>than to render them,
<i>O</i> <i>just judge, thou
sittest</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because the form of expression,
according to the first reading, is more emphatic. The import of it is this:God
at length has assumed the character of judge, and is gone up into his
judgment-seat to execute the office of judge. On this account he glories in
having law and right on his side, and declares that God was the maintainer of
his right and cause. What follows in the next verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>[or <i>discomfited,</i>]<i> 
the wicked, </i>belongs also to the same subject. When he beholds his enemies
overthrown, he does not rejoice in their destruction, considered simply in
itself; but in condemning them on account of their unrighteousness, he says that
they have received the punishment which they deserved. Under the name of
<i>nations </i>he means, that it was not a small number of ungodly persons who
were destroyed, but great armies, yea, even all who had risen up against him
from different quarters. And the goodness of God shines forth the brighter in
this, that, on account of the favor which he bare to one of his servants, he
spared not even whole nations. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast blotted out their name
for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it may be understood as
meaning, that they were destroyed without any hope of ever being able to rise
again, and devoted to everlasting shame. We could not otherwise discern how God
buries the name of the ungodly with themselves, did we not hear him declare that
the memory of the righteous shall be for ever blessed,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O thou enemy, desolations are
come to an end for ever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This sixth
verse is explained in different ways. Some read it interrogatively, viewing the
letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
as a mark of interrogation, as if David, addressing his discourse to his
enemies, asked whether they had completed their work of devastation, even as
they had resolved to destroy every thing; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tamam, </i>signifies sometimes <i>to complete, </i>and sometimes <i>to put an
end to any thing. </i>And if we here take it in this sense, David, in the
language of sarcasm or irony, rebukes the foolish confidence of his enemies.
Others, reading the verse without any interrogation, make the irony still more
evident, and think that David describes, in these three verses, a twofold state
of matters; that, in the first place, (verse 6,) he introduces his enemies
persecuting him with savage violence, and persevering with determined obstinacy
in their cruelty, so that it seemed to be their fixed purpose never to desist
until the kingdom of David should be utterly destroyed; and that, in the second
place, (verses 7, 8) he represents God as seated on his judgment-seat, directly
over against them, to repress their outrageous attempts. If this sense is
admitted, the copulative, in the beginning of the seventh verse, which we have
translated <i>and, </i>must be rendered by the adversative particle <i>but,
</i>in this way:Thou, O enemy, didst seek after nothing except slaughter and the
destruction of cities; but, at length, God has shown that he sits in heaven on
his throne as judge, to put into proper order the things which are in confusion
on the earth. According to others, David gives thanks to God, because, when the
ungodly were fully determined to spread universal ruin around them, he put an
end to their devastations. Others understand the words in a more restricted
sense, as meaning that the desolations of the ungodly were completed, because
God, in his just judgment, had made to fall upon their own heads the calamities
and ruin which they had devised against David. According to others, David, in
the 6th verse, complains that God had, for a long time, silently suffered the
miserable devastation of his people, so that the ungodly, being left unchecked,
wasted and destroyed all things according to their pleasure; and in the seventh
verse, they think he subjoins for his consolation that God, notwithstanding,
presides over human affairs. I have no objection to the view, that there is
first described ironically how dreadful the power of the enemy was, when they
put forth their highest efforts; and next, that there is set in opposition to it
the judgment of God, which suddenly brought their proceedings to an abrupt
termination, contrary to their expectation. They anticipated no such issue; for
we know that the ungodly, although they may not presume openly to deprive God of
his authority and dominion, yet run headlong to every excess of wickedness, not
less boldly than if he were bound with
fetters.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We have taken notice of an almost
similar manner of speaking in a preceding psalm,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
7:13)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This contrast between the power of the
enemies of God and his people, and the work of God in breaking up their
proceedings, very well illustrates the wonderful character of the succor which
he granted to his people. The ungodly had set to themselves no limit in the work
of doing mischief, save in the utter destruction of all things, and at the
commencement complete destruction seemed to be at hand; but when things were in
this state of confusion, God seasonably made his appearance for the help of his
people.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa156</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As often, therefore, as nothing but
destruction presents itself to our view, to whatever side we may
turn,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa157</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> let us remember to lift up our eyes to
the heavenly throne, whence God beholds all that is done here below. In the
world our affairs may have been brought to such an extremity, that there is no
longer hope in regard to them; but the shield with which we ought to repel all
the temptations by which we are assailed is this, that God, nevertheless, sits
Judge in heaven. Yea, when he seems to take no notice of us, and does not
immediately remedy the evils which we suffer, it becomes us to realize by faith
his secret providence. The Psalmist says, in the first place, <i>God sitteth for
ever, </i>by which he means, that however high the violence of men may be
carried, and although their fury may burst forth without measure, they can never
drag God from his seat. He farther means by this expression, that it is
impossible for God to abdicate the office and authority of judge; a truth which
he expresses more clearly in the second clause of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath prepared his throne for
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in which he declares that God
reigns not only for the purpose of making his majesty and glory surpassingly
great, but also for the purpose of governing the world in
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall judge the world
in righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As David has just now
testified, that the power of God is not inactive, so that he dwells in heaven
only indulging himself in pleasures; but that it is a constantly operating power
which he exercises in preserving his authority, and governing the world in
righteousness and equity; so in this verse he adds the use of this doctrine,
which is this, that the power of God is not shut up in heaven, but manifests
itself in succouring men. The true doctrine on this subject, is not, like
Epicurus, to imagine that God is a being wholly devoted to ease and pleasures,
and who, satisfied with himself alone, has no care whatever about mankind, but
to place him on the throne of power and equity, so that we may be fully
persuaded, that although he does not immediately succor those who are
unrighteously oppressed, yet there is not a moment in which he ceases to take a
deep interest in them. And when he seems for a time to take no notice of things,
the conclusion to which we should come most assuredly is, not that he deserts
his office, but that he wishes hereby to exercise the patience of his people,
and that, therefore, we should wait the issue in patience, and with tranquillity
of mind. The demonstrative pronoun <i>He, </i>in my opinion, is of great weight.
The import of it is, as if David had said, No one can deprive God of his office
as Judge of the world, nor prevent him from extending his judgments to all
nations. Whence it follows, that he will much more be the judge of his own
people. David declares these judgments to be <i>righteous, </i>in order to
induce us, when we are unrighteously and cruelly molested, to ask assistance
from God, in the confident expectation of obtaining it; for since he judges the
nations in righteousness, he will not suffer injustice and oppression always to
reign with impunity in the world, nor deny his aid to the
innocent.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

aid, and to outward appearance forsakes his faithful ones, in order at length to
succor them at a more convenient season, according to the greatness of their
necessity and affliction. From this it follows, that he by no means ceases from
the exercise of his office, although he suffer the good and the innocent to be
reduced to extreme poverty, and although he exercise them with weeping and
lamentations; for by doing this he lights up a lamp to enable them to see his
judgments the more clearly. Accordingly, David expressly declares, that God
interposes his protection <i>seasonably </i>in the afflictions of his people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will be a protection to
the poor in seasonable times in trouble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>From this we are taught the duty of giving his providence time to make
itself at length manifest in the season of need. And if protection by the power
of God, and the experience of his fatherly favor, is the greatest blessing which
we can receive, let us not feel so uneasy at being accounted poor and miserable
before the world, but let this consolatory consideration assuage our grief, that
God is not far from us, seeing our afflictions call upon him to come to our aid.
Let us also observe, that God is said to be at hand in <i>seasonable times
</i>when he succours the faithful during their
affliction.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

<i>batsarah, </i>which occurs in the end of the 9th verse, is understood by some
as if it were the simple word which signifies <i>defense; </i>but here they
render it metaphorically <i>distress, </i>denoting those trying circumstances in
which a person is so closely shut up, and reduced to such extremity, that he can
find no escape. I, however, think there is more probability in the opinion of
those who take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
the first letter of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrxb</font><font face="Palatino">,

signification.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa160</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What is here said, then, is, that God
assists his own people in the time of need, namely, in affliction, or when they
are weighed down with it, for then assistance is most necessary and most
useful.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the tenth verse, the Psalmist teaches
us, that when the Lord delivers the righteous, the fruit which results from it
is, that they themselves, and all the rest of the righteous, acquire increasing
confidence in his grace; for, unless we are fully persuaded that God exercises a
care about men and human affairs, we must necessarily be troubled with constant
disquietude. But as most men shut their eyes that they may not see the judgments
of God, David restricts this advantage to the faithful alone, and, certainly,
where there is no godliness, there is no sense of the works of God. It is also
to be observed, that he attributes to the faithful <i>the knowledge of God;
</i>because from this religion proceeds, whereas it is extinguished through the
ignorance and stupidity of men. Many take the <i>name of God </i>simply for God
himself; but, as I have observed in my remarks on a preceding psalm, I think
something more is expressed by this term. As God's essence is hidden and
incomprehensible, his name just means his character, so far as he has been
pleased to make it known to us. David next explains the ground of this trust in
God to be, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>does not
forsake those who seek him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God is
sought in two ways, either by invocation and prayers, or by studying to live a
holy and an upright life; and, indeed, the one is always inseparably joined with
the other. But as the Psalmist is here treating of the protection of God, on
which the safety of the godly depends, <i>to seek God, </i>as I understand it,
is to betake ourselves to him for help and relief in danger and
distress.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sing unto
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David, not contented with
giving thanks individually, and on his own account, exhorts the faithful to
unite with him, praising God, and to do this not only because it is their duty
to stir up one another to this religious exercise, but because the deliverances
of which he treats were worthy of being publicly and solemnly celebrated; and
this is expressed more clearly in the second clause, where he commands them to
be published among the nations. The meaning is, that they are not published or
celebrated as they deserve, unless the whole world is filled with the renown of
them. To proclaim God's doings among the nations was indeed, as it were, to sing
to the deaf; but by this manner of speaking, David intended to show that the
territory of Judea was too narrow to contain the infinite greatness of Jehovah's
praises. He gives God this title,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who dwelleth in
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to distinguish him from all the
false gods of the Gentiles. There is in the phrase a tacit comparison between
the God who made his covenant with Abraham and Israel, and all the gods who, in
every other part of the world except Judea, were worshipped according to the
blinded and depraved fancies of men. It is not enough for persons to honor and
reverence some deity indiscriminately or at random; they must distinctly yield
to the only living and true God the worship which belongs to him, and which he
commands. Moreover, as God had particularly chosen Sion as the place where his
name might be called upon, David very properly assigns it to him as his peculiar
dwelling-place, not that it is lawful to attempt to shut up, in any particular
place, Him whom "the heaven of heavens cannot contain,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 8:1.) but because, as we shall afterwards see,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:12) he had promised to make it his rest for ever. David did not, according
to his own fancy, assign God a dwelling-place there; but he understood, by a
revelation from heaven, that such was the pleasure of God himself, as Moses had
often predicted,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:1.) This goes far to prove what I have said before, that this psalm was not
composed upon the occasion of David's victory over Goliath; for it was only
towards the close of David's reign that the ark of the covenant was removed to
Sion according to the commandment of God. The conjecture of some that David
spake by the Spirit of prophecy of the residence of the ark on Sion, as a future
event, appears to me to be unnatural and forced. Farther, we see that the holy
fathers, when they resorted to Sion to offer sacrifices to God, did not act
merely according to the suggestion of their own minds; but what they did
proceeded from faith in the word of God, and was done in obedience to his
command; and they were, therefore, approved of by him for their religious
service. Whence it follows, that there is no ground whatever to make use of
their example as an argument or excuse for the religious observances which
superstitious men have, by their own fancy, invented for themselves. Besides, it
was not enough for the faithful, in those days, to depend upon the word of God,
and to engage in those ceremonial services which he required, unless, aided by
external symbols, they elevated their minds above these, and yielded to God
spiritual worship. God, indeed, gave real tokens of his presence in that visible
sanctuary, but not for the purpose of binding the senses and thoughts of his
people to earthly elements; he wished rather that these external symbols should
serve as ladders, by which the faithful might ascend even to heaven. The design
of God from the commencement in the appointment of the sacraments, and all the
outward exercises of religion, was to consult the infirmity and weak capacity of
his people. Accordingly, even at the present day, the true and proper use of
them is, to assist us in seeking God spiritually in his heavenly glory, and not
to occupy our minds with the things of this world, or keep them fixed in the
vanities of the flesh, a subject which we shall afterwards have a more suitable
opportunity of discussing more fully. And as the Lord, in ancient times, when he
called himself, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who dwelleth
in Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>intended to give his people
full and solid ground of trust, tranquillity, and joy; so even now, after the
law has come out of Sion, and the covenant of grace has flowed to us from that
fountain, let us know and be fully persuaded, that wherever the faithful, who
worship him purely and in due form, according to the appointment of his word,
are assembled together to engage in the solemn acts of religious worship, he is
graciously present, and presides in the midst of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in requiring
blood.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the original, it is <i>bloods,
</i>in the plural number, and, therefore, the relative which follows immediately
after, <i>And remembereth </i>THEM, may very properly be referred to that word
in this way, He requireth bloods, and remembereth them. But as it is
sufficiently common in Hebrew to invert the order of the antecedent and the
relative, and to put <i>them </i>before the word to which it
refers,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> some explain it of <i>the poor,
</i>thus:In requiring blood, he hath remembered them, namely, the poor, of whom
he speaks a little after. As to the sum and substance of the matter, it is of
small importance in which of these ways we explain the relative; but the former
is, in my view, the more natural explanation. There is here a repetition of what
the Psalmist had said a little before, that we ought especially to consider
God's power, as it is manifested in the mercy which he exercises towards his
servants, who are unrighteously persecuted by wicked men. From the numerous
works of God, he selects one which he commends as especially worthy of being
remembered, namely, his work in delivering the poor from death. God sometimes
leaves them in his holy providence to be persecuted by men; but at length he
takes vengeance for the wrongs inflicted upon them. The words which David uses
denote a continued act; but I have no doubt that he intends from those examples,
which he has related in the preceding part of the psalm, to lead men to
acknowledge that God requireth innocent blood, and remembers the cry of his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He again insists on what I adverted to
before, that God does not always put a stop to injuries so speedily as we would
wish, nor break the attempts of the wicked at the first, but rather withholds
and delays his assistance, so that it may seem that we cry to him in vain, a
truth which it is of importance for us to understand; for if we measure the help
of God according to our senses, our courage will ever and anon fail us, and in
the end our hope will be entirely extinguished, and will give place to
despondency and despair. We would fondly wish him, as I have said, to stretch
forth his hand to a distance, and drive back the troubles which he sees to be
prepared for us; yet he seems to take no notice, and does not prevent the blood
of the innocent from being shed. Let this consolatory consideration, however,
sustain us, that he will at length actually show how precious our blood was in
his sight. If it is objected, that God's assistance comes too late, after we
have endured all calamities, I answer, God delays to interfere no longer than he
knows it to be of advantage for us to be humbled under the cross, and if he
chooses rather to take vengeance after we have suffered outrage, than to aid us
previous to the infliction of evil, it is not because he is not always willing
and ready to succor us; but because he knows it is not always a proper time for
manifesting his grace. By the way, it is a striking evidence, not only of his
fatherly love towards us, but of the blessed immortality which is the portion of
all the children of God, that he has a care about them even after they are dead.
Were he always by his grace to prevent affliction from befalling us, who is
there amongst us who would not be wholly attached to the present life? When,
however, he avenges our death, from this it appears that, though dead, we still
remain alive in his presence. For he does not, after the manner of men, hold in
estimation the memory of those whom he could not preserve
alive,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but he actually shows that he cherishes
in his bosom, and gives protection to those who seem to be no more, viewing them
according to the flesh. And this is the reason why David says that he
remembereth blood when he requireth it; for although he may not presently
deliver his servants from the swords of the wicked, yet he suffers not their
murder to pass unpunished. To the same purpose is the last clause
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He forgetteth not the cry of the
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God may not show, by granting
instant deliverance or relief, that he lends an immediate ear to the complaints
of his servants; but at length he proves unanswerably that he has regarded them.
Express mention is made of <i>crying, </i>to encourage all who desire to
experience God as their deliverer and protector, to direct their wishes,
groanings, and prayers to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
9:13-14	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13. </b>Have mercy upon me, O
Jehovah, see my affliction which I suffer from those who persecute me, thou that
liftest me up from the gates of death. <b>14.</b> That I may recount all thy
praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion; and that I may rejoice in thy
salvation.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy upon me, O
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I think that this is the second
part of the psalm. Others, however, are of a different opinion, and consider
that David, according to his frequent practice, while giving thanks to God for
the deliverance wrought for him, mingles with his thanksgiving an account of
what had been the matter of his prayer in the extremity of his distress; and
examples of the same kind, I confess, are every where to be met with in the
Psalms. But when I consider all the circumstances more attentively, I am
constrained to incline to the other opinion, namely, that in the commencement he
celebrated the favors conferred upon him in order to make way for prayer; and
the psalm is at last concluded with a prayer. He does not, therefore, in passing
here insert the prayers which he had formerly made in the midst of his dangers
and anxieties; but he purposely implores help from God at the present
time,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and asks that <i>He, </i>whom he had
often experienced as his deliverer, would continue the exercise of the same
grace towards him. His enemies, perhaps, whom he had already vanquished on
various occasions, having gathered new courage, and raised new forces, made a
desperate effort, as we often see those who are driven to despair rush upon
their enemies just with the greater impetuosity and rage. It is indeed certain,
that David, when he offered this prayer, was seized with the greatest fear; for
he would not, on account of a small matter, have called upon God to witness his
affliction in the way he here does. It ought to be observed, that while he
humbly betakes himself to the mercy of God, he bears, with a patient and
submissive mind, the cross which was laid upon
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But we ought chiefly to mark the title
which he gives to God, calling him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his lifter up from the gates of
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for we could not find a more
appropriate expression than <i>to lift up </i>for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mwrm</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
meromem. </i>By this the Psalmist, in the first place, strengthens his faith
from his past experience, inasmuch as he had often been delivered from the
greatest dangers. And, in the second place, he assures himself of deliverance,
even in the very jaws of death; because God is accustomed not only to succor his
servants, and to deliver them from their calamities by ordinary means, but also
to bring them from the grave, even after all hope of life is cut off; for <i>the
gates of death </i>is a metaphorical expression, denoting the utmost perils
which threaten destruction, or rather, which lay the grave open before us. In
order, therefore, that neither the weight of the calamities which we presently
endure, nor the fear of those which we see impending over <i>us, </i>may
overwhelm our faith, or interrupt our prayers, let us call to our remembrance
that the office of lifting up his people from the gates of death is not ascribed
to God in vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may
recount.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David's meaning simply is, that
he will celebrate the praises of God in all assemblies, and, wherever there is
the greatest concourse of people, (for at that time it was the custom to hold
assemblies at the gates of cities;) but, at the same time, there seems to be an
allusion to the gates of death, of which he has just spoken, as if he had said,
After I am delivered from the grave, I will do my endeavor to bear testimony, in
the most public manner, to the goodness of God, manifested in my deliverance.
As, however, it is not sufficient to utter the praises of God with our tongues,
if they do not proceed from the heart, the Psalmist, in the last clause of the
verse, expresses the inward joy with which he would engage in this exercise,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that I may rejoice in thy
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if he had said, I desire
to live in this world for no other purpose than to rejoice in having been
preserved by the grace of God. Under the name of daughter, as is well known, the
Jews meant a people or city, but he here names the city from its principal part,
namely, Sion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
9:15-16	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b> The heathen are sunk

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The heathen are sunk.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">David being now raised up to holy confidence,
triumphs over his enemies. In the first place, he says metaphorically, that they
were taken in their own craftiness and snares. He next expresses the same thing
without figure, that they were snared in their own wickedness. And he affirms
that this happened not by chance, but was the work of God, and a striking proof
of his judgment. When he compares his enemies to hunters or fowlers, it is not
without having just ground for doing so. The wicked, it is true, often commit
violence and outrage, yet in deceits and cunning artifices they always imitate
their father Satan, who is the father of lies, and, therefore, whatever
ingenuity they have, they employ it in practising wickedness and in devising
mischief. As often, therefore, as wicked men cunningly plot our destruction, let
us remember that it is no new thing for them to lay nets and snares for the
children of God. At the same time, let us comfort ourselves from the reflection,
that whatever they may attempt against us, the issue is not in their power, and
that God will be against them, not only to frustrate their designs, but also to
surprise them in the wicked devices which they frame, and to make all their
resources of mischief to fall upon their own
heads.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord is known in
executing judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reading of the
words literally is this, The <i>known Lord has done judgment.</i> This manner of
speech is abrupt, and its very brevity renders it obscure. It<i> </i>is
therefore explained in two ways. Some explain it thus:- God begins then to be
known when he punishes the wicked. But the other sense suits the passage better,
namely, that it is a thing obvious and manifest to all that God executes the
office of judge, as often as he ensnares the wicked in their own maliciousness.
In short, whenever God turns back upon themselves whatever schemes of mischief
they devise, David declares that in this case the divine judgment is so evident,
that what happens can be ascribed neither to nature nor to fortune. If God,
therefore, in this way manifestly display, at any time, the power of his hand,
let us learn to open our eyes, that from the judgments which he executes upon
the enemies of his Church our faith may be confirmed more and more. As to the
word <i>Higgaion, </i>which properly signifies <i>meditation, </i>I cannot at
present assign a better reason why it has been inserted than this, that David
intended to fix the minds of the godly in meditation upon the judgments of God.
The word <i>Selah </i>was intended to answer the same purpose, and as I have
said before, regulated the singing in such a manner as to make the music
correspond to the words and the
sentiment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wicked shall be turned into
hell.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many translate the verb in the
optative mood, <i>Let the wicked be turned into hell, </i>as if it were an
imprecation. But, in my judgment, David here rather confirms himself and all the
godly with respect to the future, declaring that whatever the wicked may
attempt, it will have a termination disastrous to themselves. By the word
<i>turn </i>he means that the issue will be far otherwise than what they
imagine; for there is implied in it a tacit contrast between the height of their
presumption and the depth of their fall. As they have no fear of God, they exalt
themselves above the clouds; and then, as if they had "made a covenant with
death," according to the language of Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15) they become so much the more arrogant and presumptuous. But when we see
them raging without apprehension of danger, the prophet warns us that their
madness carries them headlong, so that, at length, they fall into the grave,
from which they thought themselves to be a great way off. Here, then, is
described to us the sudden and unexpected change, by which God, when he pleases,
restores to order things which were in confusion. When, therefore, we see the
wicked flying aloft devoid of all fear, let us, by the eyes of faith, behold the
grave which is prepared for them; and rest assured that the hand of God,
although it is unseen, is very near, which can turn them back in the midst of
their course in which they aim at reaching heaven, and make them tumble into
hell in a moment. The meaning of the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlwa&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
sheolah,</i> is doubtful, but I have not hesitated to translate it
<i>hell</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I do not find fault with those who
translate it <i>the grave, </i>but it is certain that the prophet means
something more than common death, otherwise he would here say nothing else with
respect to the wicked than what would also happen to all the faithful in common
with them. Though then, he does not speak in express terms of eternal
destruction, but only says, <i>They shall be turned into the grave, </i>yet,
under the metaphor of <i>the grave, </i>he intimates that all the ungodly shall
perish, and that the presumption with which, by every unlawful means, they raise
themselves on high to trample righteousness under foot, and to oppress the
innocent, shall bring upon them ruin and perdition. The faithful, also, it is
true, descend into the grave, but not with such fearful violence as plunges them
into it without hope of coming out again. So far is this from being the case,
that even when shut up in the grave, they dwell already in heaven by
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the poor shall not always
be forgotten.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The assertion that God
will not forsake the poor and afflicted for ever, is a confirmation of the
preceding sentence. By it he intimates, that they may indeed seem to be forsaken
for a time. Let us, therefore, remember that God has promised his assistance to
us, not in the way of preventing our afflictions, but of at length succouring us
after we have been long subdued under the cross. David speaks expressly of
<i>hope </i>or <i>expectation, </i>thereby to encourage us to prayer. The reason
why God seems to take no notice of our afflictions is, because he would have us
to awaken him by means of our prayers; for when he hears our requests, (as if he
began but then to be mindful of us,) he stretches forth his powerful hand to
help us. David again repeats that this is not done immediately, in order that we
may persevere in hoping well, even although our expectations may not be
instantly gratified.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, O
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When David beseeches God to
arise, the expression does not strictly apply to God, but it refers to external
appearance and to our senses; for we do not perceive God to be the deliverer of
his people except when he appears before our eyes, as it were sitting upon the
judgment-seat. There is added a consideration or reason to induce God to avenge
the injuries done to his people, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that man may not
prevail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for when God arises, all the
fierceness</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the ungodly must immediately fall
down and give way. Whence is it that the wicked become so audaciously insolent,
or have so great power to work mischief, if it is not because God is still, and
gives them loose reins? But, as soon as he shows some token of his judgment, he
immediately puts a stop to their proud
tumults,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa168</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and breaks their strength and power

praying, that however insolently and proudly our enemies may boast of what they
will do, yet they are in the hand of God, and can do no more than what he
permits them; and farther, that God can doubtless, whenever he pleases, render
all their endeavors vain and ineffectual. The Psalmist, therefore, in speaking
of them, calls them <i>man. </i>The word in the original is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>enosh, </i>which is derived from a root signifying misery or wretchedness,
and, accordingly, it is the same thing as if he had called them mortal or frail
man. Farther, the Psalmist beseeches God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to judge the heathen before his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God is said to do this when he
compels them, by one means or another, to appear before his judgment-seat. We
know that unbelievers, until they are dragged by force into the presence of God,
turn their backs upon him as much as they can, in order to exclude from their
minds all thought of him as their
Judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b><i>

</i>But the scope of the passage requires that we should understand it of fear
or dread; and this is the opinion of all sound expositors. Now, it is to be
considered of what kind of fear David speaks. God commonly subdues even his
chosen ones to obedience by means of fear. But as he moderates his rigour
towards them, and, at the same time, softens their stony hearts, so that they
willingly and quietly submit themselves to him, he cannot be properly said to
compel them by fear. With respect to the reprobate, he takes a different way of
dealing. As their obduracy is inflexible, so that it is easier to break than to
bend them, he subdues their desperate obstinacy by force; not, indeed, that they
are reformed, but, whether they will or no, an acknowledgement of their own
weakness is extorted from them. They may gnash their teeth and boil with rage,
and even exceed in cruelty wild beasts, but when the dread of God seizes upon
them, they are thrown down with their own violence, and fall with their own
weight. Some explain these words as a prayer that God would bring the nations
under the yoke of David, and make them tributaries to his government; but this
is a cold and forced explanation. The word <i>fear </i>comprehends in general
all the plagues of God, by which is repulsed, as by the heavy blows of a
hammer,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the rebellion of those who would never
obey him except by compulsion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There follows
next the point to which the nations must be brought, namely, to acknowledge
themselves to be mortal men. This, at first sight, seems to be a matter of small
importance; but the doctrine which it contains is far from being trifling. What
is man, that he dares of himself to move a finger? And yet all the ungodly run
to excess as boldly and presumptuously as if there were nothing to hinder them
from doing whatever they please. It is certainly through a distempered
imagination that they claim to themselves what is peculiar to God; and, in
short, they would never run to so great excess if they were not ignorant of
their own condition. David, when he beseeches God to strike the nations with
terror, that they <i>may know that they are
men,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> does not mean that the ungodly will
profit so much under the rods and chastisements of God as to humble themselves
truly and from the heart; but the knowledge of which he speaks just means an
experience of their own weakness. His language is as if he had said, Lord, since
it is their ignorance of themselves which hurries them into their rage against
me, make them actually to experience that their strength is not equal to their
infatuated presumption, and after they are disappointed of their vain hopes, let
them lie confounded and abased with shame. It may often happen that those who
are convinced of their own weakness do not yet reform; but much is gained when
their ungodly presumption is exposed to mockery and scorn before the world, that
it may appear how ridiculous was the confidence which they presumed to place in
their own strength. With respect to the chosen of God, they ought to profit
under his chastisements after another manner. It becomes them to be humbled
under a sense of their own weakness, and willingly to divest themselves of all
vain confidence and presumption. And this will be the case if they remember that
they are but men. Augustine has well and wisely said, that the whole humility of
man consists in the knowledge of himself. Moreover, since pride is natural to
all, God requires to strike terror into all men indiscriminately, that, on the
one hand, his own people may learn to be humble, and that, on the other hand,
the wicked, although they cease not to elevate themselves above the condition of
man, may be put back with shame and confusion.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
10.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David here complains, in his own name, and in the
name of all the godly, that fraud, extortion, cruelty, violence, and all kind of
injustice, prevailed every where in the world; and the cause which he assigns
for this is, that ungodly and wicked men, being intoxicated with their
prosperity, have shaken off all fear of God, and think they may do whatever they
please with impunity. Accordingly, he earnestly beseeches God to help him, and
to remedy his desperate calamities. In the close, he comforts himself and the
rest of the faithful with the hope of obtaining deliverance in due time. This
description represents, as in a mirror, a lively image of a widely corrupt and
disorganised state of society. When, therefore, we see iniquity breaking out
like a flood, that the strangeness of such a temptation may not shake the faith
of the children of God and cause them to fall into despair, let them learn to
look into this mirror. It tends greatly to lighten grief, to consider that
nothing befalls us at this day which the Church of God has not experienced in
the days of old; yea, rather that we are just called to engage in the same
conflicts with which David and the other holy patriarchs were exercised.
Farther, the faithful are admonished to have recourse to God in such a confused
state of things; for unless they are convinced that it belongs to God to succor
them, and to remedy such a state of matters, they will gain nothing by indulging
in confused murmurings, and rending the air with their cries and
complaints.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, why standest thou afar
off?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We here see how the prophet,
seeking a remedy for his calamities, which were apparently past hope, directly
addresses himself to God at the very commencement. And the rule which we should
observe, when we are in trouble and sorrow, is this:We should seek comfort and
solace in the providence of God; for amidst our agitations, vexations, and
cares, we ought to be fully persuaded that it is his peculiar office to give
relief to the wretched and afflicted. It is in an improper sense, and by
anthropathy,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the Psalmist speaks of God as
standing afar off. Nothing can be hid from his eyes; but as God permits us to
speak to him as we do to one another, these forms of expression do not contain
any thing absurd, provided we understand them as applied to God, not in a strict
sense, but only figuratively, according to the judgment which mere sense forms
from the present appearance of things. It is possible that a righteous man may
not check an injury which is done to a poor man before his eyes, because he is
destitute of the power; but this cannot be the case with respect to God, who is
always armed with invincible power. If, therefore, he act as if he took no
notice, it is the same as if he withdrew himself afar off. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yl[t</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>taelim, </i>which signifies <i>to hide, </i>is explained in two ways.
According to some, David here complains of God for hiding himself, as if he
accounted the care of human affairs beneath him. Others understand it as meaning
<i>to shut the eyes; </i>and this appears to me to be the more simple view. It
is to be observed, that although David here complains that God kept himself afar
off, he was, notwithstanding, fully persuaded of his presence with him,
otherwise it would have been in vain to have called upon him for aid. The
interrogation which he employs is to this effect:Lord, since it is thy
prerogative to govern the world, and also to regulate it by thy righteousness as
thou sustainest it by thy power, why is it that thou dost not more quickly show
thyself a defender of thine own people against the arrogance and incredible
pride of the ungodly? David, however, speaks thus not so much in the way of
complaining, as to encourage himself in the confidence of obtaining what he
desired. Through the infirmity of sense, he says, that it is unbecoming of God
to cease so long from executing his office; and yet, at the same time, he fails
not to yield to him the honor which is his due, and by his prayers he deposits
into his bosom the great burden of trouble with which he was laden. The
expression which follows, <i>at needful times, </i>relates to the same subject.
Although God may not stretch forth his hand to take
vengeance</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa177</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> at every moment, yet when he beholds
the simple and innocent oppressed, it is not time for him to defer any longer.
David briefly defines the fit time for putting the hand to the work to be when
the faithful are in distress. Of this form of speech we have spoken in the
preceding psalm, at the tenth
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The ungodly in his pride,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Before uttering his prayer against
the ungodly, the Psalmist briefly sets forth their wickedness in cruelly vexing
the afflicted, for no other reason but because they disdain and despise them,
through the pride with which they are inflated. And their cruelty is not a
little enhanced from this, that, forgetful of all humanity, they contemptuously
triumph over the poor and afflicted, mocking them and inflicting injuries upon
them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa178</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Cruelty is, indeed, always proud, yea,
rather, pride is the mother of all wrongs; for if a man did not through pride
magnify himself above his neighbors, and through an overweening conceit of
himself despise them, even common humanity would teach us with what humility and
justice we ought to conduct ourselves towards each other. But David here
intended to state that the only cause why the ungodly, whom he accuses, exercise
their cruelty against the wretched and the needy, from whom they receive no
provocation, is the pride and arrogance of their own spirits. Let every one,
therefore, who desires to live justly and unblameably with his brethren, beware
of indulging or taking pleasure in treating others disdainfully; and let him
endeavor, above all things, to have his mind freed from the disease of pride.
The word

persecute; </i>and, therefore, some prefer translating the words, <i>The poor is
persecuted in the pride of the

fa179</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They may also not improperly be
rendered thus, <i>The poor burns in the pride of the ungodly, </i>because this
is the more common signification of the word. The pride of the wicked, like
fire, devours the poor and
afflicted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the ungodly praiseth
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse is variously
explained. Literally the reading is, <i>For praiseth the wicked or ungodly;
</i>and it is therefore necessary to supply some word, but what word is
disputed.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa181</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some translate the words, <i>ungodly
</i>and <i>violent man, </i>in the accusative case, thus:<i>He praiseth the
ungodly, and blesseth the violent man; </i>because they think it strange that
after "praiseth" the sentence should end abruptly, without any thing being said
of who or what was praised. But since it is quite common in Hebrew, when the
agent and the subject are one and the same person, to express the word only
once, while we repeat it in order to complete the sense, the interpretation
which I have followed appears to me the most proper, namely, that the ungodly
man praises himself, and boasts of the desire of his soul, and blesses himself.
Now, it may be asked, What is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this desire of
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>It is usually understood in this
sense,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa182</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the ungodly flatter and applaud
themselves, while fortune smiles on them, and they obtain their wishes, and
enjoy whatever they desire; just as David adds, a little after, that they abuse
their prosperity, in attempting whatever comes into their fancy. But, in my
opinion, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desire of
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>here denotes rather lust, and the
intemperate gratification of passion and appetite; and thus the meaning is, that
they indulge themselves with delight in their depraved desires, and, despising
the judgment of God, fearlessly absolve themselves from all guilt, maintain
their innocence,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and justify their impiety. Moses uses a
similar form of expression in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
29:19,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I shall have peace,
though I walk in the imagination of mine heart."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, indeed, says a little after, that the ungodly
abuse their prosperity, by flattering themselves; but here, in my judgment, he
expresses something more weighty, namely, that they acquire praise from their
presumptuousness, and glory in their wickedness; and this foolish confidence, or
bold assurance, is the cause of their throwing off all restraint and breaking
forth into every kind of excess. Accordingly, I interpret the words <i>praise
</i>and <i>bless </i>as having the same meaning, just as the words, <i>ungodly
</i>and <i>violent man, </i>are synonymous in this place, although they differ
from each other as genus and species. With these statements agrees what is
immediately added in the end of the verse that these ungodly persons <i>despise
God. </i>To translate the verb, <i>to blaspheme, </i>as has been done by some,
or <i>to provoke to anger, </i>as has been done by others, is too remote from
the scope of the passage. David rather teaches, that the cause of their careless
indulgence in the gratification of their lusts, is their base contempt of God.
He who duly reflects that God will be his judge is so much alarmed by this
reflection, that he dares not bless his soul while his conscience accuses him of
guilt and of being given to the practice of
sin.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa184</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The ungodly, in the pride of his countenance,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Others translate the words, <i>The
ungodly man, by reason of the violence of his anger, </i>or, <i>in the pride
which he displays, does not inquire after God. </i>But this partly perverts the
meaning, and partly weakens the force of what David intended to express. In the
first place, the word <i>inquire, </i>which is here put absolutely, that is,
without any noun which it governs, is, according to this translation, improperly
limited to God. David simply means, that the ungodly, without examination,
permit themselves to do any thing, or do not distinguish between what is lawful
and unlawful, because their own lust is their law, yea, rather, as if superior
to all laws, they fancy that it is lawful for them to do whatever they please.
The beginning of well-doing in a man's life is inquiry; in other words, we can
only begin to do well when we keep ourselves from following, without choice and
discrimination, the dictates of our own fancy, and from being carried away by
the wayward propensities of our flesh. But the exercise of inquiring proceeds
from humility, when we assign to God, as is reasonable, the place of judge and
ruler over us. The prophet, therefore, very properly says, that the reason why
the ungodly, without any regard or consideration, presume to do whatever they
desire, is because, being lifted up with pride, they leave to God nothing
whatever of the prerogative of a judge. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;p</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aph, </i>which we have translated <i>countenance, </i>I have no doubt is here
taken in its proper and natural signification, and not metaphorically for
<i>anger; </i>because haughty persons show their effrontery even by their
countenance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second clause, the prophet
more severely, or, at least, more openly, accuses them, declaring that all their
wicked imaginations show that they have no God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All his devices say, There is no
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa185</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words I understand,
that through their heaven-daring presumption, they subvert all piety and
justice, as if there were no God sitting in heaven. Did they truly believe that
there is a God, the fear of the judgment to come would restrain them. Not that
they plainly and distinctly deny the existence of a God, but then they strip him
of his power. Now, God would be merely like an idol, if, contented with an
inactive existence, he should divest himself of his office as judge. Whoever,
therefore, refuse to admit that the world is subject to the providence of God,
or do not believe that his hand is stretched forth from on high to govern it, do
as much as in them lies to put an end to the existence of God. It is not,
however, enough to have some cold and unimpressive knowledge of him in the head;
it is only the true and heartfelt conviction of his providence which makes us
reverence him, and which keeps us in
subjection</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to him. The greater part of
interpreters understand the last clause as meaning generally, that all the
thoughts of a wicked man tend to the denial of a God. In my opinion, the Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twmzm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mezimmoth, </i>is here, as in many other places, taken in a bad sense for
cunning and wicked thoughts,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that the meaning, as I have noticed
already, is this:Since the ungodly have the hardihood to devise and perpetrate
every kind of wickedness, however atrocious, it is from this sufficiently
manifest, that they have cast off all fear of God from their
hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
10:5-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> His ways are prosperous at
all times; on high are thy judgments before him; he puffeth at all his enemies.
<b>6.</b> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved from generation to
generation, because he is not in
adversity.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">There is a great diversity of
opinion among interpreters respecting the first clause of this verse. The
translators of the Septuagint version, thinking the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wlyjy</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
yachilu, </i>which is in the future tense, derived from the root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chalal, </i>which it is not, have rendered it, <i>his ways are defiled.
</i>But it is agreed among the Jewish expositors, that it is derived from the
root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chol. </i>Many among them, however, take it actively for <i>to put one in
fear, </i>or <i>to put one to trouble, </i>as if it had been said, The ways of
the ungodly are dreadful to the good, and torment them.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa188</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some also apply the words to God, reading the sentence thus, <i>His ways come,
</i>that is to say, <i>have their course, </i>or <i>prosper at all times.
</i>This, however, in my judgment, is too forced. But as this word, in other
texts of Scripture, means <i>to be prosperous, </i>I am surprised that there
should be any difference of opinion among the learned concerning this passage,
when immediately, in the next clause, the prophet clearly shows that he is
speaking of the prosperous condition of the ungodly, and the continued course of
pleasure which intoxicates them. He not only complains of this their prosperity,
but from it he aggravates their guilt, in that they take occasion, from the
goodness of God, to harden themselves in their wickedness. I would, therefor
explain the verse thus:As they enjoy a continued course of prosperity, they
dream that God is bound or plighted to them, and hence they put his judgments
far from them; and if any man oppose them, they are confident they can
immediately put him down, or dash him to pieces with a puff or breath. Now, we
understand the simple meaning of the prophet to be, that the ungodly mock God,
taking encouragement from his forbearance; as that base tyrant, Dionysius,
because he had a prosperous voyage, after having plundered the temple of
Proserpine,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa189</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> boasted that God favored the
sacrilegious.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it is, that they put far from
them the judgments of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the opinion of
some, these words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On high are
thy judgments before him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>mean much the
same thing as if the prophet had said, God treats them with too much clemency,
and spares them; just as he elsewhere complains of their being exempted from the
common afflictions of life. But this interpretation does not so well agree with
the words; yea, it appears to be unnatural and forced.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The judgments of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then are said <i>to be on high to
the ungodly, </i>because, presuming upon the great distance of God from
them,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa191</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they promise themselves not only a
truce with death during their whole life, but also an everlasting covenant with
it. We see how, by procrastinating the evil day, they harden themselves, and
become more and more obstinate in
evil;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa192</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yea, persuading themselves that God is
shut up in heaven, as if they had nothing to do with him, they strengthen
themselves in the hope of escaping
unpunished;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa193</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as we see them, in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
22:13) jesting at the threatenings of the prophets, saying, "Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we shall die." When the prophets, in order to inspire the
people with terror, denounced the dreadful vengeance of God, which was ready to
be inflicted upon them, these wicked men cried out that it was all whims or idle
stories. God therefore bitterly inveighs against them, because, when he called
the people to mourning, ashes, and sackcloth, these mockers encouraged them to
minstrelsy and feasting; and at length he swears, "As I live, surely this
iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die." The faithful, indeed, lift
up their eyes to heaven to behold the judgments of God; and they are not less
afraid of them than if they were just ready to fall upon their heads. The
ungodly, on the contrary, despise them, and yet, in order not to be disturbed or
tormented with the fear or apprehension of them, they would banish them into
heaven; just as the Epicureans, although they did not presume avowedly to deny
the existence of a God, yet imagined that he is confined to heaven, where he
indulges himself in idleness, without taking any concern about what is done here
below.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

phuach, </i>which sometimes signifies <i>to ensnare, </i>is here more properly
taken for <i>to puff, </i>or <i>to blow
out.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist confirms these statements
in the next verse, where he tells us that the persons of whom he speaks are
fully persuaded in their hearts that they are beyond all danger of change.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saith in his heart, I shall
not be moved from generation to generation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The ungodly often pour forth proud language to this effect. David, however,
only touches the hidden ulcer of their vile arrogance, which they cherish in
their own breasts, and therefore he does not say what they speak with their
mouth, but what they persuade themselves of in their hearts. It may here be
asked, Why does David blame in others what he professes concerning himself in so
many places?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for trusting to the protection of God,
he courageously triumphs over all
dangers.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And surely it becomes the children of
God effectually to provide for their safety, so that, although the world should
a hundred times fall into ruins, they may have the comfortable assurance that
they will remain unmoved. The answer to this question is easy, and it is this,
The faithful promise themselves security in God, and no where else; and yet
while they do this, they know themselves to be exposed to all the storms of
affliction, and patiently submit to them. There is a very great difference
between a despiser of God who, enjoying prosperity today, is so forgetful of the
condition of man in this world, as through a distempered imagination to build
his nest above the clouds, and who persuades himself that he shall always enjoy
comfort and repose,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa197</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; there is a very great
difference between him and the godly man, who, knowing that his life hangs only
by a thread, and is encompassed by a thousand deaths, and who, ready to endure
any kind of afflictions which shall be sent upon him, and living in the world as
if he were sailing upon a tempestuous and dangerous sea, nevertheless, bears
patiently all his troubles and sorrows, and comforts himself in his afflictions,
because he leans wholly upon the grace of God, and entirely confides in
it.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The ungodly man says, I shall not be
moved, or I shall not shake for ever; because he thinks himself sufficiently
strong and powerful to bear up against all the assaults which shall be made upon
him. The faithful man says, What although I may happen to be moved, yea, even
fall and sink into the lowest depths? my fall will not be fatal, for God will
put his hand under me to sustain me. By this, in like manner, we are furnished
with an explanation of the different effects which an apprehension of danger has
upon the good and the bad. Good men may tremble and sink into despondency, but
this leads them to flee with all haste to the sanctuary of God's
grace;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa199</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whereas the ungodly, while they are
affrighted even at the noise of a falling
leaf,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and live in constant uneasiness,
endeavor to harden themselves in their stupidity, and to bring themselves into
such a state of giddy frenzy, that being, as it were, carried out of themselves,
they may not feel their calamities. The cause assigned for the confidence with
which the prosperous ungodly man persuades himself that no change shall come
upon him is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he is not in
adversity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This admits of two senses. It
either means, that the ungodly, because they have been exempted from all
calamity and misery during the past part of their life, entertain the hope of a
peaceful and joyful state in the time to come; or it means, that through a
deceitful imagination they exempt themselves from the common condition of men;
just as in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15) they say,</font><br></div>

<b>8.</b> He will sit in the ensnaring places of the villages; in his lurking
places will he murder the innocent:his eyes will take their aim against the
poor. <b>9.</b> He will lie in wait secretly, as a lion in his den; he will lie

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His mouth is full of
cursing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The scope of these four verses
is this:If God intends to succor his servants, it is now a proper time for doing
so, inasmuch as the lawlessness of the ungodly has burst forth to the utmost
possible excess. In the first place, he complains that their tongues are full of
perjuries and deceits, and that they carry or hide mischief and wrongs, it being
impossible to have any dealings with them in any matter without loss and damage.
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
alah, </i>which some render <i>cursing, </i>does not signify the execrations
which they throw out against others, but rather those which they call down upon
their own heads:for they do not scruple to utter the most awful imprecations
against themselves, that thereby they may the better succeed in deceiving
others. It is, therefore, not improperly rendered by some, <i>perjury, </i>for
this word ought to be joined to the other two, <i>deceit and malice. </i>Thus
the wicked are described as cursing or swearing falsely, so far as it
contributes to forward their purposes of deceiving and doing injury. Hence
follow mischief and injustice, because it is impossible for the simple, without
suffering detriment, to escape their snares, which are woven of deceits,
perjuries, and malice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>

places of the villages.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa202</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have purposely avoided changing the
verbs of the future tense into another tense, because they imply a continued
act, and also because this Hebrew idiom has extended even to other languages.
David, therefore, describes what ungodly men are accustomed to do. And, in the
first place, he compares them to highwaymen, who lie in wait at the narrow parts
of roads, and choose for themselves hiding-places from which they may fall upon
travelers when off their guard. He says also, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their eyes are bent or
leering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa203</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by a<i> </i>similitude borrowed from
the practice of dart-shooters, who take their aim with leering, or half shut
eyes, in order to hit the mark the surer. Nor does he here speak of the common
sort of highwaymen who are in the
woods;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but he directs his language against
those great robbers who hide their wickedness under titles of honor, and pomp,
and splendor. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrxj</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
chatserim, </i>therefore, which we have rendered <i>villages, </i>is by some
translated palaces; as if David had said, they have converted their royal
mansions into places of robbery, where they may cut the throats of their unhappy
victims. But granting the word to have this allusion, I consider that it refers
principally to the practice of robbers, to which there is a reference in the
whole verse, and I explain it thus:Like as robbers lie in wait at the egresses
of villages, so these persons lay their snares wherever they
are.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse, he sets forth their
cruelty in a light still more aggravated, by another comparison, saying, that
they thirst for their prey </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like
lions in their dens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, it is a step
higher in wickedness to equal in cruelty wild beasts than to make havoc after
the manner of robbers. It is worthy of remark, that he always joins deceits and
snares with violence, in order the better to show how miserable the children of
God would be, unless they were succoured by help from heaven. There is also
added another similitude, which expresses more clearly how craft in catching
victims is mingled with cruelty.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They catch
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he but it is by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drawing them into their
net</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he means, that they
not only rush upon them with open force and violence, but that, at the same time
also, they spread their nets in order to
deceive.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He again repeats all this in the tenth
verse, giving a beautiful and graphic description of the very mien or gesture of
such wicked men, just as if he set before our eyes a picture of them.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They crouch
low</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and cast themselves
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa205</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they may not, by their cruelty,
frighten away their victims to a distance; for they would fain catch in their
entanglements those whom they cannot hurt without coming close to them. We see
how he joins these two things together, first snares or gins, and then sudden
violence, as soon as the prey has fallen into their hands. For, by the second
clause, he means, that whenever they see the simple to be fully in their power,
they rush upon them by surprise with a savage violence, just as if a lion should
furiously rise from his couch to tear in pieces his
prey.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa206</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The obvious meaning of the Psalmist is,
that the ungodly are to be dreaded on all sides, because they dissemble their
cruelty, till they find those caught in their toils whom they wish to devour.
There is some obscurity in the words, to which we shall briefly advert. In the
clause which we have rendered <i>an
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>army of the
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yaklj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chelcaim, an army, </i>in the opinion of some, is a word of four
letters.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those, however, think more accurately
who hold it to be compound, and equivalent to two
words.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa208</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although, therefore, the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>naphal, </i>is in the singular number, yet the prophet, doubtless, uses
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">XXX</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chel caim, </i>collectively, to denote a great company of people who are
afflicted by every one of these lions. I have rendered
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yak
lj</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> atsumim, his strengths, </i>as if it were a
substantive; because the prophet, doubtless, by this term, intends the talons
and teeth of the lion, in which the strength of that beast chiefly consists. As,
however, the word is properly an adjective in the plural number, signifying
<i>strong, </i>without having any substantive with which it agrees, we may
reasonably suppose that, by the talons and teeth of the lion, he means to
express metaphorically a powerful body of soldiers. In short, the meaning is
this:These wicked men hide their strength, by feigned humility and crafty
courteous demeanour, and yet they will always have in readiness an armed band of
satellites, or claws and teeth, as soon as an opportunity of doing mischief is
presented to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
10:11-13	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b> He hath said in his

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath said in his
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist again points out the
source from which the presumption of the ungodly proceeds. Because God seems to
take no notice of their wicked practices, they flatter themselves with the hope
of escaping unpunished. As, however, they do not openly utter with their mouth
the detestable blasphemy, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God hath forgotten their conduct,
and hath shut his eyes that he may never see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
it, </i>but hide their thoughts in the deep recesses of their own hearts, as
Isaiah declares,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:15) the Psalmist uses the same form of expression which he used before, and
which he repeats a little after the third time, namely, that the ungodly say to
themselves, in their hearts, that God takes no concern whatever in the affairs
of men. And it is to be observed, that the ungodly, when all things happen to
them according to their wishes, form such a judgment of their prosperity as to
persuade themselves that God is in a manner bound or obliged to
them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa209</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whence it comes to pass, that they live
in a state of constant security,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa210</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because they do not reflect, that after
God has long exercised patience towards them, they will undergo a solemn
reckoning, and that their condemnation will be the more terrible, the greater
the long-suffering of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, O
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a disease under which men
in general labor, to imagine, according to the judgment of the flesh, that when
God does not execute his judgments, he is sitting idle, or lying at ease. There
is, however, a great difference with respect to this between the faithful and
the wicked. The latter cherish the false opinion which is dictated by the
weakness of the flesh, and in order to soothe and flatter themselves in their
vices, they indulge in slumbering, and render their conscience
stupid,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa211</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> until at length, through their wicked
obstinacy, they harden themselves into a gross contempt of God. But the former
soon shake from their minds that false imagination, and chastise themselves,
returning of their own accord to a due consideration of what is the truth on
this subject.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa212</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Of this we have here set before us a
striking example. By speaking of God after the manner of men, the prophet
declares that the same error which he has just now condemned in the despisers of
God had gradually stolen in upon his own mind. But he proceeds at once to
correct it, and resolutely struggles with himself, and restrains his mind from
forming such conceptions of God, as would reflect dishonor upon his
righteousness and glory. It is therefore a temptation to which all men are
naturally prone, to begin to doubt of the providence of God, when his hand and
judgment are not seen. The godly, however, differ widely from the wicked. The
former, by means of faith, check this apprehension of the flesh; while the
latter indulge themselves in their froward imagination. Thus David, by the word
<i>Arise, </i>does not so much stir up God, as he awakens himself, or endeavors
to awaken himself, to hope for more of the assistance of God than he presently
experienced. Accordingly, this verse contains the useful doctrine, that the more
the ungodly harden themselves, through their slothful ignorance, and endeavor to
persuade themselves that God takes no concern about men and their affairs, and
will not punish the wickedness which they commit, the more should we endeavor to
be persuaded of the contrary; yes, rather their ungodliness ought to incite us
vigorously to repel the doubts which they not only admit, but studiously frame
for themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why doth the wicked despise
God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is, indeed, superfluous to bring
arguments before God, for the purpose of persuading him to grant us what we ask;
but still he permits us to make use of them, and to speak to him in prayer, as
familiarly as a son speaks to an earthly father. It should always be observed,
that the use of praying is, that God may be the witness of all our affections;
not that they would otherwise be hidden from him, but when we pour out our
hearts before him, our cares are hereby greatly lightened, and our confidence of
obtaining our requests increases. Thus David, in the present passage, by setting
before himself how unreasonable and intolerable it would be for the wicked to be
allowed to despise God according to their pleasure, thinking he will never bring
them to an account,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa213</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was led to cherish the hope of
deliverance from his calamities. The word which is here rendered <i>despise,
</i>is the same as that which he had used before. Some translate it <i>to
provoke, </i>and others <i>to blaspheme. </i>But the signification which I have
preferred certainly agrees much better with the context; for when persons take
from God the power and office of judging, this is ignominiously to drag him from
his throne, and to degrade him, as it were, to the station of a private
individual.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa214</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Moreover, as David had a little before
complained that the ungodly deny the existence of a God, or else imagine him to
be constantly asleep, having no care about mankind, so now he complains to the
same purpose that they say, <i>God will not require
it.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
10:14-15	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14. </b>Thou hast seen it; for
thou considerest mischief and
vexation,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa215</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that thou mayest take the matter into
thine own hand:upon thee shall the poor leave, for thou wilt be the helper of
the fatherless. <b>15.</b> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man;
thou shalt seek his wickedness, and shalt not find
it.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast seen it; for thou,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here David, suddenly kindled with a
holy zeal, enters into conflict, and, armed with the shield of faith,
courageously repels these execrable opinions; but as he could derive no
advantage by making his appeal to men, he has recourse to God, and addresses
him. As the ungodly, in the hope of enjoying unrestrained license in the
commission of all kinds of wickedness, withdraw to the greatest possible
distance from God,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa216</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and through the dictates of a perverse
mind, imagine themselves to be far beyond his reach; so, on the contrary, the
faithful ought carefully to keep themselves aloof from those wild opinions,
which are afloat in the world, and with minds lifted upward, to speak to God as
if present with them. Accordingly, David, in order to prevent himself from being
overcome by the blasphemies of men, very properly turns away his attention from
them. There is added a reason in confirmation of the first sentence of the
verse, namely, because <i>God
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>considers mischief and
vexation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Since it is the peculiar
province of God to take cognisance of all wrongs, David concludes that it is
impossible for God to shut his eyes when the ungodly are recklessly and without
restraint committing their outrages. Moreover, he descends from the general to
the particular, which ought to be attentively marked:for nothing is easier than
to acknowledge in general terms that God exercises a care about the world, and
the affairs of men; but it is very difficult to apply this doctrine to its
various uses in every-day life. And yet, all that the Scripture says concerning
the power and righteousness of God will be of no advantage to us, and, as it
were, only matter of meagre
speculation,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa217</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> unless every one apply these statements
to himself, as his necessity may require. Let us therefore learn, from the
example of David, to reason thus:that, since it belongs to God to take notice of
all the mischief and injuries which are inflicted on the good and simple, He
considers our trouble and sorrows even when he seems for a time to take no
notice of them. The Psalmist also adds, that God does not look down from heaven
upon the conduct of men here below as an idle and unconcerned spectator, but
that it is his work to pass judgment upon it; for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to take the matter into his own
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is nothing else than duly and
effectually to examine and determine it as a
judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is, however, our duty to wait
patiently so long as vengeance is reserved in the hand of God, until he stretch
forth his arm to help us. We see, therefore, the reason why it is immediately
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon thee shall the poor
leave.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words David means, that
we ought to give the providence of God time to manifest itself. The godly, when
they are afflicted, may with confidence cast their cares into his bosom, and
commit themselves to his protection. They ought not, however, to be in haste for
the accomplishment of their wishes; but, being now disburdened, they should take
their breath till God manifestly declare that the fit time of interfering in
their behalf is come. The man, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>leaves upon
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who betakes himself to his
protection, and who, fully persuaded of his faithfulness in keeping what is
entrusted to him, quietly waits till the fit time of his deliverance come. Some
read the verb passively, <i>The poor shall be left upon thee. </i>The first
reading, however, is more correct, and it agrees with the rules of grammar; only
it is a defective form of expression, inasmuch as the thing which the poor
leaves is not expressed. But this defect is common in Hebrew; and there is no
obscurity in the thing itself, namely, that, when the godly commit themselves
and their concerns to God by prayer, their prayers will not be in vain; for
these two clauses are closely connected,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon thee shall the poor
leave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be a helper to the
fatherless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By a metaphor he terms the
person fatherless whom he had in the preceding clause called poor. And the verb
being in the future tense denotes a continued
act.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Break thou the
arm.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This form of expression just means
breaking the power of the wicked. And it is not simply a prayer; it may also be
regarded as a prophecy. As the ungovernable fury of our enemies very often makes
us lose courage, as if there were no means by which it could be restrained,
David, in order to support his faith, and preserve it from failing through the
fears which presented themselves, sets before himself the consideration, that
whenever it shall please God to break the power of the ungodly, he will bring to
nothing both themselves and all their schemes. To make the meaning the more
evident, the sentence may be explained in this way, &#8212; Lord, as soon as it
shall seem good to thee to break the arm of the wicked, thou wilt destroy him in
a moment, and bring to nought his powerful and violent efforts in the work of
doing mischief. David, indeed, beseeches God to hasten his assistance and his
vengeance; but, in the meantime, while these are withheld, he sustains himself
by the consolatory reflection, that the ungodly cannot break forth into violence
and mischief except in so far as God permits them; since it is in his power,
whenever he ascends into the judgment-seat, to destroy them even with his look
alone. And certainly, as the rising sun dissipates the clouds and vapours by his
heat, and clears up the dark air, so God, when he stretches forth his hand to
execute the office of a Judge, restores to tranquillity and order all the
troubles and confusions of the world. The Psalmist calls the person of whom he
speaks not only <i>wicked, </i>but <i>the wicked and the evil man, </i>and he
does so, in my judgment, for the purpose of setting forth in a stronger light
the greatness of the wickedness of the character which he describes. His words
are as if he had said, Wicked men may even be frantic in their malice and
impiety; but God can promptly and effectually remedy this evil whenever he
pleases.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

short, he reigns, not for himself in particular; it is for us that he reigns for

long delay cannot hinder him from stretching forth his hand in due season to
succor his people, even when they are, as it were, dead, or in a condition

land was at length purged from the abominations and impurities with which it had
been polluted. It was a dreadful profanation, when the land which had been given
for an inheritance to the people of God, and allotted to those who purely
worshipped him, nourished ungodly and wicked inhabitants. By <i>the heathen

that they belonged to the people of God, just as at this day many, who are
Christians only in name, occupy a place in the bosom of the Church. It is no new
thing for the prophets to call apostates, who have degenerated from the virtues
and holy lives of their fathers, by the reproachful name of <i>heathen, </i>and
to compare them not only to the uncircumcised, but also to the Canaanites, who
were the most detestable among all the heathen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Many other similar passages are to be met with in
Scripture. David, therefore, in applying the dishonorable name of <i>heathen
</i>to the false and bastard children of Abraham, gives God thanks for having
expelled such a corrupt class out of his Church. By this example we are taught,
that it is no new thing if we see in our own day the Church of God polluted by
profane and irreligious men. We ought, however, to beseech God quickly to purge
his house, and not leave his holy temple exposed to the desecration of swine and
dogs, as if it were a dunghill.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah, thou hast heard
the desire of the needy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words
the prophet confirms what I have just now said, that when hypocrites prevail in
the Church, or exceed the faithful in number, we ought, unceasingly, to beseech
God to root them out; for such a confused and shameful state of things ought
surely to be matter of deep grief to all the true servants of God. By these
words, also, the Holy Spirit assures us, that what of old God granted to the
fathers in answer to their prayers, we at the present day will obtain, provided
we have that anxious solicitude about the deliverance of the Church which we
ought to entertain. The clause which follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt direct their
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is variously interpreted by
expositors. Some think it signifies the same thing, as if it had been said, Thou
wilt give success to their desires. According to others, the meaning is, Thou
wilt frame and sanctify their hearts by thy grace, that they may ask nothing in
prayer but what is right and according to the divine will, as Paul teaches us
that the Holy Spirit</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:26)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Both these expositions are perhaps too forced. David,
in this clause, magnifies the grace of God in sustaining and comforting his
servants in the midst of their troubles and distresses, that they may not sink
into despondency, &#8212; in furnishing them with fortitude and patience, - in
inspiring them with good hope, - and in stirring them up also to prayer. This is
the import of the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;yk</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
Kin, </i>which signifies not only <i>to direct, </i>but also <i>to establish.
</i>It is a singular blessing which God confers upon us, when, in the midst of
temptation, he upholds our hearts, and does not suffer them to recede from him,
or to turn aside to any other quarter for support and deliverance. The meaning
of the clause which immediately follows, <i>Thou wilt cause thine ear to hear,
</i>is, that it is not in vain that God directs the hearts of his people, and
leads them, in obedience to his command, to look to Himself, and to call upon
him in hope and patience &#8212; it is not in vain, because his ears are never
shut against their groanings. Thus the mutual harmony between two religious
exercises is here commended. God does not suffer the faith of his servants to
faint or fail, nor does he suffer them to desist from praying; but he keeps them
near him by faith and prayer, until it actually appear that their hope has been
neither vain nor ineffectual. The sentence might, not improperly, be rendered
thus:Thou shalt establish their heart, until thine ear hear
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou mayest
judge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist applies the
last sentence of the preceding verse to a special purpose, namely, to prevent
the faithful, when they are unjustly oppressed, from doubting that God will at
length take vengeance on their enemies, and grant them deliverance. By these
words he teaches us, that we ought to bear with patience and fortitude the
crosses and afflictions which are laid upon us, since God often withholds
assistance from his servants until they are reduced to extremity. This is,
indeed, a duty of difficult performance, for we would all desire to be entirely
exempted from trouble; and, therefore, if God does not quickly come to our
relief, we think him remiss and inactive. But if we are anxiously desirous of
obtaining his assistance, we must subdue our passion, restrain our impatience,
and keep our sorrows within due bounds, waiting until our afflictions call forth
the exercise of his compassion, and excite him to manifest his grace in
succouring us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the man
who is of earth may no more terrify them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>David again commends the power of God in destroying the ungodly; and he does
it for this purpose, - that in the midst of their tumultuous assaults we may
have this principle deeply fixed in our minds, that God, whenever he pleases,
can bring all their attempts to nothing. Some understand the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#732;ra</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
arots, </i>which we have translated <i>to terrify, </i>as neuter, and read the
words thus, &#8212;<i> that mortal man may be no more afraid. </i>But it agrees
better with the scope of the passage to render it transitively, as we have done.
And although the wicked prosper in their wicked course, and lift up their heads
above the clouds, there is much truth in describing them as <i>mortal, </i>or
<i>men liable to many calamities. </i>The design of the Psalmist is indirectly
to condemn their infatuated presumption, in that, forgetful of their condition,
they breathe out cruel and terrible threatenings, as if it were beyond the power
of even God himself to repress the violence of their rage. The phrase, <i>of
earth, </i>contains a tacit contrast between the low abode of this world and the
height of heaven. For whence do they go forth to assault the children of God?
Doubtless, from the earth, just as if so many worms should creep out of the
crevices of the ground; but in so doing, they attack God himself, who promises
help to his servants from heaven.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
11.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm consists of two parts. In the first part,
David recounts the severe assaults of temptation which he had encountered, and
the state of distressing anxiety to which he had been reduced during the time of
his persecution by Saul. In the second, he congratulates himself on the
deliverance which God had granted him, and magnifies the righteousness of God in
the government of the world.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In Jehovah do I put my
trust.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Almost all interpreters think
that this is a complaint which David brings against his countrymen, that while
seeking in every quarter for hiding-places, he could find nowhere even common
humanity. And it is indeed true, that in the whole course of his wanderings,
after betaking himself to flight to escape the cruelty of Saul, he could find no
secure place of retreat, at least, none where he might continue for any length
of time undisturbed. He might, therefore, justly complain of his own countrymen,
in that none of them deigned to shelter him when he was a fugitive. But I think
he has a respect to something higher. When all men were striving, as it were,
with each other, to drive him to despair, he must, according to the weakness of
the flesh, have been afflicted with great and almost overwhelming distress of
mind; but fortified by faith, he confidently and steadfastly leaned on the
promises of God, and was thus preserved from yielding to the temptations to
which he was exposed. These spiritual conflicts, with which God exercised him in
the midst of his extreme perils, he here recounts. Accordingly, as I have just
now observed, the psalm should be divided into two parts. Before celebrating the
righteousness of God, which he displays in the preservation of the godly, the
Psalmist shows how he had encountered even death itself, and yet, through faith
and an upright conscience, had obtained the victory. As all men advised him to
leave his country, and retire into some place of exile, where he might be
concealed, inasmuch as there remained for him no hope of life, unless he should
relinquish the kingdom, which had been promised to him; in the beginning of the
psalm, he opposes to this perverse advice the shield of his trust in
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But before entering farther upon the
subject, let us interpret the words. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nud, </i>which we have rendered <i>to flee, </i>is written in the plural
number, and yet it is read in the
singular;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but, in my opinion, this is a corrupt
reading. As David tells us that this was said to himself only, the Jewish
doctors, thinking the plural number unsuitable, have taken it upon them to read
the word in the singular. Some of them, wishing to retain the literal sense as
it is called, perplex themselves with the question, why it is said, <i>Flee ye,
</i>rather than <i>Flee thou; </i>and, at length, they have recourse to a very
meagre subtilty, as if those who counselled him to betake himself to flight
addressed both his soul and his body. But it was unnecessary labor to put
themselves to so much trouble in a matter where there is no difficulty; for it
is certain that those who counselled David did not say that he alone should
flee, but that he should flee, together with all his attendants, who were in the
same danger with himself. Although, therefore, they addressed themselves
especially to David, yet they included his companions, who had a common cause
with him, and were exposed to the like danger. Expositors, also, differ in their
interpretation of what follows. Many render it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from your
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if it were
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;krhm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meharkem; </i>and, according to them, there is a change of person, because
those who spoke to him must have said, <i>flee thou from </i>Our<i> mountain.
</i>But this is harsh and strained. Nor does it appear to me that they have any
more reason on their side, when they say that Judea is here called mountain.
Others think we should read </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwpx
wmk rh</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>har kemo
tsippor,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa224</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is, <i>into the mountain as a
bird, </i>without a pronoun.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa225</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if we follow what I have said, it
will agree very well with the scope of the passage to read thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee ye into your
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for you are not permitted to
dwell in your own country. I do not, however, think that any particular mountain
is pointed out, but that David was sent away to the desert rocks wherever chance
might lead him. Condemning those who gave him this advice, he declares that he
depends upon the promise of God, and is not at all disposed thus to go away into
exile. Such, then, was the condition of David, that, in his extreme necessity,
all men repelled and chased him far away into desert
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But as he seems to intimate that it
would be a sign of distrust were he to place his safety in flight, it may be
asked, whether or not it would have been lawful for him to flee; yea, we know
that he was often forced to retire into exile, and driven about from place to
place, and that he even sometimes hid himself in caves. I answer, it is true he
was unsettled like a poor fearful bird, which leaps from branch to
branch,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa226</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and was compelled to seek for different
bypaths, and to wander from place to place to avoid the snares of his enemies;
yet still his faith continued so steadfast that he never alienated himself from
the people of God. Others accounted him a lost man, and one whose affairs were
in a hopeless condition, setting no more value upon him than if he had been a
rotten limb,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa227</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet he never separated himself from the
body of the Church. And certainly these words, <i>Flee ye, </i>tended only to
make him yield to utter despair. But it would have been wrong for him to have
yielded to these fears, and to have betaken himself to flight, as if uncertain
of what would be the issue. He therefore says expressly, that this <i>was spoken
to his soul, </i>meaning that his heart was deeply pierced by such an
ignominious rejection, since he saw (as I have said) that it tended only to
shake and to weaken his faith. In short, although he had always lived
innocently, as it became a true servant of God, yet these malignant men would
have doomed him to remain for ever in a state of exile from his native country.
This verse teaches us, that however much the world may hate and persecute
us,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa228</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we ought nevertheless to continue
steadfast at our post, that we may not deprive ourselves of a right to lay claim
to the promises of God, or that these may not slip away from us; and that,
however much and however long we may be harassed, we ought always to continue
firm and unwavering in the faith of our having the call of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely, behold! the
ungodly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that this is added
as the excuse made by those who desired David to save himself by flight.
According to others, David expostulates with his countrymen, who saw death
menacing him on all sides, and yet denied him shelter. But, in my judgment, he
here continues his account of the trying circumstances in which he was placed.
His design is not only to place before our view the dangers with which he was
surrounded, but to show us that he was exposed even to death itself. He
therefore says, that wherever he might hide himself, it was impossible for him
to escape from the hands of his enemies. Now, the description of so miserable a
condition illustrates the more strikingly the grace of God in the deliverance
which he afterwards granted him. With respect to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have fixed their arrows upon
the string</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, to </i>Shoot Secretly, or <i>in
darkness, </i>some understand them metaphorically of the attempts which David's
enemies made to surprise him by craft and snares. I, however, prefer this
interpretation, as being more simple, - that there was no place so hidden into
which the darts of his enemies did not penetrate, and that, therefore, to
whatever caves he could betake himself for concealment and shelter, death would
follow him as his inseparable
attendant.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Truly, the foundations are
destroyed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some translate the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twt&ccedil;h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hashathoth, </i>by <i>nets, </i>a sense in which the Scripture in other
places often uses this word; and their explanation of the words is, that the
wicked and deceitful arts which the ungodly practiced against David were
defeated. If we admit this interpretation, the meaning of what he adds
immediately after, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What hath the
righteous one done</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>will be, that his
escape in safety was owing neither to his own exertion, nor to his own skill,
but that, without putting forth any effort, and when, as it were, he was asleep,
he had been delivered from the nets and snares of his enemies by the power of
God. But the word<i> foundations </i>agrees better with the scope of the
passage, for he evidently proceeds to relate into what straits he had been
brought and shut up, so that his preservation was now to all appearance
hopeless. Interpreters, however, who hold that <i>foundations </i>is the proper
translation of the word, are not agreed as to the sense. Some explain it, that
he had not a single spot on which to fix his foot; others, that covenants which
ought to have stability, by being faithfully kept, had been often shamefully
violated by Saul. Some also understand it allegorically, as meaning that the
righteous priests of God, who were the pillars of the land, had been put to
death. But I have no doubt of its being a metaphor taken from buildings, which
must fall down and become a heap of ruins when their foundations are undermined;
and thus David complains, that, in the eyes of the world, he was utterly
overthrown, inasmuch as all that he possessed was completely destroyed. In the
last clause, he again repeats, that to be persecuted so cruelly was what he did
not deserve:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What hath the
righteous one done?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And he asserts his
own innocence, partly to comfort himself in his calamities from the testimony of
a good conscience, and partly to encourage himself in the hope of obtaining
deliverance. That which encouraged him to trust in God was the belief which he
entertained, that on account of the justice of his cause God was on his side,
and would be favorable to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is in the palace of
his holiness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In what follows, the
Psalmist glories in the assurance of the favor of God, of which I have spoken.
Being destitute of human aid, he betakes himself to the providence of God. It is
a signal proof of faith, as I have observed elsewhere, to take and to borrow, so
to speak,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa230</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> light from heaven to guide us to the
hope of salvation, when we are surrounded in this world with darkness on every
side. All men acknowledge that the world is governed by the providence of God;
but when there comes some sad confusion of things, which disturbs their ease,
and involves them in difficulty, there are few who retain in their minds the
firm persuasion of this truth. But from the example of David, we ought to make
such account of the providence of God as to hope for a remedy from his judgment,
even when matters are in the most desperate condition. There is in the words an
implied contrast between heaven and earth; for if David's attention had been
fixed on the state of things in this world, as they appeared to the eye of sense
and reason, he would have seen no prospect of deliverance from his present
perilous circumstances. But this was not David's exercise; on the contrary, when
in the world all justice lies trodden under foot, and faithfulness has perished,
he reflects that God sits in heaven perfect and unchanged, from whom it became
him to look for the restoration of order from this state of miserable confusion.
He does not simply say that God dwells in heaven; but that he reigns there, as
it were, in a royal palace, and has his throne of judgment there. Nor do we
indeed render to him the honor which is his due, unless we are fully persuaded
that his judgment-seat is a sacred sanctuary for all who are in affliction and
unrighteously oppressed. When, therefore, deceit, craft, treachery, cruelty,
violence, and extortion, reign in the world; in short, when all things are
thrown into disorder and darkness by injustice and wickedness, let faith serve
as a lamp to enable us to behold God's heavenly throne, and let that sight
suffice to make us wait in patience for the restoration of things to a better
state. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The temple of his
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>his holy temple,
</i>which is commonly taken for <i>Sion, </i>doubtless here signifies <i>heaven;
</i>and that it does so is clearly shown by the repetition in the next clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah has his throne in
Heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it is certain David
expresses the same thing
twice.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His eyes
behold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he infers, from the
preceding sentence, that nothing is hidden from God, and that, therefore, men
will be obliged to render up to him an account of all that they have done. If
God reigns in heaven, and if his throne is erected there, it follows that he
must necessarily attend to the affairs of men, in order one day to sit in
judgment upon them. Epicurus, and such like him as would persuade themselves
that God is idle, and indulges in repose in heaven, may be said rather to spread
for him a couch on which to sleep than to erect for him a throne of judgment.
But it is the glory of our faith that God, the Creator of the world, does not
disregard or abandon the order which he himself at first established. And when
he suspends his judgments for a time, it becomes us to lean upon this one truth
that he beholds from heaven; just as we now see David contenting himself with
this consolatory consideration alone, that God rules over mankind, and observes
whatever is transacted in the world, although his knowledge, and the exercise of
his jurisdiction, are not at first sight apparent. This truth is still more
clearly explained in what is immediately added in the fifth verse, that God
distinguishes between the righteous and the unrighteous, and in such a way as
shows that he is not an idle spectator; for he is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to approve the righteous, and to
hate the wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;jb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bachan, </i>which we have rendered <i>to approve, </i>often signifies <i>to
examine </i>or <i>try. </i>But in this passage I explain it as simply meaning,
that God so inquires into the cause of every man as to distinguish the righteous
from the wicked. It is farther declared, that God hates those who are set upon
the infliction of injuries, and upon doing mischief. As he has ordained mutual
intercourse between men, so he would have us to maintain it inviolable. In
order, therefore, to preserve this his own sacred and appointed order, he must
be the enemy of the wicked, who wrong and are troublesome to others. There is
also here contrasted God's hatred of the wicked, and wicked men's <i>love of
iniquity, </i>to teach us that those who please and flatter themselves in their
mischievous practices gain nothing by such flatteries, and only deceive
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

lays it down as a certain truth, that although God, for a time, may be still and
delay his judgments, yet the hour of vengeance will<i> </i>assuredly come. Thus
we see how by degrees he rises up to the hope of a happy issue to his present
affliction, and he uses his efforts to attain this, that the social and moral
disorder, which he saw prevailing around him, might not weaken his faith. As the
tribunal of God remains firm and immovable, he, in the first place, sustains and
comforts himself from the consideration, that God from on high beholds all that
is done here below. In the next place, he considers what the office of judge
requires, from which he concludes, that the actions of men cannot escape the
inspection of God's omniscient eye, and that although he does not immediately
punish their evil deeds, he hates all the wicked. Finally, he adds, that since
God is armed with power, this hatred will not be in vain or ineffectual. Thus
while God defers the infliction of punishment, the knowledge of his justice will
have a powerful influence in maintaining our faith, until he actually show that
he has never departed from his watch-tower, from which he beholds the actions of
men.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa233</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He appropriately compares the
punishments which God inflicts to rain. As rain is not constant, but the Lord
sends it forth when he pleases; and, when the weather is calmest and most
serene, suddenly raises a storm of hail or violent showers of rain; in like
manner, it is here intimated that the vengeance which will be inflicted on the
wicked will come suddenly, so that, when they shall be indulging in mirth, and
intoxicated with their pleasures, and "when they shall say, Peace and safety,
sudden destruction will come upon
them."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa234</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At the same time, David here evidently
alludes to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. As the prophets, when they
would promise the grace of God to the elect, remind them of the deliverance from
Egypt, which God wrought in behalf of his ancient people, so when they would
alarm the wicked, they threaten them with a destruction like that which befell
Sodom and Gomorrah, and they do so upon good grounds; since Jude, in his
Epistle, tells us that these cities "are<i> </i>set forth for an example,
suffering the vengeance of eternal fire,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;650107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jude
1:7) The Psalmist, with much beauty and propriety, puts
<i>snares</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

see that the ungodly, while God spares them, fear nothing, but give themselves
ample scope in their wayward courses, like horses let
loose</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa236</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in an open field; and then, if they see
any adversity impending over them, they devise for themselves ways of escape; in
short, they continually mock God, as if they could not be caught, unless he
first entangle and hold them fast in his snares. God, therefore, begins his
vengeance by snares, shutting up against the wicked every way of escape; and
when he has them entangled and bound, he thunders upon them dreadfully and
horribly, like as he consumed Sodom and the neighboring cities with fire from
heaven. The word

testifies that the judgments of God will certainly take effect, although ungodly
men may delude themselves by deceitful flattery. This metaphor is frequently to
be met with in the Scriptures. As the carnal mind believes nothing with greater
difficulty than that the calamities and miseries which seem to be fortuitous,
happen according to a just distribution from God, he represents himself under
the character of a householder, who distributes to each member his portion or
allowance. David, therefore, here intimates that there is certainly a reward
laid up for the ungodly; that it will be in vain for them to resist, when the
Lord shall reach to them the cup of his wrath to drink; and that the cup
prepared for them is not such as they may sip drop by drop, but a cup, the whole
of which they will be compelled to drink, as the prophet
threatens,</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the righteous Jehovah
loveth righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist has
just now reasoned from the office of God that he will punish the wicked, and
now, from the nature of God, he concludes, that he will be the defender of the
good and the upright. As he is righteous, David shows that, as the consequence
of this, he must love righteousness, for otherwise he would deny himself.
Besides, it would be a cold speculation to conceive of righteousness as inherent
in God, unless, at the same time, we could come to the settled conclusion that
God graciously owns whatever is his own, and furnishes evidence of this in the
government of the world. Some think that the abstract term <i>righteousness
</i>is put for <i>righteous persons. </i>But, in my opinion, the literal sense
is here more suitable, namely, that righteousness is well pleasing to God, and
that, therefore, he favors good causes. From this the Psalmist concludes, that
the upright are the objects of his
regard:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His countenance approveth
the upright</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had said a little before
in a different sense, that God beholds the children of men, meaning that he will
judge the life of every man; but here he means that God graciously exercises a
special care over the upright and the sincere, takes them under his protection,
and keeps them in perfect safety. This conclusion of the psalm sufficiently
shows, that the scope of the whole of it was to make it manifest that all those
who, depending upon the grace of God, sincerely follow after righteousness,
shall be safe under his protection. The Psalmist himself was one of this number
and, indeed, the very chief of them. This last clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His countenance approveth the
upright</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is, indeed, variously
explained; but the true meaning, I have no doubt, is, that God has always a
regard for the upright, and never turns away his eyes from them. It is a
strained interpretation to view the words as meaning that the upright shall
behold the face of God. But I will not stop to refute the opinions of other
men.</font><br></div>

faithfulness and constancy in performing his promises. From this he concludes,
that at length God will deliver the godly, even when the world may be in a state
of the greatest corruption.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

to the word <i>eighth, </i>there are two opinions among interpreters. According
to some, it means a musical instrument; while others are rather inclined to
think that it is a tune. But as it is of no great importance which of these
opinions is adopted, I do not trouble myself much about this matter. The
conjecture of some, that it was the beginning of a song, does not seem to me to
be so probable as that it refers to the tune, and was intended to point out how
the psalm was to be sung.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa240</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the commencement David complains
that the land was so overspread with wicked men, and persons who had broken
forth into the commission of every kind of wickedness, that the practice of
righteousness and justice had ceased, and none was found to defend the cause of
the good; in short, that there remained no longer either humanity or
faithfulness. It is probable that the Psalmist here speaks of the time when Saul
persecuted him, because then all, from the highest to the lowest, had conspired
to destroy an innocent and an afflicted man. It is a thing very distressing to
relate, and yet it was perfectly true, that righteousness was so utterly
overthrown among the chosen people of God, that all of them, with one consent,
from their hostility to a good and just cause, had broken forth into acts of
outrage and cruelty. David does not here accuse strangers or foreigners, but
informs us that this deluge of iniquity prevailed in the Church of God. Let the
faithful, therefore in our day, not be unduly discouraged at the melancholy
sight of a very corrupt and confused state of the world; but let them consider
that they ought to bear it patiently, seeing their condition is just like that
of David in time past. And it is to be observed, that, when David calls upon God
for succor, he encourages himself in the hope of obtaining it from this, that
there was no uprightness among men; so that from his example we may learn to
betake ourselves to God when we see nothing around us but black despair. We
ought to be fully persuaded of this, that the greater the confusion of things in
the world is, God is so much the readier to aid and succor his
people,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa241</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that it is then the most proper
season for him to interpose his
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The merciful man hath
failed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that this is a
complaint that the righteous had been unjustly put to death; as if the Psalmist
had said, Saul has cruelly cut off all who observed justice and faithfulness.
But I would understand the words in a simpler sense, as meaning that there is no
longer any beneficence or truth remaining among men. He has expressed in these
two words in what true righteousness consists. As there are two kinds of
unrighteousness, violence and deceit; so men live righteously when, in their
intercourse with each other, they conscientiously abstain from doing any wrong
or injury to one another, and cultivate peace and mutual friendship; when they
are neither lions nor foxes. When, however, we see the world in such a state of
disorder as is here described, and are afflicted thereby, we ought to be careful
not to howl with the wolves, nor to suffer ourselves to be carried away with the
dissipation and overflowing flood of iniquity which we see prevailing around us,
but should rather imitate the example of
David.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Every man speaketh deceit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David in this
verse sets forth that part of unrighteousness which is contrary to truth. He
says that there is no sincerity or uprightness in their speech, because the
great object upon which they are bent is to deceive. He next describes the
manner in which they deceive, namely, that every man endeavors to ensnare his
neighbor by <i>flattery</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa242</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He also points out the fountain and
first cause of this, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They speak
with a double heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This doubleness of
heart, as I may term it, makes men double and variable in their speech, in order
thereby to disguise themselves in different
ways,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or to make themselves appear to others
different from what they really are. Hence the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twqlj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chalakoth, </i>which denotes flattery, is derived from a word which signifies
<i>division. </i>As those who are resolved to act truthfully in their
intercourse with their neighbors, freely and ingenuously lay open their whole
heart; so treacherous and deceitful persons keep a part of their feeling hidden
within their own breasts, and cover it with the varnish of hypocrisy and a fair
outside; so that from their speech we cannot gather any thing certain with
respect to their intentions. Our speech, therefore, must be sincere in order
that it may be as it were a mirror, in which the uprightness of our heart may be
beheld.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
12:3-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> Let Jehovah cut off all
flattering tips, and the tongue that speaketh great [or proud] things:<b>4.</b>
Those who have said we will be strengthened by our tongues; our lips are in our
own power:who is lord over us ?	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">To his
complaint in the preceding verse he now subjoins an imprecation, that God would
cut off deceitful tongues. It is uncertain whether he wishes that deceitful men
may be utterly destroyed, or only that the means of doing mischief may be taken
from them; but the scope of the passage leads us rather to adopt the first
sense, and to view David as desiring that God, by some means or other, would
remove that plague out of the way. As he makes no mention of malice, while he
inveighs so vehemently against their envenomed tongues, we hence conclude, that
he had suffered much more injury from the latter than from the former; and
certainly falsehood and calumnies are more deadly than swords and all other kind
of weapons. From the second clause of the third verse it appears more clearly
what kind of flatterers they were of whom mention was made in the preceding
verse:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The tongue that speaketh
great or proud things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some flatter in a
slavish and fulsome manner, declaring that they are ready to do and suffer any
thing which they possibly can for our benefit. But David here speaks of another
kind of flatterers, namely, those who in flattering proudly boast of what they
will accomplish, and mingle base effrontery and threatening with their deceitful
arts. He does not, therefore, speak of the herd of mean conceited persons among
the common people who make a trade of flattering, that they may live at other
people's expense;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa244</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but he points his imprecation against
the great calumniators of the court to which he was
attached,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa245</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who not only insinuated themselves by
gentle arts, but also lied designedly in boasting of themselves, and in the big
and haughty discourse with which they overwhelmed the poor and
simple.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa246</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">This the Psalmist confirms more
fully in the following verse:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
have said, we will be strengthened by our
tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those must be possessed of
great authority who think that, in the very falsehood to which they are
addicted, they have enough of strength to accomplish their purposes, and to
protect themselves. It is the utmost height of wickedness for persons to break
out into such presumption, that they scruple not to overthrow all law and equity
by their arrogant and boasting language; for, in doing this, it is just as if
they openly declared war against God himself. Some read, <i>we will strengthen
our tongues. </i>This reading is passable, in so far as the sense is concerned,
but it scarcely agrees with the rules of grammar, because the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>is added. Moreover, the sense which is more suitable is this:that
the wicked persons spoken of being armed with their tongues, go beyond all
bounds, and think they can accomplish by this means whatever they please; just
as this set of men so deform every thing with their calumnies, that they would
almost cover the sun himself with
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because of the spoiling of
the needy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now sets before himself
as matter of consolation, the truth that God will not suffer the wicked thus to
make havoc without end and measure. The more effectually to establish himself
and others in the belief of this truth, he introduces God himself as speaking.
The expression is more emphatic when God is represented as coming forward and
declaring with his own mouth that he is come to deliver the poor and distressed.
There is also great emphasis in the adverb <i>now, </i>by which God intimates
that, although our safety is in his hand, and, therefore, in secure keeping, yet
he does not immediately grant deliverance from affliction; for his words imply
that he had hitherto been, as it were, lying still and asleep, until he was
awakened by the calamities and the cries of his people. When, therefore, the
injuries, the extortions, and the devastations of our enemies leave us nothing
but tears and groans, let us remember that now the time is at hand when God
intends to rise up to execute judgment. This doctrine should also serve to
produce in us patience, and prevent us from taking it ill, that we are reckoned
among the number of the poor and afflicted, whose cause God promises to take
into his own hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect to the meaning
of the second clause of the verse, expositors differ. According to some, <i>to
set in safety, </i>means the same thing as <i>to give or bring safety, </i>as if
the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
beth, </i>which signifies <i>in, </i>were superfluous. But the language rather
contains a promise to grant to those who are unjustly oppressed, full
restitution. What follows is attended with more difficulty. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwp</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
phuach, </i>which we have rendered <i>to lay snares for, </i>sometimes signifies
<i>to blow out, </i>or <i>to puff, </i>&#8212; at<i> </i>other times <i>to
ensnare, </i>or <i>to lay snares for; </i>and sometimes, also, to <i>speak.
</i>Those who think it is here put for <i>to speak </i>also differ among
themselves with respect to the meaning. Some render it <i>God will speak to
himself; </i>that is to say, God will determine with himself; but as the
Psalmist had already declared the determination of God, this would be an
unnecessary and vain repetition. Others refer it to the language of the godly,
as if David introduced them speaking one to another concerning the faithfulness
and stability of the promises of God; for with this word they connect the
following sentence, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The words of
the Lord are pure words, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But this
view is even more strained than the preceding. The opinion of others, who
suppose, that to the determination of God <i>to arise, </i>there is subjoined
the language which is addressed to the godly, is more admissible. It would not
be sufficient for God to determine with himself what he would do for our safety,
if he did not speak to us expressly, and by name. It is only when God makes us
to understand, by his own voice, that he will be gracious to us, that we can
entertain the hope of salvation. God, it is true, speaks also to unbelievers,
but without producing any good effect, seeing they are deaf; just as when he
treats them with gentleness and liberality, it is without effect, because they
are stupid, and devour his benefits without any sense of their coming from him.
But as I perceive that under the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rmay</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
yomar, will say, </i>the promises of God may be suitably and properly
comprehended, to avoid a repetition of the same thing, I adopt without
hesitation the sense of the last clause, which I have given in the translation,
namely, that God declares he will arise to restore to safety those who seem on
all sides to be environed by the snares of their enemies, and even caught in
them. The import of the language is this:The ungodly may hold the poor and
afflicted entangled in their snares as a prey which they have caught; but I will
set them in safety. If it should be replied, that the reading in the Hebrew is
not <i>for whom, </i>but <i>for him,</i> I would observe, that it is no new
thing for these words, <i>him, for him, </i>to be used instead of <i>whom
</i>and <i>for whom.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa249</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If any one prefer the sense of
<i>puffing at, </i>I am not disposed greatly to oppose him. According to this
reading, David would elegantly taunt the pride of the ungodly, who confidently
imagine they can do any thing,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa250</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> even with their breath, as we have seen
in the tenth psalm, at the fifth
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The words of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist now declares, that
God is sure, faithful, and steadfast in his promises. But the insertion by the
way of this commendation of the word of God would be to no purpose, if he had
not first called himself, and other believers, to meditate on God's promises in
their afflictions. Accordingly, the order of the Psalmist is to be attended to,
namely, that, after telling us how God gives to his servants the hope of speedy
deliverance, even in their deepest distresses, he now adds, to support their
faith and hope, that God promises nothing in vain, or for the purpose of
disappointing man. This, at first sight, seems a matter of small importance; but
if any person consider more closely and attentively how prone the minds of men
are to distrust and ungodly doubtings, he will easily perceive how requisite it
is for our faith to be supported by this assurance, that God is not deceitful,
that he does not delude or beguile us with empty words, and that he does not
magnify beyond all measure either his power or his goodness, but that whatever
he promises in word he will perform in deed. There is no man, it is true, who
will not frankly confess that he entertains the same conviction which David here
records, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the words of
Jehovah are pure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but those who while
lying in the shade and living at their ease liberally extol by their praises the
truth of God's word, when they come to struggle with adversity in good earnest,
although they may not venture openly to pour forth blasphemies against God,
often charge him with not keeping his word. Whenever he delays his assistance,
we call in question his fidelity to his promises and murmur just as if he had
deceived us. There is no truth which is more generally received among men than
that God is true; but there are few who frankly give him credit for this when
they are in adversity. It is, therefore, highly necessary for us to cut off the
occasion of our distrust; and whenever any doubt respecting the faithfulness of
God's promises steals in upon us, we ought immediately to lift up against it
this shield, that the words of the Lord are pure. The similitude of <i>silver,
</i>which the Psalmist subjoins, is indeed far below the dignity and excellence
of so great a subject; but it is very well adapted to the measure of our limited
and imperfect understanding. Silver, if thoroughly refined, is valued at a high
price amongst us. But we are far from manifesting for the word of God, the price
of which is inestimable, an equal regard; and its purity is of less account with
us than that of a corruptible metal. Yea, a great many coin mere dross in their
own brain, by which to efface or obscure the brightness which shines in the word
of God. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyl[b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ba&auml;lil, </i>which we have translated <i>crucible, </i>is interpreted by
many <i>prince, </i>or <i>lord, as if </i>it were a simple word. According to
them, the meaning would be, that the word of God is like the purest silver, from
which the dross has been completely removed with the greatest art and care, not
for common use, but for the service of a great lord or prince of some country.
I, however, rather agree with others who consider that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyl[b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ba&auml;lil, </i>is a word compounded of the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

the same time, I do not altogether disapprove of the interpretation which views
David as renewing his supplications at the throne of grace. Some give this
exposition of the passage, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou

them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt preserve

perhaps, we may say that, in the second, under the person of one man, the
Psalmist intends to point out the small number of good men. To suppose this is
not unreasonable or improbable; and, according to this view, the import of his
language is, Although only one good man should be left alive in the world, yet
he would be kept in perfect safety by the grace and protection of God. But as
the Jews, when they speak generally, often change the number, I leave my readers
freely to form their own judgment. This, indeed, cannot be controverted, that by
the word <i>generation, </i>or <i>race, </i>is denoted a great multitude of
ungodly persons, and almost the whole body of the people. As the Hebrew word

time itself, David, without doubt, here means that the servants of God cannot
escape, and continue safe, unless God defend them against the malice of the
whole people, and deliver them from the wicked and perverse men of the age in
which they live. Whence we learn that the world, at that time, was so corrupt,
that David, by way of reproach, puts them all, as it were, into one bundle.
Moreover, it is of importance again to remember what we have already stated,
that he does not here speak of foreign nations, but of the Israelites, and God's
chosen people. It is well to mark this carefully, that we may not be discouraged
by the vast multitude of the ungodly, if we should sometimes see an immense heap
of chaff upon the barn-floor of the Lord, while only a few grains of corn lie
hidden underneath. And then, however small may be the number of the good, let
this persuasion be deeply fixed in our minds, that God will be their protector,
and that for ever. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[l</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
leolam, </i>which signifies<i> for ever, </i>is added, that we may learn to
extend our confidence in God far into the future, seeing he commands us to hope
for succor from him, not only once, or for one day, but as long as the
wickedness of our enemies continues its work of mischief. We are,<i>
</i>however, from this passage, at the same time, admonished that war is not
prepared against us for a short time only, but that we must daily engage in the
conflict. And if the guardianship which God exercises over the faithful is
sometimes hidden, and is not manifest in its effects, let them wait in patience
until he arise; and the greater the flood of calamities which overflows them,
let them keep themselves so much the more in the exercise of godly fear and
solicitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>

circuit, </i>or <i>a going round; </i>and, therefore, some explain it
allegorically thus:the ungodly seize upon all the defiles or narrow parts of
roads, in order to shut up or besiege the good on all sides; and others expound
it even more ingeniously, thus:that they lay snares by indirect means, and by
inventions full of art and deception. But I think the simple meaning is, that
they possess the whole land, and range about through every part of it; as if the
Psalmist had said, Wherever I turn my eyes, I see troops of them on every side.
In the next clause he complains that mankind are shamefully and basely oppressed
by their tyranny. This is the meaning, provided the clause is read as a distinct
one by itself, separate from the preceding, a point about which interpreters
differ, although this view seems to come nearer to the mind of the inspired
writer. Some render the verse in one continuous sentence, thus:<i>The ungodly
fly about every where, when the reproaches among the children of men </i>(that
is to say, when the worthless and the refuse of men) <i>are exalted, </i>an
exposition which is not unsuitable. It commonly happens, that as diseases flow
from the head into the members, so corruptions proceed from princes, and infect
the whole people. As, however, the former exposition is more generally received,
and the most learned grammarians tell us that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twlz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zuluth, </i>which we have translated <i>reproach, </i>is a noun of the

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
13.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The subject of this psalm is almost the same as that
of the preceding. David, being afflicted, not only with the deepest distress,
but also feeling himself, as it were, overwhelmed by a long succession of
calamities and multiplied afflictions, implores the aid and succor of God, the
only remedy which remained for him; and, in the close, taking courage, he
entertains the assured hope of life from the promise of God, even amidst the
terrors of death.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long, O

so greatly hated by the generality of people, on account of the calumnies and
false reports which had been circulated against him, that almost all men judged
that God was not less hostile to him than
Saul</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa255</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and his other enemies were. But here he
speaks not so much according to the opinion of others, as according to the
feeling of his own mind, when he complains of being neglected by God. Not that
the persuasion of the truth of God's promises was extinguished in his heart, or
that he did not repose himself on his grace; but when we are for a long time
weighed down by calamities, and when we do not perceive any sign of divine aid,
this thought unavoidably forces itself upon us, that God has forgotten us. To
acknowledge in the midst of our afflictions that God has really a care about us,
is not the usual way with men, or what the feelings of nature would prompt; but
by faith we apprehend his invisible providence. Thus, it seemed to David, so far
as could be judged from beholding the actual state of his affairs, that he was
forsaken of God. At the same time, however, the eyes of his mind, guided by the
light of faith, penetrated even to the grace of God, although it was hidden in
darkness. When he saw not a single ray of good hope to whatever quarter he
turned, so far as human reason could judge, constrained by grief, he cries out
that God did not regard him; and yet by this very complaint he gives evidence
that faith enabled him to rise higher, and to conclude, contrary to the judgment
of the flesh, that his welfare was secure in the hand of God. Had it been
otherwise, how could he direct his groanings and prayers to him? Following this
example, we must so wrestle against temptations as to be assured by faith, even
in the very midst of the conflict, that the calamities which urge us to despair
must be overcome; just as we see that the infirmity of the flesh could not
hinder David from seeking God, and having recourse to him:and thus he has united
in his exercise, very beautifully, affections which are apparently contrary to
each other. The words</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">, <i>How long,
for ever?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are a defective form of
expression; but they are much more emphatic than if he had put the question
according to the usual mode of speaking, <i>Why for so long a time? </i>By
speaking thus, he gives us to understand, that for the purpose of cherishing his
hope, and encouraging himself in the exercise of patience, he extended his view
to a distance, and that, therefore, he does not complain of a calamity of a few
days' duration, as the effeminate and the cowardly are accustomed to do, who see
only what is before their feet, and immediately succumb at the first assault. He
teaches us, therefore, by his example, to stretch our view as far as possible
into the future, that our present grief may not entirely deprive us of
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long shall I take counsel
in my soul?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know that men in
adversity give way to discontent, and look around them, first to one quarter,
and then to another, in search of remedies. Especially, upon seeing that they
are destitute of all resources, they torment themselves greatly, and are
distracted by a multitude of thoughts; and in great dangers, anxiety and fear
compel them to change their purposes from time to time, when they do not find
any plan upon which they can fix with certainty. David, therefore, complains,
that while thinking of different methods of obtaining relief, and deliberating
with himself now in one way, and now in another, he is exhausted to no purpose
with the multitude of suggestions which pass through his mind; and by joining to
this complaint the <i>sorrow </i>which he felt daily, he points out the source
of this disquietude. As in severe sickness the diseased would desire to change
their place every moment, and the more acute the pains which afflict them are,
the more fitful and eager are they in shifting and changing; so, when sorrow
seizes upon the hearts of men, its miserable victims are violently agitated
within, and they find it more tolerable to torment themselves without obtaining
relief, than to endure their afflictions with composed and tranquil minds. The
Lord, indeed, promises to give to the faithful "the<i> </i>spirit of counsels"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:2) but he does not always give it to them at the very beginning of any matter

long deliberation without coming to a determinate
decision,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

the Hebrew word

<i>yomam, </i>as meaning <i>all the day long. </i>But it seems to me, that by it
is rather meant another kind of continuance, namely, that his sorrow returned,
and was renewed every day. In the end of the verse he deplores another evil,
that his adversaries triumph over him the more boldly, when they see him wholly
enfeebled, and as it were wasted by continual languor. Now this is an argument
of great weight in our prayers; for there is nothing which is more displeasing
to God, and which he will less bear with, than the cruel insolence which our
enemies display, when they not only feast themselves by beholding us in misery,
but also rise up the higher against us, and treat us the more disdainfully, the
more they see us oppressed and
afflicted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look upon me, answer
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As when God does not promptly afford
assistance to his servants, it seems to the eye of sense that he does not behold
their necessities, David, for this reason, asks God, in the first place, to look
upon him, and, in the second place, to succor him. Neither of these things, it
is true, is prior or posterior in respect of God; but it has been already stated
in a preceding psalm, and we will have occasion afterwards frequently to repeat
the statement, that the Holy Spirit purposely accommodates to our understanding
the models of prayer recorded in Scripture. If David had not been persuaded that
God had his eyes upon him, it would have availed him nothing to cry to God; but
this persuasion was the effect of faith. In the meantime, until God actually
puts forth his hand to give relief, carnal reason suggests to us that he shuts
his eyes, and does not behold us. The manner of expression here employed amounts
to the same thing as if he had put the mercy of God in the first place, and then
added to it his assistance, because God then hears us, when, having compassion
upon us, he is moved and induced to succor us. <i>To enlighten the eyes
</i>signifies the same thing in the Hebrew language as to give the breath of
life, for the rigour of life appears chiefly in the eyes. In this sense Solomon
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The<i> </i>poor and the
deceitful man meet together; the Lord lighteneth both their eyes."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs

Samuel 14:27.) The word <i>sleep, </i>as<i> </i>it is used in this passage, is a
metaphor of a similar kind, being put for death. In short, David confesses, that
unless God cause the light of life to shine upon him, he will be immediately
overwhelmed with the darkness of death, and that he is already as a man without
life, unless God breathe into him new vigor. And certainly our confidence of
life depends on this, that although the world may threaten us with a thousand
deaths, yet God is possessed of numberless means of restoring us to
life.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa258</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest my

little before said concerning the pride of his enemies, namely, how it would be
a thing ill becoming the character of God were he to abandon his servant to the
mockery of the ungodly. David's enemies lay, as it were, in ambush watching the
hour of his ruin, that they might deride him when they saw him fall. And as it
is the peculiar office of God to repress the audacity and insolence of the
wicked, as often as they glory in their wickedness, David beseeches God to
deprive them of the opportunity of indulging in such boasting. It is, however,
to be observed, that he had in his conscience a sufficient testimony to his own
integrity, and that he trusted also in the goodness of his cause, so that it
would have been unbecoming and unreasonable had he been left without succor in
danger, and had he been overwhelmed by his enemies. We can, therefore, with
confidence pray for ourselves, in the manner in which David here does for
himself, only when we fight under the standard of God, and are obedient to his
orders, so that our enemies cannot obtain the victory over us without wickedly
triumphing over God himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
13:5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> But I trust in thy goodness;
my heart shall exult in thy salvation. I will sing unto the Lord, because he
hath dealt bountifully with me.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa259	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist does not as yet
feel how much he has profited by praying; but depending upon the hope of
deliverance, which the faithful promise of God enabled him to entertain, he
makes use of this hope as a shield to repel those temptations with the terror of
which he might be greatly distressed. Although, therefore, he is severely
afflicted, and a multiplicity of cares urge him to despair, he, notwithstanding,
declares it to be his resolution to continue firm in his reliance upon the grace
of God, and in the hope of salvation. With the very same confidence ought all
the godly to be furnished and sustained, that they may duly persevere in prayer.
Whence, also, we gather what I have formerly adverted to, that it is by faith we
apprehend the grace of God, which is hidden from and unknown to the
understanding of the flesh. As the verbs which the Psalmist uses are not put in
the same tense, different meanings may be drawn from the different tenses; but
David, I have no doubt, here wishes to testify that he continued firm in the
hope of the deliverance promised to him, and would continue so even to the end,
however heavy the burden of temptations which might press upon him. Accordingly,
the word <i>exult </i>is put in the future tense, to denote the continued
exercise of the affection spoken of, and that no affliction shall ever shake out
of his heart <i>the joy of faith. </i>It is to be observed, that he places the
goodness of God first in order, as being the cause of his deliverance, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will sing unto the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I translate this into the future
tense. David, it is true, had not yet obtained what he earnestly desired, but
being fully convinced that God was already at hand to grant him deliverance, he
pledges himself to give thanks to him for it. And surely it becomes us to engage
in prayer in such a frame of mind as at the same time to be ready to sing the
praises of God; a thing which is impossible, unless we are fully persuaded that
our prayers will not be ineffectual. We may not be wholly free from sorrow, but
it is nevertheless necessary that this cheerfulness of faith rise above it, and
put into our mouth a song on account of the joy which is reserved for us in the
future although not as yet experienced by
us;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa260</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> just as we see David here preparing
himself to celebrate in songs the grace of God, before he perceives the issue of
his troubles. The word

reward, </i>signifies nothing else here than <i>to bestow a benefit from pure
grace, </i>and this is its meaning in many other passages of Scripture. What
kind of thanksgiving, I pray you to consider, would that be, to say that God
rewarded and rendered to his servant due recompense? This is sufficient to
refute the absurd and trifling sophism of those who wrest this passage to prove
the merit of works. In short, the only thing which remains to be observed is,
that David, in hastening with promptitude of soul to sing of God's benefits
before he had received them, places the deliverance, which was then apparently
at a distance, immediately before his eyes.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM

<div><font face="Palatino">In the beginning the Psalmist describes the wicked
contempt of God into which almost the whole people had broken forth. To give the
greater weight to his complaint, he represents God himself as uttering it.
Afterwards he comforts himself and others with the hope of a remedy, which he
assures himself God will very soon provide, although, in the meantime, he groans
and feels deep distress at the disorder which he
beholds.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fa262</font></sup><br></div>

are of opinion that in this psalm there is given forth a prediction concerning
the future oppression of their nation:as if David, by the revelation of the Holy
Spirit, bewailed the afflicted condition of the Church of God under the tyranny
of the Gentiles. They therefore refer what is here spoken to the dispersed
condition in which we see them at the present day, as if they were that precious
heritage of God which the wild beasts devour. But it is very apparent, that in
wishing to cover the disgrace of their nation, they wrest and apply to the
Gentiles, without any just ground, what is said concerning the perverse children
of Abraham.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

to the people who lived under the law,

3:19.) Besides, although we had not the testimony of this Apostle, the structure
of the psalm very clearly shows that David means rather the domestic tyrants and
enemies of the faithful than foreign ones; a point which it is very necessary
for us to understand. We know that it is a temptation which pains us
exceedingly, to see wickedness breaking forth and prevailing in the midst of the
Church, the good and the simple unrighteously afflicted, while the wicked
cruelly domineer according to their pleasure. This sad spectacle almost
completely disheartens us; and, therefore, we have much need to be fortified
from the example which David here sets before us:so that, in the midst of the
greatest desolations which we behold in the Church, we may comfort ourselves
with this assurance, that God will finally deliver her from them. I have no
doubt that there is here described the disordered and desolate state of Judea
which Saul introduced when he began to rage openly. Then, as if the remembrance
of God had been extinguished from the minds of men, all piety had vanished, and
with respect to integrity or uprightness among men, there was just as little of
it as of godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fool
hath said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lbn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nabal, </i>signifies not only a fool, but also a perverse, vile, and
contemptible person, it would not have been unsuitable to have translated it so
in this place; yet I am content to follow the more generally received
interpretation, which is, that all profane persons, who have cast off all fear
of God and abandoned themselves to iniquity, are convicted of madness. David
does not bring against his enemies the charge of common foolishness, but rather
inveighs against the folly and insane hardihood of those whom the world accounts
eminent for their wisdom. We commonly see that those who, in the estimation both
of themselves and of others, highly excel in sagacity and wisdom, employ their
cunning in laying snares, and exercise the ingenuity of their minds in despising
and mocking God. It is therefore important for us, in the first place, to know,
that however much the world applaud these crafty and scoffing characters, who
allow themselves to indulge to any extent in wickedness, yet the Holy Spirit
condemns them as being fools; for there is no stupidity more brutish than
forgetfulness of God. We ought, however, at the same time, carefully to mark the
evidence on which the Psalmist comes to the conclusion that they have cast off
all sense of religion, and it is this:that they have overthrown all order, so
that they no longer make any distinction between right and wrong, and have no
regard for honesty, nor love of humanity. David, therefore, does not speak of
the hidden affection of the heart of the wicked, except in so far as they
discover themselves by their external actions. The import of his language is,
How does it come to pass, that these men indulge themselves in their lusts so
boldly and so outrageously, that they pay no regard to righteousness or equity;
in short, that they madly rush into every kind of wickedness, if it is not
because they have shaken off all sense of religion, and extinguished, as far as
they can, all remembrance of God from their minds? When persons retain in their
heart any sense of religion, they must necessarily have some modesty, and be in
some measure restrained and prevented from entirely disregarding the dictates of
their conscience. From this it follows, that when the ungodly allow themselves
to follow their own inclinations, so obstinately and audaciously as they are
here represented as doing, without any sense of shame, it is an evidence that
they have cast off all fear of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist
says that they speak </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in their
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They may not utter this
detestable blasphemy, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>with their mouths; but the
unbridled licentiousness of their life loudly and distinctly declares that in
their hearts, which are destitute of all godliness, they soothingly sing to
themselves this song. Not that they maintain, by drawn out arguments or formal
syllogisms, as they term them, that there is no God, (for to render them so much
the more inexcusable, God from time to time causes even the most wicked of men
to feel secret pangs of conscience, that they may be compelled to acknowledge
his majesty and sovereign power;) but whatever right knowledge God instils into
them they partly stifle it by their malice against him, and partly corrupt it,
until religion in them becomes torpid, and at last dead. They may not plainly
deny the existence of a God, but they imagine him to be shut up in heaven, and
divested of his righteousness and power; and this is just to fashion an idol in
the room of God. As if the time would never come when they will have to appear
before him in judgment,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa265</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they endeavor, in all the transactions
and concerns of their life, to remove him to the greatest distance, and to
efface from their minds all apprehension of his
majesty.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And when God is dragged from his
throne, and divested of his character as judge, impiety has come to its utmost
height; and, therefore, we must conclude that David has most certainly spoken
according to truth, in declaring that those who give themselves liberty to
commit all manner of wickedness, in the flattering hope of escaping with
impunity, deny in their heart that there is a God. As the fifty-third psalm,
with the exception of a few words which are altered in it, is just a repetition
of this psalm, I will show in the proper places, as we proceed, the difference
which there is between the two psalms. David here complains that they have done
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abominable
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but for the word <i>work, </i>the
term there employed is <i>iniquity. </i>It should be observed that David does
not speak of one work or of two; but as he had said, that they have perverted or
<i>corrupted </i>all lawful order, so now he adds, that they have so polluted
their whole life, as to make it abominable, and the proof of this which he
adduces is, that they have no regard to uprightness in their dealings with one
another, but have forgotten all humanity, and all beneficence towards their
fellow-creatures.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

Jehovah looked down from heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God
himself is here introduced as speaking on the subject of human depravity, and
this renders the discourse of David more emphatic than if he had pronounced the
sentence in his own person. When God is exhibited to us as sitting on his throne
to take cognisance of the conduct of men, unless we are stupified in an
extraordinary degree, his majesty must strike us with terror. The effect of the
habit of sinning is, that men grow hardened in their sins, and discern nothing,
as if they were enveloped in thick darkness. David, therefore, to teach them
that they gain nothing by flattering and deceiving themselves as they do, when
wickedness reigns in the world with impunity, testifies that God looks down from
heaven, and casts his eyes on all sides, for the purpose of knowing what is done
among men. God, it is true, has no need to make inquisition or search; but when
he compares himself to an earthly judge, it is in adaptation to our limited
capacity, and to enable us gradually to form some apprehension of his secret
providence, which our reason cannot all at once comprehend. Would to God that
this manner of speaking had the effect of teaching us to summon ourselves before
his tribunal; and that, while the world are flattering themselves, and the
reprobate are trying to bury their sins in forgetfulness by their want of
thought, hypocrisy, or shamelessness, and are blinded in their obstinacy as if
they were intoxicated, we might be led to shake off all indifference and
stupidity by reflecting on this truth, that God, notwithstanding, looks down
from his high throne in heaven, and beholds what is going on here
below!</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To see if there were
any that did understand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As the whole
economy of a good and righteous life depends upon our being governed and
directed by the light of understanding, David has justly taught us in the
beginning of the psalm, that folly is the root of all wickedness. And in this
clause he also very justly declares, that the commencement of integrity and
uprightness of life consists in an enlightened and sound mind. But as the
greater part misapply their intellectual powers to deceitful purposes, David
immediately after defines, in one word, what true understanding is, namely, that
it consists <i>in seeking after God; </i>by which he means, that unless men
devote themselves wholly to God, their life cannot be well ordered. Some
understand the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maskil, </i>which we translated, <i>that did understand, </i>in too
restricted a sense; whereas David declares that the reprobate are utterly
destitute of all reason and
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one of them
has gone aside.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some translate the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sar, </i>which is here used, <i>to
stink</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa267</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if the reading were, <i>Every
one of them emits an offensive odour, </i>that it may correspond in meaning with
the verb in the next clause, which in Hebrew signifies <i>to become putrid
</i>or <i>rotten. </i>But there is no necessity for explaining the two words in
the same way, as if the same thing were repeated twice. The interpretation is
more appropriate, which supposes that men are here condemned as guilty of a
detestable revolt, inasmuch as they are estranged from God, or have departed far
from him; and that afterwards there is pointed out the disgusting corruption or
putrescence of their whole life, as if nothing could proceed from apostates but
what smells rank of rottenness and infection. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sar, </i>is almost universally taken in this sense. In the 53rd Psalm, the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gs</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
sag, </i>is used, which signifies the same thing. In short, David declares that
all men are so carried away by their capricious lusts, that nothing is to be
found either of purity or integrity in their whole life. This, therefore, is
defection so complete, that it extinguishes all godliness. Besides, David here
not only censures a portion of the people, but pronounces them all to be equally
involved in the same condemnation. This was, indeed, a prodigy well fitted to
excite abhorrence, that all the children of Abraham, whom God had chosen to be
his peculiar people, were so corrupt from the least to the
greatest.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it might be asked, how David makes
no exception, how he declares that not a righteous person remains, <i>not even
one, </i>when, nevertheless, he informs us, a little after, that the poor and
afflicted put their trust in God? Again, it might be asked, if all were wicked,
who was that Israel whose future redemption he celebrates in the end of the
psalm? Nay, as he himself was one of the body of that people, why does he not at
least except himself? I answer:It is against the carnal and degenerate body of
the Israelitish nation that he here inveighs, and the small number constituting
the seed which God had set apart for himself is not included among them. This is
the reason why Paul, in his Epistle to the
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:10, extends this sentence to all mankind. David, it is true, deplores the
disordered and desolate state of matters under the reign of Saul. At the same
time, however, he doubtless makes a comparison between the children of God and
all who have not been regenerated by the Spirit, but are carried away according
to the inclinations of their flesh.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa268</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some give a different explanation,
maintaining that Paul, by quoting the testimony of David, did not understand him
as meaning that men are naturally depraved and corrupt; and that the truth which
David intended to teach is, that the rulers and the more distinguished of the
people were wicked, and that, therefore, it was not surprising to behold
unrighteousness and wickedness prevailing so generally in the world. This answer
is far from being satisfactory. The subject which Paul there reasons upon is
not, what is the character of the greater part of men, but what is the character
of all who are led and governed by their own corrupt nature. It is, therefore,
to be observed, that when David places himself and the small remnant of the
godly on one side, and puts on the other the body of the people, in general,
this implies that there is a manifest difference between the children of God who
are created anew by his Spirit, and all the posterity of Adam, in whom
corruption and depravity exercise dominion. Whence it follows, that all of us,
when we are born, bring with us from our mother's womb this folly and filthiness
manifested in the whole life, which David here describes, and that we continue
such until God make us new creatures by his mysterious
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
14:4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> Have all the workers of
iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread? they call not

fa269	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino">This question is added to give
a more amplified illustration of the preceding doctrine. The prophet had said
that God observed from heaven the doings of men, and had found all of them gone
out of the way; and now he introduces him exclaiming with astonishment, What
madness is this, that they who ought to cherish my people, and assiduously
perform to them every kind office, are oppressing and falling upon them like
wild beasts, without any feeling of humanity? He attributes this manner of
speaking to God, not because any thing can happen which is strange or unexpected
to him, but in order the more forcibly to express his indignation. The Prophet
Isaiah, in like manner,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
59:16,) when treating of almost the same subject, says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And God saw that there
was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
59:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God, it is true, does not actually experience in
himself such affections, but he represents himself as invested with them, that
we may entertain the greatest horror and dread on account of our sins, when he
declares them to be of so monstrous a character, that he is as it were thrown
into agitation and disorder by them. And were we not harder than the stones, our
horror at the wickedness which prevails in the world would make the hair of our
head to stand on end,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa270</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> seeing God exhibits to us in his own
person such a testimony of the detestation with which he regards it. Moreover,
this verse confirms what I have said in the commencement, that David does not
speak in this psalm of foreign tyrants, or the avowed enemies of the church, but
of the rulers and princes of his people, who were furnished with power and
honor. This description would not apply to men who were altogether strangers to
the revealed will of God; for it would be nothing wonderful to see those who do
not possess the moral law, the rule of life, devoting themselves to the work of
violence and oppression. But the heinousness of the proceedings condemned is not
a little aggravated from this circumstance, that it is the shepherds themselves,
whose office it is to feed and to take care of the
flock,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa271</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who cruelly devour it, and who spare
not even the people and heritage of God. There is a similar complaint in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
3:1-3,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And I said, Hear I pray
you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel:Is it not for you
to know judgment? Who hate the good and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
from off them; and their flesh from off their bones; who also eat the flesh of
my people, and flay their skin from off
them,"</font><br><font face="Palatino">etc. If those who profess to know and to
serve God were to exercise such cruelty towards the Babylonians or Egyptians, it
would be a piece of injustice which could admit of no excuse; but when they glut
themselves with the blood and flesh of the saints, as they devour bread, this is
such monstrous iniquity, that it may well strike both angels and men with
astonishment. Had such persons a particle of sound understanding remaining in
them, it would restrain them from conduct so fearfully infatuated. They must,
therefore, be completely blinded by the devil, and utterly bereft of reason and
understanding, seeing they knowingly and willingly flay and devour the people of
God with such inhumanity. This passage teaches us how displeasing to God, and
how abominable is the cruelty which is exercised against the godly, by those who
pretend to be their shepherds. In the end of the verse, where he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they call not upon the
Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he again points out the source and
cause of this unbridled wickedness, namely, that such persons have no reverence
for God. Religion is the best mistress for teaching us mutually to maintain
equity and uprightness towards each other; and where a concern for religion is
extinguished, then all regard for justice perishes along with it. With respect
to the phrase, <i>calling upon God, </i>as it constitutes the principal exercise
of godliness, it includes by synecdoche, (a figure of rhetoric, by which a part
is put for the whole,) not only here, but in many other passages of Scripture,
the whole of the service of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

not forsake his people even to the end, but will at length show himself to be
their defender. Some explain the adverb of place <i>there, </i>as meaning that
God will take vengeance on the wicked in the presence of his saints, because
they exercised their tyranny upon them. But I rather think that by this word
there is expressed the certainty of their
punishment,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

in their interpretation of these words. Some supply the word <i>equal </i>or
<i>like, </i>and read, There is no fear equal to it. Others refer them to those
secret alarms with which the ungodly are tormented, even when there may be no
ground for apprehension. God threatens the transgressors of his law with such
mental torment that they "shall flee when none pursueth them," (Leviticus 26:17,
and
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032636&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:36) just as we see that they are themselves their own tormentors, and are
agitated with mental trouble even when there is no external cause to create it.
But I think the meaning of the prophet is different, namely, that when their
affairs are in a state of the greatest tranquillity and prosperity, God will
suddenly launch against them the bolts of his vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For when they shall say,

<div><font face="Palatino">The prophet, therefore, encourages and supports the
faithful with this prospect, that the ungodly, when they think themselves free
from all danger, and are securely celebrating their own triumphs, shall be
overwhelmed with sudden destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The reason
of this is added in the last clause of the verse, namely, because God is
determined to defend the righteous, and to take in hand their
cause:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God is in the
generation of the righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, in

the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwd</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
dor, </i>which we have translated <i>generation. </i>As this noun in Hebrew
sometimes signifies <i>an age, </i>or, <i>the course of human life, </i>the
sentence might be explained as follows:Although God for a time may seem to take
no notice of the wrongs inflicted upon his servants by the wicked, yet he is
ever present with them, and exercises his grace towards them during their whole
life. But it seems to me a more simple and natural exposition to interpret the
clause thus:That God is on the side of the righteous, and takes their part, as
we say,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa278</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwd</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God hath scattered the bones
of him that besiegeth thee, thou shalt put them to shame; because God hath
rejected them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words the
prophet explains more clearly how God protects the righteous, that it is by
delivering them from the jaws of death, just as if one were to put to flight
those who had laid siege to a town, and were to set at liberty its inhabitants,
who before were in great extremity and quite shut
up.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa279</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whence it follows, that we must
patiently bear oppression, if we desire to be protected and preserved by the
hand of God, at the time of our greatest danger. The expression, <i>bones,
</i>is used metaphorically for <i>strength </i>or <i>power. </i>The prophet
particularly speaks of their power; for if the wicked were not possessed of
riches, ammunition, and troops, which render them formidable, it would not
appear, with sufficient evidence, that it is the hand of God which at length
crushes them. The Psalmist next exhorts the faithful to a holy boasting, and
bids them rest assured that an ignominious destruction hangs over the heads of
the wicked. The reason of this is, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God hath rejected
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and if he is opposed to them, all
things must ultimately go ill with them. As
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sam</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ma&auml;s, </i>which we have translated <i>to reject, </i>sometimes signifies
<i>to despise, </i>some render it thus, <i>Because God hath despised them;
</i>but this, I think, does not suit the passage. It would be more appropriate
to read,<i> &#8212; He hath rendered them contemptible, </i>or, <i>subjected
them to disgrace and ignominy. </i>Whence it follows, that they only draw down
upon themselves dishonor and infamy while they strive to elevate themselves, as
it were, in despite of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye deride the counsel of the
poor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He inveighs against those giants
who mock at the faithful for their simplicity, in calmly expecting, in their
distresses, that God will show himself to be their deliverer. And, certainly,
nothing seems more irrational to the flesh than to betake ourselves to God when
yet he does not relieve us from our calamities; and the reason is, because the
flesh judges of God only according to what it presently beholds of his grace.
Whenever, therefore, unbelievers see the children of God overwhelmed with
calamities, they reproach them for their groundless confidence, as it appears to
them to be, and with sarcastic jeers laugh at the assured hope with which they
rely upon God, from whom, notwithstanding, they receive no sensible aid. David,
therefore, defies and derides this insolence of the wicked, and threatens that
their mockery of the poor and the wretched, and their charging them with folly
in depending upon the protection of God, and not sinking under their calamities,
will be the cause of their destruction. At the same time, he teaches them that
there is no resolution to which we can come which is better advised than the
resolution to depend upon God, and that to repose on his salvation, and on the
assistance which he hath promised us, even although we may be surrounded with
calamities, is the highest
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
14:7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> Who shall give salvation [or
deliverance] to Israel out of Sion? When Jehovah shall have brought back the
captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be
glad.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">David, after having laid down the
doctrine of consolation, again returns to prayers and groanings. By this he
teaches us, that although God may leave us for a long time to languish, yet we
ought not to weary, or lose courage, but should always glory in him; and, again,
that while our troubles continue, the most effectual solace we can have is often
to return to the exercise of prayer. When he asks the question,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall give
salvation?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this does not imply, that he
was looking either to the right hand or to the left, or that he turned away his
eyes from God in search of another deliverer; he intends only to express the
ardor of his desire, as if he had said, When will the time at length come when
God will display his salvation, and make it fully manifest? By the word <i>Sion,
</i>which he adds, he testifies that his hope is fixed on God; for Sion was the
holy place from which God had promised to hear the prayers of his servants; and
it was the dwelling-place of the ark of the covenant, which was an external
pledge and symbol of the presence of God. He does not, therefore, doubt who
would be the author of his salvation; but he asks, with a sorrowful heart, when
at length that salvation will come forth which is to be expected from no other
source than from God alone. The question may, however, be put, if this prayer
refers to the time of Saul, how can Sion, with propriety, be named as being
already the sanctuary of God? I will not deny that the Psalmist, by the spirit
of prophecy, may have predicted what had not yet actually taken place; but I
think it highly probable, that this psalm was not composed until the ark of the
covenant had been placed on mount Sion. David, as we know, employed his leisure
hours in committing to writing, for the benefit of posterity, events which had
happened long before. Besides, by expressing his desire for the deliverance of
Israel, we are taught that he was chiefly anxious about the welfare of the whole
body of the Church, and that his thoughts were more occupied about this than
about himself individually. This is worthy of being the more carefully marked
when we consider, that, while our attention is engrossed with our own particular
sorrows, we are in danger of almost entirely neglecting the welfare of our
brethren. And yet the particular afflictions with which God visits each of us
are intended to admonish us to direct our attention and care to the whole body
of the Church, and to think of its necessities, just as we see David here
including Israel with
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Lord shall
have brought back the captivity of his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>In these words, David concludes,
that God will not suffer the faithful to languish under continual sorrow,
according as it is said in another psalm,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
126:5) "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy." He doubtless aims at
confirming and encouraging himself and all the godly to hope for the promised
deliverance. He therefore says, in the first place, that although God may delay,
or at least may not make so much haste as we would wish, he will, nevertheless,
show himself to be the defender of his people, by redeeming them from captivity.
And, in the next place, he assuages their sorrow, by setting forth that the
issue of it will be joyful, seeing it will at length be turned into gladness.
<i>The captivity, </i>of which he makes mention, is not the Babylonish, or the
dispersion of his people among the heathen nations; it rather refers to an
oppression at home, when the wicked exercise dominion like tyrants in the
Church. We are, therefore, taught by these words, that when such furious enemies
waste and destroy the flock of God, or proudly tread it under foot, we ought to
have recourse to God, whose peculiar office it is to gather together his Israel
from all places whither they have been dispersed. And the term <i>captivity,
</i>which he employs, implies, that when the wicked overthrow at their pleasure
all good and lawful order in the midst of the Church, it is converted into a
Babylon or Egypt. Farther, although David defers the joy of the holy people, to
the time of their deliverance, yet the consolatory prospect of this should serve
not only to moderate our grief, but also to mix and season it with
joy.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
15.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm teaches us upon what condition God made

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah, who shall dwell in

common in the world than falsely to assume the name of God, or to pretend to be
his people, and as a great part of men allow themselves to do this without any
apprehension of the danger it involves, David, without stopping to speak to men,
addresses himself to God, which he considers the better course; and he
intimates, that if men assume the title of the people of God, without being so
in deed and in truth, they gain nothing by their self-delusion, for God
continues always like himself, and as he is faithful himself, so will he have us
to keep faith with him in return. No doubt, he adopted Abraham freely, but, at
the same time, he stipulated with him that he should live a holy and an upright
life, and this is the general rule of the covenant which God has, from the
beginning, made with his Church. The sum is, that hypocrites, who occupy a place
in the temple of God, in vain pretend to be his people, for he acknowledges none
as such but those who follow after justice and uprightness during the whole
course of their life. David saw the temple crowded with a great multitude of men
who all made a profession of the same religion, and presented themselves before
God as to the outward ceremony; and, therefore, assuming the person of one
wondering at the spectacle, he directs his discourse to God, who, in such a
confusion and medley of characters, could easily distinguish his own people from
strangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is a threefold use of this
doctrine. In the first place, If we really wish to be reckoned among the number
of the children of God, the Holy Ghost teaches us, that we must show ourselves
to be such by a holy and an upright life; for it is not enough to serve God by
outward ceremonies, unless we also live uprightly, and without doing wrong to
our neighbors. In the second place, As we too often see the Church of God
defaced by much impurity, to prevent us from stumbling at what appears so
offensive, a distinction is made between those who are permanent citizens of the
Church, and strangers who are mingled among them only for a time. This is
undoubtedly a warning highly necessary, in order that when the temple of God
happens to be tainted by many impurities, we may not contract such disgust and
chagrin as will make us withdraw from it. By impurities I understand the vices
of a corrupt and polluted life. Provided religion continue pure as to doctrine
and worship, we must not be so much stumbled at the faults and sins which men
commit, as on that account to rend the unity of the Church. Yet the experience
of all ages teaches us how dangerous a temptation it is when we behold the
Church of God, which ought to be free from all polluting stains, and to shine in
uncorrupted purity, cherishing in her bosom many ungodly hypocrites, or wicked
persons. From this the Catharists, Novatians, and Donatists, took occasion in
former times to separate themselves from the fellowship of the godly. The
Anabaptists, at the present day, renew the same schisms, because it does not
seem to them that a church in which vices are tolerated can be a true church.
But Christ, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
25:32, justly claims it as his own peculiar office to separate the sheep from
the goats; and thereby admonishes us, that we must bear with the evils which it
is not in our power to correct, until all things become ripe, and the proper
season of purging the Church arrive. At the same time, the faithful are here
enjoined, each in his own sphere, to use their endeavors that the Church of God
may be purified from the corruptions which still exist within her. And this is
the third use which we should make of this doctrine. God's sacred barn-floor
will not be perfectly cleansed before the last day, when Christ at his coming
will cast out the chaff; but he has already begun to do this by the doctrine of
his gospel, which on this account he terms a fan. We must, therefore, by no
means be indifferent about this matter; on the contrary, we ought rather to
exert ourselves in good earnest, that all who profess themselves Christians may
lead a holy and an unspotted life. But above all, what God here declares with
respect to all the unrighteous should be deeply imprinted on our memory; namely,
that he prohibits them from coming to his sanctuary, and condemns their impious
presumption, in irreverently thrusting themselves into the society of the godly.
David makes mention of <i>the tabernacle, </i>because the temple was not yet
built. The meaning of his discourse, to express it in a few words, is this, that
those only have access to God who are his genuine servants, and who live a holy
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that walketh in
integrity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we should mark, that in
the words there is an implied contrast between the vain boasting of those who
are only the people of God in name, or who make only a bare profession of being
so, which consists in outward observances, and this indubitable and genuine
evidence of true godliness which David commends. But it might be asked, As the
service of God takes precedence of the duties of charity towards our neighbors,
why is there no mention here made of faith and prayer; for, certainly, these are
the marks by which the genuine children of God ought to have been distinguished
from hypocrites? The answer is easy:David does not intend to exclude faith and
prayer, and other spiritual sacrifices; but as hypocrites, in order to promote
their own interests, are not sparing in their attention to a multiplicity of
external religious observances, while their ungodliness, notwithstanding, is
manifested outwardly in the life, seeing they are fall of pride, cruelty,
violence, and are given to deceitfulness and extortion, - the Psalmist, for the
purpose of discovering and drawing forth into the light all who are of such a
character, takes the marks and evidences of true and sincere faith from the
second table of the law. According to the care which every man takes to practice
righteousness and equity towards his neighbors, so does he actually show that he
fears God. David, then, is not here to be understood as resting satisfied with
political or social justice, as if it were enough to render to our fellow-men
what is their own, while we may lawfully defraud God of his right; but he
describes the approved servants of God, as distinguished and known by the fruits
of righteousness which they produce. In the first place, he requires
<i>sincerity; </i>in other words, that men should conduct themselves in all
their affairs with singleness of heart, and without sinful craft or cunning.
Secondly, he requires <i>justice; </i>that is to say, that they should study to
do good to their neighbors, hurt nobody, and abstain from all wrong. Thirdly, he
requires <i>truth </i>in their speech, so that they may speak nothing falsely or
deceitfully. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To speak in the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a strong figurative expression,
but it expresses more forcibly David's meaning than if he had said <i>from the
heart. </i>It denotes such agreement and harmony between the heart and tongue,
as that the speech is, as it were, a vivid representation of the hidden
affection or feeling within.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
15:3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> He that slandereth not with
his tongue, nor doeth evil to his companion, nor raiseth up a calumnious report
against his neighbor.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">David, after having
briefly set forth the virtues with which all who desire to have a place in the
Church ought to be endued, now enumerates certain vices from which they ought to
be free. In the first place, he tells them that they must not be <i>slanderers
</i>or <i>detractors; </i>secondly, that they must restrain themselves from
doing any thing mischievous and injurious to their neighbors; and, thirdly, that
they must not aid in giving currency to calumnies and false reports. Other
vices, from which the righteous are free, we shall meet with as we proceed.
David, then, sets down calumny and detraction as the first point of injustice by
which our neighbors are injured. If a good name is a treasure, more precious
than all the riches of the world,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
22:1,) no greater injury can be inflicted upon men than to wound their
reputation. It is not, however, every injurious word which is here condemned;
but the disease and lust of detraction, which stirs up malicious persons to
spread abroad calumnies. At the same time, it cannot be doubted that the design
of the Holy Spirit is to condemn all false and wicked accusations. In the clause
which immediately follows, the doctrine that the children of God ought to be far
removed from all injustice, is stated more
generally:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor doeth evil to his
companion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the words <i>companion and
neighbor, </i>the Psalmist means not only those with whom we enjoy familiar
intercourse, and live on terms of intimate friendship, but all men, to whom we
are bound by the ties of humanity and a common nature. He employs these terms to
show more clearly the odiousness of what he condemns, and that the saints may
have the greater abhorrence of all wrong dealing, since every man who hurts his
neighbor violates the fundamental law of human society. With respect to the
meaning of the last clause, interpreters are not agreed. Some take the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to raise up a calumnious
report</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for <i>to invent, </i>because
malicious persons raise up calumnies from nothing; and thus it would be a
repetition of the statement contained in the first clause of the verse, namely,
that good men should not allow themselves to indulge in detraction. But I think
there is also here rebuked the vice of undue credulity, which, when any evil
reports are spread against our neighbors, leads us either eagerly to listen to
them, or at least to receive them without sufficient reason; whereas we ought
rather to use all means to suppress and trample them under
foot.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa280</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When any one is the bearer of invented
falsehoods, those who reject them leave them, as it were, to fall to the ground;
while, on the contrary, those who propagate and publish them from one person to
another are, by an expressive form of speech, said to raise them
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
15:4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> In his eyes the offcast [or
reprobate</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa281</font></sup><font face="Palatino">] is despised; but he honoureth them
that fear the Lord; when he hath sworn to his own hurt, he changeth
not.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The first part of this verse is
explained in different ways. Some draw from it this meaning, that the true
servants of God are contemptible and worthless in their own estimation. If we
adopt this interpretation, the copula <i>and, </i>which David does not express,
must be supplied, making the reading thus, <i>He is vile and despised in his own
eyes. </i>But besides the consideration, that, if this had been the sense, the
words would probably have been joined together by the copula <i>and, </i>I have
another reason which leads me to think that David had a different meaning, He
compares together two opposite things, namely, to despise perverse and worthless
characters, and to honor the righteous and those who fear God. In order that
these two clauses may correspond with each other, the only sense in which I can
understand what is here said about <i>being despised </i>is this, that the
children of God despise the ungodly, and form that low and contemptuous estimate
of them which their character deserves. The godly, it is true, although living a
praiseworthy and virtuous life, are not inflated with presumption, but, on the
contrary, are rather dissatisfied with themselves, because they feel how far
short they are as yet of the perfection which is required. When, however, I
consider what the scope of the passage demands, I do not think that we are here
to view the Psalmist as commending humility or modesty, but rather a free and
upright judgment of human character, by which the wicked, on the one hand, are
not spared, while virtue, on the other, receives the honor which belongs to it;
for flattery, which nourishes vices by covering them, is an evil not less
pernicious than it is common. I indeed admit, that if the wicked are in
authority, we ought not to carry our contempt of them the length of refusing to
obey them in so far as a regard to our duty will permit; but, at the same time,
we must beware of flattery and of accommodating ourselves to them, which would
be to involve us in the same condemnation with them. He who not only seems to
regard their wicked actions with indifference, but also honors them, shows that
he approves of them as much as it is in his power. Paul therefore teaches us,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:11,) that it is a species of fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness
when we do not reprove them. It is certainly a very perverse way of acting, when
persons, for the sake of obtaining the favor of men, will indirectly mock God;
and all are chargeable with doing this who make it their business to please the
wicked. David, however, has a respect, not so much to persons as to wicked
works. The man who sees the wicked honored, and by the applause of the world
rendered more obstinate in their wickedness, and who willingly gives his consent
or approbation to this, does he not, by so doing, exalt vice to authority, and
invest it with sovereign power? "But woe," says the prophet Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:20,) "unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for
light, and light for darkness."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor ought it to
be regarded as a rude or violent manner of speaking, when David calls base and
wicked persons <i>reprobates, </i>although they may be placed in an exalted and
honorable station. If (as Cicero affirms, in his book entitled The Responses of
the Aruspices) the inspectors of the entrails of the sacrifices, and other
heathen soothsayers, applied to worthless and abandoned characters the term
<i>rejected, </i>although they excelled in dignity and riches, why should not a
prophet of God be permitted to apply the name of <i>degraded outcasts </i>to all
who are rejected by God? The meaning of the Psalmist, to express it in a few
words, is, that the children of God freely judge of every man's doings, and that
for the purpose of obtaining the favor of men, they will not stoop to vile
flattery, and thereby encourage the wicked in their
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows immediately after,
namely, <i>to honor </i>the righteous and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who fear
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is no mean virtue. As they are
often, as it were, the filth and the offscouring of all things in the estimation
of the world, so it frequently happens that those who show them favor and
sympathy, excite against themselves every where the hatred of the world. The
greater part of mankind, therefore, refuse the friendship of good men, and leave
them to be despised, which cannot be done without grievous and heinous injury to
God. Let us learn then not to value men by their estate or their money, or their
transitory honors, but to hold in estimation godliness, or the fear of God. And
certainly no man will ever truly apply his mind to the study of godliness who
does not, at the same time, reverence the servants of God; as, on the other
hand, the love we bear to them incites us to imitate them in sanctity of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he hath sworn to
his own hurt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The translation of the
LXX. would agree very well with the scope of the passage, were it not that the
points which are under the words in the Hebrew text will not bear such a
sense.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa282</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is, indeed, no proof of the
inaccuracy of their rendering, that it does not agree with the points; for,
although the Jews have always used the points in reading, it is probable that
they did not always express them in writing. I, however, prefer following the
commonly received reading. And the meaning is, that the faithful will rather
submit to suffer loss than break their word. When a man keeps his promises, in
as far as he sees it to be for his own advantage, there is in this no argument
to prove his uprightness and faithfulness. But when men make a promise to each
other, there is nothing more common than from some slight loss which the
performance of it would occasion, to endeavor to find a pretext for breaking
their engagements. Every one considers with himself what is for his own
advantage, and if it puts him to inconvenience or trouble to stand to his
promises, he is ingenious enough to imagine that he will incur a far greater
loss than there is any reason to apprehend. It seems, indeed, a fair excuse when
a man complains that, if he does not depart from his engagement, he will suffer
great loss. Hence it is, that we generally see so much unfaithfulness among men,
that they do not consider themselves bound to perform the promises which they
have made, except in so far as it will promote their own personal interest.
David, therefore, condemning this inconstancy, requires the children of God to
exhibit the greatest steadfastness in the fulfillment of their promises. Here
the question might be asked, If a man, having fallen into the hands of a
highwayman, promise him a sum of money to save his life, and if, in consequence
of this, he is let go, should he in that case keep his promise? Again, if a man
has been basely deceived, in entering into a contract, is it lawful for him to
break the oath which he shall have made in such an engagement? With respect to
the highwayman, he who confers upon him money falls into another fault, for he
supports at his own expense a common enemy of mankind to the detriment of the
public welfare. David does not impose upon the faithful such an alternative as
this, but only enjoins them to show a greater regard to their promises than to
their own personal interests, and to do this especially when their promises have
been confirmed by an oath. As to the other case, namely, when a person has
sworn, from being deceived and imposed upon by wicked artifice he ought
certainly to hold the holy name of God in such veneration, as rather patiently
to submit to loss than violate his oath. Yet it is perfectly lawful for him to
discover or reveal the fraud which has been practiced upon him, provided he is
not led to do so by a regard to his own personal interest; and there is,
besides, nothing to hinder him from peaceably endeavoring to compromise the
matter with his adversary. Many of the Jewish expositors restrict this passage
to vows, as if David exhorted the faithful to perform their vows when they have
promised to humble and afflict themselves by fasting. But in this they are
mistaken. Nothing is farther from his meaning than this, for he discourses here
only of the second table of the law, and of the mutual rectitude which men
should maintain in their dealings with one
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
15:5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> He putteth not out his money
to usury, nor taketh bribes upon the innocent. He that doeth these things shall
not be moved for ever.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">In this verse David
enjoins the godly neither to oppress their neighbors by usury, nor to suffer
themselves to be corrupted with bribes to favor unrighteous causes. With respect
to the first clause, as David seems to condemn all kinds of usury in general,
and without exception, the very name has been every where held in detestation.
But crafty men have invented specious names under which to conceal the vice; and
thinking by this artifice to escape, they have plundered with greater excess
than if they had lent on usury avowedly and openly. God, however, will not be
dealt with and imposed upon by sophistry and false pretences. He looks upon the
thing as it really is. There is no worse species of usury than an unjust way of
making bargains, where equity is disregarded on both sides. Let us then remember
that all bargains in which the one party unrighteously strives to make gain by
the loss of the other party, whatever name may be given to them, are here
condemned. It may be asked, Whether all kinds of usury are to be put into this
denunciation, and regarded as alike unlawful? If we condemn all without
distinction, there is a danger lest many, seeing themselves brought into such a
strait, as to find that sin must be incurred, in whatever way they can turn
themselves, may be rendered bolder by despair, and may rush headlong into all
kinds of usury, without choice or discrimination. On the other hand, whenever we
concede that something may be lawfully done this way, many will give themselves
loose reins, thinking that a liberty to exercise usury, without control or
moderation, has been granted them. In the first place, therefore, I would, above
all things, counsel my readers to beware of ingeniously contriving deceitful
pretexts, by which to take advantage of their fellow-men, and let them not
imagine that any thing can be lawful to them which is grievous and hurtful to
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect to usury, it is scarcely
possible to find in the world a usurer who is not at the same time an
extortioner, and addicted to unlawful and dishonorable gain. Accordingly,
Cato</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa283</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of old justly placed the practice of
usury and the killing of men in the same rank of criminality, for the object of
this class of people is to suck the blood of other men. It is also a very
strange and shameful thing, that, while all other men obtain the means of their
subsistence with much toil, while husbandmen fatigue themselves by their daily
occupations, and artisans serve the community by the sweat of their brow, and
merchants not only employ themselves in labors, but also expose themselves to
many inconveniences and dangers, &#8212; that money-mongers should sit at their
ease without doing any thing, and receive tribute from the labor of all other
people. Besides, we know that generally it is not the rich who are exhausted by
their usury,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa284</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but poor men, who ought rather to be
relieved. It is not, therefore, without cause that God has, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032535&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
25:35, 36, forbidden usury, adding this reason, "And if thy brother be waxen
poor and fallen in decay with thee, then thou shalt relieve him; take thou no
usury of him or increase." We see that the end for which the law was framed was,
that men should not cruelly oppress the poor, who ought rather to receive
sympathy and compassion.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa285</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This was, indeed, a part of the
judicial law which God appointed for the Jews in particular; but it is a common
principle of justice which extends to all nations and to all ages, that we
should keep ourselves from plundering and devouring the poor who are in distress
and want, Whence it follows, that the gain which he who lends his money upon
interest acquires, without doing injury to any one, is not to be included under
the head of unlawful usury. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
neshek, </i>which David employs, being derived from another word, which
signifies <i>to bite, </i>sufficiently shows that usuries are condemned in so
far as they involve in them or lead to a license of robbing and plundering our
fellow-men. Ezekiel, indeed,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
18:17, and
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
22:12, seems to condemn the taking of any interest whatever upon money lent; but
he doubtless has an eye to the unjust and crafty arts of gaining, by which the
rich devoured the poor people. In short, provided we had engraven on our hearts
the rule of equity, which Christ prescribes in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:12,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Therefore, all things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them,"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it would not be necessary to enter into lengthened
disputes concerning usury.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What next follows in
the text properly applies to judges who, being corrupted by presents and
rewards, pervert all law and justice. It may, however, be extended farther,
inasmuch as it often happens, that even private individuals are corrupted by
bribes to favor and defend bad causes. David, therefore, comprehends, in
general, all those corruptions by which we are led away from truth and
uprightness. Some think that what is here intended is the rapacity of judges in
extorting money from the innocent who are accused, as the price of their
deliverance, when they ought rather to have protected and assisted them
gratuitously. But it appears from the passages similar to this in Ezekiel, which
we have quoted, that the sense is
different.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who doeth these
things. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This conclusion warns us again, that
all who thrust themselves into the sanctuary of God are not permanent citizens
of "the holy Jerusalem<i> </i>which is
above;"</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa286</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but that hypocrites, and all who
falsely assume the title of saints, shall at length be "cast out" with Ishmael
whom they resemble. That which is ascribed in Psalm 46, to the whole Church,
David here applies to every one of the faithful:<i>He shall not be moved for
ever. </i>The reason of this which is there expressed is, because God dwells in
the midst of Jerusalem. On the contrary, we know that he is far from the
perfidious and the wicked, who approach him only with the mouth, and with
reigned lips.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM

God, and thereby stirs himself up to thanksgiving. By his service, it is true,
he could in no respect be profitable to God, but he, notwithstanding, surrenders
and devotes himself entirely to him, protesting that he will have nothing to do
with superstitions. He also states the reason of this to be, that full and
substantial happiness consists in resting in God alone, who never suffers his

commits himself to the protection of God. He does not, however, here implore the
aid of God, in some particular emergency, as he often does in other psalms, but
he beseeches him to show himself his protector during the whole course of his
life, and indeed our safety both in life and in death depends entirely upon our
being under the protection of God. What follows concerning <i>trust,
</i>signifies much the same thing as if the Holy Spirit assured us by the mouth
of David, that God is ready to succor all of us, provided we rely upon him with
a sure and steadfast faith; and that he takes under his protection none but
those who commit themselves to him with their whole heart. At the same time, we
must be reminded that David, supported by this trust, continued firm and unmoved
amidst all the storms of adversity with which he was
buffeted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt say unto

can bestow nothing upon God, not only because God stands in no need of any
thing, but also because mortal man cannot merit the favor of God by any service
which he can perform to him. At the same time, however, he takes courage, and,
as God accepts our devotion, and the service which we yield to him, David
protests that he will be one of his servants. To encourage himself the more
effectually to this duty he speaks to his own soul; for the Hebrew word which is
rendered <i>Thou shalt say, </i>is of the feminine gender, which can refer only
to the soul.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa290</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some may prefer reading the word in the
past tense, <i>Thou hast said, </i>which I think is unobjectionable, for the
Psalmist is speaking of an affliction which had a continued abode in his soul.
The import of his language is, I am, indeed, fully convinced in my heart, and
know assuredly, that God can derive no profit or advantage from me; but
notwithstanding this, I will join myself in fellowship with the saints, that
with one accord we may worship him by the sacrifices of praise. Two things are
distinctly laid down in this verse. The first is, that God has a right to
require of us whatever he pleases, seeing we are wholly bound to Him as our
rightful proprietor and Lord. David, by ascribing to him the power and the
dominion of <i>Lord, </i>declares that both himself and all he possessed are the
property of God. The other particular contained in this verse is, the
acknowledgement which the Psalmist makes of his own indigence.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My well-doing extendeth not unto
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Interpreters expound this last
clause in two ways. As
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;yl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aleyka, </i>may be rendered <i>upon thee, </i>some draw from it this sense,
that God is not brought under obligation, or in the least degree indebted to us,
by any good deeds which we may perform to him; and they understand the term
<i>goodness </i>in a passive sense, as if David affirmed that whatever goodness
he received from God did not proceed from any obligation he had laid God under,
or from any merit which he possessed. But I think the sentence has a more
extensive meaning, namely, that let men strive ever so much to lay themselves
out for God, yet they can bring no advantage to him. Our goodness extendeth not
to him, not only because, having in himself alone an all-sufficiency, he stands
in need of nothing,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa290a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but also because we are empty and
destitute of all good things, and have nothing with which to show ourselves
liberal towards him. From this doctrine, however, the other point which I have
before touched upon will follow, namely, that it is impossible for men, by any
merits of their own, to bring God under obligation to them, so as to make him
their debtor. The sum of the discourse is, that when we come before God, we must
lay aside all presumption. When we imagine that there is any good thing in us,
we need not wonder if he reject us, as we thus take away from him a principal
part of the honor which is his due. But, on the contrary, if we acknowledge that
all the services which we can yield him are in themselves things of nought, and
undeserving of any recompense, this humility is as a perfume of a sweet odour,
which will procure for them acceptance with
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto the saints who are on
the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Almost all are agreed in
understanding this place, as if David, after the sentence which we have just now
been considering, had added, The only way of serving God aright is to endeavor
to do good to his holy servants. And the truth is, that God, as our good deeds
cannot extend to him, substitutes the saints in his place, towards whom we are
to exercise our charity. When men, therefore, mutually exert themselves in doing
good to one another, this is to yield to God right and acceptable service. We
ought, doubtless, to extend our charity even to those who are unworthy of it, as
our heavenly Father</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"maketh his sun to rise
on the evil and on the good,"<i>

5:45;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but David justly prefers the saints to others, and
places them in a higher rank. This, then, as I have said in the commencement, is
the common opinion of almost all
interpreters.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa291</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But although I do not deny that this
doctrine is comprehended under the words of David, I think he goes somewhat
farther, and intimates that he will unite himself with the devout worshippers of
God, and be their associate or companion; even as all the children of God ought
to be joined together by the bond of fraternal unity, that they may all serve
and call upon their common Father with the same affection and
zeal.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa292</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We thus see that David, after having
confessed that he can find nothing in himself to bring to God, seeing he is
indebted to him for every thing which he has, sets his affections upon the
saints, because it is the will of God that, in this world, he should be
magnified and exalted in the assembly of the just, whom he has adopted into his
family for this end, that they may live together with one accord under his
authority, and under the guidance of his Holy Spirit. This passage, therefore,
teaches us that there is no sacrifice more acceptable to God than when we
sincerely and heartily connect ourselves with the society of the righteous, and
being knit together by the sacred bond of godliness, cultivate and maintain with
them brotherly good-will. In this consists the communion of saints which
separates them from the degrading pollutions of the world, that they may be the
holy and peculiar people of God. He expressly speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the saints who are on the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because it is the will of God
that, even in this world, there should be conspicuous marks, and as it were
visible escutcheons,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa293</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of his glory, which may serve to
conduct us to himself. The faithful, therefore, bear his image, that, by their
example, we may be stirred up to meditation upon the heavenly life. For the same
reason, the Psalmist calls them <i>excellent, </i>or honorable, because there is
nothing which ought to be more precious to us than righteousness and holiness,
in which the brightness of God's Spirit shines forth; just as we are commanded
in the preceding psalm to prize and honor those who fear God. We ought,
therefore, highly to value and esteem the true and devoted servants of God, and
to regard nothing as of greater importance than to connect ourselves with their
society; and this we will actually do if we wisely reflect in what true
excellence and dignity consist, and do not allow the vain splendor of the world
and its deceitful pomps to dazzle our
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

true way of maintaining brotherly concord with the saints, by declaring that he
will have nothing to do with unbelievers and the superstitious. We cannot be
united into the one body of the Church under God, if we do not break off all the
bonds of impiety, separate ourselves from idolaters, and keep ourselves pure and
at a distance from all the pollutions which corrupt and vitiate the holy service
of God. This is certainly the general drift of David's discourse. But as to the
words there is a diversity of opinion among expositors. Some translate the first
word of the verse
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twbx[</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
atsboth, </i>by <i>idols,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa297</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and according to this rendering
the meaning is, that after men in their folly have once begun to make to
themselves false gods, their madness breaks forth without measure, until they
accumulate an immense multitude of deities. As,<i> </i>however, this word is
here put in the feminine gender, I prefer translating it <i>sorrows or troubles,
</i>although it may still have various meanings. Some think it is an
imprecation, and they read, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let
their sorrows be multiplied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if
David, inflamed with a holy zeal, denounced the just vengeance of God against
the superstitious. Others, whose opinions I prefer, do not change the tense of
the verb, which in the Hebrew is future,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their sorrows shall be
multiplied;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but to me they do not seem
to express, with sufficient clearness, what kind of sorrows David intends. They
say,<i> </i>indeed, that wretched idolaters are perpetually adding to their new
inventions, in doing which, they miserably torment themselves. But I am of
opinion, that by this word there is, at the same time, denoted the end and issue
of the pains which they take in committing it; it points out that they not only
put themselves to trouble without any profit or advantage, but also miserably
harass and busy themselves to accomplish their own destruction. As an incitement
to him to withdraw himself farther from their company, he takes this as an
incontrovertible principle, that, so far from deriving any advantage from their
vain superstitions, they only, by their strenuous efforts in practising them,
involve themselves in greater misery and wretchedness. For what must be the
issue with respect to those miserable men who willingly surrender themselves as
bond-slaves to the devil, but to be disappointed of their hope? even as God
complains in Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:13,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"They have forsaken me
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
that can hold no water."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the next clause there is also some ambiguity. The
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rhm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mahar, </i>which we have translated <i>to offer, </i>in the conjugation
<i>kal </i>signifies <i>to endow, </i>or <i>to give. </i>But as, in the
conjugation <i>hiphil, </i>it is more frequently taken for <i>to run, </i>or
<i>to make haste,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>many have preferred this latter
meaning, and interpret the clause thus, that superstitious persons eagerly
hasten after strange gods. And in fact we see them rushing into their idolatries
with all the impetuosity and recklessness of madmen running in the
fields;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa299</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the prophets often upbraid them for
this inconsiderate frenzy with which they are fired. I would, therefore, be much
disposed to adopt this sense were it supported by the common usage of the
language; but as grammarians observe that there is not to be found another
similar passage in Scripture, I have followed, in my translation, the first
opinion. In short, the sum of what the Psalmist says is this, That unbelievers,
who lavish and squander away their substance upon their idols, not only lose all
the gifts and offerings which they present to them, but also, by provoking the
wrath of God against themselves, are continually increasing the amount of their
miseries. Perhaps, also, the prophet has an allusion to the common doctrine of
Scripture, that idolaters violate the promise of the spiritual marriage
contracted with the true God, and enter into covenant with
idols.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa300</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Ezekiel
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
16:33) justly upbraids the Jews, in that while the custom is for the lover to
allure the harlot with presents, they, on the contrary, offered rewards to the
idols to whom they prostituted and abandoned themselves. But the meaning which
we have above given brings out the spirit of the passage, namely, that
unbelievers, who honor their false gods by offering to them gifts, not only lose
what is thus expended, but also heap up for themselves sorrows upon sorrows,
because at last the issue will be miserable and ruinous to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not taste their
libations of blood.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By libations of
blood some understand that there is a reference to sacrifices made of things
acquired by murder or rapine. As,<i> </i>however, the prophet is not here
inveighing against cruel and bloodthirsty men, but condemns, in general, all
false and corrupt religious worship; and again, as he does not directly name
sacrifices, but expressly speaks of the ceremony of taking the cup, and tasting
a little of it, which was observed in offering
sacrifices,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa301</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have no doubt but that to this
ceremony, as it was observed according to the law of God, he here tacitly
opposes the drinking of blood in heathen sacrifices. We know that God, in order
to teach his ancient people to hold in greater abhorrence murder and all
cruelty, forbade them to eat or to drink blood either in their common food or in
sacrifices. On the contrary, the histories of the heathen nations bear testimony
that the custom of tasting the blood in their sacrifices prevailed among them.
David, therefore, protests, that he will not only keep himself uncontaminated by
the corrupt and false opinions by which idolaters are seduced, but that he will
also take care not to show outwardly any token of his complying with or
approving them. In the same sense we are to understand what follows immediately
after, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not take their
names in my lips.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This implies that he
will hold idols in such hatred and detestation, as to keep himself from naming
them as from execrable treason against the majesty of heaven. Not that it is
unlawful to pronounce their names, which we frequently meet with in the writings
of the prophets, but David felt he could not otherwise more forcibly express the
supreme horror and detestation with which the faithful ought to regard false
gods. This is also shown by the form of expression which he employs, using the
relative only, <i>their names, </i>although he has not expressly stated before
that he is speaking of idols. Thus, by his example, he enjoins believers not
only to beware of errors and wicked opinions, but also to abstain from all
appearance of giving their consent to them. He evidently speaks of external
ceremonies, which indicate either the true religion, or some perverse
superstition. If, then, it is unlawful for the faithful to show any token of
consenting to or complying with the superstitions of idolaters, Nicodemuses (who
falsely call themselves by this name</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa302</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) must not think to shelter themselves
under the frivolous pretext that they have not renounced the faith, but keep it
hidden within their hearts, when they join in the observance of the profane
superstitions of the Papists. Some understand the words <i>strangers </i>and
<i>their names, </i>as denoting the worshippers of false gods; but in my
judgment David rather means the false gods themselves. The scope of his
discourse is this:The earth is filled with an immense
accumulation</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa303</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of superstitions in every possible
variety, and idolaters are lavish beyond all bounds in ornamenting their idols;
but the good and the holy will ever regard all their superstitious inventions
with abhorrence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
16:5-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> Jehovah is the portion of
mine inheritance, and of my cup; thou sustainest my lot. <b>6.</b> The lines
have fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
heritage.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord is the portion of
mine inheritance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist
explains his sentiments more clearly. He shows the reason why he separates
himself from idolaters, and resolves to continue in the church of God, why he
shuns, with abhorrence, all participation in their errors, and cleaves to the
pure worship of God; namely, because he rests in the only true God as his
portion. The unhappy restlessness of those blind
idolaters</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa304</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whom we see going astray, and running
about as if stricken and impelled by madness, is doubtless to be traced to their
destitution of the true knowledge of God. All who have not their foundation and
trust in God must necessarily be often in a state of irresolution and
uncertainty; and those who do not hold the true faith in such a manner as to be
guided and governed by it, must be often carried away by the overflowing floods
of errors which prevail in the world.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa305</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This passage teaches us, that none are
taught aright in true godliness but those who reckon God alone sufficient for
their happiness. David, by calling God <i>the portion of his lot, </i>and <i>his
inheritance, </i>and <i>his cup, </i>protests that he is so fully satisfied with
him alone, as neither to covet any thing besides him, nor to be excited by any
depraved desires. Let us therefore learn, when God offers himself to us, to
embrace him with the whole heart, and to seek in him only all the ingredients
and the fullness of our happiness. All the superstitions which have ever
prevailed in the world have undoubtedly proceeded from this source, that
superstitious men have not been contented with possessing God alone. But we do
not actually possess him unless "he is the portion of our inheritance;" in other
words, unless we are wholly devoted to him, so as no longer to have any desire
unfaithfully to depart from him. For this reason, God, when he upbraids the Jews
who had wandered from him as
apostates,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa306</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with having run about after idols,
addresses them thus, "Let<i> </i>them be thine inheritance, and thy portion." By
these words he shows, that if we do not reckon him alone an all-sufficient
portion for us, and if we will have idols along with
him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa307</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he gives place entirely to them, and
lets them have the full possession of our hearts. David here employs three
metaphors; he first compares God to an inheritance; secondly, to a cup; and,
thirdly, he represents him as He who defends and keeps him in possession of his
inheritance. By the first metaphor he alludes to the heritages of the land of
Canaan, which we know were divided among the Jews by divine appointment, and the
law commanded every one to be content with the portion which had fallen to him.
By the word <i>cup </i>is denoted either the revenue of his own proper
inheritance, or by synecdoche, ordinary food by which life is sustained, seeing
drink is a part of our nourishment.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa308</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is as if David had said, God is mine
both in respect of property and enjoyment. Nor is the third comparison
superfluous. It often happens that rightful owners are put out of their
possession because no one defends them. But while God has given himself to us
for an inheritance, he has engaged to exercise his power in maintaining us in
the safe enjoyment of a good so inconceivably great. It would be of little
advantage to us to have once obtained him as ours, if he did not secure our
possession of him against the assaults which Satan daily makes upon us. Some
explain the third clause as if it had been said, <i>Thou art my ground in which
my portion is situated; </i>but this sense appears to me to be cold and
unsatisfactory.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
lines</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa309</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> have fallen to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist confirms more fully
what he had already said in the preceding verse with respect to his resting,
with a composed and tranquil mind, in God alone; or rather, he so glories in God
as nobly to despise all that the world imagines to be excellent and desirable
without him. By magnifying God in such honorable and exalted strains, he gives
us to understand that he does not desire any thing more as his portion and
felicity. This doctrine may be profitable to us in many ways. It ought to draw
us away not only from all the perverse inventions of superstition, but also from
all the allurements of the flesh and of the world. Whenever, therefore, those
things present themselves to us which would lead us away from resting in God
alone, let us make use of this sentiment as an antidote against them, that we
have sufficient cause for being contented, since he who has in himself an
absolute fullness of all good has given himself to be enjoyed by us. In this way
we will experience our condition to be always pleasant and comfortable; for he
who has God as his portion is destitute of nothing which is requisite to
constitute a happy life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
16:7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> I will magnify Jehovah, who
giveth me counsel; even in the night my reins instruct
me.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa310	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino">Last of all, David confesses
that it was entirely owing to the pure grace of God that he had come to possess
so great a good, and that he had been made a partaker of it by faith. It would
be of no advantage to us for God to offer himself freely and graciously to us,
if we did not receive him by faith, seeing he invites to himself both the
reprobate and the elect in common; but the former, by their ingratitude, defraud
themselves of this inestimable blessing. Let us, therefore, know that both these
things proceed from the free liberality of God; first, his being our
inheritance, and next, our coming to the possession of him by faith. The
<i>counsel </i>of which David makes mention is the inward illumination of the
Holy Spirit, by which we are prevented from rejecting the salvation to which he
calls us, which we would otherwise certainly do, considering the blindness of
our flesh.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa311</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whence we gather, that those who
attribute to the free will of man the choice of accepting or rejecting the grace
of God basely mangle that grace, and show as much ignorance as impiety. That
this discourse of David ought not to be understood of external teaching appears
clearly from the words, for he tells us that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he was instructed in the
night</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when he was removed from the sight
of men. Again, when he speaks of this being done
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
reins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he doubtless means secret
inspirations.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa312</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Farther, it ought to be carefully
observed, that, in speaking of the time when he was instructed, he uses the
plural number, saying, it was done in the <i>nights. </i>By this manner of
speaking, he not only ascribes to God the beginning of faith, but acknowledges
that he is continually making progress under his tuition; and, indeed, it is
necessary for God, during the whole of our life, to continue to correct the
vanity of our minds, to kindle the light of faith into a brighter flame, and by
every means to advance us higher in the attainments of spiritual
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
16:8-9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> I have set Jehovah
continually before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
<b>9.</b> Therefore my heart</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa313</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is glad, my tongue rejoiceth; my flesh
also dwelleth in confidence, [or in
security.]	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have set Jehovah,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist again shows the
firmness and stability of his faith. To set God before us is nothing else than
to keep all our senses bound and captive, that they may not run out and go
astray after any other object. We must look to him with other eyes than those of
the flesh, for we shall seldom be able to perceive him unless we elevate our
minds above the world; and faith prevents us from turning our back upon him. The
meaning, therefore, is, that David kept his mind so intently fixed upon the
providence of God, as to be fully persuaded, that whenever any difficulty or
distress should befall him, God would be always at hand to assist him. He adds,
also, <i>continually, </i>to show us how he constantly depended upon the
assistance of God, so that, amidst the various conflicts with which he was
agitated, no fear of danger could make him turn his eyes to any other quarter
than to God in search of succor. And thus we ought so to depend upon God as to
continue to be fully persuaded of his being near to us, even when he seems to be
removed to the greatest distance from us. When we shall have thus turned our
eyes towards him, the masks and the vain illusions of this world will no longer
deceive us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he is at
my right hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I read this second clause
as a distinct sentence from the preceding. To connect them together as some do
in this way, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have set the Lord
continually before me, because he is at my right
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>would give a meagre meaning to the
words, and take away much of the truth which is taught in them, as it would make
David to say, that he measured God's presence according to the experience he had
of it; a mode of speaking which would not be at all becoming. I consider,
therefore, the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have set
the Lord continually before me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as a
complete sentence, and David set the Lord before him for the purpose of
constantly repairing to him in all his dangers. For his greater encouragement to
hope well, he sets before himself what it is to have God's assistance and
fatherly care, namely, that it implies his keeping firm and unmoved his own
people with whom he is present. David then reckons himself secure against all
dangers, and promises himself certain safety, because, with the eyes of faith,
he beholds God as present with him. From this passage we are furnished with an
argument which overthrows the fabrication of the
Sorbonists,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa314</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>that the faithful are in doubt with
respect to their final perseverance; </i>for David, in very plain terms, extends
his reliance on the grace of God to the time to come. And, certainly, it would
be a very miserable condition to be in, to tremble in uncertainty every moment,
having no assurance of the continuance of the grace of God towards
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore my heart is
glad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse the Psalmist
commends the inestimable fruit of faith, of which Scripture every where makes
mention, in that, by placing us under the protection of God, it makes us not
only to live in the enjoyment of mental tranquillity, but, what is more, to live
joyful and cheerful. The principal, the essential part of a happy life, as we
know, is to possess tranquillity of conscience and of mind; as, on the contrary,
there is no greater infelicity than to be tossed amidst a multiplicity of cares
and fears.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the ungodly, however much
intoxicated with the spirit of thoughtlessness or stupidity, never experience
true joy or serene mental peace; they rather feel terrible agitations within,
which often come upon them and trouble them, so much as to constrain them to
awake from their lethargy. In short, calmly to rejoice is the lot of no man but
of him who has learned to place his confidence in God alone, and to commit his
life and safety to his protection. When, therefore, encompassed with innumerable
troubles on all sides, let us be persuaded, that the only remedy is to direct
our eyes towards God; and if we do this, faith will not only tranquillise our
minds, but also replenish them with fullness of joy. David, however, not only
affirms that he is glad inwardly; he also makes his <i>tongue, </i>yea, even
his<i> flesh, </i>sharers of this joy. And not without cause, for true believers
not only have this spiritual joy in the secret affection of their heart, but
also manifest it by the tongue, inasmuch as they glory in God as He who protects
them and secures their salvation. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwbk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kabod, </i>properly signifies glory and excellence. I have, however, no doubt
of its being here taken for <i>the
tongue,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa315</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as it is in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:6; for otherwise the division which is obviously made in this verse of the
person into three parts is not so distinct and evident. Farther, although the
body is not free from inconveniences and troubles, yet as God defends and
maintains not only our souls, but also our bodies, David does not speak
groundlessly when he represents the blessing of dwelling in safety as extending
to his flesh in common with his
soul.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
16:10	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10. </b>For thou wilt not leave my
soul in the grave; neither wilt thou make thy Holy One to see the
pit.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa316	</font></sup><br><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist goes on to explain
still more fully the preceding doctrine, by declaring that as he is not afraid
of death, there is nothing wanting which is requisite to the completion of his
joy. Whence it follows, that no one truly trusts in God but he who takes such
hold of the salvation which God has promised him as to despise death. Moreover,
it is to be observed, that David's language is not to be limited to some
particular kind of deliverance, as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
49:15, where he says, "God hath redeemed my soul from the power of the grave,"
and in other similar passages; but he entertains the undoubted assurance of
eternal salvation, which freed him from all anxiety and fear. It is as if he had
said, There will always be ready for me a way of escape from the grave, that I
may not remain in corruption. God, in delivering his people from any danger,
prolongs their life only for a short time; but how slender and how empty a
consolation would it be to obtain some brief respite, and to take breath for a
short time, until death, coming at last, should terminate the course of our
life,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and swallow us up without any hope of
deliverance? Hence it appears that when David spake thus, he raised his mind
above the common lot of mankind. As the sentence has been pronounced upon all
the children of Adam, "Dust<i> </i>thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:19,) the same condition in this respect awaits them all without exception. If,
therefore, Christ, who is the first-fruits of those who rise again, does not
come forth from the grave, they will remain for ever under the bondage of
corruption. From this Peter justly concludes,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:30,) that David could not have gloried in this manner but by the spirit of
prophecy; and unless he had had a special respect to the Author of life, who was
promised to him, who alone was to be honored with this privilege in its fullest
sense. This, however, did not prevent David from assuring himself of exemption
from the dominion of death by right, seeing Christ, by his rising from the dead,
obtained immortality not for himself individually, but for us all. As to the
point, that Peter
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:30) and Paul
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:33) contend that this prophecy was fulfilled in the person of Christ
alone,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa318</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the sense in which we must understand
them is this, that he was wholly and perfectly exempted from the corruption of
the grave, that he might call his members into his fellowship, and make them
partakers of this blessing,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa319</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> although by degrees, and each according
to his measure. As the body of David, after death, was, in the course of time,
reduced to dust, the apostles justly conclude that he was not exempted from
corruption. It is the same with respect to all the faithful, not one of whom
becomes a partaker of incorruptible life without being first subjected to
corruption. From this it follows that the fullness of life which resides in the
head alone, namely, in Christ, falls down upon the members only in drops, or in
small portions. The question, however, may be asked, as Christ descended into
the grave, was not he also subject to corruption? The answer is easy. The
etymology or derivation of the two words here used to express the grave should
be carefully attended to. The grave is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwa&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
sheol, </i>being as it were an insatiable gulf, which devours and consumes all
things, and the pit is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shachath, </i>which signifies <i>corruption. </i>These words, therefore, here
denote not so much the place as the quality and condition of the place, as if it
had been said, The life of Christ will be exempted from the dominion of the
grave, inasmuch as his body, even when dead, will not be subject to corruption.
Besides, we know that the grave of Christ was filled, and as it were embalmed
with the life-giving perfume of his Spirit, that it might be to him the gate to
immortal glory. Both the Greek and Latin Fathers, I confess, have strained these
words to a meaning wholly different, referring them to the bringing back of the
soul of Christ from hell. But it is better to adhere to the natural simplicity
of the interpretation which I have given, that we may not make ourselves objects
of ridicule, to the Jews; and farther, that one subtilty, by engendering many
others, may not involve us in a labyrinth. In the second clause mention is
without doubt made of the body; and we know it to be a mode of speaking very
common with David intentionally to repeat the same thing twice, making a slight
variation as to words. It is true, we translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nephesh, </i>by <i>soul, </i>but in Hebrew it only signifies <i>the vital
breath, </i>or <i>life
itself</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
16:11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11. </b>Thou wilt make me to know
the path of life; fullness of joy is in thy countenance, pleasures are at thy
right hand for evermore.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist
confirms the statement made in the preceding verse, and explains the way in
which God will exempt him from the bondage of death, namely, by conducting and
bringing him at length safely to the possession of eternal life. Whence we again
learn what I have already observed, that this passage touches upon the
difference which there is between true believers and aliens, or reprobates, with
respect to their everlasting state. It is a mere cavil to say, that when David
here speaks of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the path of
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>being shown to him, it means the
prolongation of his natural life. It is to form a very low estimate, indeed, of
the grace of God to speak of him as a guide to his people in the path of life
only for a very few years in this world. In this case, they would differ nothing
from the reprobate, who enjoy the light of the sun in common with them. If,
therefore, it is the special grace of God which he communicates to none but his
own children, that David here magnifies and exalts, the showing of the way of
life, of which he speaks, must undoubtedly be viewed as extending to a blessed
immortality; and, indeed, he only knows the way of life who is so united to God
that he lives in God, and cannot live without
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">David next adds, that when God is
reconciled to us, we have all things which are necessary to perfect happiness.
The phrase, <i>the countenance of God, </i>may be understood either of our being
beheld by him, or of our beholding him; but I consider both these ideas as
included, for his fatherly favor, which he displays in looking upon us with a
serene countenance, precedes this joy, and is the first cause of it, and yet
this does not cheer us until, on our part, we behold it shining upon us. By this
clause David also intended distinctly to express to whom those <i>pleasures
</i>belong, of which God has in his hand a full and an overflowing abundance. As
there are with God pleasures sufficient to replenish and satisfy the whole
world, whence comes it to pass that a dismal and deadly darkness envelopes the
greater part of mankind, but because God does not look upon all men equally with
his friendly and fatherly countenance, nor opens the eyes of all men to seek the
matter of their joy in him, and no where else? <i>Fulness of joy </i>is
contrasted with the evanescent allurements and pleasures of this transitory
world, which, after having diverted their miserable votaries for a time, leave
them at length unsatisfied, famished, and disappointed. They may intoxicate and
glut themselves with pleasures to the greatest excess, but, instead of being
satisfied, they rather become wearied of them through loathing; and, besides,
the pleasures of this world vanish away like dreams. David, therefore, testifies
that true and solid joy in which the minds of men may rest will never be found
any where else but in God; and that, therefore, none but the faithful, who are
contented with his grace alone, can be truly and perfectly
happy.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
17.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm contains a mournful complaint against the
cruel pride of David's enemies. He protests that he did not deserve to be
persecuted with such inhumanity, inasmuch as he had given them no cause for
exercising their cruelty against him. At the same time, he beseeches God, as his
protector, to put forth his power for his deliverance. The inscription of the
psalm does not refer to any particular time, but it is probable that David here
complains of Saul and his associates.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear my righteousness, O
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist begins the psalm
by setting forth the goodness of his cause. He does this because God has
promised that he will not suffer the innocent to be oppressed, but will always,
at length, succor them. Some explain the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as denoting <i>righteous prayer, </i>an interpretation which appears to me
unsatisfactory. The meaning rather is, that David, confiding in his own
integrity, interposes God as a Judge between himself and his enemies, to
cognosce or determine in his cause. We have already seen, in a preceding psalm,
that when we have to deal with wicked men, we may warrantably protest our
innocence before God. As, however, it would not be enough for the faithful to
have the approving testimony of a good conscience, David adds to his
protestation earnest prayer. Even irreligious persons may often be able justly
to boast of having a good cause; but as they do not acknowledge that the world
is governed by the providence of God, they content themselves with enjoying the
approbation of their own conscience, as they speak, and, gnawing the bit, bear
the injuries which are done to them rather obstinately than steadfastly, seeing
they do not seek for any consolation in faith and prayer. But the faithful not
only depend upon the goodness of their cause, they also commit it to God that he
may defend and maintain it; and whenever any adversity befalls them, they betake
themselves to him for help. This, therefore, is the meaning of the passage; it
is a prayer that God, who knew David to have done justly, and to have performed
his duty without giving occasion to any to blame
him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa323</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, therefore, to be unrighteously
molested by his enemies, would graciously look upon him; and that he would do
this especially, since, confiding in his aid, he entertained good hope, and, at
the same time, prays to him with a sincere heart. By the words <i>cry </i>and
<i>prayer </i>he means the same thing; but the word <i>cry, </i>and the
repetition of what it denotes, by a different expression, serve to show his
vehement, his intense earnestness of soul. Farther, as hypocrites talk loftily
in commendation of themselves, and to show to others a token of the great
confidence which they have in God, give utterance to loud cries, David protests
concerning himself that he does not speak <i>deceitfully; </i>in other words,
that he does not make use of his crying and prayer as a pretext for covering his
sins, but comes into the presence of God with sincerity of heart. By this form
of prayer the Holy Spirit teaches us, that we ought diligently to endeavor to
live an upright and innocent life, so that, if there are any who give us
trouble, we may be able to boast that we are blamed and persecuted
wrongfully.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa324</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Again, whenever the wicked assault us,
the same Spirit calls upon us to engage in prayer; and if any man, trusting to
the testimony of a good conscience which he enjoys, neglects the exercise of
prayer, he defrauds God of the honor which belongs to him, in not referring his
cause to him, and in not leaving him to judge and determine in it. Let us learn,
also, that when we present ourselves before God in prayer, it is not to be done
with the ornaments of an artificial eloquence, for the finest rhetoric and the
best grace which we can have before him consists in pure
simplicity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the presence of thy
countenance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Literally it is, <i>from
before thy face, </i>or, <i>before thy face. </i>By these words David intimates
that if God does not rise up as the vindicator of his cause, he will be
overwhelmed with calumnies though innocent, and will be looked upon as a guilty
and condemned person. The cognisance which God will take of his cause is tacitly
set in opposition to the dark inventions of falsehood which were spread against
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa325</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> His language is as if he had said, I do
not ask for any other judge but God, nor do I shrink from standing before his
judgment-seat,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since I bring with me both a pure heart
and a good cause. What he immediately adds with respect to God's <i>looking upon
</i>his uprightness is of similar import. He does not mean to say that God is
blind, but only beseeches him actually to show that he does not connive at the
wickedness of men, and that it is not to him a matter of indifference when he
beholds those who have not the means of defending
themselves</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa327</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> receiving evil treatment undeservedly.
Some take the word<i> judgment </i>in too restricted a sense for the right to
the kingdom which was promised to David, as if he petitioned to be placed on the
royal throne by the power of God, inasmuch as he had been chosen by him to be
king, and had also, in his name and by his authority, been anointed to this
office by the hand of Samuel. The meaning which I attach to David's language is
simply this, that being oppressed with many and varied wrongs, he commits
himself to the protection and defense of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
17:3-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> Thou hast proved my heart;

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast proved my
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some are of opinion that in the
three first verbs the past tense is put for the future. Others more correctly
and more clearly resolve the words thus:If thou provest my heart, and visitest
it by night, and examinest it thoroughly, there will not be found any deceit
therein. But without making any change upon the words, they may be suitably
enough explained in this way:Thou, Lord, who understandest all the secret
affections and thoughts of my heart, even as it is thy peculiar prerogative to
try men, knowest very well that I am not a double man, and do not cherish any
deceit within. What David intended to express is certainly very evident. As he
was unjustly and falsely charged with crime, and could obtain neither justice
nor humanity at the hands of men, he appeals to God, requesting he would become
judge in the matter.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa330</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But not to do this rashly, he subjects
himself to an impartial examination, seeing God,<i> </i>whose prerogative it is
to search the secret recesses of the heart, cannot be deceived by the external
appearance. The time when he declares God to have visited him is during <i>the
night, </i>because, when a man is withdrawn from the presence of his
fellow-creatures, he sees more clearly his sins, which otherwise would be hidden
from his view; just as, on the contrary, the sight of men affects us with shame,
and this is, as it were, a veil before our eyes, which prevents us from
deliberately examining our faults. It is, therefore, as if David had said, O
Lord, since the darkness of the night discovers the conscience more fully, all
coverings being then taken away, and since, at that season, the affections,
either good or bad, according to men's inclinations, manifest themselves more
freely, when there is no person present to witness and pronounce judgment upon
them; if thou then examinest me, there will be found neither disguise nor deceit
in my heart.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa331</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence we conclude how great was David's
integrity, seeing that, when purposely and leisurely taking account of his
inmost thoughts, he presents himself so boldly, to be tried by the judgment of
God. And he not only declares himself to be innocent of outward crimes, but also
free from all secret malice. So far from cherishing malicious designs, while he
covered them over with fair pretences, as his enemies alleged, he protests that
his words were a frank and undisguised representation of what was passing in his
heart:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My thought shall not pass
beyond my mouth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Our thought is said to

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As for the works of men, by

explain this verse in different senses. Some thinking that the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth, </i>which commonly signifies <i>in </i>or <i>by</i>, is taken for
<i>against, </i>render it thus:As for the works of men which they practice
against thy word. But I rather incline to the opinion of others who consider
that there is here commended a right judgment of the actions of men which is
formed according to the rule of the word of God. There are some shrewd and
ingenious persons who carefully mark the works of men, but they do not judge of
them according to the word of God. What we have as yet said does not, however,
fully give us the sense of the passage. We must still consider what the Psalmist
means when he speaks of <i>the paths of the
destroyer.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa333</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think he refers to the men
of his own company, who, if he had not restrained them, would have instantly
rushed like robbers to commit depredation; since being reduced to the greatest
distress, and seeing no prospect of an alteration to the better in their
affairs, they were become bold through despair; and we know how sharp a spur
necessity is in goading men forward in any course. But this exposition seems to
me to be forced, and therefore I rather refer the words to his enemies. Farther,
there is a diversity of opinion among interpreters with respect to the meaning
of the word <i>watched </i>or <i>observed. </i>Some understand it in this sense,
that David had done his duty in strenuously opposing outrageous men, and those
who were wickedly engaged in the work of disturbing the repose and tranquillity
of their fellow-men.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa334</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others understand it thus, that he was
careful to distinguish between good and evil, or right and wrong, that he might
not be corrupted by bad examples,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa335</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but avoid them, and, on the contrary,
practice those things which he saw to be agreeable to the word of God. But
David, I have no doubt, had a different meaning, and intended to declare, that
although wicked and malicious men provoked him to evil, he had, nevertheless,
been always restrained by the word of God, so that he kept himself from
exercising violence and inflicting injuries, or from rendering evil for
evil.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa336</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He therefore tells us, that whatever
may have been the works of men, he had been always so devoted to the word of
God, and so hung, as it were, upon his mouth, that he could not think of
allowing himself, when provoked by the injuries his enemies inflicted on him, to
act towards them as they acted towards him. We know how severe a temptation it
is, and how difficult to overcome, to disregard the manner in which men behave
themselves towards us, and to consider only what God forbids or commands us.
Even those who are naturally inclined to gentleness and
humanity,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa337</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who desire to do good to all men, and
wish to hurt nobody, whenever they are provoked, burst forth into a revengeful
mood, carried away by a blind impetuosity; especially when we see all right and
equity overthrown, the confusion so blinds us, that we begin to howl with the
wolves. If, therefore, we would have a good rule for governing ourselves, when
our enemies, by their mischievous actions, provoke us to treat them in a similar
manner, let us learn, after the example of David, to meditate upon the word of
God, and to keep our eyes fixed upon it. By this means our minds will be
preserved from ever being blinded, and we shall always avoid the paths of
wickedness, seeing God will not only keep our affections under restraint by his
commandments, but will also train them to patience by his promises. He withholds
us from doing evil to our neighbors,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa338</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not only by forbidding us, but by
declaring, at the same time, that he will take into his own hand the execution
of vengeance on those who injure us,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

the precepts of his law, the sense will be evident, namely, that although David
had spoken according to truth, in boasting of having, in the midst of the most
grievous temptations which assailed him, constantly practiced righteousness with
a pure heart, yet, conscious of his own weakness, he commits himself to God to
be governed by him, and prays for grace to enable him to persevere. His language
is as if he had said, Since hitherto, under thy guidance, I have proceeded
onward in the right path, I beseech thee, in like manner, to keep my steps from
sliding with respect to the time to come. And certainly the more any one excels
in grace,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

fa341</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to produce in us carnal confidence
which may induce carelessness. I do not altogether reject this sense, but I
think it more probable that David here beseeches God to bring his affairs to a
prosperous issue, however dark the aspect of matters was at present. The import
of his language is this, Lord, since thou seest that I walk in uprightness and
sincerity of heart, govern thou me in such a manner as to make all men see that
thou art my protector and guardian, and leave me not to be cast down at the will
of my enemies. Thus, by <i>the paths of the Lord, </i>he will mean not the
doctrine by which our life is regulated, but the power by which God upholds us,
and the protection by which he preserves us. And he addresses God in this
manner, not only because all events are in his hand, but because when he takes
care of us all things in our lot go on prosperously. When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the soles of my feet may not

events which threaten us every moment, and to the danger we are in of perishing,

encouragement to pray, because, depending upon the promise of God, he hoped that
his prayers would not be in vain. But, perhaps, it may be thought preferable to
change the tense of the verb as some do, so as to give this meaning, I will

exposition what appears to me the more simple. David, in my judgment, here
encourages and animates himself to call upon God, from the confident hope of
being heard, as if he had said, Since I call upon thee, surely, O God, thou wilt
not despise my prayers. Immediately after he beseeches God to bestow upon him

be desperate. If, then, the translation, <i>separate and set apart thy mercy,

servant David the special grace which he communicates to none but his chosen
ones. While God involves both the good and the bad in danger indiscriminately,
he at length shows, by the different issue of things, in regard to the two
classes, that he does not confusedly mingle the chaff and the wheat together,
seeing he gathers his own people into a company by themselves,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:12, and
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
25:32.) I, however, prefer following another exposition. David, in my judgment,
perceiving that he could only be delivered from the perilous circumstances in
which he was placed by singular and extraordinary means, betakes himself to the
wonderful or miraculous power of God. Those who think he desires God to withhold
his grace from his persecutors do too great violence to the scope of the
passage. By this circumstance there is expressed the extreme danger to which
David was exposed; for otherwise it would have been enough for him to have been
succoured in the ordinary and common way in which God is accustomed daily to
favor and to aid his own people. The grievousness of his distress, therefore,
constrained him to beseech God to work miraculously for his deliverance. The
title with which he here honors God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O thou preserver of those who
trust [in thee,]</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>serves to confirm him
in the certain hope of obtaining his requests. As God takes upon him the charge
of saving all who confide in him, David being one of their number, could upon
good ground assure himself of safety and deliverance. Whenever, therefore, we
approach God, let the first thought impressed on our minds be, that as he is not
in vain called the preserver of those who trust in him, we have no reason
whatever to be afraid of his not being ready to succor us, provided our faith
continue firmly to rely upon his grace. And if every way of deliverance is shut
up, let us also at the same time remember that he is possessed of wonderful and
inconceivable means of succouring us, which serve so much the more conspicuously
to magnify and manifest his power. But as the participle <i>trusting, </i>or
<i>hoping, </i>is put without any additional word expressing the object of this
trust or hope,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa345</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> some interpreters connect it with the
last words of the verse, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
right hand,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if the order of the words
were inverted. They, therefore, resolve them thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O thou preserver of those who
trust in thy right hand, from those who rise up against
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As<i> </i>this, however, is harsh and
strained, and the exposition which I have given is more natural, and more
generally received,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa346</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> let us follow it. To express,
therefore, the meaning in one sentence, the Psalmist attributes to God the
office of defending and preserving his own people from all the ungodly who rise
up to assault them, and who, if it were in their power, would destroy them. And
the ungodly are here said </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
exalt themselves against the hand of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because, in molesting the faithful whom God has taken under his protection,
they openly wage war against him. The doctrine contained in these words, namely,
that when we are molested, an outrage is committed upon God in our person, is a
very profitable one; for having once declared himself to be the guardian and
protector of our welfare, whenever we are unjustly assailed, he puts forth his
hand before us as a shield of defense.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The two
similitudes which David has subjoined in the following verse, respecting <i>the
apple of the eye, </i>and the little birds which the mother keeps <i>under her
wings,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa347</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are introduced for illustrating
the same subject. God, to express the great care which he has of his own people,
compares himself to a hen and other fowls, which spread out their wings to
cherish and cover their young, and declares them to be no less dear to him than
the apple of the eye, which is the tenderest part of the body, is to man; it
follows, therefore, that whenever men rise up to molest and injure the
righteous, war is waged against him. As this form of prayer was put into the
mouth of David by the Holy Spirit, it is to be regarded as containing in it a
promise. We have here presented to our contemplation a singular and an
astonishing proof of the goodness of God, in humbling himself so far, and in a
manner so to speak, transforming himself, in order to lift up our faith above
the conceptions of the flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the face of the
ungodly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist, by again accusing
his enemies, intends to set forth his own innocence, as an argument for his
obtaining the favor of God. At the same time, he complains of their cruelty,
that God may be the more inclined to aid him. First, he says that they burn with
an enraged desire to waste and to destroy him; secondly, he adds, that they
<i>besiege him in his soul, </i>by which he means, that they would never rest
satisfied until they had accomplished his death. The greater, therefore, the
terror with which we are stricken by the cruelty of our enemies, the more ought
we to be quickened to ardor in prayer. God, indeed, does not need to receive
information and incitement from us; but the use and the end of prayer is, that
the faithful, by freely declaring to God the calamities and sorrows which
oppress them, and in disburdening them, as it were, into his bosom, may be
assured beyond all doubt that he has a regard to their
necessities.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
17:10-12	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10. </b>They have inclosed
themselves in their own fat,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa348</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they have spoken proudly with their
mouth. <b>11.</b> They have now compassed me round about in our steps; they have
fixed their eyes to cast down to the ground. <b>12.</b> The likeness of him is

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have inclosed themselves in

is given by others is considered preferable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have inclosed their own
fat,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning will be quite the same.
Some Jewish interpreters explain the words thus:that being stuffed with fat, and
their throat being, as it were, choked with it, they were unable to speak
freely; but this is a very meagre and unsatisfactory exposition. By the word
<i>fat, </i>I think, is denoted the pride with which they were filled and
swollen, as it were, with fatness. It is a very appropriate and expressive
metaphor to represent them as having their hearts choked up with pride, in the
manner in which corpulent persons are affected from the fat within
them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa349</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David complains of their being puffed
up with their wealth and pleasures, and accordingly we see the ungodly, the more
luxuriously they are pampered, conducting themselves the more outrageously and
proudly. But I think there is described by the word <i>fat </i>an inward vice
namely, their being inclosed on all sides with arrogance and presumption, and
their having become utter strangers to every feeling of
humanity.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa350</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Psalmist next declares that this is
abundantly manifested in their language. In short, his meaning is, that inwardly
they swell with pride, and that they take no pains to conceal it, as appears
from the high swelling words to which they give utterance. When it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have spoken proudly with
their mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the word <i>mouth </i>is
not a pleonasm, as it often is in other places; for David means, that with
mouths widely opened they pour forth scornful and contemptuous language, which
bears testimony to the pride which dwells within
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have now compassed me round
about in our steps.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist
confirms what he has said before concerning the furious passion for doing
mischief with which his enemies were inflamed. He says they were so cruelly bent
on accomplishing his destruction, that in whatever way he directed or altered
his course, they ceased not to follow close upon him. When he says <i>our steps,
</i>he doubtless comprehends his own companions, although he immediately after
returns to speak of himself alone; unless, perhaps, another reading is
preferred, for some copies have
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnwbbs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sebabunu, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
compassed us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in the plural number.
This, however, is not a matter of great importance. David simply complains, that
unless God stretch forth his hand from heaven to deliver him, there now remains
for him no way of escape, seeing his enemies, whenever he stirs his foot to
avoid their fury, immediately pursue him, and watch all his steps. By the adverb
<i>now, </i>he intimates not only that he is at present in very great danger,
but also that at every moment his enemies, in whatever way he turns himself,
pursue and press hard upon him. In the last clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have fixed their eyes to
cast down to the ground</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>some consider
David as comparing his enemies to hunters, who, with eyes fixed on the ground,
are silently looking with eager desire for their prey. They, therefore, think
that by the eyes fixed on the ground is denoted the gesture or attitude of
David's adversaries, and certainly crafty and malicious men have their
countenance often fixed on the ground. According to others, whose opinion is
nearer the spirit of the passage, this form of expression signifies the
continual and unwearied ardor by which the ungodly are impelled to turn all
things upside down. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To fix their
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore, is nothing else than to
apply all their ingenuity, and put forth all their efforts. What follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to cast down to the
ground</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is the same thing as to
overthrow. The ungodly, as if they must necessarily fall, should the world
continue to stand, would wish all mankind thrown down or destroyed, and,
therefore, they exert themselves to the utmost to bring down and ruin all men.
This is explained more fully by the figurative illustration introduced in the
following verse, where they are said to be <i>like lions and lions'
whelps</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa351</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But we ought always to keep this
truth in remembrance, that the more proudly wicked men exercise their cruelty
against us, the hand of God is so much the nearer to us to oppose itself to
their savage fury; for to him alone belongs the praise of subduing and
restraining these wild beasts who delight in shedding blood. David speaks of
<i>dens, </i>or <i>secret lurking places, </i>because his enemies were deeply
skilled in artful stratagem, and had various methods of doing mischief, while
they had also at hand the power and means of executing them, so that it was
difficult to resist them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
17:13-14	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13. </b>Arise, O Jehovah,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, O
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The more furiously David was
persecuted by his enemies, he beseeches God the more earnestly to afford him
immediate aid; for he uses the word <i>face </i>to denote the swift impetuosity
of his adversary, to repress which there was need of the greatest haste. By
these words, the Holy Spirit teaches us, that when death shows itself to be just
at hand, God is provided with remedies perfectly prepared, by which he can
effect our deliverance in a moment. The Psalmist not only attributes to God the
office of delivering his people; he at the same time arms him with power to
crush and break in pieces the wicked. He does not, however, wish them to be cast
down farther than was necessary to their being humbled, that they might cease
from their outrageous and injurious conduct towards him, as we may gather from
the following clause, where he again beseeches God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to deliver his
soul</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> David would have been contented to see
them continuing in the possession of their outward ease and prosperity, had they
not abused their power by practising injustice and cruelty. Let us know then,
that God consults the good of his people when he overthrows the ungodly, and
breaks their strength; when he does this, it is for the purpose of delivering
from destruction the poor innocents who are molested by these wretched
men.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa354</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some expositors read the passage thus,
<i>From the ungodly man, who is thy
sword,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa355</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and also, <i>From the men who
are thy hand; </i>but this does not seem to me to be a proper translation. I
admit, that from whatever quarter afflictions come to us, it is the hand of God
which chastises us, and that the ungodly are the scourges he employs for this
purpose; and farther, that this consideration is very well fitted to lead us to
exercise patience. But as this manner of speaking would here be somewhat harsh,
and, at the same time, not very consistent with the prayer, I prefer adopting
the exposition which represents David's words as a prayer that God would deliver
him by his sword, and smite with his hand those men who, for too long a time,
had been in possession of power and prosperity. He contrasts God's sword with
human aids and human means of relief; and the import of his words is, If God
himself does not come forth to take vengeance, and draw his sword, there remains
for me no hope of deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From men by thy hand, O Jehovah,
from men who are from an age.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I connect
these words thus:O Lord, deliver me by thy hand, or by thy heavenly aid, from
men; I say from men whose tyranny has prevailed too long, and whom thou hast
suffered to wallow too long in the filth and draft of their prosperity. This
repetition is very emphatic; David's voice being stifled, as it were, with the
indignation which he felt at seeing such villany continuing for so long a
period, he stops all at once after uttering the first word, without proceeding
farther in the sentence which he meant to express; then, after having recovered
his breath, he declares what it is that so greatly distressed him. In the
preceding verse he had spoken in the singular number; but now he gives us to
understand that he had not only one enemy but many, and that those who were set
against him were strong and powerful, so that he saw no hope of deliverance
remaining for him except in the aid of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These words, <i>from world, </i>or <i>age,
</i>(for such is the exact literal
rendering,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz336</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) are expounded in different ways. Some
understand them as meaning <i>men who have their time, </i>as if David intended
to say that their prosperous condition would not be of long duration; but this
does not appear to me to be the proper explanation. Others suppose he means by
this expression such as are wholly devoted to the world, and whose whole
attention and thoughts are absorbed in the things of earth; and, according to
their opinion, David compares his enemies to brute beasts. In the same sense
they explain what follows immediately after, <i>Their portion is in life,
</i>language which<i> </i>they consider as applied to them, because, being
entirely destitute of the Spirit, and cleaving with their whole hearts to
transitory good things, they think of nothing better than this world. For that
in which each man places his felicity is termed his portion. As, however, the
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dlj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheled, </i>signifies <i>an age, </i>or <i>the course of a man's life,
</i>David, I doubt not, complains that his enemies had lived and enjoyed
prosperity longer than the ordinary term allotted to the life of man. The
audacity and the outrages</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz337</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> committed by wicked men might be borne
with for a short time, but when they wax wanton against God, it is very strange
indeed to see them continuing stable in their prosperous condition. That this is
the sense appears from the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>min, </i>which we have translated<i> from, </i>by which David expresses that
they were not sprung up only a few days before or lately, but that their
prosperity, which should have vanished away in a moment, had lasted for a very
long time. Such, then, is the meaning of the Psalmist, unless, perhaps, we may
understand him as denominating them <i>of the world, </i>or <i>age, </i>because
they bear the chief authority among men, and are exalted in honors and riches,
as if this world had been made for them
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their portion is in
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I explain it as meaning that they
are exempted from all troubles, and abound in pleasures; in short, that they do
not experience the common condition of other men; as, on the contrary, when a
man is oppressed with adversities, it is said of him that his portion is in
death. David therefore intimates, that it is not a reasonable thing that the
ungodly should be permitted to gad about in joy and gaiety without having any
fear of death, and to claim for themselves, as if by hereditary right, a
peaceful and happy life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What he adds
immediately after, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose belly
thou fillest with thy secret goods,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is
of the same import. We see these persons not only enjoying, in common with other
men, light, breath, food, and all other commodities of life, but we also see God
often treating them more delicately and more bountifully than others, as if he
fed them on his lap, holding them tenderly like little babes, and fondling them
more than all the rest of mankind.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz338</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Accordingly, by <i>the secret goods of
God, </i>we are here to understand the rare and more exquisite dainties which he
bestows upon them. Now, this is a severe temptation, if a man estimates the love
and favor of God by the measure of earthly prosperity which he bestows; and,
therefore, it is not to be wondered at, though David was greatly afflicted in
contemplating the prosperous condition of ungodly men. But let us remember that
he makes this holy complaint to console himself, and to mitigate his distress,
not in the way of murmuring against God and resisting his will; - let us
remember this, I say<i>, </i>that, after his example, we may learn also to
direct our groanings to heaven. Some give a more subtile exposition of what is
here called <i>God's secret goods, </i>viewing it as meaning the good things
which the ungodly devour without thinking of or regarding him who is the author
of them; or they suppose the good things of God to be called <i>secret,
</i>because the reason why God pours them forth so abundantly upon the wicked is
not apparent. But the exposition which I have given, as it is both simple and
natural, so of itself it sufficiently disproves the others. The last point in
this description is, that, by continual succession, these persons transmit their
riches to their children and their children's children. As they are not among
the number of the children of God, to whom this blessing is promised, it
follows, that when they are thus fattened, it is for the day of slaughter which
he hath appointed. The object which David therefore has in view in making this
complaint is, that God would make haste to execute vengeance, seeing they have
so long abused his liberality and gentle
treatment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
17:15	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15. </b>But as for me, I shall
behold thy face in righteousness:I shall be satisfied, when I shall awake, with
thy image, [or likeness.]	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">Having with
anguish of heart declared before God the troubles which afflicted and tormented
him, that he might not be overwhelmed with the load of temptations which pressed
upon him, he now takes, as it were, the wings of faith and rises up to a region
of undisturbed tranquillity, where he may behold all things arranged and
directed in due order. In the first place, there is here a tacit comparison
between the well regulated state of things which will be seen when God by his
judgment shall restore to order those things which are now embroiled and
confused, and the deep and distressing darkness which is in the world, when God
keeps silence, and hides his face. In the midst of those afflictions which he
has recounted, the Psalmist might seem to be plunged in darkness from which he
would never obtain deliverance.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz339</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When we see the ungodly enjoying
prosperity, crowned with honors, and loaded with riches, they seem to be in
great favor with God. But David triumphs over their proud and presumptuous
boasting; and although, to the eye of sense and reason, God has cast him off,
and removed him far from him, yet he assures himself that one day he will enjoy
the privilege of familiarly beholding him. The pronoun <i>I</i> is emphatic, as
if he had said, The calamities and reproaches which I now endure will not
prevent me from again experiencing fullness of joy from the fatherly love of God
manifested towards me. We ought carefully to observe, that David, in order to
enjoy supreme happiness, desires nothing more than to have always the taste and
experience of this great blessing that God is reconciled to him. The wicked may
imagine themselves to be happy, but so long as God is opposed to them, they
deceive themselves in indulging this imagination.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To behold God's
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is nothing else than to have a
sense of his fatherly favor, with which he not only causes us to rejoice by
removing our sorrows, but also transports us even to heaven. By the word
<i>righteousness, </i>David means that he will not be disappointed of the reward
of a good conscience. As long as God humbles his people under manifold
afflictions, the world insolently mocks at their simplicity, as if they deceived
themselves, and lost their pains in devoting themselves to the cultivation and
practice of purity and innocence.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fz340</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Against such kind of mockery and derision David is here struggling, and in
opposition to it he assures himself that there is a recompense laid up for his
godliness and uprightness, provided he continue to persevere in his obedience to
the holy law of God; as Isaiah, in like manner,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
3:10,) exhorts the faithful to support themselves from this consideration, that
"it<i> </i>shall be well with the righteous:for they shall eat the fruit of
their doings." We ought not, however, from this to think that he represents
works as the cause of his salvation. It is not his purpose to treat of what
constitutes the meritorious ground upon which he is to be received into the
favor of God. He only lays it down as a principle, that they who serve God do
not lose their labor, for although he may hide his face from them for a time, he
causes them again in due season to behold his bright
countenance</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz341</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and compassionate eye beaming upon
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall be
satisfied.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some interpreters, with more
subtility than propriety, restrict this to the resurrection at the last day, as
if David did not expect to experience in his heart a blessed
joy</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz342</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> until the life to come, and suspended
every longing desire after it until he should attain to that life. I readily
admit that this satisfaction of which he speaks will not in all respects be
perfect before the last coming of Christ; but as the saints, when God causes
some rays of the knowledge of his love to enter into their hearts, find great
enjoyment in the light thus communicated, David justly calls this peace or joy
of the Holy Spirit <i>satisfaction. </i>The ungodly may be at their ease, and
have abundance of good things, even to bursting, but as their desire is
insatiable, or as they feed upon wind, in other words, upon earthly things,
without tasting spiritual things, in which there is
substance,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz343</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or being so stupified through the
pungent remorse of conscience with which they are tormented, as not to enjoy the
good things which they possess, they never have composed and tranquil minds, but
are kept unhappy by the inward passions with which they are perplexed and
agitated. It is therefore the grace of God alone which can give us
contentment,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz344</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and prevent us from being distracted by
irregular desires. David, then, I have no doubt, has here an allusion to the
empty joys of the world, which only famish the soul, while they sharpen and
increase the appetite the more,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz345</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in order to show that those only are
partakers of true and substantial happiness who seek their felicity in the
enjoyment of God alone. As the literal rendering of the Hebrew words is, <i>I
shall be satisfied in the awaking of thy face, </i>or, <i>in awaking by thy
face; </i>some, preferring the first exposition, understand by the awaking of
God's face the breaking forth, or manifestation of the light of his grace, which
before was, as it were, covered with clouds. But to me it seems more suitable to
refer the word <i>awake </i>to David,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz346</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and to view it as meaning the same
thing as to obtain respite from his sorrow. David had never indeed been
overwhelmed with stupor; but after a lengthened period of fatigue, through the
persecution of his enemies, he must needs have been brought into such a state as
to appear sunk into a profound sleep. The saints do not sustain and repel all
the assaults which are made upon them so courageously as not, by reason of the
weakness of their flesh, to feel languid and feeble for a time, or to be
terrified, as if they were enveloped in darkness. David compares this
perturbation of mind to a sleep. But when the favor of God shall again have
arisen and shone brightly upon him, he declares that then he will recover
spiritual strength and enjoy tranquillity of mind. It is true, indeed, as Paul
declares, that so long as we continue in this state of earthly pilgrimage, "we
walk by faith, not by sight;" but as we nevertheless behold the image of God not
only in the glass of the gospel, but also in the numerous evidences of his grace
which he daily exhibits to us, let each of us awaken himself from his lethargy,
that we may now be satisfied with spiritual felicity, until God, in due time,
bring us to his own immediate presence, and cause us to enjoy him face to
face.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
18.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We all know through what difficulties and almost
insurmountable obstacles David came to the kingdom. Even to the time of Saul's
death he was a fugitive, and, as it were, an outlaw, and wearily passed his life
in fear, amidst many threatenings and dangers of death. After God had, with his
own hand, placed him on the royal throne, he was immediately harassed with the
tumults and insurrections of his own subjects, and the hostile faction being
superior to him in power, he was often at the point of being completely
overthrown. Foreign enemies, on the other hand, severely tried him even to his
old age. These calamities he would never have surmounted had he not been aided
by the power of God. Having therefore obtained many and signal victories, he
does not, as irreligious men are accustomed to do, sing a song of triumph in
honor of himself, but exalts and magnifies God the author of these victories, by
a train of striking and appropriate epithets, and in a style of surpassing
grandeur and sublimity. This psalm, therefore, is the first of those psalms in
which David celebrates, in lofty strains, the wonderful grace which God had
shown towards him, both in putting him in possession of the kingdom, and in
afterwards maintaining him in it. He also shows that his reign was an image and
type of the kingdom of Christ, to teach and assure the faithful that Christ, in
spite of the whole world, and of all the resistance which it can make, will, by
the stupendous and incomprehensible power of the Father, be always
victorious.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician of David, the servant of Jehovah, who sung to Jehovah the words of this
song in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and
from the hand of Saul.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought carefully to mark the particular time when
this psalm was composed, as it shows us that David, when his affairs were
brought to a state of peace and prosperity, was not intoxicated with extravagant
joy like irreligious men, who, when they have obtained deliverance from their
calamities, shake off from their minds the remembrance of God's benefits, and
plunge themselves into gross and degrading pleasures, or erect their crests, and
obscure the glory of God by their proud and vain boasting. David, as the sacred
history relates,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;102201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 22:1,) sung this song to the Lord, when he was now almost spent with age,
and when, being delivered from all his troubles, he enjoyed tranquillity. The
inscription here agrees with that account, and, from What is there stated, we
conclude, that it has not been improperly or incorrectly prefixed to this psalm.
David points out the time when it was sung, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after God had delivered him from
all his enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to show us that he was
then in perfectly quiet possession of his kingdom, and that God had assisted him
not once, nor against one kind of enemies only; seeing his conflicts were from
time to time renewed, and the end of one war was the commencement of another;
yea, many armies often rose up against him at the same time. Since the creation
of the world, we will scarcely find another individual in it whom God has tried
by so many and so varied afflictions. As Saul had persecuted him with more
cruelty, and with greater fury and determination than all others, his name on
that account is here expressly mentioned, although, in the preceding clause, the
Psalmist had spoken in general terms of all his enemies. Saul is not put last,
as if he had been one of his later
enemies,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz347</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for his death had taken place about
thirty years previous to this time; and since that event David had discomfited
many foreign enemies, and had also suppressed the rebellion of his own son
Absalom. But, persuaded that it was a singular manifestation of the grace of God
towards him, and eminently worthy of being remembered, that he had for so many
years escaped from innumerable deaths, or rather that as many days as he had
lived under the reign of Saul, God had wrought, as it were, so many miracles for
his deliverance, he firstly mentions and celebrates in particular his
deliverance from the hands of this relentless enemy. By calling himself
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the servant of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he doubtless intended to bear
testimony to his call to be king, as if he had said, I have not rashly, and by
my own authority, usurped the kingdom, but have only acted in obedience to the
oracle of heaven. And, indeed, amidst the many storms which he had to encounter,
it was a support highly necessary to be well assured in his own mind of having
undertaken nothing but by the appointment of God; or rather, this was to him a
peaceful haven, and a secure retreat in the midst of so many broils and strange
calamities.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz348</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is not a more wretched object
than mail in adversity, when he has brought himself into distress by acting
according to the mere impulse of his own mind, and not by acting in obedience to
the call of God. David, therefore, had a good reason for wishing it to be known
that it was not ambition which impelled him to enter into those contests which
were so painful and difficult for him to bear, and that he had not attempted any
thing unlawful or by wicked means, but had always kept steadily in view the will
of God, which served as a light to guide him in his path. This is a point which
it is highly useful for us to know, in order that we may not expect to be
exempted from all trouble, when we follow the call of God, but may rather
prepare ourselves for a condition of warfare painful and disagreeable to our
flesh. The name <i>servant, </i>therefore, in this passage, as in many others,
relates to his public office; just as when the prophets and apostles call
themselves the servants of God, they have a reference to their official
character. It is as if he had said, I am not a king of my own creation, but have
been chosen by God to fill that high station. At the same time, we ought
particularly to notice the humility of David, who, although distinguished by so
many victories, and the conqueror of so many nations, and possessed of so great
dignity and wealth, honors himself with no other title than this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The servant of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as<i> </i>if he meant to show that
he accounted it more honorable to have faithfully performed the duties of the
office with which God had invested him, than to possess all the honors and
excellence of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
18:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> And he said, I will
affectionately love thee,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

refuge.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I will not stop to examine too minutely
the syllables, or the few words, in which this psalm differs from the song which
is recorded in the twenty-second chapter of the Second Book of Samuel. When,
however, we meet with any important difference, we shall advert to it in the
proper place; and we find one in the remarkable sentence with which this psalm
commences, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will love thee
affectionately, O Jehovah, my strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which is omitted in the song in Samuel. As the Scripture does not use the
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;hr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>racham, </i>for <i>to love, </i>except in the conjugation <i>pihel, </i>and
as it is here put in the conjugation <i>kal, </i>some of the Jewish expositors
explain it as here meaning <i>to seek mercy; </i>as if David had said, Lord,
since I have so often experienced thee to be a merciful God, I will trust to and
repose in thy mercies for ever. And certainly this exposition would not be
unsuitable, but I am unwilling to depart from the other, which is more generally
received. It is to be observed, that love to God is here laid down as
constituting the principal part of true godliness; for there is no better way of
serving God than to love him. No doubt, the service which we owe him is better
expressed by the word <i>reverence, </i>that thus his majesty may prominently
stand forth to our view in its infinite greatness. But as he requires nothing so
expressly as to possess all the affections of our heart, and to have them going
out towards him, so there is no sacrifice which he values more than when we are
bound fast to him by the chain of a free and spontaneous love; and, on the other
hand, there is nothing in which his glory shines forth more conspicuously than
in his free and sovereign goodness. Moses, therefore,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
10:12,) when he meant to give a summary of the law, says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And now, Israel, what
doth the Lord thy God require</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">of
thee but to love him?"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In speaking thus, David, at the same time, intended
to show that his thoughts and affections were not so intently fixed upon the
benefits of God as to be ungrateful to him who was the author of them, a sin
which has been too common in all ages. Even at this day we see how the greater
part of mankind enjoy wholly at their ease the gifts of God without paying any
regard to him, or, if they think of him at all, it is only to despise him.
David, to prevent himself from falling into this ingratitude, in these words
makes as it were a solemn vow, Lord, as thou art my strength, I will continue
united and devoted to thee by unfeigned
love.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is my rock,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When David thus heaps together many
titles by which to honor God, it is no useless or unnecessary accumulation of
words. We know how difficult it is for men to keep their minds and hearts stayed
in God. They either imagine that it is not enough to have God for them, and,
consequently, are always seeking after support and succor elsewhere, or, at the
first temptation which assails them, fall from the confidence which they placed
in him. David, therefore, by attributing to God various methods of saving his
people, protests that, provided he has God for his protector and defender, he is
effectually fortified against all peril and assault; as if he had said, Those
whom God intends to succor and defend are not only safe against one kind of
dangers, but are as it were surrounded by impregnable ramparts on all sides, so
that, should a thousand deaths be presented to their view, they ought not to be
afraid even at this formidable array.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz352</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see, then, that the design of David
here is not only to celebrate the praises of God, in token of his gratitude, but
also to fortify our minds with a firm and steadfast faith, so that, whatever
afflictions befall us, we may always have recourse to God, and may be fully
persuaded that he has virtue and power to assist us in different ways, according
to the different methods of doing us mischief which the wicked devise. Nor, as I
have observed before, does David insist so much on this point, and express the
same thing by different terms without cause. God may have aided us in one way,
and yet whenever a new tempest arises, we are immediately stricken with terror,
as if we had never experienced any thing of his aid. And those who in one
trouble expect protection and succor from him, but who afterwards circumscribe
his power, accounting it limited in other respects, act like a man who upon
going into battle, considers himself well secured as to his breast, because he
has a breastplate and a shield to defend him, and yet is afraid of his head,
because he is without a helmet. David, therefore, here furnishes the faithful
with a complete suit of armor,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fz353</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they may feel that they are in no
danger of being wounded, provided they are shielded by the power of God. That
such is the object he has in view, is apparent from the declaration which he
makes of his confidence in God:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will trust in him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Let us, therefore,
learn from his example, to apply to our own use those titles which are here
attributed to God, and to apply them as an antidote against all the perplexities
and distresses which may assail us; or rather, let them be deeply imprinted upon
our memory, so that we may be able at once to repel to a distance whatever fear
Satan may suggest to our mind. I give this exhortation, not only because we
tremble under the calamities with which we are presently assailed, but also
because we groundlessly conjure up in our own imaginations dangers as to the
time to come, and thus needlessly disquiet ourselves by the mere creations of
fancy. In the song, as recorded in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;102203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 22:3, instead of these words, <i>My God, my rock, </i>it is, <i>God of my
rock. </i>And after the word <i>refuge, </i>there is, <i>My fortress, my savior,
thou shalt preserve me from violence; </i>words which make the sentence fuller,
but the meaning comes to the same
thing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
18:3-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> I will call upon the
praised Jehovah, and I shall be saved from mine enemies. <b>4.</b> The
cords</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

him, even into his
ears.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I will call upon the praised Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Calling upon God, as has been observed elsewhere, frequently comprehends the
whole of his service; but as the effect or fruit of prayer is particularly
mentioned in what follows, this phrase in the passage before us, I have no
doubt, signifies to have recourse to God for protection, and to ask by prayer
deliverance from him. David having said in the second verse, that he trusted in
God, now subjoins this as an evidence of his trust; for every one who confides
in God will earnestly beseech his aid in the time of need. He therefore
declares, that he <i>will be saved, </i>and prove victorious over all <i>his
enemies, </i>because he will have recourse to God for help. He calls God the
<i>praised Jehovah, </i>not only to intimate that he is worthy of being praised,
as almost all interpreters explain it, but also to point out, that, when he came
to the throne of grace, his prayers would be mingled and interwoven with
praises.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa357</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The scope of the passage seems to
require that it be understood as meaning, that giving thanks to God for the
benefits which he has received from him in times past, he will ask his
assistance by renewed supplications. And certainly no man will ever invoke God
in prayer freely and frankly unless he animate and encourage himself by the
remembrance of the grace of God. Accordingly Paul, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:6, exhorts the faithful</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"in every thing by prayer
and supplication with thanksgiving, to make their requests known unto God"
(Philippians 4:6)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and to disburden their cares, as it were, into his
bosom. All those whose prayers are not accompanied with the praises of God are
chargeable with clamouring and complaining against him, when engaged in that
solemn exercise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
cords</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa358</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> of death had
compassed me about.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now begins to
recount the undoubted and illustrious proofs by which he had experienced that
the hand of God is sufficiently strong and powerful to repel all the dangers and
calamities with which he may be assailed. And we need not wonder that those
things which might have been described more simply, and in an unadorned style,
are clothed in poetical forms of expression, and set forth with all the
elegancies and ornaments of language. The Holy Spirit, to contend against and
make an impression upon the wicked and perverse dispositions of men, has here
furnished David with eloquence full of majesty, energy, and wonderful power, to
awaken mankind to consider the benefits of God. There is scarcely any assistance
God bestows, however evident and palpable it may be to our senses, which our
indifference or proud disdain does not obscure. David, therefore, the more
effectually to move and penetrate our minds, says that the deliverance and
succor which God had granted him had been conspicuous in the whole frame-work of
the world. This his intention it is needful for us to take into view, lest we
should think that he exceeds due bounds in expressing himself in a style so
remarkable for sublimity. The sum is, that, when in his distresses he had been
reduced to extremity, he had betaken himself to God for help, and had been
wonderfully preserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We shall now make a few
observations with respect to the words. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebley, </i>means <i>cords </i>or <i>sorrows, </i>or any deadly
evil,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa359</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which consumes a man's health and
strength, and which tends to his destruction. That the psalm may correspond with
the song recorded in 2nd Samuel, formerly referred to, I do not disapprove of
this word being here taken for <i>contrition, </i>because the phrase there
employed is </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twm
yrb&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> mishberey
maveth,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa360</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrb&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mishberey, </i>is derived<i> </i>from a verb which signifies to <i>break.
</i>But as the metaphor taken from cords or snares agrees better with the verb
<i>compass about, </i>the import of which is, that David was on all sides
involved and entangled in the perils of death, I am disposed rather to adopt
this interpretation. What follows concerning <i>torrents </i>implies that he had
been almost overwhelmed by the violence and impetuosity of his enemies against
him, even as a man who is covered over the head with floods of water is almost
lost. He calls them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the torrents
of Belial</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because it was wicked and
perverse men who had conspired against him. The Hebrew word <i>Belial </i>has a
wide signification. With respect to its etymology there are different opinions
among expositors. Why Jerome has rendered it <i>without
yoke,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa361</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I know not. The more generally
received opinion is, that it is compounded of these two words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beli, not, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ya&auml;l,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa362</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to denote that the wicked do not
rise, in other words, ultimately gain nothing, and obtain no advantage by their
infatuated course. The Jews certainly employed this word to designate every kind
of detestable wickedness, and from this it is highly probable that David by it
meant to describe his enemies, who basely and wickedly plotted his
destruction.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa363</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If, however, any prefer translating the
phrase, by <i>deadly torrents, </i>I am not disposed to oppose this rendering.
In the following verse he again repeats, <i>that the corruptions </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cords of the grave had compassed
him about</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As the Hebrew word is the
same which he had employed in the preceding verse, I have thought it proper to
translate it <i>cords </i>here, as I have done there, not only because he uses a
verb which signifies <i>to beset, to inclose, </i>or <i>to surround, </i>but
also because he adds immediately after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the snares of
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which, in my opinion, is to be
understood in the same sense. This, then, is the description of the dangerous
circumstances into which he was brought, and it enhances and magnifies so much
the more the glory of his deliverance. As David had been reduced to a condition
so desperate that no hope of relief or deliverance from it was apparent, it is
certain that he was delivered by the hand of God, and that it was not a thing
effected by the power of
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In my distress, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was a very
evident proof of uncommon faith in David, when, being almost plunged into the
gulf of death, he lifted up his heart to heaven by prayer. Let us therefore
learn, that such an example is set before our eyes, that no calamities, however
great and oppressive, may hinder us from praying, or create an aversion to it.
It was prayer which brought to David the fruits or wonderful effects of which he
speaks a little after, and from this it appears still more clearly that his
deliverance was effected by the power of God. In saying that he <i>cried, </i>he
means, as we have observed elsewhere, the ardor and earnestness of affection
which he had in prayer. Again, by calling God <i>his God, </i>he separates
himself from the gross despisers of God, or hypocrites, who, when constrained by
necessity, call upon the Divine Majesty in a confused and tumultuous manner, but
do not come to God familiarly and with a pure heart, as they know nothing of his
fatherly favor and goodness. When, therefore, as we approach to God, faith goes
before to illumine the way, giving us the full persuasion that He is our Father,
then is the gate opened, and we may converse freely with Him and he with us.
David, by calling God his God, and putting him on his side, also intimates that
God was opposed to his enemies; and this serves to show that he was actuated by
true piety and the fear of God. By the word <i>temple </i>we are not here to
understand the sanctuary as in many other places, but heaven; for the
description which immediately follows cannot be applied to the sanctuary.
Accordingly, the sense is, that when David was forsaken and abandoned in the
world, and all men shut their ears to his cry for help, God stretched forth his
hand from heaven to save him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
18:7-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> Then the earth shook and
trembled; the foundations of the mountains were troubled, and were shaken,
because he was wroth. <b>8.</b> There went up a smoke by [or out of] his
nostrils, and fire proceeding from his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it.
<b>9.</b> And he bowed the heavens and came down:and thick darkness was under
his feet. <b>10.</b> He rode also upon a cherub, and did fly; and was carried
upon the wings of the wind. <b>11.</b> He made darkness his secret [or hiding]
place; his pavilion [or tent] round about him was dark waters, and the clouds of
the skies.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the earth
shook.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David, convinced that the aid of
God, which he had experienced, was of such a character, that it was impossible
for him to extol it sufficiently and as it deserved, sets forth an image of it
in the sky and the earth, as if he had said, It has been as visible as the
changes which give different appearances to the sky and the earth. If natural
things always flowed in an even and uniform course, the power of God would not
be so perceptible. But when he changes the face of the sky by sudden rain, or by
loud thunder, or by dreadful tempests, those who before were, as it were, asleep
and insensible, must necessarily be awakened, and be tremblingly conscious of
the existence of a presiding God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa364</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Such sudden and unforeseen changes
manifest more clearly the presence of the great Author of nature. No doubt, when
the sky is unclouded and tranquil, we see in it sufficient evidences of the
majesty of God, but as men will not stir up their minds to reflect upon that
majesty, until it come nearer to them, David, the more powerfully to affect us,
recounts the sudden changes by which we are usually moved and dismayed, and
introduces God at one time clothed with a dark cloud, &#8212; at another,
throwing the air into confusion by tempests, &#8212; now rending it by the
boisterous violence of winds, &#8212; now launching the lightnings, &#8212; and
anon darting down hailstones and thunderbolts. In short, the object of the
Psalmist is to show that the God who, as often as he pleases, causes all parts
of the world to tremble by his power, when he intended to manifest himself as
the deliverer of David, was known as openly and by signs as evident as if he had
displayed his power in all the creatures both above and
beneath.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the first place, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The earth
shook,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and nothing is more dreadful than
an earthquake. Instead of the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the foundations of the
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is in the song, as
recorded in 2nd Samuel, <i>the foundations of the heavens; </i>but the meaning
is the same, namely, that there was nothing in the world so settled and
steadfast which did not tremble, and which was not removed out of its place.
David, however, as I have already observed in the beginning, does not relate
this as a piece of history, or as what had actually taken place, but he employs
these similitudes for the purpose of removing all doubt, and for the greater
confirmation of faith as to the power and providence of God; because men, from
their slowness of understanding, cannot apprehend God except by means of
external signs. Some think that these miracles were actually wrought, and
performed exactly as they are here related; but it is not easy to believe this,
since the Holy Spirit, in the narrative given of David's life, makes no mention
whatever of such wonderful displays of divine power in his behalf. We cannot,
however, justly censure or find fault with this hyperbolic manner of speaking,
when we consider our slowness of apprehension, and also our depravity, to which
I have just now called your attention. David, who was much more penetrating and
quick of understanding than ordinary men, finding he could not sufficiently
succeed in impressing and profiting people of sluggish and weak understandings
by a simple manner of speaking, describes under outward figures the power of
God, which he had discovered by means of faith, and the revelation of the Holy
Spirit. He doubtless hereby apprehended and knew more distinctly the omnipresent
majesty of God, than the dull sort of common people perceive the hand of God in
earthquakes, tempests, thunders, the gloomy lowerings of the heavens, and the
boisterous winds. At the same time, it is proper to consider, that although God
had, in a wonderful manner, displayed his grace in defending and maintaining
David, many, nevertheless, thought that it was by his own skill, or by chance,
or by other natural means, that all his affairs had come to a prosperous issue;
and it was such stupidity or depravity as this which he saw in the men of his
own time, that constrained him to mention and to summon together all parts of
creation as witnesses for God. Some also justly and judiciously consider that,
in the whole of this description, David has an allusion to the common
deliverance of God's chosen people from Egypt. As God then designed and
established that event to be a perpetual memorial, from which the faithful might
learn that he was the guardian and protector of their welfare, so all the
benefits which, from that period, he bestowed upon his people, either as a
public body or as private individuals, were, so to speak, appendages of that
first deliverance. Accordingly David, in other places as well as here, with the
view of exalting the succor which God had granted to his people, sets forth that
most memorable instance of the goodness of God towards the children of Israel,
as if it were the archtype or original copy of the grace of God. And surely,
while many, seeing him an exile from his country, held him in derision as a man
expelled from the family of God, and many murmured that he had violently and
unrighteously usurped the kingdom, he had good ground to include, under the
deliverance which had been common to all the people, the protection and safety
which God had afforded to himself; as if he had said, I have been wrongfully
cast off as an alien or stranger, seeing God has sufficiently shown, in the
deliverance which he has wrought for me, that by him I am owned and acknowledged
to be a distinguished and valuable member of the Church. We see how the
prophets, whenever they would inspire the people with the hope of salvation,
call their thoughts back to the contemplation of that first covenant which had
been confirmed by those miracles which were wrought in Egypt, in the passage
through the Red Sea and in Mount Sinai. When he says, <i>The earth trembled,
because he was wroth, </i>it is to be understood as referring to the ungodly. It
is a form of speech which God often employs, to say, that, being inflamed with
indignation, he arms himself to maintain the safety of his people against their
persecutors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
There went up a smoke by [or out of] his nostrils,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;a</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
aph, </i>properly signifies <i>the nose, </i>or <i>the nostrils. </i>But as it
is sometimes taken metaphorically for <i>wrath, </i>some translate it thus,
<i>There went up a smoke in his wrath, </i>which, in my opinion, is not at all
appropriate. David compares the mists and vapours which darken the air to the
thick smoke which a man sends forth from his nostrils when he is angry. And when
God, by his very breath, covers the heaven with clouds, and taking away from us
the brightness of the sun and of all the stars, overwhelms us in darkness, by
this we are very impressively taught how dreadful is his wrath. By the rendering
which I have given, the figure here strikingly harmonises with the one in the
clause which immediately follows, namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that fire proceeding from his
mouth consumed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist means, that
God, without great labor or effort, as soon as he shall have sent forth a breath
or blast from his nostrils, and opened his mouth, will kindle such a fire that
its smoke will darken the whole world, and its intense heat devour it. What he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Coals were kindled by
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>serves to distinguish this dreadful
fire from a flame which blazes for a moment, and then is extinguished.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The bowing of the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>denotes a time when the heavens
are covered and obscured with clouds. When dense vapours occupy the middle of
the air, the clouds seem to us to come down and to lie upon our heads. And not
only so, but the majesty of God then approaching, as it were, nearer us, strikes
us with dread dismay, and greatly distresses us, although before, when the sky
was fair, agreeable, and tranquil, we took ample scope, and enjoyed ourselves
with much gaiety. Again, let us remember, that the Scripture, under these
descriptions of a clouded and darkened sky, pourtray to us the anger of God.
When the sky is clear and unclouded, it seems as if it were the pleasant and
benignant countenance of God beaming upon us, and causing us to rejoice;
whereas, on the other hand, when the atmosphere is troubled, we feel a
depression of the animal spirits which constrains us to look sad, as if we saw
God coming against us with a threatening aspect. At the same time, we are taught
that no change takes place either in the atmosphere or in the earth, but what is
a witness to us of the presence of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He rode also upon a
cherub.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist having exhibited to
us a sign of the wrath of God in the clouds, and in the darkening of the air,
representing him as if he breathed out
smoke,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa365</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from his nostrils, and descended with a
threatening countenance, to afflict men by the dreadful weight of his power; and
having also represented lightnings and thunderbolts as flaming fire proceeding
from his mouths &#8212; he now introduces him as riding upon the winds and
tempests, to take a survey of the whole world with rapid speed, or rather with
the swiftness of flying. We meet with a similar description in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:3, where God is said to "walk<i> </i>upon the wings of the winds," and to
send them forth in every direction as his swift messengers. David does not,
however, simply represent God as the governor of the winds, who drives them by
his power whithersoever he pleases; he at the same time tells us that he rides
upon <i>a cherub, </i>to teach us that the very violence of the winds is
governed by angels as God has ordained. We know that the angels were represented
under the figure of the cherubim. David, therefore, I have no doubt, here
intended to make an allusion to the ark of the covenant. In proposing for our
consideration the power of God as manifested in the wonders of nature, he does
it in such a manner as all the time to have an eye to the temple, where he knew
God had made himself known in a peculiar manner to the children of Abraham. He
therefore celebrates God not only as creator of the world, but as He who entered
into covenant with Israel, and chose for himself a holy dwelling-place in the
midst of that people. David might have called the angels by their common name,
but he has expressly made use of a term which has a reference to the visible
symbol of the ark, that true believers, in singing this psalm, might always have
their minds directed to the service of God which was performed in the temple.
What follows with respect, to God's <i>dark pavilion </i>or <i>tent, </i>is a
repetition of the preceding sentence in different words, namely, that when God
covers the air with dark clouds, it is as if he spread a thick veil between him
and men, to deprive them of the sight of his
countenance,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa366</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> just as if a king, incensed against his
subjects, should retire into his secret chamber and hide himself from them.
Those take a mistaken view of this verse who bring it forward to prove, in
general, the hidden and mysterious character of the glory of God, as if David,
with the view of restraining the presumption of human curiosity, had said that
God is hidden in darkness in regard to men. God, it is true, is said to dwell in
the light which no man can approach unto"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16;) but the form of expression which David here employs, I have no
doubt, ought to be restricted, according to the scope of the passage, to the
sense which I have given.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

lightnings which, by dividing and as it were cleaving the clouds, lay open the
heaven; and, therefore, he says, that the clouds of God (that is to say, those
which he had set before him, in token of his anger, for the purpose of depriving
men of the enjoyment of the light of his countenance) passed away
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the brightness which was
before him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These sudden changes affect
us with a much more lively sense of the power and agency of God than natural
phenomena which move on in one uniform course. He adds, that there followed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hail-storm and coals of
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for when the thunder separates and
rends asunder the clouds, it either breaks out in lightnings, or the clouds
resolve themselves into hail.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
thundered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here repeats the same
thing in different words, declaring that God thundered from heaven; and he calls
the thunder <i>the yoke of God, </i>that we may not suppose it is produced
merely by chance or by natural causes, independent of the appointment and will
of God. Philosophers, it is true, are well acquainted with the intermediate or
secondary causes, from which the thunder proceeds, namely, that when the cold
and humid vapours obstruct the dry and hot exhalations in their course upwards,
a collision takes place, and by this, together with the noise of the clouds
rushing against each other, is produced the rumbling
thunder-peal.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa369</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But David, in describing the phenomena
of the atmosphere, rises, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, above the mere
phenomena themselves, and represents God to us as the supreme governor of the
whole, who, at his will, penetrates into the hidden veins of the earth, and
thence draws forth exhalations; who then, dividing them into different sorts,
disperses them through the air; who again collects the vapours together, and
sets them in conflict with the subtile and dry heats, so that the thunder which
follows seems to be a loud pealing voice proceeding from his own mouth. The song
in 2nd Samuel also contains the repetition to which we have referred in the
commencement of our remarks on this verse; but the sense of this and the
preceding verse, and of the corresponding verses in Samuel, are entirely
similar. We should remember what I have said before,<i> </i>that David, under
these figures, describes to us the dreadful power of God, the better to exalt
and magnify the divine grace, which was manifested in his deliverance. He
declares a little after, that this was his intention; for, when speaking of his
enemies, he says, (verse 14,) that they <i>were scattered, </i>or <i>put to
flight, by the arrows of God; </i>as if he had said, They have been overthrown,
not by the hands or swords of men, but by God, who openly launched his
thunderbolts against them. Not that he means to affirm that this happened
literally, but he speaks in this metaphorical language, because those who were
uninstructed and slow to acknowledge the power of
God,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa370</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> could not otherwise be brought to
perceive that God was the author of his deliverance. The import of his words is,
Whoever does not acknowledge that I have been preserved by the hand of God, may
as well deny that it is God who thunders from heaven, and abolish his power
which is manifested in the whole order of nature, and especially in those
wonderful changes which we see taking place in the atmosphere. As God shoots
lightnings as if they were arrows, the Psalmist has, in the first place,
employed this metaphor; and then he has expressed the thing simply by its proper
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sources of the waters
were seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse, David
doubtless alludes to the miracle which was wrought when the chosen tribes passed
through the Red Sea. I have before declared the purpose for which he does this.
As all the special benefits which God in old time conferred upon any of the
children of Abraham as individuals, were so many testimonies by which he
recalled to their remembrance the covenant which he had once entered into with
the whole people, to assure them that he would always continue his grace towards
them, and that one deliverance might be to them a token or pledge of their
perpetual safety, and of the protection of God, David fitly conjoins with that
ancient deliverance of the Church the assistance which God had sent from heaven
to him in particular. As the grace which he declares God had shown towards him
was not to be separated from that first deliverance, since it was, so to speak,
a part and an appendage of it, he beholds, as it were at a glance, or in an
instant, both the ancient miracle of the drying up of the Red Sea, and the
assistance which God granted to himself. In short, God, who once opened up for
his people a way through the Red Sea, and then showed himself to be their
protector upon this condition, that they should assure themselves of being
always maintained and preserved under his keeping, now again displayed his
wonderful power in the defense and preservation of one man, to renew the
remembrance of that ancient history. From this it appears the more evidently,
that David, in using these apparently strange and exaggerated hyperboles, does
not recite to us the mere creations of romance to please the fancy, after the
manner of the heathen poets,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa371</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but observes the style and manner which
God had, as it were, prescribed to his people. At the same time, we ought
carefully to mark the reason already adverted to, which constrained him to
magnify the grace of God in a style of such splendid imagery, namely, because
the greater part of the people never made the grace of God the subject of
serious consideration, but, either through wickedness or stupidity, passed over
it with shut eyes. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqypa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aphikim, </i>which I have rendered <i>sources, </i>properly signifies <i>the
channels of rivers; </i>but David, in this passage, evidently means that the
very springs or sources of the waters were laid open, and that thus it could be
discerned whence proceeds the great and inexhaustible abundance of waters which
supply the rivers, and by which they always continue to flow on in their
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He sent down from
above.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here there is briefly shown the
drift of the sublime and magnificent narrative which has now passed under our
review, namely, to teach us that David at length emerged from the profound abyss
of his troubles, neither by his own skill, nor by the aid of men, but that he
was drawn out of them by the hand of God. When God defends and preserves us
wonderfully and by extraordinary means, he is said in Scripture language to send
down succor from above; and this <i>sending </i>is set in opposition to human
and earthly aids, on which we usually place a mistaken and an undue confidence.
I do not disapprove of the opinion of those who consider this as referring to
the angels, but I understand it in a more general sense; for by whatever means
we are preserved, it is God who having his creatures ready at his nod to do his
will, appoints them to take charge of us, and girds or prepares them for
succouring us. But, although every kind of aid comes from heaven, David, with
good reason, affirms that God had stretched out his hand from on high to deliver
him. In speaking thus, he meant to place the astonishing benefit referred to, by
way of eminence, above others of a more common kind; and besides, there is in
this expression a tacit comparison between the unusual exercise of the power of
God here celebrated, and the common and ordinary means by which he succours his
people. When he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
drew him out of great waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is a
metaphorical form of expression. By comparing the cruelty of his enemies to
impetuous torrents, by which he might have been swallowed up a hundred times, he
expresses more clearly the greatness of the danger; as if he had said, I have,
contrary to the expectation of men, escaped, and been delivered from a deep
abyss in which I was ready to be overwhelmed. In the following verse he
expresses the thing simply and without a figure, declaring that he had been
delivered from a <i>strong enemy,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa372</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who mortally hated and
persecuted him. The more to exalt and magnify the power of God, he directs our
attention to this circumstance, that no strength or power of men had been able
to prevent God from saving him, even when he was reduced to the greatest
extremity of distress. As in the end of the verse there is the Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>which generally denotes the cause of what is predicated, almost all
interpreters agree in explaining the verse thus:God has succoured me from above,
because my enemies were so numerous and so strong that no relief was to be
expected by the mere aid of men. From this we deduce a very profitable doctrine,
namely, that the most seasonable time for God to aid his people is when they are
unable to sustain the assaults of their enemies, or rather, when, broken and
afflicted, they sink under their violence, like the wretched man who having in a
shipwreck lost all hope of being able to swim to the shore, sinks with great
rapidity to the bottom of the deep. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ky</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>however, might also be explained by the adversative particle
<i>although, </i>in this way:Although the enemies of David were superior to him
in number and power, he nevertheless was
saved.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They had prevented me in the
day of my calamity.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa373</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here confirms in
different words the preceding sentence, namely, that he had been sustained by
the aid of God, when there was no way of escaping by the power of man. He tells
us how he had been besieged on all sides, and that not by an ordinary siege,
inasmuch as his enemies, in persecuting him, always molested him most in the
time of his calamity. From this circumstance it is the more evident that he had
obtained enlargement by no other means than by the hand of God. Whence proceeded
so sudden a restoration from death to life, but because God intended to show
that he has in his hand, and under his absolute control, the issues of death? In
short, the Psalmist ascribes his deliverance to no other cause than the mere
good pleasure of God, that all the praise might redound to him
alone:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He delivered me, because he
loved me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>had a good will to me.
</i>In mentioning the good pleasure of God, he has a special respect to his own
calling to be king. The point on which he principally insisted is, that the
assaults which were made upon him, and the conflicts which he had to sustain,
were stirred up against him for no other reason but because he had obeyed the
call of God, and followed with humble obedience the revelation of his oracle.
Ambitious and turbulent men, who are carried headlong by their unruly lusts,
inconsiderately to attempt any thing, and who, by their rashness, involve
themselves in dangers, may often accomplish their undertakings by vigorous and
resolute efforts, but at length a reverse takes place, and they are stopt short
in their career of success, for they are unworthy of being sustained and
prospered by God, since, without having any warrant or foundation for what they
do in his call, they would raise their insane structures even to heaven, and
disturb all around them. In short, David testifies, by this expression, that the
assistance of God had never failed him, because he had not thrust himself into
the office of king of his own accord, but that when he was contented with his
humble condition, and would willingly have lived in obscurity, in the
sheep-cotes, or in his father's hut, he had been anointed by the hand of Samuel,
which was the symbol of his free election by God to fill the
throne.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
18:20-24	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b> Jehovah rewarded me
according to my righteousness; he recompensed me according to the cleanness of
my hands. <b>21.</b> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly
departed from my God. <b>22.</b> For all his judgments were before me, nor did I
put away his statutes [or ordinances] from me. <b>23.</b> I was also upright
with him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

<b>24.</b> Therefore Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness,
according to the cleanness of my hands before his
eyes.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah rewarded
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> David might seem at first sight to
contradict himself; for, while a little before he declared that all the
blessings which he possessed were to be traced to the good pleasure of God, he
now boasts that God rendered to him a just recompense. But if we remember for
what purpose he connects these commendations of his own integrity with the good
pleasure of God, it will be easy to reconcile these apparently conflicting
statements. He has before declared that God was the sole author and originator
of the hope of coming to the kingdom which he entertained, and that he had not
been elevated to it by the suffrages of men, nor had he rushed forward to it
through the mere impulse of his own mind, but accepted it because such was the
will of God. Now he adds, in the second place, that he had yielded faithful
obedience to God, and had never turned aside from his will. Both these things
were necessary; first, that God should previously show his favor freely towards
David, in choosing him to be king; and next, that David, on the other hand,
should, with an obedient spirit, and a pure conscience, receive the kingdom
which God thus freely gave him; and farther, that whatever the wicked might
attempt, with the view of overthrowing or shaking his faith, he should
nevertheless continue to adhere to the direct course of his calling. Thus, then,
we see that these two statements, so far from disagreeing with each other,
admirably harmonise. David here represents God as if the
president</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa375</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of a combat, under whose authority and
conduct he had been brought forth to engage in the combats. Now that depended
upon election, in other words, upon this, that God having embraced him with his
favor, had created him king. He adds in the verses which immediately follow,
that he had faithfully performed the duties of the charge and office committed
to him even to the uttermost. It is not, therefore, wonderful if God maintained
and protected David, and even showed, by manifest miracles, that he was the
defender of his own champion,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa376</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whom he had, of his own free choice,
admitted to the combat, and who he saw had performed his duty with all fidelity.
We ought not, however, to think that David, for the sake of obtaining praise
among men, has here purposely indulged in the language of vain boasting; we
ought rather to view the Holy Spirit as intending by the mouth of David to teach
us the profitable doctrine, that the aid of God will never fail us, provided we
follow our calling, keep ourselves within the limits which it prescribes, and
undertake nothing without the command or warrant of God. At the same time, let
this truth be deeply fixed in our minds, that we can only begin an upright
course of life when God of his good pleasure adopts us into his family, and in
effectually calling, anticipates us by his grace, without which neither we nor
any creature would give him an opportunity of bestowing this blessing upon
us.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa377</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">There, however, still remains one
question. If God rendered to David a just recompense, it may be said, does it
not seem, when he shows himself liberal towards his people, that he is so in
proportion as each of them has deserved? I answer, When the Scripture uses the
word <i>reward </i>or <i>recompense, </i>it is not to show that God owes us any
thing, and it is therefore a groundless and false conclusion to infer from this
that there is any merit or worth in works. God, as a just judge, rewards every
man according to his works, but he does it in such a manner, as to show that all
men are indebted to him, while he himself is under obligation to no one. The
reason is not only that which St Augustine has assigned, namely, that God finds
no righteousness in us to recompense, except what he himself has freely given
us, but also because, forgiving the blemishes and imperfections which cleave to
our works, he imputes to us for righteousness that which he might justly reject.
If, therefore, none of our works please God, unless the sin which mingles with
them is pardoned, it follows, that the recompense which he bestows on account of
them proceeds not from our merit, but from his free and undeserved grace. We
ought, however, to attend to the special reason why David here speaks of God
rewarding him according to his righteousness. He does not presumptuously thrust
himself into the presence of God, trusting to or depending upon his own
obedience to the law as the ground of his justification; but knowing that God
approved the affection of his heart, and wishing to defend and acquit himself
from the false and wicked calumnies of his enemies, he makes God himself the
judge of his cause. We know how unjustly and shamefully he had been loaded with
false accusations, and yet these calumnies did not so much bear against the
honor and name of David as against the welfare and estate of the whole Church in
common. It was indeed mere private spite which stirred up Saul, and drove him
into fury against David, and it was to please the king that all other men were
so rancorous against an innocent individual, and broke forth so outrageously
against him; but Satan, there is no doubt, had a prime agency in exciting these
formidable assaults upon the kingdom of David, and by them he endeavored to
accomplish his ruin, because in the person of this one man God had placed, and,
as it were, shut up the hope of the salvation of the whole people. This is the
reason why David labors so carefully and so earnestly to show and to maintain
the righteousness of his cause. When he presents and defends himself before the
judgment-seat of God against his enemies, the question is not concerning the
whole course of his life, but only respecting one certain cause, or a particular
point. We ought, therefore, to attend to the precise subject of his discourse,
and what he here debates. The state of the matter is this:His adversaries
charged him with many crimes; first, of rebellion and treason, accusing him of
having revolted from the king his father-in-law; in the second place, of plunder
and robbery, as if, like a robber, he had taken possession of the kingdom;
thirdly, of sedition, as if he had thrown the kingdom into confusion when it
enjoyed tranquillity; and, lastly, of cruelty and many flagitious actions, as if
he had been the cause of murders, and had prosecuted his conspiracy by many
dangerous means and unlawful artifices. David, in opposition to these
accusations, with the view of maintaining his innocence before God, protests and
affirms that he had acted uprightly and sincerely in this matter, inasmuch as he
attempted nothing without the command or warrant of God; and whatever hostile
attempts his enemies made against him, he nevertheless always kept himself
within the bounds prescribed by the Divine Law. It would be absurd to draw from
this the inference that God is merciful to men according as he judges them to be
worthy of his favor. Here the object in view is only to show the goodness of a
particular cause, and to maintain it in opposition to wicked calumniators; and
not to bring into examination the whole life of a man, that he may obtain favor,
and be pronounced righteous before God. In short, David concludes from the
effect and the issue, that his cause was approved of by God, not that one
victory is always and necessarily the sign of a good cause, but because God, by
evident tokens of his assistance, showed that he was on the side of
David.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I have kept the ways of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had spoken in the preceding
verse of the cleanness of his hands, but finding that men judged of him
perversely, and were very active in spreading evil reports concerning
him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa378</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he affirms that he had kept the ways of
the Lord, which is equivalent to his appealing the matter to the judgment-seat
of God. Hypocrites, it is true, are accustomed confidently to appeal to God in
the same way; yea, there is nothing which they are more forward in doing than in
dallying with the sacred name of God, and making it a cover to conceal their
hypocrisy; but David brings forward nothing which men might not have certainly
known to be true, if any regard to justice had existed among them. Let us,
therefore, from his example, endeavor above all things to have a good
conscience. And, in the second place, let us have the magnanimity to despise the
false judgments of men, and to look up to heaven for the vindicator of our
character and cause. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have not wickedly departed from my God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This implies, that he always aimed directly at the mark of his calling,
although the ungodly attempted many things to overthrow his faith. The verb
which he uses does not denote one fall only, but a defection which utterly
removes and alienates a man from God. David, it is true, sometimes fell into sin
through the weakness of the flesh, but he never desisted from following after
godliness, nor deserted the service to which God had called
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all his judgments were
before me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now shows how he came to
possess that unbending rectitude of character, by which he was enabled to act
uprightly amidst so many and so grievous temptations, namely, because he always
applied his mind to the study of the law of God. As Satan is daily making new
assaults upon us, it is necessary for us to have recourse to arms, and it is
meditation upon the Divine Law which furnishes us with armor to resist. Whoever,
therefore, would desire to persevere in uprightness and integrity of life, let
them learn to exercise themselves daily in the study of the word of God; for,
whenever a man despises or neglects instruction, he easily falls into
carelessness and stupidity, and all fear of God vanishes from his mind. I do not
intend here to make any subtle distinction between these two words, <i>judgments
</i>and <i>ordinances. </i>If, however, any person is inclined to make a
distinction between them, the best distinction is to refer <i>judgments </i>to
the second table of the law, and <i>ordinances, </i>or <i>statutes, </i>which in
Hebrew are called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twkwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chukoth, </i>to the duties of piety and the exercises immediately connected
with the worship of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was also upright with
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All the verbs in this verse are put
by David in the future tense, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will be upright</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>because he does
not boast of one act only, or of a good work performed by fits and starts, but
of steady perseverance in an upright course. What I have said before, namely,
that David takes God for his judge, as he saw that he was wrongfully and
unrighteously condemned by men, appears still more clearly from what he here
says, "I<i> </i>have been upright with him." The Scriptures, indeed, sometimes
speak in similar terms of the saints, to distinguish them from hypocrites, who
content themselves with wearing the outward mask of religious observances; but
it is to disprove the false reports which were spread against him that David
thus confidently appeals to God with respect to them. This is still more fully
confirmed by the repetition of the same thing which is made a little after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the cleanness of my
hands before his eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In these words
there is evidently a contrast between the eyes of God and the blinded or
malignant eyes of the world; as if he had said, I disregard false and wicked
calumnies, provided I am pure and upright in the sight of God, whose judgment
can never be perverted by malevolent or other vicious and perverse affections.
Moreover, the integrity which he attributes to himself is not perfection but
sincerity, which is opposed to dissimulation and hypocrisy. This may be gathered
from the last clause of the 23rd verse, where he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have kept myself from my
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In thus speaking, he tacitly
acknowledges that he had not been so pure and free from sinful affections as
that the malignity of his enemies did not frequently excite indignation within
him, and gall him to the heart. He had therefore to fight in his own mind
against many temptations, for as he was a man, he must have felt in the flesh on
many occasions the stirrings of vexation and anger. But this was the proof of
his virtue, that he imposed a restraint upon himself, and refrained from
whatever he knew to be contrary to the word of God. A man will never persevere
in the practice of uprightness and of godliness, unless he carefully keep
himself from his iniquity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

subject. In considering the grace of God by which he had been delivered, he
brings it forward as a proof of his integrity, and thus triumphs over the
unfounded and disgraceful calumnies of his enemies. Hypocrites, I confess, are
also accustomed to act in the same way; for prosperity and the success of their
affairs so elates them that they are not ashamed proudly to vaunt themselves not
only against men, but even against God. As such persons, however, openly mock
God, when, by his long-suffering, he allures them to repentance, their wicked
and unhappy presumption has no resemblance to the boasting by which we here see
David encouraging himself. He does not abuse the forbearance and mercy of God by
palliating or spreading a specious varnish over his iniquities, because God
bears with them; but having, by the manifold aids he had received from God,
experienced beyond doubt that he was merciful to him, he justly viewed them as
evident testimonies of the divine favor towards him. And we ought to mark well
this difference between the ungodly and the faithful, namely, that the former,
intoxicated with prosperity, unblushingly boast of being acceptable to God,
while yet they disregard him, and rather sacrifice to Fortune, and make it their
God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa383</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whereas the latter in their prosperity
magnify the grace of God, from the deep sense of his grace with which their
consciences are affected. Thus David here boasts that God had succoured him on
account of the justice of his cause. For, in the first place, we must adapt the
words to the scope of the whole discourse, and view them as implying that God,
in so often delivering an innocent man from death, when it was near him, showed,
indeed, that he is merciful towards the merciful, and pure towards the pure. In
the second place, we must view the words as teaching the general doctrine, that
God never disappoints his servants, but always at length deals graciously with
them, provided they wait for his aid with meekness and patience. To this purpose
Jacob said, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013033&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
30:33,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"God<i> </i>will make my
righteousness to return upon me."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The scope of the discourse is, that the people of God
should entertain good hope, and encourage themselves to practice uprightness and
integrity, since every man shall reap the fruit of his own
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The last clause of the 26th
verse, where it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With the
perverse thou wilt show thyself perverse,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>seems to convey a meaning somewhat strange, but it does not imply any thing
absurd; yea, rather, it is not without good reason that the Holy Spirit uses
this manner of speaking; for he designs thereby to awaken hypocrites and the
gross despisers of God, who lull themselves asleep in their vices without any
apprehension of danger.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa384</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see how such persons, when the
Scripture proclaims the sore and dreadful judgments of God, and when also God
himself denounces terrible vengeance, pass over all these things, without giving
themselves any trouble about them. Accordingly, this brutish, and, as it were,
monstrous stupidity which we see in men, compels God to invent new forms of
expression, and, as it were, to clothe himself with a different character. There
is a similar sentence in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:21-24, where God says, "And if ye walk contrary unto [<i>or</i> perversely
with] me, then will I also walk contrary unto [<i>or </i>perversely or roughly,
or at random against] you;" as if he had said, that their obstinacy and
stubbornness would make him on his part forget his accustomed forbearance and
gentleness, and cast himself recklessly or at random against
them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa385</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see, then, what the stubborn at
length gain by their obduracy; it is this, that God hardens himself still more
to break them in pieces, and if they are of stone, he causes them to feel that
he has the hardness of iron. Another reason which we may assign for this manner
of speaking is, that the Holy Spirit, in addressing his discourse to the wicked,
commonly speaks according to their own apprehension. When God thunders in good
earnest upon them, they transform him, through the blind terrors which seize
upon them, into a character different from his real one, inasmuch as they
conceive of nothing as entering into it but barbarity, cruelty, and ferocity. We
now see the reason why David does not simply attribute to God the name and
office of judge, but introduces him as armed with impetuous violence, for
resisting and overcoming the perverse, according as it is said in the common
proverb, A tough knot requires a stout
wedge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou wilt save the
afflicted people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse contains
the correction of a mistake into which we are very ready to fall. As experience
shows that the merciful are often severely afflicted, and the sincere involved
in troubles of a very distressing description, to prevent any from regarding the
statement as false that God deals mercifully with the merciful, David admonishes
us that we must wait for the end; for although God does not immediately run to
succor the good, yet, after having exercised their patience for a time, he lifts
them up from the dust on which they lay prostrate, and brings effectual relief
to them, even when they were in despair. Whence it follows, that we ought only
to judge by the issue how God shows himself merciful towards the merciful and
pure towards the pure. If he did not keep his people in suspense and waiting
long for deliverance from affliction, it could not be said that it is his
prerogative to save the afflicted. And it is no small consolation, in the midst
of our adversities, to know that God purposely delays to communicate his
assistance, which otherwise is quite prepared, that we may experience his
goodness in saving us after we have been afflicted and brought
low.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa386</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nor ought we to reckon the wrongs which
are inflicted upon us too bitter, since they excite God to show towards us his
favor which bringeth salvation. As to the second clause of this verse, the
reading is a little different in the song in the 2nd Book of Samuel, where the
words are, <i>Thine eyes are against the proud to cast them down. </i>But this
difference makes no alteration as to the meaning, except that the Holy Spirit
there more plainly threatens the proud, that, as God is on the watch to
overthrow them, it is impossible for them to escape destruction. The substance
of both places is this:The more the ungodly indulge in gratifying their own
inclinations, without any fear of danger, and the more proudly they despise the
afflicted poor who are under their feet, they are so much the nearer to
destruction. Whenever, therefore, they cruelly break forth against us with
mockery and contempt, let us know that there is nothing which prevents God from
repelling their headstrong pertinacity, but that their pride is not yet come to
its height.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
18:28-32	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28. </b>For thou shalt light my

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou shalt light my
lamp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the song in Samuel, the form of
the expression is somewhat more precise; for there it is said not that God
lights our lamp, but that he himself is our lamp. The meaning, however, comes to
the same thing, namely, that it was by the grace of God that David, who had been
plunged in darkness, returned to the light. David does not simply give thanks to
God for having lighted up a lamp before him, but also for having converted his
darkness into light. He, therefore, acknowledges that he had been reduced to
such extremity of distress, that he was like a man whose condition was forlorn
and hopeless; for he compares the confused and perplexed state of his affairs to
darkness. This, indeed, by the transference of material things to things
spiritual, may be applied to the spiritual illumination of the understanding;
but, at the same time, we must attend to the subject of which David treats, that
we may not depart from the true and proper meaning. Now, as he acknowledges that
he had been restored to prosperity by the favor of God, which was to him, as it
were, a life-giving light, let us, after his example, regard it as certain that
we will never have the comfort of seeing our adversities brought to an end,
unless God disperse the darkness which envelops us, and restore to us the light
of joy. Let it not, however, be distressing to us to walk through darkness,
provided God is pleased to perform to us the office of a lamp. In the following
verse, David ascribes his victories to God, declaring that, under his conduct,
he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had broken through the
wedges</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> or phalanxes </i>of his enemies, and
had taken by storm their fortified
cities.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa389</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus we see that, although he was a
valiant warrior, and skilled in arms, he arrogates nothing to himself. As to the
tenses of the verbs, we would inform our readers once for all, that in this
psalm David uses the past and the future tenses indifferently, not only because
he comprehends different histories, but also because he presents to himself the
things of which he speaks as if they were still taking place before his eyes,
and, at the same time, describes a continued course of the grace of God towards
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The way of God is
perfect.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The way of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is not here taken for his revealed
will, but for his method of dealing towards his people. The meaning, therefore,
is, that God never disappoints or deceives his servants, nor forsakes them in
the time of need, (as may be the case with men who do not aid their dependants,
except in so far as it contributes to their own particular advantage,) but
faithfully defends and maintains those whom he has once taken under his
protection. But we will never have any nearness to God, unless he first come
near to us by his word; and, for this reason, David, after having asserted that
God aids his people in good earnest, adds, at the same time, that <i>his word is
purified. </i>Let us, therefore, rest assured that God will actually show
himself upright towards us, seeing he has promised to be the guardian and
protector of our welfare, and his promise is certain and infallible truth. That
by <i>the word </i>we are not here to understand the commandments, but the
promises of God, is easily gathered from the following clause, where it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He is a shield to all those who
trust in him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It seems, indeed, a common
commendation to say, that the word of God is pure, and without any mixture of
fraud and deceit, like silver which is well refined and purified from all its
dross. But our unbelief is the cause why God, so to speak, is constrained to use
such a similitude, for the purpose of commending and leading us to form exalted
conceptions of the steadfastness and certainty of his promises; for whenever the
issue does not answer our expectation, there is nothing to which we are
naturally more prone than forthwith to begin to entertain unhallowed and
distrustful thoughts of the word of God. For a farther explanation of these
words, we would refer our readers to our remarks on Psalm
12:6.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For who is God besides
Jehovah?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here, deriding the
foolish inventions of men, who, according to their own fancy, make for
themselves tutelary gods,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa390</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> confirms what I have said before, that
he never undertook any thing but by the authority and command of God. If he had
passed beyond the limits of his calling, he could not with such confidence have
said that God was on his side. Besides, although in these words he opposes to
the true God all the false gods invented by men, his purpose, at the same time,
is to overthrow all the vain hopes in which the world is wrapped up, and by
which it is carried about, and prevented from resting in God. The question which
David here treats of is not the bare title and name of <i>God, </i>but he
declares that whatever assistance we need we should seek it from God, and from
no other quarter, because he alone is endued with
power:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is strong except our
God? </i></font><font face="Palatino">We should, however, attend to the design
of David, which I have first adverted to, namely, that, by confidently
representing God as opposed to all his enemies, and as the leader, under whose
standard he had valiantly fought against them, he means to affirm that he had
attempted nothing according to his own fancy, or with an evil and condemning
conscience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is God who hath
girded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a metaphor taken either
from the belt or girdle of a warrior, or from the reins, in which the Scripture
sometimes places a man's vigor or strength. It is, therefore, as if he had said,
I, who would otherwise have been feeble and effeminate, have been made strong
and courageous by the power of God. He afterwards speaks of the success itself
with which God had favored him; for it would not be enough for persons to have
prompt and active courage, nor even to excel in strength, if their undertakings
were not at the same time crowned with a prosperous issue. Irreligious men
imagine that this proceeds from their own prudence, or from fortune; but David
ascribes it to God alone:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is
God who hath made my way perfect. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The word
<i>way </i>is here to be understood of the course of our actions, and the
language implies, that whatever David undertook, God, by his blessing, directed
it to a successful issue.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

holden me up, and thy clemency hath increased me. <b>36.</b> Thou hast enlarged
my steps under me, and my feet have not
staggered.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">David, having taken many
strongholds which, on account of their steep and difficult access, were believed
to be impregnable, extols the grace of God in this particular. When he says that
God had given him feet like <i>hinds' feet, </i>he means that he had given him
unusual swiftness, and such as does not naturally belong to men. The sense,
therefore, is, that he had been aided by God in an extraordinary manner, so that
like a roe he climbed with amazing speed over inaccessible rocks. He calls the
strongholds, which, as conqueror, he had obtained by right of war,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his high
places</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he could justly boast that
he took possession of nothing which belonged to another man, inasmuch as he knew
that he had been called to occupy these fortresses by God. When he says that
<i>his hands </i>had been taught and framed <i>to war, </i>he confesses that he
had not acquired his dexterity in fighting by his own skill, nor by exercise and
experience, but had obtained it as a gift through the singular goodness of God.
It is true in general, that strength and skill in war proceed only from a secret
virtue communicated by God; but David immediately after shows that he had been
furnished with greater strength for carrying on his wars than what men commonly
possess, inasmuch as his arms were sufficiently strong
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to break even bows of brass in
pieces</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>True, he had by nature a
vigorous and powerful bodily frame; but the Scripture describes him as a man of
low stature, and the similitude itself which he here uses implies something
surpassing the natural strength of man. In the following verse, he declares that
it was by the grace of God alone that he had escaped, and been kept in perfect
safety:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast also given me
the shield of thy salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the
phrase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the shield of God's
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates, that if God had
not wonderfully preserved him, he would have been exposed unprotected to many
deadly wounds; and thus God's shield of salvation is tacitly opposed to all the
coverings and armor with which he had been provided. He again ascribes his
safety to the free goodness of God as its cause, which he says <i>had increased
him, </i>or more and more carried him forward in the path of honor and success;
for, by the word <i>increase, </i>he means a continuation and an unintermitted
and ever growing augmentation of the tokens of the divine favor towards
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the enlargement of his
steps,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates that God had opened
up to him an even and an accommodating pathway through places to which there was
before no means of access; for there is in the words an implied contrast between
a large and spacious place and a narrow spot, out of which a person cannot move
his foot. The meaning is, that when David was reduced to the greatest distress,
and saw no way of escape, God had graciously brought him out of his straits and
difficulties. This is a lesson which may be highly useful for correcting our
distrust. Unless we see before us a beautiful and pleasant plain, in which the
flesh may freely enjoy itself, we tremble as if the earth would sink under our
feet. Let us, therefore, remember, that the office of enlarging our ways and
making them level belongs to God, and is here justly ascribed to him. In short,
the Psalmist subjoins the effect of this instance of the grace of God towards
him, namely, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his feet had
not staggered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or <i>slipped; </i>in
other words, no resistance, adversity, or calamity, which had befallen him, had
been able to deprive him of courage or cast him into
despair.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

insists so much is, that of showing from the effect or issue, that all his
victories were to be traced to the favor of God; and from this it follows that
his cause was good and just. God, no doubt, sometimes grants successes even to
the ungodly and wicked; but he at length shows by the issue, that he was all the
while opposed to them and their enemy. It is his servants alone who experience
such tokens of his favor as he shewed towards David, and he intends by these to
testify that they are approved and accepted by him. We are apt to think that
David here speaks too much after the manner of a soldier, in declaring that he
will not cease from the work of slaughter until he has destroyed all his
enemies; or rather that he has forgotten the gentleness and meekness which ought
to shine in all true believers, and in which they should resemble their heavenly
Father; but as he attempted nothing without the command of God, and as his
affections were governed and regulated by the Holy Spirit, we may be assured
that these are not the words of a man who was cruel, and who took pleasure in
shedding blood, but of a man who faithfully executed the judgment which God had
committed to him. And, indeed, we know that he was so distinguished for
gentleness of disposition as to abhor the shedding of even a single drop of
blood, except in so far as duty and the necessity of his office required. We
must, therefore, take into consideration David's vocation, and also his pure
zeal, which was free from all perturbation of the flesh. Moreover, it should be
particularly attended to that the Psalmist here calls those his <i>enemies
</i>whose indomitable and infatuated obstinacy merited and called forth such
vengeance from God. As he represented the person of Christ, he inflicted the
punishment of death only on those who were so inflexible that they could not be
reduced to order by the exercise of a mild and humane authority; and this of
itself shows, that there was nothing in which he more delighted than to pardon
those who repented and reformed themselves. He thus resembled Christ, who gently
allures all men to repentance, but breaks in pieces, with his iron rod, those
who obstinately resist him to the last. The sum of these verses is, that David,
as he fought under the authority of God, being chosen king by him, and engaging
in no undertaking without his warrant, was assisted by him, and rendered
invincible against the assaults of all his enemies, and enabled even to
discomfit vast and very powerful armies. Farther, let us remember, that under
this type there is shadowed forth the invincible character and condition of the
kingdom of Christ, who, trusting to, and sustained by, the power of God,
overthrows and destroys his enemies, &#8212; who, in every encounter, uniformly
comes off victorious, &#8212; and who continues king in spite of all the
resistance which the world makes to his authority and power. And as the
victories secured to him involve a security of similar victories to us, it
follows that there is here promised us an impregnable defense against all the
efforts of Satan, all the machinations of sin, and all the temptations of the
flesh. Although, therefore, Christ can only obtain a tranquil kingdom by
fighting, let us not on that account be troubled, but let it be enough to
satisfy us, that the hand of God is always ready to be stretched forth for its
preservation. David was, for a time, a fugitive, so that it was with difficulty
he could save his life, by taking shelter in the dens of wild beasts; but God,
at length, made his enemies turn their backs, and not only put them to flight,
but also delivered them over to him, that he might pursue and utterly discomfit
them. In like manner, our enemies for a time may be, as it were, just ready to
put the knife to our throat</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa395</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to destroy us, but God, at length, will
make them not only to flee before us, but also to perish in our presence, as
they deserve. At the same time, let us remember what kind of warfare it is to
which God is calling us, against what kind of persons he will have us to
contend, and with what armor he furnishes us, that it may suffice us to have the
devil, the flesh, and sin overthrown and placed under our feet by his spiritual
power. With respect to those to whom he has given the power of the sword, he
will also defend them, and not suffer them to be unrighteously opposed, provided
they reign under Christ, and acknowledge him as their head. As to the words,
interpreters almost unanimously render the beginning of the 40th verse,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My</i> <i>enemies have turned
the back</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>a phrase of the same import
as, <i>They have been put to flight; </i>but as the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;r[</font><font face="Palatino">,

slain.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall cry,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The change of the tense in the verb
from the past to the future does not break the continuity of the narration; and,
therefore, the words should be explained thus:Although they cried to God, yet
their prayers were rejected by him. He pursues the same subject which it was his
object to illustrate before, namely, that it was at length manifest from the
issue that his enemies falsely boasted of having the support and countenance of
God, who showed that he had turned away from them. It is true, that when their
affairs continued to go on prosperously, they sometimes received such applause
and commendation, that it was commonly believed that God was favorable to them,
while, at the same time he seemed to be opposed to David, who although he cried
night and day to him, found it of no avail. But after God had sufficiently tried
the patience of his servant, he cast them down, and disappointed them of their
vain hope; yea, rather he would not deign to hear their prayers. We now perceive
the design of David in these words. As the ungodly had long wickedly abused the
name of God, by pretending that he favored their unjust proceedings, the
Psalmist derides their vain boasting, in which they were completely
disappointed. It is to be observed, that he here speaks of hypocrites, who never
call upon God in sincerity and truth. For this promise shall never
fail,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord is nigh unto
all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
145:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David does not, therefore, say that his enemies were
repulsed when they had recourse to God with sincere affection of heart, but only
when, with their accustomed effrontery, they thought that God was, so to speak,
bound to conduct and advance their wicked enterprises. When the ungodly, in the
extremity of their distress, pour forth prayers, and when, cast down with fear,
and trembling with the dread of impending evils, they show an appearance of
humility, they, notwithstanding, do not change their purpose so as truly to
repent and amend the evil of their ways. Besides, instead of being influenced by
faith, they are actuated by presumption and hardness of heart, or they pour
forth their complaints in doubt, rather for the purpose of murmuring against
God, than of familiarly and confidently placing their trust in him. from this
passage we may gather a profitable warning, namely, that all who treat the
afflicted poor with cruel mockery, and who proudly thrust back those who come to
them as humble suppliants, will experience that God is deaf to their prayers. We
are farther taught by the following verse, that after God has cast off the
ungodly, he leaves them to be treated with every kind of indignity, and gives
them up to be trampled under foot, as <i>the mire of the streets</i>. He not
only declares, that when the proud and the cruel cry to him in their affliction,
he will shut his ears against their cry; but he also threatens, that, in the
course of his retributive providence, they shall be treated in the same manner
in which they treat others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt deliver me from the
contentions of the people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David states,
in a few words, that he had experienced the assistance of God in all variety of
ways. He was in great danger from the tumults which sometimes arose among his
own subjects, if God had not wonderfully allayed them, and subdued the
fierceness of the people. It also happened, contrary to the general expectation,
that David, as is stated in the second clause of the verse, was victorious far
and wide, and overthrew the neighboring nations who had a little before
discomfited all Israel by their forces. It was an astonishing renovation of
things, when he not only suddenly restored to their former estate the people of
Israel, who had been greatly reduced by defeat and slaughter, but also made his
tributaries the neighboring nations, with whom before, on account of their
hostility to the nation of Israel, it was impossible to live in peace. It would
have been much to see the kingdom, after having sustained so grievous a
calamity, still surviving, and after having again collected strength recovering
its former state; but God, contrary to all expectation, conferred upon the
people of Israel more than this; he enabled them even to subdue those who before
had been their conquerors. David makes mention of both these; he tells us, in
the first place, that when the people rose up in tumult against him, it was none
other but God who stilled these commotions which took place within the kingdom;
and, in the second place, that it was under the authority, and by the conduct
and power of God, that powerful nations were subjected to him, and that the
limits of the kingdom, which, in the time of Saul, had been weak and half
broken, were greatly enlarged. Hence it is evident that David was assisted by
God, not less with respect to his domestic affairs, that is to say, within his
own kingdom, than against foreign enemies. As the kingdom of David was a type
under which the Holy Spirit intended to shadow forth to us the kingdom of
Christ, let us remember that, both in erecting and preserving it, it is
necessary for God not only to stretch forth his arm and fight against avowed
enemies, who from without rise up against him, but also to repress the tumults
and strifes which may take place within the Church. This was clearly shown in
the person of Christ from the beginning. In the first place, he met with much
opposition from the infatuated obstinacy of those of his own nation. In the next
place, the experience of all ages shows that the dissensions and strifes with
which hypocrites rend and mangle the Church, are not less hurtful in undermining
the kingdom of Christ, (if God do not interpose his hand to prevent their
injurious effects,) than the violent efforts of his enemies. Accordingly God, to
advance and maintain the kingdom of his own Son, not only overthrows before him
external enemies, but also delivers him from domestic contentions; that is to
say, from those within his kingdom, which is the
Church.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa400</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the song in 2nd Samuel, instead of
these words, <i>Thou hast made me the head of the nations, </i>the word employed
is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynrm&ccedil;t</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
tishmereni, </i>which signifies <i>to keep </i>or g<i>uard, </i>and is therefore
to be understood in this sense, that David will be securely, and for a long
time, maintained in possession of the kingdom. He knew how difficult it is to
keep under discipline and subjection those who have not been accustomed to the
yoke; and, accordingly, nothing is of more frequent occurrence than for kingdoms
which have been lately acquired by conquest to be shaken with fresh commotions.
But David, in the song in Samuel, declares that God, having elevated him to such
a high degree of power as to make him the head of the nations, will also
maintain him in the possession of the sovereignty he had been pleased to confer
upon him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A people whom I have
not known shall serve me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The whole of
this passage strongly confirms what I have just now touched upon, that the
statements here made are not to be restricted to the person of David, but
contain a prophecy respecting the kingdom of Christ which was to come. David, it
is true, might have boasted that nations, with whose manners and dispositions he
was only very imperfectly acquainted, were subject to him; but it is
nevertheless certain, that none of the nations which he conquered were
altogether unknown to him, nor removed at so great a distance as to render it
difficult for him to acquire some knowledge of them. The conquests of David,
therefore, and the submission of the people to him, were only an obscure figure
in which God has exhibited to us some faint representation of the boundless
dominion of his own Son, whose kingdom extends</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"from the rising of the
sun, even unto the going down of the

world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>44.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the simple fame of my name
they shall obey me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is of the same
import with the last clause of the preceding verse. Although David, by his
victories, had acquired such reputation and renown, that many laid down their
arms and came voluntarily to surrender themselves to him; yet, as they also had
been subdued through the dread of the power of his arms, which they saw their
neighbors had experienced to their smart, it cannot be said, properly speaking,
that at the simple fame of the name of David they submitted themselves to him.
This applies more truly to the person of Christ, who, by means of his word,
subdues the world to himself, and, at the simple hearing of his name, makes
those obedient to him who before had been rebels against him. As David was
intended to be a type of Christ, God subjected to his authority distant nations,
and such as before had been unknown to Israel in so far as familiar intercourse
was concerned. But that was only a prelude, and, as it were, preparatory to the
dominion promised to Christ, the boundaries of which must be extended to the
uttermost ends of the earth. In like manner, David had acquired to himself so
great a name by arms and warlike prowess, that many of his enemies, subdued by
fear, submitted themselves to him. And in this God exhibited a type of the
conquest which Christ would make of the Gentiles, who, by the preaching of the
Gospel alone, were subdued, and brought voluntarily to submit to his dominion;
for the obedience of faith in which the dominion of Christ is founded "cometh<i>
</i>by hearing,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The children of
strangers shall lie to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here there is
described what commonly happens in new dominions acquired by conquest, namely,
that those who have been vanquished pay homage with great reverence to their
conqueror; but it is by a reigned and forced humility. They obey in a slavish
manner, and not willingly or cheerfully. This is evidently the sense. Some
interpreters, indeed, give a different explanation of the word <i>lie,
</i>viewing David as meaning by it that his enemies had either been disappointed
in their expectation, or that, in order to escape the punishment which they were
afraid he might inflict upon them, they had lied in declaring that they had
never devised any thing hostile against him; but it appears to me, that this
does not sufficiently express what David intended. In my opinion, therefore, the
words <i>to lie </i>are here to be understood generally as in other places, for
<i>to be humbled after a slavish manner. </i>The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;hk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cachash, </i>here used, which signifies <i>to lie, </i>is sometimes to be
understood metaphorically for <i>to be humbled, to submit to, to take upon one's
self the yoke of subjection;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa401</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but still in a feigned and servile
manner. Those whom he terms the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of the
stranger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>of strangers, </i>are
the nations who did not belong to the people of Israel, but who, previous to
their being conquered by him, formed a distinct and an independent community by
themselves. This also we see fulfilled in Christ, to whom many come with
apparent humility; not, however, with true affection, but with a double and
false heart, whom, on that account, the Holy Spirit fitly terms <i>strangers.
</i>They are, indeed, mingled among the chosen people, but they are not united
to the same body with them by a true faith, and, therefore, ought not to be
accounted children of the Church. It is very true that all the Gentiles, when in
the beginning they were called into the Church, were strangers; but when they
began to entertain new feelings and new affections towards Christ, they who
before were "strangers and foreigners" became</font><br></div>

more striking light, the great fame and formidable name which we have said David
had acquired. It is no ordinary sign of reverence when those who are protected
in hiding-places, and shut up within steep fortifications, are so stricken with
terror as to come forth of their own accord and surrender themselves. As fear
made the enemies of David to come forth from their places of concealment, to
meet him with submission, so the Gospel strikes the unbelieving with such fear,
as compels them to yield obedience to Christ. Such is the power of prophecy,
that is to say, the preaching of the word, as Paul testifies in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

reading, which is in the optative mood expressing a wish <i>that God might live,

defense of it, that it is a metaphor borrowed from the custom of men, who not
only use this manner of speaking when they wish well to any one, but likewise
utter it with loud and applauding acclamation, when they intend to receive their
princes with due honor. According to this view, it would be an expression in
which praise is ascribed to God, and suitable for a triumphal
song.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa405</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It may, however, be very properly
considered as a simple affirmation, in which David declares that <i>God lives,
</i>in other words, that he is endued with sovereign power. Farther, the life
which David attributes to God is not to be restricted to the being or essence of
God, but is rather to be understood of the evidence of it deducible from his
works, which manifest to us that he liveth. Whenever he withdraws the working of
his power from before our eyes, the sense and cognisance of the truth, "God
liveth," also evanishes from our minds. He is, therefore, said <i>to live,
</i>inasmuch as he shows, by evident proofs of his power, that it is he who
preserves and upholds the world. And as David had known, by experience, this
life of God, he celebrates it with praises and thanksgiving. If we read the
first clause in the present tense, <i>The Lord liveth, </i>the copula <i>and,
</i>which follows, has the force of an inference; and, accordingly, the words
should be resolved thus:<i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah liveth, and,
therefore, blessed be my strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
epithet, <i>My strength, </i>and the other which occurs in verse 48th,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
deliverer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>confirm what I have already
stated, that God does not simply live in himself, and in his secret place, but
displays his vital energy in the government of the whole world. The Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrwx</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
tsuri, </i>which we have translated <i>my strength, </i>is here to be understood
in a transitive sense for <i>Him </i>who bestows
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>47.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God who giveth me
vengeance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist again attributes
to God the victories which he had obtained. As he could never have expected to
obtain them unless he had been confident that he would receive the aid of God,
so now he acknowledges God to be the sole author of them. That he may not seem
carelessly to bestow upon him, as it were, in passing, only a small sprinkling
of the praise of his victories, he repeats, in express terms, that he had
nothing but what God had given him. In the first place, he acknowledges that
power was given him from above, to enable him to inflict on his enemies the
punishment which they deserved. It may seem at first sight strange that God
should arm his own people to execute vengeance; but as I have previously shown
you, we ought always to remember David's vocation. He was not a private person,
but being endued with royal power and authority, the judgment which he executed
was enjoined upon him by God. If a man, upon receiving injury, breaks forth to
avenge himself, he usurps the office of God; and, therefore, it is rash and
impious for private individuals to retaliate the injuries which have been
inflicted upon them. With respect to kings and magistrates, God, who declares
that vengeance belongeth to him, in arming them with the sword, constitutes them
the ministers and executioners of his vengeance. David, therefore, has put the
word <i>vengeance </i>for the just punishments which it was lawful for him to
inflict by the commandment of God, provided he was led under the influence of a
zeal duly regulated by the Holy Spirit, and not under the influence of the
impetuosity of the flesh. Unless this moderation is exemplified in performing
the duties of their calling, it is in vain for kings to boast that God has
committed to them the charge of taking vengeance; seeing it is not less
unwarrantable for a man to abuse, according to his own fancy and the lust of the
flesh, the sword which he is allowed to use, than to seize it without the
command of God. The Church militant, which is under the standard of Christ, has
no permission to execute vengeance, except against those who obstinately refuse
to be reclaimed. We are commanded to endeavor to overcome our enemies by doing
them good, and to pray for their salvation. It becomes us, therefore, at the
same time, to desire that they may be brought to repentance, and to a right
state of mind, until it appear beyond all doubt that they are irrecoverably and
hopelessly depraved. In the meantime, in regard to vengeance, it must be left to
God, that we may not be carried headlong to execute it before the time. David
next concludes, from the perils and distresses in which he had been involved,
that if he had not been preserved by the hand of God, he could not in any other
way have escaped in safety:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
deliverer from my enemies; yea, thou hast lifted me up from those who had risen
up against me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The sense in which we are
to understand <i>the lifting up </i>of which he speaks is, that he was
wonderfully raised up above the power and malice of his enemies that he might
not sink under their violence, and that they might not be victorious over
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>49.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore will I praise thee, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse he teaches us
that the blessings God had conferred upon him, of which he had spoken, are
worthy of being celebrated with extraordinary and unusual praises, that the fame
of them might reach even the heathen. There is in the words an implied contrast
between the ordinary worship of God which the faithful were then accustomed to
perform in the temple, and this thanksgiving of which David speaks, which could
not be confined within so narrow limits. The meaning, therefore, is, O Lord, I
will not only give thee thanks in the assembly of thy people, according to the
ritual which thou hast appointed in thy law, but thy praises shall extend to a
greater distance, even as thy grace towards me is worthy of being recounted
through the whole world. Moreover, from these words we conclude that this
passage contains a prophecy concerning the kingdom of Christ, which was to come.
Unless the heathen had been allured into the fellowship of the chosen people,
and united into one body with them, to praise God among them would have been to
sing his praises among the deaf, which would have been foolish work and lost
labor. Accordingly, Paul very properly and suitably proves from this text, that
the calling of the Gentiles was not a thing which happened by chance, or at a
venture,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:9.) We shall afterwards see in many places that the Church is appointed to be
the sacred dwelling-place for showing forth the praises of God. And, therefore,
the name of God could not have been rightly and profitably celebrated elsewhere
than in Judea, until the ears of the Gentiles were opened, which was done when
God adopted them, and called them to himself by the
gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He worketh great deliverances,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This concluding verse clearly shows
why God had exercised such goodness and liberality towards David, namely,
because he had anointed him to be king. By calling himself <i>God's king,
</i>David testifies that he had not rashly rushed into that office, nor was
thrust into it by conspiracies and wicked intrigues, but, on the contrary,
reigned by lawful right, inasmuch as it was the will of God that he should be
king. This he proves by the ceremony of anointing; for God, in anointing him by
the hand of Samuel, had asserted his right to reign not less than if he had
visibly stretched forth his hand from heaven to place and establish him on the
royal throne. This election, he says, was confirmed by a continued series of
great deliverances; and from this it follows, that all who enter on any course
without having the call of God, are chargeable with avowedly making war against
him. At the same time, he attributes these deliverances to the goodness of God
as their cause, to teach us, that that kingdom was founded purely and simply
upon the good pleasure of God. Farther, from the concluding sentence of the
psalm, it appears, as I have said before, that David does not here so much
recount by way of history the singular and varied instances of the grace of God
which he had personally experienced, as predict the everlasting duration of his
kingdom. And it is to be observed, that by the word <i>seed </i>we are not to
understand all his descendants indiscriminately; but we are to consider it as
particularly referring to that successor of David of whom God had spoken in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:12, promising that he would be a father to him. As it had been
predicted that his kingdom would continue as long as the sun and the moon should
shine in the heavens, the prophecy must necessarily be viewed as descending to
him who was to be king not for a time, but for ever. David, therefore, commends
his seed to us, as honored by that remarkable promise, which fully applies
neither to Solomon nor to any other of his successors, but to the only begotten
Son of God; as the apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:4,) teaches us, that this is a dignity in which he excels the angels. In
conclusion, we shall then only duly profit in the study of this psalm, when we
are led by the contemplation of the shadow and type to him who is the
substance.</font><br></div>

fa408</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have already said, that this
psalm consists of two parts, in the first of which David celebrates the glory of
God as manifested in his works; and, in the other, exalts and magnifies the
knowledge of God which shines forth more clearly in his word. He only makes
mention of the heavens; but, under this part of creation, which is the noblest,
and the excellency of which is more conspicuous, he doubtless includes by
synecdoche the whole fabric of the world. There is certainly nothing so obscure
or contemptible, even in the smallest corners of the earth, in which some marks
of the power and wisdom of God may not be seen; but as a more distinct image of
him is engraven on the heavens, David has particularly selected them for
contemplation, that their splendor might lead us to contemplate all parts of the
world. When a man, from beholding and contemplating the heavens, has been
brought to acknowledge God, he will learn also to reflect upon and to admire his
wisdom and power as displayed on the face of the earth, not only in general, but
even in the minutest plants. In the first verse, the Psalmist repeats one thing
twice, according to his usual manner. He introduces the heavens as witnesses and
preachers of the glory of God, attributing to the dumb creature a quality which,
strictly speaking, does not belong to it, in order the more severely to upbraid
men for their ingratitude, if they should pass over so clear a testimony with
unheeding ears. This manner of speaking more powerfully moves and affects us
than if he had said, The heavens <i>show </i>or <i>manifest </i>the glory of
God. It is indeed a great thing, that in the splendor of the heavens there is
presented to our view a lively image of God; but, as the living voice has a
greater effect in exciting our attention, or at least teaches us more surely and
with greater profit than simple beholding, to which no oral instruction is
added, we ought to mark the force of the figure which the Psalmist uses when he
says, that the heavens by their preaching declare the glory of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The repetition which he makes in the second
clause is merely an explanation of the first. David shows how it is that the
heavens proclaim to us the glory of God, namely, by openly bearing testimony
that they have not been put together by chance, but were wonderfully created by
the supreme Architect. When we behold the heavens, we cannot but be elevated, by
the contemplation of them, to Him who is their great Creator; and the beautiful
arrangement and wonderful variety which distinguish the courses and station of
the heavenly bodies, together with the beauty and splendor which are manifest in
them, cannot but furnish us with an evident proof of his providence. Scripture,
indeed, makes known to us the time and manner of the creation; but the heavens
themselves, although God should say nothing on the subject, proclaim loudly and
distinctly enough that they have been fashioned by his hands:and this of itself
abundantly suffices to bear testimony to men of his glory. As soon as we
acknowledge God to be the supreme Architect, who has erected the beauteous
fabric of the universe, our minds must necessarily be ravished with wonder at
his infinite goodness, wisdom, and
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Day unto day uttereth
speech.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Philosophers, who have more
penetration into those matters than others, understand how the stars are
arranged in such beautiful order, that notwithstanding their immense number
there is no confusion; but to the ignorant and unlettered, the continual
succession of days is a more undoubted proof of the providence of God. David,
therefore, having spoken of the heavens, does not here descend from them to
other parts of the world; but, from an effect more sensible and nearer our
apprehension, he confirms what he has just now said, namely, that the glory of
God not only shines, but also resounds in the heavens. The words may be
variously expounded, but the different expositions which have been given of them
make little difference as to the sense. Some explain them thus, that no day
passes in which God does not show some signal evidence of his power. Others are
of opinion that they denote the augmentations of instruction and knowledge, -
that every succeeding day contributes something new in proof of the existence
and perfections of God. Others view them as meaning that the days and nights
talk together, and reason concerning the glory of their Creator', but this is a
somewhat forced interpretation. David, I have no doubt, here teaches, from the
established alternations of days and nights, that the course and revolutions of
the sun, and moon, and stars, are regulated by the marvellous wisdom of God.
Whether we translate the words <i>Day after day, </i>or <i>one day to another
day, </i>is of little consequence; for all that David means is the beautiful
arrangement of time which the succession of days and nights effects. If, indeed,
we were as attentive as we ought to be, even one day would suffice to bear
testimony to us of the glory of God, and even one night would be sufficient to
perform to us the same office. But when we see the sun and the moon performing
their daily revolutions, &#8212; the sun by day appearing over our heads, and
the moon succeeding in its turns &#8212; the sun ascending by degrees, while at
the same time he approaches nearer us, &#8212; and afterwards bending his course
so as to depart from us by little and little; &#8212; and when we see that by
this means the length of the days and nights is regulated, and that the
variation of their length is arranged according to a law so uniform, as
invariably to recur at the same points of time in every successive year, we have
in this a much brighter testimony to the glory of God. David, therefore, with
the highest reason, declares, that although God should not speak a single word
to men, yet the orderly and useful succession of days and nights eloquently
proclaims the glory of God, and that there is now left to men no pretext for
ignorance; for since the days and nights perform towards us so well and so
carefully the office of teachers, we may acquire, if we are duly attentive, a
sufficient amount of knowledge under their
tuition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no language nor
speech [where] their voice is not heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This verse receives two almost contrary interpretations, each of which,
however, has the appearance of probability. As the words, when rendered
literally, read thus &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No
language, and no words, their voice is not
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>&#8212; some connect the third and
fourth verses together, as if this sentence were incomplete without the clause
which follows in the beginning of the fourth verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their writing has gone forth
through all the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. According to
them, the meaning is this:&#8212; The heavens, it is true, are mute and are not
endued with the faculty of speech; but still they proclaim the glory of God with
a voice sufficiently loud and distinct. But if this was David's meaning, what
need was there to repeat three times that they have not articulate speech? It
would certainly be spiritless and superfluous to insist so much upon a thing so
universally known. The other exposition, therefore, as it is more generally
received, seems also to be more suitable. In the Hebrew tongue, which is
concise, it is often necessary to supply some word; and it is particularly a
common thing in that language for the relatives to be omitted, that is to say,
the words <i>which, in which, </i>etc., as here, <i>There is no language, there
is no speech, </i>[<i>where</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

fa411</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> rather denotes an exception to what is
stated in the preceding members of the sentence, as if it had been said, The
difference and variety of languages does not prevent the preaching of the
heavens and their language from being heard and understood in every quarter of
the world. The difference of languages is a barrier which prevents different
nations from maintaining mutual intercourse, and it makes him who in his own
country is distinguished for his eloquence, when he comes into a foreign country
either dumb or, if he attempt to speak, barbarous. And even although a man could
speak all languages, he could not speak to a Grecian and a Roman at the same
time; for as soon as he began to direct his discourse to the one, the other
would cease to understand him. David, therefore, by making a tacit comparison,
enhances the efficacy of the testimony which the heavens bear to their Creator.
The import of his language is, Different nations differ from each other as to
language; but the heavens have a common language to teach all men without
distinction, nor is there any thing but their own carelessness to hinder even
those who are most strange to each other, and who live in the most distant parts
of the world, from profiting, as it were, at the mouth of the same
teacher.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Their writing has gone forth, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here
the inspired writer declares how the heavens preach to all nations
indiscriminately, namely, because men, in all countries and in all parts of the
earth, may understand that the heavens are set before their eyes as witnesses to
bear testimony to the glory of God. As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kav signifies </i>sometimes <i>a line, </i>and sometimes <i>a building,
</i>some deduce from it this meaning, that the fabric of the heavens being
framed in a regular manner, and as it were by line, proclaims the glory of God
in all parts of the world. But as David here metaphorically introduces the
splendor and magnificence of the heavenly bodies, as preaching the glory of God
like a teacher in a seminary of learning, it would be a meagre and unsuitable
manner of speaking to say, that the line of the heavens goes forth to the
uttermost ends of the earth. Besides, he immediately adds, in the following
clause, that <i>their words </i>are every where heard; but what relation is
there between words and the beauty of a building? If, however, we render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kav, writing, </i>these two things will very well agree, first, that the
glory of God is written and imprinted in the heavens, as in an open volume which
all men may read; and, secondly, that, at the same time, they give forth a loud
and distinct voice, which reaches the ears of all men, and causes itself to be
heard in all places.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa412</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus we are taught, that the language
of which mention has been made before is, as I may term it, a visible language,
in other words, language which addresses itself to the sight; for it is to the
eyes of men that the heavens speak, not to their ears; and thus David justly
compares the beautiful order and arrangement, by which the heavenly bodies are
distinguished, to a writing. That the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kav, </i>signifies a line in
writing,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa413</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is sufficiently evident from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:10, where God, comparing the Jews to children who are not yet of sufficient
age to make great proficiency, speaks thus:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For precept must be upon
precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little,
and there a little."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In my judgment, therefore, the meaning is, that the
glory of God is not written in small obscure letters, but richly engraven in
large and bright characters, which all men may read, and read with the greatest
ease. Hitherto I have explained the true and proper meaning of the inspired
writer. Some have wrested this part of the psalm by putting upon it an
allegorical interpretation; but my readers will easily perceive that this has
been done without reason. I have shown in the commencement, and it is also
evident from the scope of the whole discourse, that David, before coming to the
law, sets before us the fabric of the world, that in it we might behold the
glory of God. Now, if we understand the heavens as meaning the apostles, and the
sun Christ, there will be no longer place for the division of which we have
spoken; and, besides, it would be an improper arrangement to place the gospel
first and then the law. It is very evident that the inspired poet here treats of
the knowledge of God, which is naturally presented to all men in this world as
in a mirror; and, therefore, I forbear discoursing longer on that point. As,
however, these allegorical interpreters have supported their views from the
words of Paul, this difficulty must be removed. Paul, in discoursing upon the
calling of the Gentiles, lays down this as an established principle, that,
"Whoever<i> </i>shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved;" and then
he adds, that it is impossible for any to call upon him until they know him by
the teaching of the gospel. But as it seemed to the Jews to be a kind of
sacrilege that Paul published the promise of salvation to the Gentiles, he asks
whether the Gentiles themselves had not heard? And he answers, by quoting this
passage, that there was a school open and accessible to them, in which they
might learn to fear God, and serve him, inasmuch as "the<i>
</i>writing</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa414</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the heavens has gone forth
<i>through all the earth, </i>and their words unto the ends of the world,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451018&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:18.) But Paul could not at that time have said with truth, that the voice of
the gospel had been heard through the whole world from the mouth of the
apostles, since it had scarcely as yet reached even a few countries. The
preaching of the other apostles certainly had not then extended to far distant
parts of the world, but was confined within the boundaries of Judea. The design
of the apostle it is not difficult to comprehend. He intended to say that God,
from ancient times, had manifested his glory to the Gentiles, and that this was
a prelude to the more ample instruction which was one day to be published to
them. And although God's chosen people for a time had been in a condition
distinct and separate from that of the Gentiles, it ought not to be thought
strange that God at length made himself known indiscriminately to both, seeing
he had hitherto united them to himself by certain means which addressed
themselves in common to both; as Paul says in another passage, that when
God,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"in times past, suffered
all nations to walk in their own ways, he nevertheless left not himself without
a
witness,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
14:16, 17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whence we conclude, that those who have imagined that
Paul departed from the genuine and proper sense of David's words are grossly
mistaken. The reader will understand this still more clearly by reading my
commentaries on the above passage of St.
Paul.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath set in them a
tabernacle [or pavilion] for the sun.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As
David, out of the whole fabric of the world, has especially chosen the heavens,
in which he might exhibit to our view an image of God, because there it is more
distinctly to be seen, even as a man is better seen when set on an elevated
stage; so now he shows us the sun as placed in the highest rank, because in his
wonderful brightness the majesty of God displays itself more magnificently than
in all the rest. The other planets, it is true, have also their motions, and as
it were the appointed places within which they run their
race,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa415</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the firmament, by its own
revolution, draws with it all the fixed stars, but it would have been lost time
for David to have attempted to teach the secrets of astronomy to the rude and
unlearned; and therefore he reckoned it sufficient to speak in a homely style,
that he might reprove the whole world of ingratitude, if, in beholding the sun,
they are not taught the fear and the knowledge of God. This, then, is the reason
why he says that a tent or pavilion has been erected for the sun, and also why
he says, that he goes forth from one end of the heaven, and quickly passes to
the other and opposite end. He does not here discourse scientifically (as he
might have done, had he spoken among philosophers) concerning the entire
revolution which the sun performs, but, accommodating himself to the rudest and
dullest, he confines himself to the ordinary appearances presented to the eye,
and, for this reason, he does not speak of the other half of the sun's course,
which does not appear in our hemisphere. He proposes to us three things to be
considered in the sun, &#8212; the splendor and excellency of his forms &#8212;
the swiftness with which he runs his course, &#8212; and the astonishing power
of his heat. The more forcibly to express and magnify his surpassing beauty and,
as it were, magnificent attire, he employs the similitude of a bridegroom. He
then adds another similitude, that of a valiant man who enters the lists as a
racer to carry off the prize of the course. The swiftness of those who in
ancient times contended in the stadium, whether on chariots or on foot, was
wonderful; and although it was nothing when compared with the velocity with
which the sun moves in his orbit, yet David, among all that he saw coming under
the ordinary notice of men, could find nothing which approached nearer to it.
Some think that the third clause, where he speaks of the heat of the sun, is to
be understood of his vegetative heat, as it is called; in other words, that by
which the vegetating bodies which are in the earth have their vigor, support,
and growth.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa416</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I do not think that this sense
suits the passage. It is, indeed, a wonderful work of God, and a signal evidence
of his goodness, that the powerful influence of the sun penetrating the earth
renders it fruitful. But as the Psalmist says, that <i>no man </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nothing is hidden from his
heat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I am rather inclined to understand
it of the violent heat which scorches men and other living creatures as well as
plants and trees. With respect to the enlivening heat of the sun, by which we
feel ourselves to be invigorated, no man desires to avoid
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

The law of the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the second
part of the psalm commences. After having shown that the creatures, although
they do not speak, nevertheless serve as instructors to all mankind, and teach
all men so clearly that there is a God, as to render them inexcusable, the
Psalmist now turns towards the Jews, to whom God had communicated a fuller
knowledge of himself by means of his word. While the heavens bear witness
concerning God, their testimony does not lead men so far as that thereby they
learn truly to fear him, and acquire a well-grounded knowledge of him; it serves
only to render them inexcusable. It is doubtless true, that if we were not very
dull and stupid, the signatures and proofs of Deity which are to be found on the
theater of the world, are abundant enough to incite us to acknowledge and
reverence God; but as, although surrounded with so clear a light, we are
nevertheless blind, this splendid representation of the glory of God, without
the aid of the word, would profit us nothing, although it should be to us as a
loud and distinct proclamation sounding in our ears. Accordingly, God vouchsafes
to those whom he has determined to call to salvation special grace, just as in
ancient times, while he gave to all men without exception evidences of his
existence in his works, he communicated to the children of Abraham alone his
Law, thereby to furnish them with a more certain and intimate knowledge of his
majesty. Whence it follows, that the Jews are bound by a double tie to serve
God. As the Gentiles, to whom God has spoken only by the dumb creatures, have no
excuse for their ignorance, how much less is their stupidity to be endured who
neglect to hear the voice which proceeds from his own sacred mouth? The end,
therefore, which David here has in view, is to excite the Jews, whom God had
bound to himself by a more sacred bond, to yield obedience to him with a more
prompt and cheerful affection. Farther, under the term <i>law, </i>he not only
means the rule of living righteously, or the Ten Commandments, but he also
comprehends the covenant by which God had distinguished that people from the
rest of the world, and the whole doctrine of Moses, the parts of which he
afterwards enumerates under the terms <i>testimonies, statutes, </i>and other
names. These titles and commendations by which he exalts the dignity and
excellence of the Law would not agree with the Ten Commandments alone, unless
there were, at the same time, joined to them a free adoption and the promises
which depend upon it; and, in short, the whole body of doctrine of which true
religion and godliness consists. As to the Hebrew words which are here used, I
will not spend much time in endeavoring very exactly to give the particular
signification of each of them, because it is easy to gather from other passages,
that they are sometimes confounded or used indifferently.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">Twd[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eduth, </i>which we render <i>testimony, </i>is generally taken for the
covenant, in which God, on the one hand, promised to the children of Abraham
that he would be their God, and on the other required faith and obedience on
their part. It, therefore, denotes the mutual covenant entered into between God
and his ancient people. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydwqp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pikkudim, </i>which I have followed others in translating <i>statutes, </i>is
restricted by some to ceremonies, but improperly in my judgment:for I find that
it is every where taken generally for ordinances and edicts. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mitsvah, </i>which follows immediately after, and which we translate
<i>commandment, </i>has almost the same signification. As to the other words, we
shall consider them in their respective
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The first commendation of the law of God
is, that it is <i>perfect. </i>By this word David means, that if a man is duly
instructed in the law of God, he wants nothing which is requisite to perfect
wisdom. In the writings of heathen authors there are no doubt to be found true
and useful sentences scattered here and there; and it is also true, that God has
put into the minds of men some knowledge of justice and uprightness; but in
consequence of the corruption of our nature, the true light of truth is not to
be found among men where revelation is not enjoyed, but only certain mutilated
principles which are involved in much obscurity and doubt. David, therefore,
justly claims this praise for the law of God, that it contains in it perfect and
absolute wisdom. As <i>the conversion of the soul, </i>of which he speaks
immediately after, is doubtless to be understood of its <i>restoration, </i>I
have felt no difficulty in so rendering it. There are some who reason with too
much subtilty on this expression, by explaining it as referring to the
repentance and regeneration of man. I admit that the soul cannot be restored by
the law of God, without being at the same time renewed unto righteousness; but
we must consider what is David's proper meaning, which is this, that as the soul
gives vigor and strength to the body, so the law in like manner is the life of
the soul. In saying that the soul is restored, he has an allusion to the
miserable state in which we are all born. There, no doubt, still survive in us
some small remains of the first creation; but as no part of our constitution is
free from defilement and impurity, the condition of the soul thus corrupted and
depraved differs little from death, and tends altogether to death. It is,
therefore, necessary that God should employ the law as a remedy for restoring us
to purity; not that the letter of the law can do this of itself, as shall be
afterwards shown more at length, but because God employs his word as an
instrument for restoring our souls.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the
Psalmist declares, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The testimony
of Jehovah is faithful,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is a
repetition of the preceding sentence, so that <i>the integrity </i>or
<i>perfection of the law </i>and <i>the faithfulness </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth of his
testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>signify the same thing;
namely, that when we give ourselves up to be guided and governed by the word of
God, we are in no danger of going astray, since this is the path by which he
securely guides his own people to salvation.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instruction in
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>seems here to be added as the
commencement of the restoration of the soul. Understanding is the most excellent
endowment of the soul; and David teaches us that it is to be derived from the
law, for we are naturally destitute of it. By the word <i>babes, </i>he is not
to be understood as meaning any particular class of persons, as if others were
sufficiently wise of themselves; but by it he teaches us, in the first place,
that none are endued with right understanding until they have made progress in
the study of the law. In the second place, he shows by it what kind of scholars
God requires, namely, those who are fools in their own estimation,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:18,) and who come down to the rank of children, that the loftiness
of their own understanding may not prevent them from giving themselves up, with
a spirit of entire docility, to the teaching of the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The statutes of Jehovah are
right.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist at first view may
seem to utter a mere common-place sentiment when he calls the statutes of the
Lord <i>right. </i>If we, however, more attentively consider the contrast which
he no doubt makes between the rectitude of the law and the crooked ways in which
men entangle themselves when they follow their own understandings, we will be
convinced that this commendation implies more than may at first sight appear. We
know how much every man is wedded to himself, and how difficult it is to
eradicate from our minds the vain confidence of our own wisdom. It is therefore
of great importance to be well convinced of this truth, that a man's life cannot
be ordered aright unless it is framed according to the law of God, and that
without this he can only wander in labyrinths and crooked bypaths. David adds,
in the second place, <i>that God's statutes rejoice the heart. </i>This implies
that there is no other joy true and solid but that which proceeds from a good
conscience; and of this we become partakers when we are certainly persuaded that
our life is pleasing and acceptable to God. No doubt, the source from which true
peace of conscience proceeds is faith, which freely reconciles us to God. But to
the saints who serve God with true affection of heart there arises unspeakable
joy also, from the knowledge that they do not labor in his service in vain, or
without hope of recompense, since they have God as the judge and approver of
their life. In short, this joy is put in opposition to all the corrupt
enticements and pleasures of the world, which are a deadly bait, luring wretched
souls to their everlasting destruction. The import of the Psalmist's language
is, Those who take delight in committing sin procure for themselves abundant
matter of sorrow; but the observance of the law of God, on the contrary, brings
to man true joy. In the end of the verse, the Psalmist teaches that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the commandment of God is pure,
enlightening the eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this he gives
us tacitly to understand that it is only in the commandments of God that we find
the difference between good and evil laid down, and that it is in vain to seek
it elsewhere, since whatever men devise of themselves is mere filth and refuse,
corrupting the purity of the life. He farther intimates that men, with all their
acuteness, are blind, and always wander in darkness, until they turn their eyes
to the light of heavenly doctrine. Whence it follows, that none are truly wise
but those who take God for their conductor and guide, following the path which
he points out to them, and who are diligently seeking after the peace which he
offers and presents by his word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But here a
question of no small difficulty arises; for Paul seems entirely to overthrow
these commendations of the law which David here recites. How can these things
agree together:that the law restores the souls of men, while yet it is a dead
and deadly letter? that it rejoices men's hearts, and yet, by bringing in the
spirit of bondage, strikes them with terror? that it enlightens the eyes, and
yet, by casting a veil before our minds, excludes the light which ought to
penetrate within? But, in the first place, we must remember what I have shown
you at the commencement, that David does not speak simply of the precepts of the
Moral Law, but comprehends the whole covenant by which God had adopted the
descendants of Abraham to be his peculiar people; and, therefore, to the Moral
Law, the rule of living well &#8212; he joins the free promises of salvation, or
rather Christ himself, in whom and upon whom this adoption was founded. But
Paul, who had to deal with persons who perverted and abused the law, and
separated it from the grace and the Spirit of Christ, refers to the ministry of
Moses viewed merely by itself, and according to the letter. It is certain, that
if the Spirit of Christ does not quicken the law, the law is not only
unprofitable, but also deadly to its disciples. Without Christ there is in the
law nothing but inexorable rigour, which adjudges all mankind to the wrath and
curse of God. And farther, without Christ, there remains within us a
rebelliousness of the flesh, which kindles in our hearts a hatred of God and of
his law, and from this proceed the distressing bondage and awful terror of which
the Apostle speaks. These different ways in which the law may be viewed, easily
show us the manner of reconciling these passages of Paul and David, which seem
at first view to be at variance. The design of Paul is to show what the law can
do for us, taken by itself; that is to say, what it can do for us when, without
the promise of grace, it strictly and rigorously exacts from us the duty which
we owe to God; but David, in praising it as he here does, speaks of the whole
doctrine of the law, which includes also the gospel, and, therefore, under the
law he comprehends Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fear of Jehovah is
clean.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the <i>fear of God </i>we are
here to understand the way in which God is to be served; and therefore it is
taken in an active sense for the doctrine which prescribes to us the manner in
which we ought to fear God. The way in which men generally manifest their fear
of God, is by inventing false religions and a vitiated worship; in doing which
they only so much the more provoke his wrath. David, therefore, here indirectly
condemns these corrupt inventions, about which men torment themselves in
vain,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa420</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and which often sanction impurity; and
in opposition to them he justly affirms, that in the keeping of the law there is
an exemption from every thing which defiles. He adds, that <i>it endures for
ever; </i>as if he had said, This is the treasure of everlasting happiness. We
see how mankind, without well thinking what they are doing, pursue, with
impetuous and ardent affections, the transitory things of this world; but, in
thus catching at the empty shadow of a happy life, they lose true happiness
itself. In the second clause, by calling the commandments of God <i>truth,
</i>David shows that whatever men undertake to do at the mere suggestion of
their own minds, without having a regard to the law of God as a rule, is error
and falsehood. And, indeed, he could not have more effectually stirred us up to
love, and zealously to live according to the law, than by giving us this
warning, that all those who order their life, without having any respect to the
law of God, deceive themselves, and follow after mere delusions. Those who
explain the word <i>judgments, </i>as referring only to the commandments of the
second table, are, in my opinion, mistaken:for David's purpose was to commend,
under a variety of expressions, the advantages which the faithful receive from
the law of God. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are justified
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the meaning is, They are all
righteous from the greatest to the least, without a single exception. By this
commendation he distinguishes the law of God from all the doctrines of men, for
no blemish or fault can be found in it, but it is in all points absolutely
perfect.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
19:10-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10. </b>More to be desired are

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>More to be desired are they

law of God both on account of its price and sweetness. This commendation depends
on the commendations given in the preceding verses; for the many and great
advantages which he has just now enumerated, ought justly to make us account
heavenly truth the highest and most excellent treasure, and to despise, when
compared with it, all the gold and silver of the world. Instead of the word
<i>fine gold, </i>which the Latins have called <i>Aurum
obryzum,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa422</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some render the Hebrew word <i>a
jewel, </i>or <i>precious stones,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa423</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but the other translation is
more generally received, namely, <i>fine gold, </i>that is, gold which is pure
and well refined in the furnace; and there are many passages of Scripture by
which this rendering is confirmed.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa424</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>paz, </i>is derived from

<i>pazah, </i>which signifies <i>to
strengthen;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa425</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from which we may conjecture
that the Psalmist does not mean the gold of any particular country, as if one
should say the gold of Ophir, but gold completely refined and purified by art.
So far is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>paz, </i>from being derived from the name of a country, that, on the
contrary, it appears from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241009&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:9, that the land of Uphaz took its name from this Hebrew word, because it had
in it mines of the finest gold. As to the origin of the word <i>obrizum,
</i>which the Latins have used, we cannot say any thing with certainty, except
that, according to the conjecture of Jerome, it signifies <i>brought from the
land of Ophir, </i>as if it had been said, <i>aurum Ophrizum. </i>In short, the
sense is, that we do not esteem the law as it deserves, if we do not prefer it
to all the riches of the world. If we are once brought thus highly to prize the
law, it will serve effectually to deliver our hearts from an immoderate desire
of gold and silver. To this esteem of the law there must be added love to it,
and delight in it, so that it may not only subdue us to obedience by constraint,
but also allure us by its sweetness; a thing which is impossible, unless, at the
same time, we have mortified in us the love of carnal pleasures, with which it
is not wonderful to see us enticed and ensnared, so long as we reject, through a
vitiated taste, the righteousness of God. From this we may again deduce another
evidence, that David's discourse is not to be understood simply of the
commandments, and of the dead letter, but that he comprehends, at the same time,
the promises by which the grace of God is offered to us. If the law did nothing
else but command us, how could it be loved, since in commanding it terrifies us,
because we all fail in keeping it?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa426</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Certainly, if we separate the law from
the hope of pardon, and from the Spirit of Christ, so far from tasting it to be
sweet as honey, we will rather find in it a bitterness which kills our wretched
souls.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moreover, by them is thy
servant made circumspect.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words
may be extended generally to all the people of God; but they are properly to be
understood of David himself, and by them he testifies that he knew well, from
his own experience, all that he had stated in the preceding verses respecting
the law. No man will ever speak truly and in good earnest of heavenly truth, but
he who has it deeply fixed in his own heart. David therefore acknowledges, that
whatever prudence he had for regulating and framing his life aright, he was
indebted for it to the law of God. Although, however, it is properly of himself
that he speaks, yet by his own example he sets forth a general rule, namely,
that if persons wish to have a proper method for governing the life well, the
law of God alone is perfectly sufficient for this purpose; but that, on the
contrary, as soon as persons depart from it, they are liable to fall into
numerous errors and sins. It is to be observed that David, by all at once
turning his discourse to God, appeals to him as a witness of what he had said,
the more effectually to convince men that he speaks sincerely and from the
bottom of his heart. As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rhz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zahar, </i>which I have translated <i>made circumspect, </i>signifies <i>to
teach, </i>as well as <i>to be on one's guard, </i>some translate it in this
place, <i>Thy servant is taught, </i>or <i>warned, </i>by the commandments of
the law. But the sentence implies much more, when it is viewed as meaning that
he who yields himself to God to be governed by him is made circumspect and
cautious, and, therefore, this translation seems to me to be preferable. In the
second clause the Psalmist declares, that whoever yield themselves to God to
observe the rule of righteousness which he prescribes, do not lose their labor,
seeing he has in reserve for them a great and rich
reward:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In keeping of them there
is great reward. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is no mean commendation of
the law when it is said, that in it God enters into covenant with us, and, so to
speak, brings himself under obligation to recompense our obedience. In requiring
from us whatever is contained in the law, he demands nothing but what he has a
right to; yet such is his free and undeserved liberality, that he promises to
his servants a reward, which, in point of justice, he does not owe them. The
promises of the law, it is true, are made of no effect; but it is through our
fault:for even he who is most perfect amongst us comes far short of full and
complete righteousness; and men cannot expect any reward for their works until
they have perfectly and to the full satisfied the requirements of the law. Thus
these two doctrines completely harmonize:first, that eternal life shall be given
as the reward of works to him who fulfils the law in all points; and, secondly,
that the law notwithstanding denounces a curse against all men, because the
whole human family are destitute of the righteousness of works. This will
presently appear from the following verse. David, after having celebrated this
benefit of the law - that it offers an abundant reward to those who serve God
&#8212; immediately changes his discourse, and cries out,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who</i> <i>can understand his
errors?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by which he pronounces all men
liable to eternal death, and thus utterly overthrows all the confidence which
men may be disposed to place in the merit of their works. It may be objected,
that this commendation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
keeping of thy commandments there is great
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is in vain ascribed to the law,
seeing it is without effect. The answer is easy, namely, that as in the covenant
of adoption there is included the free pardon of sins, upon which depends the
imputation of righteousness, God bestows a recompense upon the works of his
people, although, in point of justice, it is not due to them. What God promises
in the law to those who perfectly obey it, true believers obtain by his gracious
liberality and fatherly goodness, inasmuch as he accepts for perfect
righteousness their holy desires and earnest endeavors to
obey.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

use we should make of the promises of the law, which have a condition annexed to
them. It is this: As soon as they come forth, every man should examine his own
life, and compare not only his actions, but also his thoughts, with that perfect
rule of righteousness which is laid down in the law. Thus it will come to pass,
that all, from the least to the greatest, seeing themselves cut off from all
hope of reward from the law, will be constrained to flee for refuge to the mercy
of God. It is not enough to consider what the doctrine of the law contains; we
must also look into ourselves, that we may see how far short we have come in our
obedience to the law. Whenever the Papists hear this promise,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">they do not hesitate at once to connect eternal life
with the merit of their works, as if it were in their own power to fulfill the
law, of which we are all transgressors, not only in one point, but in all its
parts. David, therefore, being involved as it were in a labyrinth on all sides,
acknowledges with astonishment that he is overwhelmed under a sense of the
multitude of his sins. We ought then to remember, in the first place, that as we
are personally destitute of the righteousness which the law requires, we are on
that account excluded from the hope of the reward which the law has promised;
and, in the next place, that we are guilty before God, not of one fault or of
two, but of sins innumerable, so that we ought, with the bitterest sorrow, to
bewail our depravity, which not only deprives us of the blessing of God, but
also turns to us life into death. This David did. There is no doubt that when,
after having said that God liberally offers a reward to all who observe his law,
he cried out, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who can understand
his errors? it</i></font><font face="Palatino"> was from the terror with which
he was stricken in thinking upon his sins. By the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twayg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shegioth, </i>which we have translated <i>errors, </i>some think David
intends lesser faults; but in my judgment he meant simply to say, that Satan has
so many devices by which he deludes and blinds our minds, that there is not a
man who knows the hundredth part of his own sins. The saints, it is true, often
offend in lesser matters, through ignorance and inadvertence; but it happens
also that, being entangled in the snares of Satan, they do not perceive even the
grosser faults which they have committed. Accordingly, all the sins to the
commission of which men give themselves loose reins, not being duly sensible of
the evil which is in them, and being deceived by the allurements of the flesh,
are justly included under the Hebrew word here used by David, which signifies
<i>faults </i>or <i>ignorances.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa430</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In summoning himself and others
before the judgment-seat of God, he warns himself and them, that although their
consciences do not condemn them, they are not on that account absolved; for God
sees far more clearly than men's consciences, since even those who look most
attentively into themselves, do not perceive a great part of the sins with which
they are chargeable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After making this
confession, David adds a prayer for pardon,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cleanse thou me from my secret
sins.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word <i>cleanse </i>is to be
referred not to the blessing of regeneration, but to free forgiveness; for the
Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nakah, </i>here used, comes from a word which signifies <i>to</i> <i>be
innocent. </i>The Psalmist explains more clearly what he intended by the word
<i>errors, </i>in now calling them <i>secret sins; </i>that is to say, those
with respect to which men deceive themselves, by thinking that they are no sins,
and who thus deceive themselves not only purposely and by expressly aiming at
doing so, but because they do not enter into the due consideration of the
majesty of the judgment of God. It is in vain to attempt to justify ourselves
under the pretext and excuse of ignorance. Nor does it avail any thing to be
blind as to our faults, since no man is a competent judge in his own cause. We
must, therefore, never account ourselves to be pure and innocent until we are
pronounced such by God's sentence of absolution or acquittal. The faults which
we do not perceive must necessarily come under the review of God's judgment, and
entail upon us condemnation, unless he blot them out and pardon them; and if so,
how shall he escape and remain unpunished who, besides these, is chargeable with
sins of which he knows himself to be guilty, and on account of which his own
conscience compels him to judge and condemn himself? Farther, we should remember
that we are not guilty of one offense only, but are overwhelmed with an immense
mass of impurities. The more diligently any one examines himself, the more
readily will he acknowledge with David, that if God should discover our secret
faults, there would be found in us an abyss of sins so great as to have neither
bottom nor shore, as we say;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa431</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for no man can comprehend in how many
ways he is guilty before God. From this also it appears, that the Papists are
bewitched, and chargeable with the grossest hypocrisy, when they pretend that
they can easily and speedily gather all their sins once a year into a bundle.
The decree of the Lateran Council commands every one to confess all his sins
once every year, and at the same time declares that there is no hope of pardon
but in complying with that decree. Accordingly, the blinded Papist, by going to
the confessional, to mutter his sins into the ear of the priest, thinks he has
done all that is required, as if he could count upon his fingers all the sins
which he has committed during the course of the whole year; whereas, even the
saints, by strictly examining themselves, can scarcely come to the knowledge of
the hundredth part of their sins, and, therefore, with one voice unite with
David in saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who can
understand his errors?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Nor will it do to
allege that it is enough if each performs the duty of reckoning up his sins to
the utmost of his ability. This does not diminish, in any degree, the absurdity
of this famous decree.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa432</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As it is impossible for us to do what
the law requires, all whose hearts are really and deeply imbued with the
principle of the fear of God must necessarily be overwhelmed with despair, so
long as they think themselves bound to enumerate all their sins, in order to
their being pardoned; and those who imagine they can disburden themselves of
their sins in this way must be persons altogether stupid. I know that some
explain these words in a different sense, viewing them as a prayer, in which
David beseeches God, by the guidance of his Holy Spirit, to recover him from all
his errors. But, in my opinion, they are to be viewed rather as a prayer for
forgiveness, and what follows in the next verse is a prayer for the aid of the
Holy Spirit, and for success to overcome
temptations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep back thy servant also
from presumptuous sins.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By
<i>presumptuous sins </i>he means known and evident
transgressions,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa433</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> accompanied with proud contempt and
obstinacy. By the word <i>keep back, </i>he intimates, that such is the natural
propensity of the flesh to sin, that even the saints themselves would
immediately break forth or rush headlong into it, did not God, by his own
guardianship and protection, keep them back. It is to be observed, that while he
calls himself <i>the servant of God, </i>he nevertheless acknowledges that he
had need of the bridle, lest he should arrogantly and rebelliously break forth
in transgressing the law of God. Being regenerated by the Spirit of God, he
groaned, it is true, under the burden of his sins; but he knew, on the other
hand, how great is the rebellion of the flesh, and how much we are inclined to
forgetfulness of God, from which proceed contempt of his majesty and all
impiety. Now, if David, who had made so much progress in the fear of God, was
not beyond the danger of transgressing, how shall the carnal and unrenewed man,
in whom innumerable lusts exercise dominion, be able to restrain and govern
himself by his own free will? Let us learn, then, even although the unruliness
of our wayward flesh has been already subdued by the denial of ourselves, to
walk in fear and trembling; for unless God restrain us, our hearts will
violently boil with a proud and insolent contempt of God. This sense is
confirmed by the reason added immediately after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may not have dominion
over me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he expressly
declares, that unless God assist him, he will not only be unable to resist, but
will be wholly brought under the dominion of the worst vices. This passage,
therefore, teaches us not only that all mankind are naturally enslaved to sin,
but that the faithful themselves would become the bond-slaves of sin also, if
God did not unceasingly watch over them to guide them in the path of holiness,
and to strengthen them for persevering in it. There is also another useful
lesson which we have here to attend to, namely, that we ought never to pray for
pardon, without, at the same time, asking to be strengthened and fortified by
the power of God for the time to come, that temptations, in future, may not gain
advantage over us. And although we may feel in our hearts the incitements of
concupiscence goading and distressing us, we ought not, on that account, to
become discouraged. The remedy to which we should have recourse is to pray to
God to restrain us. No doubt, David could have wished to feel in his heart no
stirrings of corruption; but knowing that he would never be wholly free from the
remains of sin, until at death he had put off this corrupt nature, he prays to
be armed with the grace of the Holy Spirit for the combat, that iniquity might
not reign victorious over him. In the end of the verse there are two things to
be observed. David, in affirming that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall then be upright and
clean from much wickedness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>attributes,
in the first place, the honor of preserving him innocent to the spiritual
assistance of God; and depending upon it, he confidently assures himself of
victory over all the armies of Satan. In the second place, he acknowledges, that
unless he is assisted by God, he will be overwhelmed with an immense load, and
plunged as it were into a boundless abyss of wickedness:for he says, that aided
by God, he will be clear not of one fault or of two, but of many. From this it
follows, that as soon as we are abandoned by the grace of God, there is no kind
of sin in which Satan may not entangle us. Let this confession of David then
quicken us to earnestness in prayer; for in the midst of so many and various
snares, it does not become us to fall asleep or to be indolent. Again, let the
other part of the Psalmist's exercise predominate in our hearts &#8212; let us
boast with him, that although Satan may assault us by many and strong armies, we
will nevertheless be invincible, provided we have the aid of God, and will
continue, in despite of every hostile attempt, to hold fast our
integrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the words of my mouth,
and the meditation of my heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David
asks still more expressly to be fortified by the grace of God, and thus enabled
to live an upright and holy life. The substance of the verse is this:I beseech
thee, O God, not only to keep me from breaking forth into the external acts of
transgression, but also to frame my tongue and my heart to the obedience of thy
law. We know how difficult it is, even for the most perfect, so to bridle their
words and thoughts, as that nothing may pass through their heart or mouth which
is contrary to the will of God; and yet this inward purity is what the law
chiefly requires of us. Now, the rarer this virtue &#8212; the rarer this strict
control of the heart and of the tongue is, let us learn so much the more the
necessity of our being governed by the Holy Spirit, in order to regulate our
life uprightly and honestly. By the word <i>acceptable, </i>the Psalmist shows
that the only rule of living well is for men to endeavor to please God, and to
be approved of him. The concluding words, in which he calls God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his strength and his
redeemer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he employs to confirm himself
in the assured confidence of obtaining his requests.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
20.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm contains a common prayer of the Church in
behalf of the King of Israel, that God would succor him in danger; and in behalf
of his kingdom, that God would maintain it in safety, and cause it to
prosper:for in the person of David the safety and well-being of the whole
community centred. To this there is added a promise, that God will preside over
that kingdom of which he was the founder, and so effectually watch over it as to
secure its continual preservation.</font><br></div>

20:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> May Jehovah hear thee in
the day of trouble! may the name of the God of Jacob defend thee! <b>2.</b> May
he send thee help from his sanctuary, and sustain thee out of
Sion!	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">The inscription shows that the psalm
was composed by David; but though he was its author, there is no absurdity in
his speaking of himself in the person of others. The office of a prophet having
been committed to him, he with great propriety prepared this as a form of prayer
for the use of the faithful. In doing this, his object was not so much to
commend his own person, by authoritatively issuing a royal ordinance enjoining
upon the people the use of this prayer, as to show, in the exercise of his
office as a teacher, that it belonged to the whole Church to concern itself, and
to use its endeavors that the kingdom which God had erected might continue safe
and prosperous. Many interpreters view this prayer as offered up only on one
particular occasion; but in this I cannot agree. The occasion of its composition
at first may have arisen from some particular battle which was about to be
fought, either against the Ammonites, or against some other enemies of Israel.
But the design of the Holy Spirit, in my judgment, was to deliver to the Church
a common form of prayer, which, as we may gather from the words, was to be used
whenever she was threatened with any danger. God commands his people, in
general, to pray for kings, but there was a special reason, and one which did
not apply to any other kingdom, why prayer was to be made in behalf of this
kingdom; for it was only by the hand of David and his seed that God had
determined to govern and maintain his people. It is particularly to be noticed,
that under the figure of this temporal kingdom, there was described a government
far more excellent, on which the whole joy and felicity of the Church depended.
The object, therefore, which David had expressly in view was, to exhort all the
children of God to cherish such a holy solicitude about the kingdom of Christ,
as would stir them up to continual prayer in its
behalf.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May Jehovah hear thee,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Holy Spirit, by introducing the
people as praying that God would answer the prayers of the king, is to be viewed
as at the same time admonishing kings that it is their duty to implore the
protection of God in all their affairs. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the day of
trouble,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he shows that they will not be
exempted from troubles, and he does this that they may not become discouraged,
if at any time they should happen to be in circumstances of danger. In short,
the faithful, that the body may not be separated from the head, further the
king's prayers by their common and united supplications.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The name of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is here put for <i>God himself
</i>and not without good reason; for the essence of God being incomprehensible
to us, it behoves us to trust in him, in so far as his grace and power are made
known to us. From his name, therefore, proceeds confidence in calling upon him.
The faithful desire that the king may be protected and aided by God, whose name
was called upon among <i>the sons of Jacob. </i>I cannot agree with those who
think that mention is here made of that patriarch, because God exercised him
with various afflictions, not unlike those with which he tried his servant
David. I am rather of opinion that, as is usual in Scripture, the chosen people
are denoted by the term <i>Jacob. </i>And from this name, <i>the God of Jacob,
</i>the faithful encourage themselves to pray for the defense of their king;
because it was one of the privileges of their adoption to live under the conduct
and protection of a king set over them by God himself. Hence we may conclude, as
I have said before, that under the figure of a temporal kingdom there is
described to us a government much more
excellent.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa434</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Since Christ our King, being an
everlasting priest, never ceases to make intercession with God, the whole body
of the Church should unite in prayer with
him;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa435</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and farther, we can have no hope of
being heard except he go before us, and conduct us to
God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa436</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And it serves in no small degree to
assuage our sorrows to consider that Jesus Christ, when we are afflicted,
accounts our distresses his own, provided we, at the same time, take courage,
and continue resolute and magnanimous in tribulation; which we should be
prepared to do, since the Holy Spirit here forewarns us that the kingdom of
Christ would be subject to dangers and
troubles.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May he send thee
help.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That is to say, may he succor thee
out of mount Sion, where he commanded the ark of the covenant to be placed, and
chose for himself a dwelling-place. The weakness of the flesh will not suffer
men to soar up to heaven, and, therefore, God comes down to meet them, and by
the external means of grace shows that he is near them. Thus the ark of the
covenant was to his ancient people a pledge of his presence, and the sanctuary
an image of heaven. But as God, by appointing mount Sion to be the place where
the faithful should continually worship him, had joined the kingdom and
priesthood together, David, in putting into the lips of the people a prayer for
help out of Sion, doubtless had an eye to this sacred bond of union. Hence I
conjecture that this psalm was composed by David in his old age, and about the
close of his life. Some think he spake of Sion by the Spirit of prophecy before
it had been appointed that the ark should be placed there; but this opinion
seems strained, and to have little
probability.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May he
remember.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I understand the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remember</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as meaning <i>to have regard to, </i>as it is to be understood in many other
places; just as <i>to forget </i>often signifies <i>to neglect, </i>or <i>not to
deign to regard, nor even to behold, </i>the object to which it is applied. It
is, in short, a prayer that God would actually show that the king's sacrifices
were acceptable to him. Two kinds of them are here mentioned; <i>first, </i>the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjnm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
mincha, </i>mentioned in the first clause of the verse, which was the appointed
accompaniment of all sacrifices, and which was also sometimes offered by itself;
and, secondly, the holocaust, or whole burnt-sacrifice. But under these two
kinds David intended to comprehend, by synecdoche, all sacrifices; and under
sacrifices he comprehends requests and prayers. We know that whenever the
fathers prayed under the law, their hope of obtaining what they asked was
founded upon their sacrifices; and, in like manner, at this day our prayers are
acceptable to God only in so far as Christ sprinkles and sanctifies them with
the perfume of his own sacrifice. The faithful, therefore, here desire that the
solemn prayers of the king, which were accompanied with sacrifices and
oblations, might have their effect in the prosperous issue of his affairs. That
this is the meaning may be gathered still more clearly from the following verse,
in which they commend to God the desires and counsels of the king. But as it
would be absurd to ask God to grant foolish and wicked desires, it is to be
regarded as certain, that there is here described a king who was neither given
to ambition, nor inflamed with avarice, nor actuated by the desire of whatever
the unruly passions might <i>suggest, </i>but wholly intent on the charge which
was committed to him, and entirely devoted to the advancement of the public
good; so that he asks nothing but what the Holy Spirit dictated to him, and what
God, by his own mouth, commanded him to
ask.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may rejoice in thy
salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse may be explained
in two other ways, besides the sense it bears according to the translation which
I have given. Some consider it to be a prayer, as if it had been said, Lord,
make us to rejoice. Others think that the faithful, after having finished their
prayer, encourage themselves to entertain good
hope;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa438</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or rather, being already inspired with
an assured hope of success, they begin to sing, so to speak, of the victory,
even as it is usual with David to intermingle such kind of rejoicings with his
prayers, thereby to stir up himself to continue with the more alacrity in
prayer. But upon considering the whole more carefully, my opinion is, that what
is meant to be expressed is the effect or fruit which would result from the
bestowment of the grace and favor of God, for which the people prayed; and,
therefore, I have thought it necessary to supply the particle <i>that, </i>in
the beginning of the verse. The faithful, as an argument to obtain the favor of
God towards their king, set forth the joy which they would all experience in
common, in seeing it exercised towards him, and the thanksgiving which they
would with one accord render for it. The import of their language is, It is not
for the preservation and welfare of one man that we are solicitous; it is for
the safety and well-being of the whole Church. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thy
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be referred to God as
well as to the king; for the salvation which God bestows is often called <i>the
salvation of God; </i>but the context requires that it should be rather
understood of the king. The people lived "under the shadow of the king," to use
the words of Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:20;) and, therefore, the faithful now testify, that as long as he is safe and
in prosperity, they will all be joyful and happy. At the same time, to
distinguish their joy from the heathen dancings and rejoicings, they declare
that they will set up their banners in the name of God; for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lgd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>dagal, </i>here used, means <i>to set </i>or <i>lift up a banner. </i>The
meaning is, that the faithful, in grateful acknowledgement of the grace of God,
will celebrate his praises and triumph in his
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
20:6-9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> Now I know that Jehovah

him.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now I
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here there follows grateful
rejoicing, in which the faithful declare that they have experienced the goodness
of God in the preservation of the king. To this there is at the same time added
a doctrine of faith, namely, that God showed by the effect that he put forth his
power in maintaining the kingdom of David, because it was founded upon his
calling. The meaning is, It appears from certain experience, that God is the
guardian of the kingdom which he himself set up, and of which he is the founder.
For David is called Messiah, or <i>anointed, </i>that the faithful might be
persuaded that he was a lawful and sacred king, whom God had testified, by
outward anointing, to be chosen by himself. Thus, then, the faithful ascribe to
the grace of God the deliverance which had been wrought for David from the
greatest dangers, and at the same time, particularly mention the cause of this
to be, that God had determined to protect and defend him who, by his
commandment, had been anointed king over his people. They confirm still more
clearly their hope, with respect to the future, in the following
clause:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will hear him out of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I do not translate the verb
which is here used into the past tense, but retain the future:for I have no
doubt, that from the experience which God had already given them of his
goodness, they concluded that it would be hereafter exercised in the continual
preservation of the kingdom. Here the Psalmist makes mention of another
<i>sanctuary,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa441</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>namely, a heavenly. As God then
graciously vouchsafed to descend among the Israelites, by the ark of the
covenant, in order to make himself more familiarly known to them; so, on the
other hand, he intended to draw the minds of his people upwards to himself, and
thereby to prevent them from forming carnal and earthly conceptions of his
character, and to teach them that he was greater than the whole world. Thus,
under the visible sanctuary, which was made with hands, there is set forth the
fatherly goodness of God, and his familiarity with his people; while, under the
heavenly sanctuary, there is shown his infinite power, dominion, and majesty.
The words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the mightiness of
the salvation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>mean <i>his mighty
salvation, </i>or <i>his saving power. </i>Thus, in the very expression there is
a transposing of the words. The sense comes to this: May God by his wonderful
power, preserve the king who was anointed by his commandment! The Holy Spirit,
who dictated this prayer, saw well that Satan would not suffer David to live in
peace, but would put forth all his efforts to oppose him, which would render it
necessary for him to be sustained by more than human power. I do not, however,
disapprove of the other exposition which I have marked on the margin, according
to which the faithful, for their greater encouragement, set before themselves
this truth, that the salvation of God's right hand is in mightiness; in other
words, is sufficiently strong to overcome all
impediments.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some trust in
chariots.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not restrict this to the
enemies of Israel, as is done by other interpreters. I am rather inclined to
think that there is here a comparison between the people of God and all the rest
of the world. We see how natural it is to almost all men to be the more
courageous and confident the more they possess of riches, power and military
forces. The people of God, therefore, here protest that they do not place their
hope, as is the usual way with men, in their military forces and warlike
apparatus, but only in the aid of God. As the Holy Spirit here sets the
assistance of God in opposition to human strength, it ought to be particularly
noticed, that whenever our minds come to be occupied by carnal confidence, they
fall at the same time into a forgetfulness of God. It is impossible for him, who
promises himself victory by confiding in his own strength, to have his eyes
turned towards God. The inspired writer, therefore, uses the word <i>remember,
</i>to show, that when the saints betake themselves to God, they must cast off
every thing which would hinder them from placing an exclusive trust in him. This
remembrance of God serves two important purposes to the faithful. In the first
place, however much power and resources they may possess, it nevertheless
withdraws them from all vain confidence, so that they do not expect any success
except from the pure grace of God. In the second place, if they are bereft and
utterly destitute of all succor, it notwithstanding so strengthens and
encourages them, that they call upon God both with confidence and constancy. On
the other hand, when ungodly men feel themselves strong and powerful, being
blinded with pride, they do not hesitate boldly to despise God; but when they
are brought into circumstances of distress, they are so terrified as not to know
what to become. In short, the Holy Spirit here recommends to us the remembrance
of God, which, retaining its efficacy both in the want and in the abundance of
power, subdues the vain hopes with which the flesh is wont to be inflated. As
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rykzn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nazkir, </i>which I have translated <i>we will remember, </i>is in the
conjugation <i>hiphil, </i>some render it transitively, <i>we shall cause to
remember. </i>But it is no new thing in Hebrew for verbs to be used as neuter
which are properly transitive; and, therefore, I have adopted the exposition
which seems to me the most suitable to this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are bowed
down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that there is here
pointed out, as it were with the finger, the enemies of Israel, whom God had
overthrown, when they regarded no event as less likely to happen. There is
contained in the words a tacit contrast between the cruel pride with which they
had been lifted up for a time when they audaciously rushed forward to make havoc
of all things on the one hand, and the oppression of the people of God on the
other. The expression, <i>to rise, </i>is applied only to those who were before
sunk or fallen; and, on the other hand, the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowed down and
fallen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is with propriety applied to
those who were lifted up with pride and presumption. The prophet therefore
teaches by the event, how much more advantageous it is for us to place all our
confidence in God than to depend upon our own
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Save, O Jehovah!

Jehovah! save the king;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa442</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>perhaps because they think it
wrong to attribute to an earthly king what is proper to God only, &#8212; to be
called upon, and to hear prayer. But if we turn our eyes towards Christ, as it
becomes us to do, we will no longer wonder that what properly belongs to him is
attributed in a certain sense to David and his successors, in so far as they
were types of Christ. As God governs and saves us by the hand of Christ, we must
not look for salvation from any other quarter. In like manner, the faithful
under the former economy were accustomed to betake themselves to their king as
the minister of God's saving grace. Hence these words of
Jeremiah,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The<i> </i>breath of our
nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall
live among the heathen."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Lamentations
4:20)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Whenever, therefore, God promises the
restoration of his church, he sets forth a symbol or pledge of its salvation in
the kingdom. We now see that it is not without very good reason that the
faithful are introduced asking succor from their king, under whose guardianship
and protection they were placed, and who, as the vicegerent of God, presided
over them; as the Prophet Micah says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
2:13,) "Their king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them;" by
which words he intimates, that their king will be as it were a mirror in which
they may see reflected the image of God. To return to the present
passage:&#8212; The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Save, O
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is elliptical, but it has
greater emphasis than if the object for which salvation is sought had been
mentioned; for by this means David shows that this salvation belongs in common
to the whole body of the church. In
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:25, there is a prayer in the same words, and it is certain that it is the
very same prayer. In short, this is a prayer, that God, by blessing the king,
would show himself the Savior of the whole people. In the last clause of the
verse there is expressed the means of this salvation. The people pray that the
king may be furnished with power from God to deliver them whenever they are in
distress, and cry to him for help.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the king hear us in the day
that we call upon him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God had not
promised that his people would be saved in any other way than by the hand and
conduct of the king whom he had given them. In the present day, when Christ is
now manifested to us, let us learn to yield him this honor &#8212; to renounce
all hope of salvation from any other quarter, and to trust to that salvation
only which he shall bring to us from God his Father. And of this we shall then
only become partakers when, being all gathered together into one body, under the
same Head, we shall have mutual care one of another, and when none of us will
have his attention so engrossed with his own advantage and individual interest,
as to be indifferent to the welfare and happiness of others.</font><br></div>

faithful. In the beginning of the psalm the believing Israelites express their
firm persuasion that God, who had created David to be king, had undertaken to
defend and maintain him. It therefore appears that this psalm, as well as the
preceding, was composed for the purpose of assuring the faithful that the
goodness of God in this respect towards David would be of long duration, and
permanent; and it was necessary, in order to their being established in a
well-grounded confidence of their safety; to hope well of their king, whose
countenance was as it were a mirror of the merciful and reconciled countenance
of God. The sense of the words is:Lord, in putting forth thy power to sustain
and protect the king, thou wilt preserve him safe; and, ascribing his safety to
thy power, he will greatly rejoice in thee. The Psalmist has doubtless put
<i>strength </i>and <i>salvation </i>for <i>strong and powerful succor;
</i>intimating, that the power of God in defending the king would be such as
would preserve and protect him against all
dangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second verse there is pointed
out the cause of this joy. The cause was this:that God had heard the prayers of
the king, and had liberally granted him whatever he desired. It was important to
be known, and that the faithful should have it deeply impressed on their minds,
that all David's successes were so many benefits conferred upon him by God, and
at the same time testimonies of his lawful calling. And David, there is no
doubt, in speaking thus, testifies that he did not give loose reins to the
desires of the flesh, and follow the mere impulse of his appetites like worldly
men, who set their minds at one time upon this thing, and at another time upon
that, without any consideration, and just as they are led by their sensual
lusts; but that he had so bridled his affections as to desire nothing save what
was good and lawful. According to the infirmity which is natural to men, he was,
it is true, chargeable with some vices, and even fell shamefully on two
occasions; but the habitual administration of his kingdom was such that it was
easy to see that the Holy Spirit presided over it. But as by the Spirit of
prophecy the Psalmist had principally an eye to Christ, who does not reign for
his own advantage, but for ours, and whose desire is directed only to our
salvation, we may gather hence the very profitable doctrine, that we need
entertain no apprehension that God will reject our prayers in behalf of the
church, since our heavenly King has gone before us in making intercession for
her, so that in praying for her we are only endeavoring to follow his
example.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou wilt prevent
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The change of the tense in the
verbs does not break the connection of the discourse; and, therefore, I have,
without hesitation, translated this sentence into the future tense, as we know
that the changing of one tense into another is quite common in Hebrew. Those who
limit this psalm to the last victory which David gained over foreign nations,
and who suppose that the crown of which mention is here made was the crown of
the king of the Ammonites, of which we have an account in sacred history, give,
in my judgment, too low a view of what the Holy Spirit has here dictated
concerning the perpetual prosperity of this kingdom. David, I have no doubt,
comprehended his successors even to Christ, and intended to celebrate the
continual course of the grace of God in maintaining his kingdom through
successive ages. It was not of one man that it had been said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will be his father,

son,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Samuel 7:14;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but this was a prophecy which ought to be extended
from Solomon to Christ, as is fully established by the testimony of Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:6,) who informs us that it was fulfilled when the Son was given or manifested.
When it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt
prevent him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the meaning is, that such
will be the liberality and promptitude of God, in spontaneously bestowing
blessings, that he will not only grant what is asked from him, but, anticipating
the requests of the king, will load him with every kind of good things far
beyond what he had ever expected. By <i>blessings </i>we are to understand
abundance or plenteousness. Some translate the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tob, goodness;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa445</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but with this I cannot agree. It
is to be taken rather for <i>the beneficence </i>or<i> the free gifts of God.
</i>Thus the meaning will be, The king shall want nothing which is requisite to
make his life in every respect happy, since God of his own good pleasure will
anticipate his wishes, and enrich him with an abundance of all good things. The
Psalmist makes express mention of <i>the crown, </i>because it was the emblem
and ensign of royalty; and he intimates by this that God would be the guardian
of the king, whom he himself had created. But as the prophet testifies, that the
royal diadem, after lying long dishonored in the dust, shall again be put upon
the head of Christ, we come to the conclusion, that by this song the minds of
the godly were elevated to the hope of the eternal kingdom, of which a shadow
only, or an obscure image, was set forth in the person of the successors of
David. The doctrine of the everlasting duration of the kingdom of Christ is,
therefore, here established, seeing he was not placed upon the throne by the
favor or suffrages of men, but by God, who, from heaven, set the royal crown
upon his head with his own
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He asked life from
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse confirms what I have
formerly said, that this psalm is not to be limited to the person of any one
man. David's life, it is true, was prolonged to an advanced period, so that,
when he departed from this world, he was an old man, and full of days; but the
course of his life was too short to be compared to this <i>length of days,
</i>which is said to consist of many ages. Even if we reckon the time from the
commencement of David's reign to the captivity of Babylon, this length of days
will not be made up and completed in all David's successors. David, therefore,
without doubt, comprehends the Eternal King. There is here a tacit comparison
between the beginnings of this kingdom, which were obscure and contemptible, or
rather which were fraught with the most grievous perils, and which bordered on
despair; and the incredible glory which followed, when God, exempting it from
the common lot of other kingdoms, elevated it almost above the heavens. For it
is no ordinary commendation of this kingdom, when it is said, that it shall
endure as long as the sun and moon shall shine in the heavens,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
72:1.) David, therefore, in saying that <i>he asked life, </i>tacitly points to
the distressed circumstances to which he had often been reduced; and the meaning
is, Lord, since the time thou hast called thy servant to the hope of the kingdom
by thy holy anointing, his condition has been such that he has accounted it a
singular blessing to be rescued from the jaws of death; but now, he has not
only, by thy grace, escaped in safety the dangers which threatened his life:thou
hast also promised that his kingdom will be continued for many ages in his
successors. And it serves not a little to magnify the grace of God, that he
vouchsafed to confer on a poor and miserable man, who was almost at the point of
death, not only his life, - when, amidst the dangers which threatened it, he
tremblingly asked merely its preservations &#8212; but also the inestimable
honor of elevating him to the royal dignity, and of transmitting the kingdom to
his posterity for ever. Some expound the verse thus:&#8212; Thou hast given him
the life which he asked, even to the prolonging of his days for ever and ever.
But this seems to me a cold and strained interpretation. We must keep in view
the contrast which, as I have said, is here made between the weak and
contemptible beginnings of the kingdom, and the unexpected honor which God
conferred upon his servant, in calling the moon to witness that his seed should
never fail. The same has been exemplified in Christ, who, from contempt,
ignominy, death, the grave, and despair, was raised up by his Father to the
sovereignty of heaven, to sit at the Father's right hand for ever, and at length
to be the judge of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His glory is
great.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words the people
intimate that their king, through the protection which God afforded him, and the
deliverances which he wrought for him, would become more renowned than if he had
reigned in peace with the applause of all men, or had been defended by human
wealth and human strength, or, finally, had continued invincible by his own
power and policy; for thereby it appeared the more clearly that he had only
attained to the royal dignity by the favor, conduct, and commandment of God. The
believing Israelites, therefore, leave it to heathen kings to ennoble themselves
by their own achievements, and to acquire fame by their own valor; and they set
more value upon this, that God graciously showed himself favorable towards their
king,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa447</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> than upon all the triumphs of the
world. At the same time, they promise themselves such assistance from God as
will suffice for adorning the king with majesty and
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast set him to be
blessings for ever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain these
words simply thus, That God had chosen David to be king, in order to pour upon
him his blessings in rich abundance. But it is evident that something more is
intended by this manner of speaking. It implies, that the king had such an
exuberant abundance of all good things, that he might justly be regarded as a
pattern of the greatness of the divine beneficence; or that, in praying, his
name would be generally used to serve as an example of how the suppliant wished
to be dealt with. The Jews were accustomed to speak of those being set to be a
curse, who were rendered so detestable, and on whom the dreadful vengeance of
God had been inflicted with such severity, that their very names served for
cursing and direful imprecations. On the other hand, they were accustomed to
speak of those being set to be a blessing, whose names we propose in our prayers
as an example of how we desire to be blessed; as if a man for instance should
say, May God graciously bestow upon thee the same favor which he vouchsafed to
his servant David! I do not reject this interpretation, but I am satisfied with
the other, which views the words as implying that the king, abounding in all
kind of good things, was an illustrious pattern of the liberality of God. We
must carefully mark what is said immediately after concerning
joy:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast gladdened him with
joy before thy
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa448</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The people not only mean that
God did good to the king, seeing he looked upon him with a benignant and
fatherly eye, but they also point out the proper cause of this joy, telling us
that it proceeded from the knowledge which the king had of his being the object
of the Divine favor. It would not be enough for God to take care of us, and to
provide for our necessities, unless, on the other hand, he irradiated us with
the light of his gracious and reconciled countenance, and made us to taste of
his goodness, as we have seen in the 4th Psalm, "There be many that say, Who
will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,
and we shall be saved." And without all doubt, it is true and solid happiness to
experience that God is so favorable to us that we dwell as it were in his
presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

Israelites glory that their king shall be established, because he relies upon
God; and they express at the same time how he relies upon him, namely, by hope
or trust. I read the whole verse as one sentence, so that there is but one
principal verb, and explain it thus:- The king, as he places by faith his
dependence on God and his goodness, will not be subject to the disasters which
overthrow the kingdoms of this world. Moreover, as we have said before, that
whatever blessings the faithful attribute to their king, belong to the whole
body of the Church, there is here made a promise, common to all the people of
God, which may serve to keep us tranquil amidst the various storms which agitate
the world. The world turns round as it were upon a wheel, by which it comes to
pass, that those who were raised to the very top are precipitated to the bottom
in a moment; but it is here promised, that the kingdom of Judah, and the kingdom
of Christ of which it was a type, will be exempted from such vicissitude. Let us
remember, that those only have the firmness and stability here promised, who
betake themselves to the bosom of God by an assured faith, and relying upon his
mercy, commit themselves to his protection. The cause or the ground of this hope
or trust is at the same time expressed, and it is this, that God mercifully
cherishes his own people, whom he has once graciously received into his
favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thy hand shall find.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hitherto the
internal happiness of the kingdom has been described. Now there follows, as it
was necessary there should, the celebration of its invincible strength against
its enemies. What is said in this verse is of the same import as if the king had
been pronounced victorious over all his enemies. I have just now remarked, that
such a statement is not superfluous; for it would not have been enough for the
kingdom to have flourished internally, and to have been replenished with peace,
riches, and abundance of all good things, had it not also been well fortified
against the attacks of foreign enemies. This particularly applies to the kingdom
of Christ, which is never without enemies in this world. True, it is not always
assailed by open war, and there is sometimes granted to it a period of respite;
but the ministers of Satan never lay aside their malice and desire to do
mischief, and therefore they never cease to plot and to endeavor to accomplish
the overthrow of Christ's kingdom. It is well for us that our King, who lifts up
his hand as a shield before us to defend us, is stronger than all. As the Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">axm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>matsa, </i>which is twice repeated, and which we have translated, <i>to find,
</i>sometimes signifies <i>to suffice; </i>and, as in the first clause, there is
prefixed to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kal, </i>which signifies <i>all, </i>the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>which signifies <i>for, </i>or <i>against, </i>and which is not
prefixed to the Hebrew word which is rendered <i>those that hate thee; </i>some
expositors, because of this diversity, explain the verse as if it had been said,
Thy hand shall be able for all thine enemies, thy right hand shall find out
those that hate thee. Thus the sentence will ascend by degrees, &#8212; Thy hand
shall be able to withstand, thy right hand shall lay hold upon thy enemies, so
that they shall not escape
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt put them as it
were into a furnace of fire.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa450</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here describes a
dreadful kind of vengeance, from which we gather, that he does not speak of
every kind of enemies in general, but of the malicious and frantic despisers of
God, who, after the manner of the
giants</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa451</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of old, rise up against his only
begotten Son. The very severity of the punishment shows the greatness of the
wickedness. Some think that David alludes to the kind of punishment which he
inflicted upon the Ammonites, of which we have an account in the sacred history;
but it is more probable that he here sets forth metaphorically the dreadful
destruction which awaits all the adversaries of Christ. They may burn with rage
against the Church, and set the world on fire by their cruelty, but when their
wickedness shall have reached its highest pitch, there is this reward which God
has in reserve for them, that he will cast them into his burning furnace to
consume them. In the first clause, the king is called an avenger; in the second,
this office is transferred to God; and in the third, the execution of the
vengeance is attributed to fire; which three things very well agree. We know
that judgment has been committed to Christ, that he may cast his enemies
headlong into everlasting fire; but, it was of importance distinctly to express
that this is not the judgment of man but of God. Nor was it less important to
set forth how extreme and dreadful a kind of vengeance this is, in order to
arouse from their torpor those who, unapprehensive of danger, boldly despise all
the threatenings of God. Besides, this serves not a little for the consolation
of the righteous. We know how dreadful the cruelty of the ungodly is, and that
our faith would soon sink under it, if it did not rise to the contemplation of
the judgment of God. The expression, <i>In the time of thy wrath, </i>admonishes
us that we ought patiently to bear the cross as long as it shall please the Lord
to exercise and humble us under it. If, therefore, he does not immediately put
forth his power to destroy the ungodly, let us learn to extend our hope to the
time which our heavenly Father has appointed in his eternal purpose for the
execution of his judgment, and when our King, armed with his terrible power,
will come forth to execute vengeance. While he now seems to take no notice, this
does not imply that he has forgotten either himself or us. On the contrary, he
laughs at the madness of those who go on in the commission of every kind of sin
without any fear of danger, and become more presumptuous day after day. This
laughter of God, it is true, brings little comfort to us; but we must,
nevertheless, complete the time of our condition of warfare till "the day of the
Lord's vengeance" come, which, as Isaiah declares,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
34:87) shall also be "the<i> </i>year of our redemption." It does not seem to me
to be out of place to suppose, that in the last clause, there is denounced
against the enemies of Christ a destruction like that which God in old time sent
upon Sodom and Gomorrah. That punishment was a striking and memorable example
above all others of the judgment of God against all the wicked, or rather it
was, as it were, a visible image upon earth of the eternal fire of hell which is
prepared for the reprobate:and hence this similitude is frequently to be met
with in the sacred writings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt destroy their fruit
from the earth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">David amplifies the greatness
of God's wrath, from the circumstance that it shall extend even to the children
of the wicked. It is a doctrine common enough in Scripture, that God not only
inflicts punishment upon the first originators of wickedness, but makes it even
to overflow into the bosom of their
children.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa452</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet when he thus pursues his
vengeance to the third and fourth generation, he cannot be said indiscriminately
to involve the innocent with the guilty. As the seed of the ungodly, whom he has
deprived of his grace, are accursed, and as all are by nature children of wrath,
devoted to everlasting destruction, he is no less just in exercising his
severity towards the children than towards the fathers. Who can lay any thing to
his charge, if he withhold from those who are unworthy of it the grace which he
communicates to his own children? In both ways he shows how dear and precious to
him is the kingdom of Christ; first, in extending his mercy to the children of
the righteous even to a thousand generations; and, secondly, in causing his
wrath to rest upon the reprobate, even to the third and fourth
generation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they have spread
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse David shows that the
ungodly had deserved the awful ruin which he predicted would befall them, since
they had not only molested mortal man, but had also rushed forth in the fury of
their pride to make war against God himself. No man, as has been stated in our
exposition of the second psalm, could offer violence to the kingdom of Israel,
which was consecrated in the person of David, by the commandment of God, without
making foul and impious war against God. Much more when persons directly attack
the kingdom of Christ to overthrow it, is the majesty of God violated, since it
is the will of God to reign in the world only by the hand of his Son. As the
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hfn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>natah, </i>which we have translated <i>to spread out, </i>also sometimes
signifies <i>to turn aside, </i>it may not unsuitably be here rendered either
way. According to the first view the meaning is, that the wicked, as if they had
spread out their nets, endeavored to subject to themselves the power of God.
According to the second the meaning is, that for the purpose of hindering, and
as it were swallowing up his power,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa455</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they turned aside their malice, so as
to make it bear against it, just like a man who, having dug a great ditch,
turned aside the course of some torrent to make it fall within it. The Psalmist
next declares, that they <i>devised a stratagem, </i>or device, which would fail
of its accomplishment. By these words he rebukes the foolish arrogance of those
who, by making war against God, manifest a recklessness and an audacity which
will undertake any thing, however daring.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou wilt set them as a

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;k&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
shekem, </i>which we have rendered <i>a butt, </i>properly signifies <i>a
shoulder, </i>some understand it in that sense here, and explain the sentence
thus:Their heads shall be smitten with heavy blows, so that having their bodies
bended, their shoulders shall appear sticking out. According to these
interpreters, the subjugation of the enemies of God is here metaphorically
pointed out. But there is another explanation which is more generally received
even among the Jewish expositors, namely, that God will shut them up in some
corner, and there keep them from doing mischief;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fa456</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and they take this view, because the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;k&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shekem, </i>is often used to denote a <i>corner, quarter, </i>or <i>place.
</i>As, however, the sacred writer, in the clause immediately following,
represents God as furnished with a bow, ready to shoot his arrows directly in
their faces, I have no doubt that, continuing his metaphor, he compares them to
a butt, or mound of earth, on which it is customary to plant the mark which is
aimed at, and thus the sense will flow very naturally thus:Lord, thou wilt make
them as it were a butt against which to shoot thine
arrows.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa457</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The great object which the Psalmist has
in view is doubtless to teach us to exercise patience, until God, at the fit
time, bring the ungodly to their end.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Raise thyself, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The psalm is at length
concluded with a prayer, which again confirms that the kingdom which is spoken
of is so connected with the glory of God, that his power is reflected from it.
This was no doubt true with respect to the kingdom of David; for God in old time
displayed his power in exalting him to the throne. But what is here stated was
only fully accomplished in Christ, who was appointed by the heavenly Father to
be King over us, and who is at the same time God manifest in the flesh. As his
divine power ought justly to strike terror into the wicked, so it is described
as full of the sweetest consolation to us, which ought to inspire us with joy,
and incite us to celebrate it with songs of praise and
thanksgivings.</font><br></div>

needlessly perplexed themselves in seeking after I know not what sublime mystery
in a matter of small importance. Some are of opinion that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tlya</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ayeleth, </i>means <i>the morning

fa460</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but it is more correctly
rendered <i>hind. </i>As it is evident, from the testimony of the apostles, that
this psalm is a prophecy concerning Christ, the ancient interpreters thought
that Christ would not be sufficiently dignified and honored unless, putting a
mystical or allegorical sense upon the word <i>hind, </i>they viewed it as
pointing out the various things which are included in a sacrifice. Those, also,
who prefer translating the original words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rj&ccedil;h

fa461</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>have endeavored to do the same
thing. But as I find no solidity in these subtleties, it will be better to take
that view of the title which is more simple and natural. I think it highly
probable that it was the beginning of some common song; nor do I see how the
inscription bears any relation to the subject-matter of the psalm. From the
tenor of the whole composition, it appears that David does not here refer merely
to one persecution, but comprehends all the persecutions which he suffered under
Saul. It is, however, uncertain whether he composed this psalm when he peaceably
enjoyed his kingdom, or in the time of his affliction; but there is no doubt
that he here describes the thoughts which passed through his mind in the midst
of his troubles, perplexities, and
sorrows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
22:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> My God! my God! why hast
thou forsaken me? Why art thou far from my help, and from the words of my
roaring? <b>2.</b> O my God! I cry in the
day-time,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The first verse contains two
remarkable sentences, which, although apparently contrary to each other, are yet
ever entering into the minds of the godly together. When the Psalmist speaks of
being forsaken and cast off by God, it seems to be the complaint of a man in
despair; for can a man have a single spark of faith remaining in him, when he
believes that there is no longer any succor for him in God? And yet, in calling
God twice his own God, and depositing his groanings into his bosom, he makes a
very distinct confession of his faith. With this inward conflict the godly must
necessarily be exercised whenever God withdraws from them the tokens of his
favor, so that, in whatever direction they turn their eyes, they see nothing but
the darkness of night. I say, that the people of God, in wrestling with
themselves, on the one hand discover the weakness of the flesh, and on the other
give evidence of their faith. With respect to the reprobate, as they cherish in
their hearts their distrust of God, their perplexity of mind overwhelms them,
and thus totally incapacitates them for aspiring after the grace of God by
faith. That David sustained the assaults of temptation, without being
overwhelmed, or swallowed up by it, may be easily gathered from his words. He
was greatly oppressed with sorrow, but notwithstanding this, he breaks forth
into the language of assurance,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My God! my
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which he could not have done
without vigorously resisting the contrary
apprehension</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa463</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that God had forsaken him. There is not
one of the godly who does not daily experience in himself the same thing.
According to the judgment of the flesh, he thinks he is cast off and forsaken by
God, while yet he apprehends by faith the grace of God, which is hidden from the
eye of sense and reason; and thus it comes to pass, that contrary affections are
mingled and interwoven in the prayers of the faithful. Carnal sense and reason
cannot but conceive of God as being either favorable or hostile, according to
the present condition of things which is presented to their view. When,
therefore, he suffers us to lie long in sorrow, and as it were to pine away
under it, we must necessarily feel, according to the apprehension of the flesh,
as if he had quite forgotten us. When such a perplexing thought takes entire
possession of the mind of man, it overwhelms him in profound unbelief, and he
neither seeks, nor any longer expects, to find a remedy. But if faith come to
his aid against such a temptation, the same person who, judging from the outward
appearance of things, regarded God as incensed against him, or as having
abandoned him, beholds in the mirror of the promises the grace of God which is
hidden and distant. Between these two contrary affections the faithful are
agitated, and, as it were, fluctuate, when Satan, on the one hand, by exhibiting
to their view the signs of the wrath of God, urges them on to despair, and
endeavors entirely to overthrow their faith; while faith, on the other hand, by
calling them back to the promises, teaches them to wait patiently and to trust
in God, until he again show them his fatherly
countenance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We see then the source from which
proceeded this exclamation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
God! my God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and from which also
proceeded the complaint which follows immediately after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why hast thou forsaken
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whilst the vehemence of grief, and the
infirmity of the flesh, forced from the Psalmist these words, <i>I am forsaken
of God; </i>faith, lest he should when so severely tried sink into despair, put
into his mouth a correction of this language, so that he boldly called God, of
whom he thought he was forsaken, his God. Yea, we see that he has given the
first place to faith. Before he allows himself to utter his complaint, in order
to give faith the chief place, he first declares that he still claimed God as
his own <i>God, </i>and betook himself to him for refuge. And as the affections
of the flesh, when once they break forth, are not easily restrained, but rather
carry us beyond the bounds of reason, it is surely well to repress them at the
very commencement. David, therefore, observed the best possible order in giving
his faith the precedency - in expressing it before giving vent to his sorrow,
and in qualifying, by devout prayer, the complaint which he afterwards makes
with respect to the greatness of his calamities. Had he spoken simply and
precisely in these terms, Lord, why forsakest thou me? he would have seemed, by
a complaint so bitter, to murmur against God; and besides, his mind would have
been in great danger of being embittered with discontent through the greatness
of his grief. But, by here raising up against murmuring and discontent the
rampart of faith, he keeps all his thoughts and feelings under restraint, that
they may not break beyond due bounds. Nor is the repetition superfluous when he
twice calls God <i>his God; </i>and, a little after, he even repeats the same
words the third time. When God, as if he had cast off all care about us, passes
over our miseries and groanings as if he saw them not, the conflict with this
species of temptation is arduous and painful, and therefore David the more
strenuously exerts himself in seeking the confirmation of his faith. Faith does
not gain the victory at the first encounter, but after receiving many blows, and
after being exercised with many tossings, she at length comes forth victorious.
I do not say that David was so courageous and valiant a champion as that his
faith did not waver. The faithful may put forth all their efforts to subdue
their carnal affections, that they may subject and devote themselves wholly to
God; but still there is always some infirmity remaining in them. From this
proceeded that halting of holy Jacob, of which Moses makes mention in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:24; for although in wrestling with God he prevailed, yet he ever after bore
the mark of his sinful defect. By such examples God encourages his servants to
perseverance, lest, from a consciousness of their own infirmity, they should
sink into despair. The means therefore which we ought to adopt, whenever our
flesh becomes tumultuous, and, like an impetuous tempest, hurries us into
impatience, is to strive against it, and to endeavor to restrain its
impetuosity. In doing this we will, it is true, be agitated and sorely tried,
but our faith will, nevertheless, continue safe, and be preserved from
shipwreck. Farther, we may gather from the very form of the complaint which
David here makes, that he did not without cause redouble the words by which his
faith might be sustained. He does not simply say that he <i>was forsaken </i>by
God, but he adds, that God <i>was far from his help, </i>in as-much as when he
saw him in the greatest danger, he gave him no token to encourage him in the
hope of obtaining deliverance. Since God has the ability to succor us, if, when
he sees us exposed as a prey to our enemies, he nevertheless sits still as if he
cared not about us, who would not say that he has drawn back his hand that he
may not deliver us? Again, by the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the words of my
roaring</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Psalmist intimates that he
was distressed and tormented in the highest degree. He certainly was not a man
of so little courage as, on account of some slight or ordinary affliction, to
howl in this manner like a brute
beast.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa464</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must therefore come to the
conclusion, that the distress was very great which could extort such roaring
from a man who was distinguished for meekness, and for the undaunted courage
with which he endured calamities.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As our Savior
Jesus Christ, when hanging on the cross, and when ready to yield up his soul
into the hands of God his Father, made use of these very words,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402746&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:46,) we must consider how these two things can agree, that Christ was the
only begotten Son of God, and that yet he was so penetrated with grief, seized
with so great mental trouble, as to cry out that God his Father had forsaken
him. The apparent contradiction between these two statements has constrained
many interpreters to have recourse to evasions for fear of charging Christ with
blame in this matter.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa465</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Accordingly, they have said that Christ
made this complaint rather according to the opinion of the common people, who
witnessed his sufferings, than from any feeling which he had of being deserted
by his father. But they have not considered that they greatly lessen the benefit
of our redemption, in imagining that Christ was altogether exempted from the
terrors which the judgment of God strikes into sinners. It was a groundless fear
to be afraid of making Christ subject to so great sorrow, lest they should
diminish his glory. As Peter, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:24, clearly testifies that "it<i> </i>was not possible that he should be
holden of the pains of death," it follows that he was not altogether exempted
from them. And as he became our representative, and took upon him our sins, it
was certainly necessary that he should appear before the judgment-seat of God as
a sinner. From this proceeded the terror and dread which constrained him to pray
for deliverance from death; not that it was so grievous to him merely to depart
from this life; but because there was before his eyes the curse of God, to which
all who are sinners are exposed. Now, if during his first conflict "his<i>
</i>sweat was as it were great drops of blood," and he needed an angel to
comfort him,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422243&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
22:43,) it is not wonderful if, in his last sufferings on the cross, he uttered
a complaint which indicated the deepest sorrow. By the way, it should be marked,
that Christ, although subject to human passions and affections, never fell into
sin through the weakness of the flesh; for the perfection of his nature
preserved him from all excess. He could therefore overcome all the temptations
with which Satan assailed him, without receiving any wound in the conflict which
might afterwards constrain him to halt. In short, there is no doubt that Christ,
in uttering this exclamation upon the cross, manifestly showed, that although
David here bewails his own distresses, this psalm was composed under the
influence of the Spirit of prophecy concerning David's King and
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my God! I cry in the
day-time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse the Psalmist
expresses the long continuance of his affliction, which increased his
disquietude and weariness. It was a temptation even still more grievous, that
his crying seemed only to be lost labor; for, as our only means of relief under
our calamities is in calling upon God, if we derive no advantage from our
prayers, what other remedy remains for us? David, therefore, complains that God
is in a manner deaf to his prayers. When he says in the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there is no silence to
me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning is, that he experienced
no comfort or solace, nothing which could impart tranquillity to his troubled
mind. As long as affliction pressed upon him, his mind was so disquieted, that
he was constrained to cry out. Here there is shown the constancy of faith, in
that the long duration of calamities could neither overthrow it, nor interrupt
its exercise. The true rule of praying is, therefore, this, that he who seems to
have beaten the air to no purpose, or to have lost his labor in praying for a
long time, should not, on that account, leave off, or desist from that duty.
Meanwhile, there is this advantage which God in his fatherly kindness grants to
his people, that if they have been disappointed at any time of their desires and
expectations, they may make known to God their perplexities and distresses, and
unburden them, as it were, into his
bosom.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

experienced;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa468</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but I cannot subscribe to this opinion.
It is more simple and natural to view the language as meaning, that God has
always shown himself gracious to his chosen people. The subject here treated is
not what God is in heaven, but what he has shown himself to be towards men. It
may be asked, whether David, in these words, aggravates his complaint, by
insinuating that he is the only person who obtains nothing from God? or whether,
by holding up these words as a shield before him, he repels the temptation with
which he was assailed, by exhibiting to his view this truth, that God is the
continual deliverer of his people? I admit that this verse is an additional
expression of the greatness of David's grief; but I have no doubt, that in using
this language he seeks from it a remedy against his distrust. It was a dangerous
temptation to see himself forsaken by God; and, accordingly, lest by continually
thinking upon it, he should nourish it, he turned his mind to the contemplation
of the constant evidences afforded of the grace of God, from which he might
encourage himself, in the hope of obtaining succor. He, therefore, not only
meant to ask how it was that God, who had always dealt mercifully with his
people, should now, forgetting as it were his own nature, thus leave a miserable
man without any succor or solace; but he also takes a shield with which to
defend himself against the fiery darts of Satan. He calls God <i>holy,
</i>because he continues always like himself. He says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabiteth the praises of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>because, in showing such
liberality towards the chosen people, as to be continually bestowing blessings
upon them, he furnished them with matter for continued praise and thanksgiving.
Unless God cause us to taste of his goodness by doing us good, we must needs
become mute in regard to the celebration of his praise. As David belonged to the
number of this chosen people, he strives, in opposition to all the obstacles
which distrust might suggest as standing in the way, to cherish the hope that he
shall at length be united to this body to sing along with them the praises of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our fathers trusted in
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist assigns the
reason why God sitteth amidst the praises of the tribes of Israel. The reason
is, because his hand had been always stretched forth to preserve his faithful
people. David, as I have just now observed, gathers together the examples of all
past ages, in order thereby to encourage, strengthen, and effectually persuade
himself, that as God had never cast off any of his chosen people, he also would
be one of the number of those for whom deliverance is securely laid up in the
hand of God. He therefore expressly declares that he belongs to the offspring of
those who had been heard, intimating by this, that he is an heir of the same
grace which they had experienced. He has an eye to the covenant by which God had
adopted the posterity of Abraham to be his peculiar people. It would be of
little consequence to know the varied instances in which God has exercised his
mercy towards his own people, unless each of us could reckon himself among their
number, as David includes himself in the Church of God. In repeating three times
that the fathers had obtained deliverance by <i>trusting, </i>there is no doubt
that with all modesty he intends tacitly to intimate that he had the same hope
with which they were inspired, a hope which draws after it, as its effect, the
fulfillment of the promises in our behalf. In order that a man may derive
encouragement from the blessings which God has bestowed upon his servants in
former times, he should turn his attention to the free promises of God's word,
and to the faith which leans upon them. In short, to show that this confidence
was neither cold nor dead, David tells us, at the same time, that <i>they cried
unto God. </i>He who pretends that he trusts in God, and yet is so listless and
indifferent under his calamities that he does not implore his aid, lies
shamefully. By prayer, then, true faith is known, as the goodness of a tree is
known by its fruit. It ought also to be observed, that God regards no other
prayers as right but those which proceed from faith, and are accompanied with
it. It is therefore not without good reason that David has put the word <i>cried
</i>in the middle between these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They trusted in thee, they
trusted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in the fourth verse, and these
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They trusted in
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in the fifth
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I am a worm, and not a
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David does not murmur against God
as if God had dealt hardly with him; but in bewailing his condition, he says, in
order the more effectually to induce God to show him mercy, that he is not
accounted so much as a man. This, it is true, seems at first sight to have a
tendency to discourage the mind, or rather to destroy faith; but it will appear
more clearly from the sequel, that so far from this being the case, David
declares how miserable his condition is, that by this means he may encourage
himself in the hope of obtaining relief. He therefore argues that it could not
be but that God would at length stretch forth his hand to save him; to save him,
I say, who was so severely afflicted, and on the brink of despair. If God has
had compassion on all who have ever been afflicted, although afflicted only in a
moderate degree, how could he forsake his servant when plunged in the lowest
abyss of all calamities? Whenever, therefore, we are overwhelmed under a great
weight of afflictions, we ought rather to take from this an argument to
encourage us to hope for deliverance, than suffer ourselves to fall into
despair. If God so severely exercised his most eminent servant David, and abased
him so far that he had not a place even among the most despised of men, let us
not take it ill, if, after his example, we are brought low. We ought, however,
principally to call to our remembrance the Son of God, in whose person we know
this also was fulfilled, as Isaiah had
predicted,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He is despised and
rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief and we hid as it
were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
53:3)</font><br><font face="Palatino">By these words of the prophet we are
furnished with a sufficient refutation of the frivolous subtlety of those who
have philosophised upon the word <i>worm, </i>as if David here pointed out some
singular mystery in the generation of Christ; whereas his meaning simply is,
that he had been abased beneath all men, and, as it were, cut off from the
number of living beings. The fact that the Son of God suffered himself to be
reduced to such ignominy, yea, descended even to hell, is so far from obscuring,
in any respect, his celestial glory, that it is rather a bright mirror from
which is reflected his unparalleled grace towards
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All those who see me mock at
me, etc.,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa469</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is an explanation of the preceding
sentence. He had said that he was an object of scorn to the lowest of men, and,
as it were, to the refuse of the people. He now informs us of the ignominy with
which he had been treated, &#8212; that not content with opprobrious language,
they also showed their insolence by their very gesture, both by shooting out
their lips,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa470</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and by shaking their heads. As the
words which we render</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> they thrust
out the lip,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, in the Hebrew, <i>they
open with the lip,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa471</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some explain them as meaning
<i>to rail. </i>But this view does not appear to me to be appropriate; for the
letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
beth, </i>which signifies <i>with, </i>is here superfluous, as it often is in
the Hebrew. I have therefore preferred rendering the original words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they thrust out the
lip;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is the gesture of those who
mock openly and injuriously. The reproachful language which follows was much
more grievous when they alleged against him that God, who he openly avowed was
his father, was turned away from him. We know that David, when he saw himself
unjustly condemned of the world, was accustomed to support and console himself
with the assurance, that since he had the approving testimony of a good
conscience, he had God in heaven for his guardian, who was able to execute
vengeance upon his revilers.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa472</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But now, all who saw him reproached
him, that with vain arrogance he had groundlessly boasted of the succor he would
receive from God. Where is that God, say they, on whom he leaned? Where is that
love to which he trusted? Satan has not a more deadly dart for wounding the
souls of men than when he endeavors to dislodge hope from our minds, by turning
the promises of God into ridicule. David's enemies, however, do not simply say
that his prayers were in vain, and that the love of God of which he boasted was
fallacious; but they indirectly charge him with being a hypocrite, in that he
falsely pretended to be one of the children of God, from whom he was altogether
estranged.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How severe a temptation this must
have been to David every man may judge from his own experience. But by the
remedy he used he afforded a proof of the sincerity of his confidence:for unless
he had had God as the undoubted witness and approver of the sincerity of his
heart, he would never have dared to come before him with this complaint.
Whenever, therefore, men charge us with hypocrisy, let it be our endeavor that
the inward sincerity of our hearts may answer for us before God. And whenever
Satan attempts to dislodge faith from our minds, by biting detraction and cruel
derision, let this be our sacred anchors &#8212; to call upon God to witness it,
and that, beholding it, he may be pleased to show his righteousness in
maintaining our right, since his holy name cannot be branded with viler
blasphemy than to say that those who put their trust in him are puffed up with
vain confidence, and that those who persuade themselves that God loves them
deceive themselves with a groundless fancy. As the Son of God was assailed with
the same weapon, it is certain that Satan will not be more sparing of true
believers who are his members than of him. They ought, therefore, to defend
themselves from this consideration - that although men may regard them as in a
desperate condition, yet, if they commit to God both themselves and all their
affairs, their prayers will not be in vain. By the verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gol, </i>which is rendered <i>to commit, </i>the nature and efficacy of faith
are very well expressed, which, reposing itself upon the providence of God,

fortress, in order to withstand and repel the machinations of Satan. He briefly
enumerates the benefits which God had bestowed upon him, by which he had long
since learned that he was his father. Yea, he declares that even before he was
born God had shown towards him such evidence of his fatherly love, that although
now overwhelmed with the darkness of death, he might upon good ground venture to
hope for life from him. And it is the Holy Spirit who teaches the faithful the
wisdom to collect together, when they are brought into circumstances of fear and
trouble, the evidences of the goodness of God, in order thereby to sustain and
strengthen their faith. We ought to regard it as an established principle, that
as God never wearies in the exercise of his liberality, and as the most
exuberant bestowment cannot exhaust his riches, it follows that, as we have
experienced him to be a father from our earliest infancy, he will show himself
the same towards us even to extreme old age. In acknowledging that he was
<i>taken from the womb </i>by the hand of God, and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God had caused him to confide
upon the breasts of his mother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the
meaning is, that although it is by the operation of natural causes that infants
come into the world, and are nourished with their mother's milk, yet therein the
wonderful providence of God brightly shines forth. This miracle, it is true,
because of its ordinary occurrence, is made less account of by us. But if
ingratitude did not put upon our eyes the veil of stupidity, we would be
ravished with admiration at every childbirth in the world. What prevents the
child from perishing, as it might, a hundred times in its own corruption, before
the time for bringing it forth arrives, but that God, by his secret and
incomprehensible power, keeps it alive in its grave? And after it is brought
into the world, seeing it is subject to so many miseries, and cannot stir a
finger to help itself, how could it live even for a single day, did not God take
it up into his fatherly bosom to nourish and protect it? It is, therefore, with
good reason said, that the infant <i>is cast upon him; </i>for, unless he fed
the tender little babes, and watched over all the offices of the nurse, even at
the very time of their being brought forth, they are exposed to a hundred
deaths, by which they would be suffocated in an instant. Finally, David
concludes that God was <i>his God. </i>God, it is true, to all appearance, shows
the like goodness which is here celebrated even to the brute creation; but it is
only to mankind that he shows himself to be a father in a special manner. And
although he does not immediately endue babes with the knowledge of himself, yet
he is said <i>to give them confidence, </i>because, by showing in fact that he
takes care of their life, he in a manner allures them to himself; as it is said
in another place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He giveth to the beast

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
147:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since God anticipates in this manner, by his grace,
little infants before they have as yet the use of reason, it is certain that he
will never disappoint the hope of his servants when they petition and call upon
him. This is the argument by which David struggled with, and endeavored to
overcome temptation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart not far from
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he employs another argument to
induce God to show him mercy, alleging that he is sorely pressed and hemmed in
by the greatest distress. He doubtless set before his eyes the office which the
Scriptures every where attribute to God of succouring the miserable, and of
being the more ready to help us the more we are afflicted. Even despair itself,
therefore, served as a ladder to elevate his mind to the exercise of devout and
fervent prayer. In like manner, the feeling we have of our afflictions should
excite us to take shelter under the wings of God, that by granting us his aid,
he may show that he takes a deep interest in our
welfare.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
22:12-16	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b> Strong bulls have
encompassed me; the bulls of Bashan have beset me round. <b>13.</b> They have
opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and a roaring lion. <b>14.</b> I am
poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed: my heart is like wax; it
is melted in the midst of my bowels. <b>15.</b> My strength is dried up like a
potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me to the
dust of death. <b>16.</b> For dogs have encompassed me; the assembly of the
wicked have surrounded me: they have pierced my hands and my
feet.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Strong bulls have encompassed
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist now complains of the
cruelty and barbarous rage of his enemies; and he compares them first to bulls,
secondly to lions, and thirdly to dogs. When the anger of bulls is kindled, we
know how fierce and terrible they are. The lion, also, is a cruel beast, and
dreadful to mankind. And the eager and fierce boldness with which dogs, when
once they are irritated, rush upon a man to do him injury, is well known. In
short, David's enemies were so blood-thirsty and cruel, that they more resembled
wild beasts than men. He calls them not simply <i>bulls, </i>but <i>strong
bulls. </i>Instead of rendering the original word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rabbim, strong, </i>as we have done, some would render it <i>many:</i>with
which I cannot agree. David, it is true, was assailed by great hosts of enemies;
but it appears, from the second clause of the verse, that what is here described
is their strength, and not their number. He there terms them <i>the bulls of
Bashan; </i>meaning by that expression, well-fed bulls, and, consequently, large
and strong:for we know that the hill of Bashan was distinguished for rich and
fat pastures.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa475</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am poured out like
water.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hitherto he has informed us that
being surrounded by wild beasts, he was not far from death, as if he had been at
the point of being devoured every moment. He now bewails, in addition to this,
his inward distress; from which we learn that he was not stupid or insensible in
dangers. It could have been no ordinary fear which made him almost pine away, by
which his bones were disjointed, and his heart poured out like water. We see,
then, that David was not buffeted with the waves of affliction like a rock which
cannot be moved, but was agitated within by sore troubles and temptations,
which, through the infirmity of the flesh, he would never have been able to
sustain had he not been aided by the power of the Spirit of God. How these
sufferings are applicable to Christ I have informed you a little before. Being a
real man, he was truly subject to the infirmities of our flesh, only without the
taint of sin. The perfect purity of his nature did not extinguish the human
affections; it only regulated them, that they might not become sinful through
excess. The greatness of his griefs, therefore, could not so weaken him as to
prevent him, even in the midst of his most excruciating sufferings, from
submitting himself to the will of God, with a composed and peaceful mind. Now,
although this is not the case with respect to us, who have within us turbulent
and disorderly affections, and who never can keep them under such restraint as
not to be driven hither and thither by their impetuosity, yet, after the example
of David, we ought to take courage; and when, through our infirmity, we are, as
it were, almost lifeless, we should direct our groanings to God, beseeching him
that he would be graciously pleased to restore us to strength and
vigor.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My strength is dried
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He means the vigor which is imparted
to us by the radical moisture, as physicians call it. What he adds in the next
clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My tongue cleaveth to my
jaws,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is of the same import. We know
that excessive grief not only consumes the vital spirits, but also dries up
almost all the moisture which is in our bodies. He next declares, that in
consequence of this, he was adjudged or devoted to the
grave:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast brought me to the
dust of death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this he intimates,
that all hope of life was taken from him; and in this sense Paul also says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:9,) that "he had received the sentence of death in himself." But
David here speaks of himself in hyperbolical language, and he does this in order
to lead us beyond himself to Christ. The dreadful encounter of our Redeemer with
death, by which there was forced from his body blood instead of sweat; his
descent into hell, by which he tasted of the wrath of God which was due to
sinners; and, in short, his emptying himself, could not be adequately expressed
by any of the ordinary forms of speech. Moreover, David speaks of death as those
who are in trouble are accustomed to speak of it, who, struck with fear, can
think of nothing but of their being reduced to dust and to destruction. Whenever
the minds of the saints are surrounded and oppressed with this darkness, there
is always some unbelief mixed with their exercise, which prevents them from all
at once emerging from it to the light of a new life. But in Christ these two
things were wonderfully conjoined, namely, terror, proceeding from a sense of
the curse of God; and patience, arising from faith, which tranquillised all the
mental emotions, so that they continued in complete and willing subjection to
the authority of God. With respect to ourselves, who are not endued with the
like power, if at any time, upon beholding nothing but destruction near us, we
are for a season greatly dismayed, we should endeavor by degrees to recover
courage, and to elevate ourselves to the hope which quickens the
dead.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have pierced my hands and my

translated <i>they have pierced, </i>is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrak</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caari, </i>which literally rendered is, <i>like a lion. </i>As all the Hebrew
Bibles at this day, without exception, have this reading, I would have had great
hesitation in departing from a reading which they all support, were it not that
the scope of the discourse compels me to do so, and were there not strong
grounds for conjecturing that this passage has been fraudulently corrupted by
the Jews. With respect to the Septuagint version, there is no doubt that the
translators had read in the Hebrew text,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wrak</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caaru, </i>that is the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,

<i>yod.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa477</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Jews prate much about the
literal sense being purposely and deliberately overthrown, by our rendering the
original word by <i>they have pierced:</i>but for this allegation there is no
color of truth whatever. What need was there to trifle so presumptuously in a
matter where it was altogether unnecessary? Very great suspicion of falsehood,
however, attaches to them, seeing it is the uppermost desire of their hearts to
despoil the crucified Jesus of his escutcheons, and to divest him of his
character as the Messiah and Redeemer. If we receive this reading as they would
have us to do, the sense will be enveloped in marvellous obscurity. In the first
place, it will be a defective form of expression, and to complete it, they say
it is necessary to supply the verb <i>to surround </i>or <i>to beset. </i>But
what do they mean by <i>besetting the hands and the feet? </i>Besetting belongs
no more to these parts of the human body than to the whole man. The absurdity of
this argument being discovered, they have recourse to the most ridiculous old
wives' fables, according to their usual way, saying, that the lion, when he
meets any man in his road, makes a circle with his tail before rushing upon his
prey:from which it is abundantly evident that they are at a loss for arguments
to support their view.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, since David, in
the preceding verse, has used the similitude of a lion, the repetition of it in
this verse would be superfluous. I forbear insisting upon what some of our
expositors have observed, namely, that this noun, when it has prefixed to it the
letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caph, </i>which signifies <i>as, </i>the word denoting similitude, has
commonly other points than those which are employed in this passage. My object,
however, is not here to labor to convince the Jews who in controversy are in the
highest degree obstinate and opinionative. I only intend briefly to show how
wickedly they endeavor to perplex Christians on account of the different reading
which occurs in this place. When they object, that by the appointment of the law
no man was fastened with nails to a cross, they betray in this their gross
ignorance of history, since it is certain that the Romans introduced many of
their own customs and manners into the provin ces which they had conquered. If
they object that David was never nailed to a cross, the answer is easy, namely,
that in bewailing his condition, he has made use of a similitude, declaring that
he was not less afflicted by his enemies than the man who is suspended on a
cross, having his hands and feet pierced through with nails. We will meet a
little after with more of the same kind of
metaphors.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

<i>atsmoth </i>which signifies <i>bones, </i>is derived from another word, which
signifies <i>strength; </i>and, therefore, this term is sometimes applied to
friends, by whose defense we are strengthened, or to arguments and reasons which
are, as it were, the sinews and the strength of the defense of a cause. Some,
therefore, put this meaning upon the passage, &#8212; I will profit nothing by
reckoning up all my arguments in self-vindication; for my enemies are fully
determined to destroy me by some means or other, whether fair or foul, without
having any regard to the dictates of justice. Others explain it thus:Although I
should gather together all the aids which might seem to be capable of affording
me succor, they would avail me nothing. But the exposition which is more
generally received seems to me to be also the more simple and natural, and,
therefore, I embrace it the more readily. It is this - that David complains that
his body was so lean and wasted, that the bones appeared protruding from all
parts of it; for he adds immediately after, that his enemies took pleasure in
seeing him in so pitiable a condition. Thus the two clauses of the verse are
beautifully connected together. The cruelty of his enemies was so insatiable,
that beholding a wretched man wasted with grief, and as it were pining away,
they took pleasure in feeding their eyes with so sad a
spectacle.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows in the next verse
concerning his garments is metaphorical. It is as if he had said, that all his
goods were become a prey to his enemies, even as conquerors are accustomed to
plunder the vanquished, or to divide the spoil among themselves, by casting lots
to determine the share which belongs to each. Comparing his ornaments, riches,
and all that he possessed, to his garments, he complains that, after he had been
despoiled of them, his enemies divided them among themselves, as so much booty,
accompanied with mockery of him; and by this mockery the villany of their
conduct was aggravated, inasmuch as they triumphed over him, as if he had been a
dead man. The Evangelists quote this place to the letter, as we say, and without
figure; and there is no absurdity in their doing so. To teach us the more
certainly that in this psalm Christ is described to us by the Spirit of
prophecy, the heavenly Father intended that in the person of his Son those
things should be visibly accomplished which were shadowed forth in David.
Matthew,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
8:16, 17,) in narrating that the paralytic, the blind, and the lame, were healed
of their diseases, says, that this was done "that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bear
our sicknesses;" although the prophet, in that place, sets before us the Son of
God in the character of a spiritual physician. We are extremely slow and
backward to believe; and it is not wonderful, that, on account of our dullness
of apprehension, a demonstration of the character of Christ, palpable to our
senses, has been given us,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not thou, then, far from me, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must keep in mind all that
David has hitherto related concerning himself. As his miseries had reached the
utmost height, and as he saw not even a single ray of hope to encourage him to
expect deliverance, it is a wonderful instance of the power of faith, that he
not only endured his afflictions patiently, but that from the abyss of despair
he arose to call upon God. Let us, therefore, particularly mark, that David did
not pour out his lamentations thinking them to be in vain, and of no effect, as
persons who are in perplexity often pour forth their groanings at random. The
prayers which he adds sufficiently show that he hoped for such an issue as he
desired. When he calls God <i>his strength, </i>by this epithet he gives a more
evident proof of his faith. He does not pray in a doubting manner; but he
promises himself the assistance which the eye of sense did not as yet perceive.

presently exposed to the danger of death, and that in many ways. Whence we
gather, that although he utterly fainted in himself when thus surrounded by
death, he yet continued strong in the Lord, and that the spirit of life had
always been vigorous in his heart. Some take the words <i>only soul, </i>or
<i>only life, </i>for <i>dear </i>and
<i>precious;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa481</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but this view does not appear to
me to be appropriate. He rather means, that, amidst so many deaths he found no

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
35:17 the words, <i>only soul,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

clearly from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
25:16, where David, by calling himself poor and alone, doubtless complains that
he was completely deprived of friends, and forsaken of the whole world. When it

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear me from the horns of the

may seem strange and obscure to our ears, but the sense is not at all ambiguous.
The cause is only put instead of the effect; for our deliverance is the
consequence or effect of God's hearing us. If it is asked how this can be
applied to Christ, whom the Father did not deliver from death? I answer, in one
word, that he was more mightily delivered than if God had prevented him from
falling a victim to death, even as it is a much greater deliverance to rise
again from the dead than to be healed of a grievous malady. Death, therefore,
did not prevent Christ's resurrection from at length bearing witness that he had
been heard.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

is delivered he will not be ungrateful, confirms what I have previously stated,
that he had never been so cast down by temptation as not to take courage to
resist it. How could he be putting himself in readiness, as he is doing here, to
offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving, if he had not beforehand entertained
the assured hope of deliverance? Should we even grant that this psalm was
composed after David had actually obtained what he desired, there is no doubt
that what he afterwards put into writing formed the meditations and reflections
which had passed through his mind during the time of his heavy afflictions. It
ought to be particularly noticed, that it is no ordinary token of gratitude
which he promises, but such as God required for rare blessings; namely, that the
faithful should come into his sanctuary, and there bear solemn testimony to the
grace which they had received. The design of public and solemn thanksgiving is,
that the faithful may employ themselves in all variety of ways, in serving and
honoring God, and that they may encourage one another to act in the same manner.
We know that God's wonderful power shone forth in the protection of David; and
that not only by one miracle, but by many. It is, therefore, not wonderful that
he brings himself under obligation, by a solemn vow, to make open and public
profession of his piety and faithfulness towards God. By <i>his brethren </i>he
means the Israelites; and he gives them this appellation, not only because he
and they were both descended from the same parentage, but rather because the
religion which they had in common, as a sacred bond, kept them united to one
another by a spiritual relationship. The apostle,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:12) in applying this verse to Christ, argues from it, that he was a partaker
of the same nature with us, and joined to us by a true fellowship of the flesh,
seeing he acknowledges us as his brethren, and vouchsafes to give us a title so
honorable. I have already repeatedly stated, (and it is also easy to prove it
from the end of this psalms) that under the figure of David, Christ has been
here shadowed forth to us. The apostle, therefore, justly deduces from this,
that under and by the name of <i>brethren, </i>the right of fraternal alliance
with Christ has been confirmed to us. This, no doubt, to a certain extent
belongs to all mankind, but the true enjoyment thereof belongs properly to
genuine believers alone. For this reason Christ himself, with his own mouth,
limits this title to his disciples, saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Go to my brethren, and
say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your
God,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;432017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
20:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The ungodly, by means of their unbelief, break off
and dissolve that relationship of the flesh, by which he has allied himself to
us, and thus render themselves utter strangers to him by their own fault. As
David, while he comprehended under the word <i>brethren </i>all the offspring of
Abraham, immediately after (verse 23) particularly addresses his discourse to
the true worshippers of God; so Christ, while he has broken down "the middle
wall of partition" between Jews and Gentiles, and published the blessings of
adoption to all nations, and thereby exhibited himself to them as a brother,
retains in the degree of brethren none but true
believers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye who fear
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here, again, the Psalmist
expresses more distinctly the fruit of public and solemn thanksgiving, of which
I have spoken before, declaring, that by engaging in this exercise, every man in
his own place invites and stirs up the church by his example to praise God. He
tells us, that the end for which he will praise the name of God in the public
assembly is to encourage his brethren to do the same. But as hypocrites commonly
thrust themselves into the church, and as on the barn-floor of the Lord the
chaff is mingled with the wheat, he addresses himself expressly to the godly,
and those who <i>fear </i>God. Impure and wicked men may sing the praises of God
with open mouth, but assuredly, they do nothing else than pollute and profane
his holy name. It were, indeed, an object much to be desired, that men of all
conditions in the world would, with one accord, join in holy melody to the Lord.
But as the chief and most essential part of this harmony proceeds from a sincere
and pure affection of heart, none will ever, in a right manner, celebrate the
glory of God, except the man who worships him under the influence of holy fear.
David names, a little after, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
seed of Jacob and Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>having a
reference to the common calling of the people; and certainly, he put no obstacle
in the way to hinder even all the children of Abraham from praising God with one
accord. But as he saw that many of the Israelites were bastard and degenerate,
he distinguishes true and sincere Israelites from them; and at the same time
shows that God's name is not duly celebrated, unless where there is true piety
and the inward fear of God. Accordingly, in his exhortation he again joins
together the praises of God and reverence towards him. &#8212;<i> Fear him, ye
seed of Israel, </i>says he; for all the fair faces which hypocrites put on in
this matter are nothing but pure mockery. The fear which he recommends is not,
however, such as would frighten the faithful from approaching God, but that
which will bring them truly humbled into his sanctuary, as has been stated in
the fifth psalm. Some may be surprised to find David addressing an exhortation
to praise God,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa485</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to those whom he had previously
commended for doing so. But this is easily explained, for even the holiest men
in the world are never so thoroughly imbued with the fear of God as not to have
need of being continually incited to its exercise. Accordingly, the exhortation
is not at all superfluous when, speaking of those who fear God, he exhorts them
to stand in awe of him, and to prostrate themselves humbly before
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he hath not
despised.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To rejoice in one another's
good, and to give thanks in common for each other's welfare, is a branch of that
communion which ought to exist among the people of God, as Paul also
teaches,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"That for the gift

<div><font face="Palatino">But this statement of David serves another important
purpose &#8212; it serves to encourage every man to hope that God will exercise
the same mercy towards himself. By the way, we are taught from these words that
the people of God ought to endure their afflictions patiently, however long it
shall please the Lord to keep them in a state of distress, that he may at length
succor them, and lend them his aid when they are so severely
tried.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My praise shall proceed from
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not reject the other
translation; but in my opinion, the Hebrew manner of expression here requires
this sense - that David will take the matter of his song of praise from God.
Accordingly, I supply the verb <i>shall proceed, </i>or <i>shall flow, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My praise shall proceed or
flow from thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he made this
statement in order to testify that he owed his deliverance entirely to God. We
know that there are many who, under pretense of praising God, trumpet forth
their own praises, and those of their friends, and leaving God in the
back-ground, take occasion from one thing or another to celebrate their own
triumphs. The Psalmist repeats what he had touched upon a little before, that he
will show the tokens of his gratitude in a public manner, in order thereby to
edify others. He adds, that among these tokens will be the solemn exercise of
godliness enjoined by the law:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will pay my vows in the presence of them that fear
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In important affairs, and when
threatened with imminent danger, it was a common practice among God's ancient
people to vow a peace-offering, and after having obtained the object of their
desire, they performed their vow. As David, therefore, belonged to the number of
the saints, he conformed himself, as it became him, to that common and
understood regulation of the Church. The vows which he promises to pay are those
which he intimates he had made in his extreme distress, and he prepares himself
to perform them with a noble and cheerful heart, yea, with a heart full of
confidence. Now, although it behoved him to perform this solemn act of religion
in the presence of the whole assembly without distinction, he again confesses it
to be his desire, that all who should be present there to witness it should be
the true worshippers of God. Thus, although it may not be in our power to
cleanse the Church of God, it is our duty to desire her purity. The Papists, by
wresting this passage to support their false and deceitful vows, show themselves
so stupid and so ridiculous, that it is unnecessary to spend much time in
refuting them. What resemblance is there between these childish fooleries, with
which according to their own imagination they attempt to appease God, and this
holy testimony of gratitude, which not only a true sense of religion and the
fear of God suggested to the fathers, but which God himself has commanded and
ratified in his law? Yea, how can they have the face to equal their foolish and
infamous superstitions to the most precious of all sacrifices - the sacrifice of
thanksgiving? even as the Scriptures testify, that the principal part of the
service of God consists in this, that true believers publicly and solemnly
acknowledge that he is the author of all good
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The poor shall
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist has a reference to the
custom which was at that time prevalent among the Jews, of feasting on their
sacrifices, as is very well known. He here promises this feast, in order to
exercise and prove his charity. And surely that is a pleasant and an acceptable
oblation to God to which compassion and mercy are joined. Without these, the
ceremonies by which men profess to worship God, with all their pomp and
magnificence, vanish into smoke. David does not, however, simply promise to
bestow upon the poor and the hungry something for the mere nourishment of the
body. He declares that they shall be partakers of this feast for another
purpose, namely, that matter of comfort being ministered to them, joy might be
restored to their hearts and flourish afresh. For they saw in that feast, as in
a mirror, the goodness of God set forth to all who are in affliction, which
might assuage with wonderful consolation the grief arising from all their
calamities. The Psalmist therefore adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall praise Jehovah that
seek him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The abundant repast of which
they had partaken ought, no doubt, to have incited them to give thanks to God;
but what is particularly meant is, praising God for that deliverance in grateful
commemoration of which the sacrifice was offered. This appears still more
clearly from the last clause of the
verse:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your heart shall live for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>One meal could not have sufficed
to make their hearts live for ever. It was rather the hope which they
entertained of having ready succor from God which did this; for all the faithful
justly reckoned the deliverance of this one man as a deliverance wrought for
themselves in particular. Whence it follows, that, in the peace-offerings, the
praises of God were so celebrated, as that genuine worshippers also exercised
their hope in them. Farther, as hypocrites content themselves with merely going
through the bare and lifeless ceremony, the Psalmist restricts the right
performance of this exercise to true and holy Israelites;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall praise Jehovah that
seek him;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and to seek God is the certain
mark of genuine godliness. Now, if the fathers under the law had their spiritual
life renewed and invigorated by their holy feasts, this virtue will show itself
much more abundantly at this day in the holy supper of Christ, provided those
who come to partake of it seek the Lord truly, and with their whole
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the ends of the earth
shall remember.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage, beyond all
doubt, shows that David stops not at his own person, but that under himself, as
a type, he describes the promised Messiah. For even then, it ought to have been
a well-known point, that he had been created king by God, that the people might
be united together and enjoy a happy life under one head; and this was at length
completely fulfilled in Christ. David's name, I admit, was great and renowned
among the neighboring nations; but what was the territory which they occupied in
comparison of the whole world? Besides, the foreign nations whom he had subdued
had never been converted by him to the true worship of God. That forced and
slavish submission, therefore, which the heathen nations had been brought by
conquest to yield to an earthly king, was very different from the willing
obedience of true godliness by which they would be recovered from their
miserable wanderings, and gathered to God. Nor does the Psalmist mean an
ordinary change, when he says, that the nations shall return to God, after
having become well acquainted with his grace. Moreover, by uniting them to the
fellowship of the holy feast, he manifestly grafts them into the body of the
Church. Some explain these words, <i>They shall remember, </i>as meaning, that
upon the restoration of the light of faith to the Gentiles, they should then
come to remember God, whom they had for a time
forgotten;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa487</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but this seems to me too refined, and
far from the meaning. I allow that the conversion or return of which mention is
here made, implies that they had previously been alienated from God by wicked
defection; but this remembrance simply means that the Gentiles, awakened by the
signal miracles wrought by God, would again come to embrace the true religion,
from which they had fallen away. Farther, it is to be observed, that the true
worship of God proceeds from the knowledge of him; for the language of the
Psalmist implies, that those shall come to prostrate themselves before God, in
humble adoration, who shall have profited so far in meditation upon his works,
as that they shall have no more desire proudly and contemptuously to break forth
against him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This sense is more fully confirmed
by the reason</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa488</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is added in the following verse,
(28) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The kingdom is Jehovah's,
that he may rule over the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some
explain these words thus:- It is not to be wondered at if the Gentiles should be
constrained to yield honor to God, by whom they were created, and by whose hand
they are governed, although he has not entered into a covenant of life with
them. But I reject this as a meagre and unsatisfactory interpretation. This
passage, I have no doubt, agrees with many other prophecies which represent the
throne of God as erected, on which Christ may sit to superintend and govern the
world. Although, therefore, the providence of God is extended to the whole
world, without any part of it being excepted; yet let us remember that he then,
in very deed, exercises his authority, when having dispelled the darkness of
ignorance, and diffused the light of his word, he appears conspicuous on his
throne. We have such a description of his kingdom by the prophet
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He shall judge among the
nations, and shall rebuke many people."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
2:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, as God had not subdued the world to
himself, prior to the time when those who before were unconquerable were subdued
to a willing obedience by the preaching of the gospel, we may conclude that this
conversion was effected only under the management and government of Christ. If
it is objected, that the whole world has never yet been converted, the solution
is easy. A comparison is here made between that remarkable period in which God
suddenly became known every where, by the preaching of the gospel, and the
ancient dispensation, when he kept the knowledge of himself shut up within the
limits of Judea. Christ, we know, penetrated with amazing speed, from the east
to the west, like the lightning's flash, in order to bring into the Church the
Gentiles from all parts of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the fat ones of the earth
shall eat and worship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest it should be
thought inconsistent that now the fat ones of the earth are admitted as guests
to this banquet, which David seemed immediately before to have appointed only
for the poor, let us remember that the first place was given to the poor,
because to them principally comfort was set forth in the example of David. Yet
it was necessary, in the second place, that the rich and the prosperous should
be called to the feast, that they might not think themselves excluded from the
participation of the same grace. They are not, it is true, urged, by the
pressure of present calamities, to seek comfort for grief, but they have need of
a remedy to prevent them from intoxicating themselves with their delights, and
to excite them rather to lay up their joy in heaven. Again, since they also are
subject to a variety of troubles, their abundance will be a curse to them,
provided it keep their minds down to the earth. The amount of the Psalmist's
statement is, that this sacrifice will be common as well to those who are sound,
lusty, and in opulent circumstances, as to those who are lean, poor, and half
dead from the want of food; that the former, laying aside their pride, may
humble themselves before God, and that the latter, though they may be brought
low, may lift up their minds by spiritual joy to God, the author of all good
things, as James
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:9, 10) admonishes both classes, in these words, "Let the brother of low degree
rejoice in that he is exalted; but the rich in that he is made low." Now, if
God, under the law, joined the full with the hungry, the noble with the mean,
the happy with the wretched, much more ought this to take place at the present
day under the gospel. When, therefore, the rich hear that food is offered to
them elsewhere than in earthly abundance, let them learn to use the outward good
things which God has bestowed upon them for the purposes of the present life,
with such sobriety as that they may not be disgusted with spiritual food, or
turn away from it, through loathing. So long as they wallow in their own filth,
they will never long for this food with a holy desire; and although they may
have it at hand, they will never take pleasure in tasting
it.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa489</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Farther, as those who are fat must
become lean, in order that they may present themselves to God to be fed and
nourished, so David endeavors to inspire the famished with assured and undaunted
confidence, lest their poverty should hinder them from coming to the banquet.
Yea, he invites even the dead to come to the feast, in order that the most
despised, and those who, in the estimation of the world, are almost like
putrefying carcases, may be encouraged and emboldened to present themselves at
the holy table of the Lord. The change which the Psalmist makes in the number,
from the plural to the singular, in the end of the verse, somewhat obscures the
sense; but the meaning undoubtedly is, that those who seem already to be reduced
to dust, and whose restoration from death to life is, as it were, despaired of,
shall be partakers of the same grace with
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
22:30-31	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b> Their seed shall serve

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their seed shall serve

the benefit, he declares that it will be of such a character that posterity will
never forget it. And he shows how it will come to be perpetuated, namely,
because the conversion of the world, of which he has spoken, will not be for a
short time only but will continue from age to age. Whence we again conclude,
that what is here celebrated is not such a manifestation of the glory of God to
the Gentile nations as proceeds from a transitory and fading rumor, but such as
will enlighten the world with its beams, even to the end of time. Accordingly,
the perpetuity of the Church is here abundantly proved, and in very clear
terms:not that it always flourishes or continues in the same uniform course
through successive ages, but because God, unwilling that his name should be
extinguished in the world, will always raise up some sincerely to devote
themselves to his service. We ought to remember that this seed, in which the
service of God was to be preserved, is the fruit of the incorruptible seed; for
God begets and multiplies his Church only by means of his
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be registered to the Lord for
a generation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is explained in two ways.
Some take the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwd</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
dor, </i>for <i>a succession of ages, </i>and explain the clause thus:They shall
be registered to the Lord age after age. Others take it for <i>generation,
</i>in the sense in which the word <i>natio </i>[nation] is used in the Latin
tongue. As both these senses suit very well, and come almost to the same thing,
I leave my readers at liberty to choose between them. I am, however, I admit,
rather inclined to the opinion, that by this word is designated God's chosen
people and peculiar nation, which may be accounted the heritage of God. Farther,
as the name <i>Jehovah, </i>which is expressive of God's essence, is not here
used as it is a little before, but the word <i>Adonai, </i>I do not disapprove
of the opinion of those who think that Christ is here expressly invested with
authority over</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa491</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the Church, that he may register all
who shall give in their names as on the side of God his Father. And, indeed, as
our heavenly Father has committed all his chosen ones to the protection and
guardianship of his own Son, he acknowledges as his people none but those who
belong to the flock of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall come, and shall
declare.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here confirms what
I have previously stated, that since the fathers will transmit the knowledge of
this benefit to their children, as it were from hand to hand, the name of God
will be always renowned. From this we may also deduce the additional truth, that
it is by the preaching of the grace of God alone that the Church is kept from
perishing. At the same time, let it be observed, that care and diligence in
propagating divine truth are here enjoined upon us, that it may continue after
we are removed from this world. As the Holy Spirit prescribes it as a duty
incumbent on all the faithful to be diligent in instructing their children, that
there may be always one generation after another to serve God, the sluggishness
of those who have no scruple of conscience in burying the remembrance of God in
eternal silence, a sin with which those are virtually chargeable who neglect to
speak of him to their children, and who thus do nothing to prevent his name from
utterly perishing, is condemned as involving the greatest turpitude. The term
<i>righteousness, </i>in this place, refers to the faithfulness which God
observes in preserving his people, of which we have a memorable example in the
deliverance of David. In defending his servant from the violence and outrage of
the wicked, he proved himself to be righteous. Hence we may learn how dear our
welfare is to God, seeing he combines it with the celebration of the praise of
his own righteousness. If then the righteousness of God is illustriously
manifested in this, that he does not disappoint us of our hope, nor abandon us
in dangers, but defends and keeps us in perfect safety, there is no more reason
to fear that he will forsake us in the time of our need, than there is reason to
fear that he can forget himself. We must, however, remember that it is not for
any particular succor afforded to one individual, but it is for the redemption
of the human race, that the celebration of the praise of God is required from us
in this passage. In short, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, recommends to
us the publication of Christ's resurrection. In the end of this psalm some
commentators resolve the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, because, </i>into the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher, which, </i>as if it had been said, <i>The righteousness which he hath
done. </i>But the sentence will be fuller if we read, <i>because, </i>and
explain the passage thus:They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness,
because God shall have given proof, or demonstration, of his righteousness -
shall have afforded evidence by the effect, or the deed itself, that he is the
faithful guardian of his own people.</font><br></div>

23.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm is neither intermingled with prayers, nor
does it complain of miseries for the purpose of obtaining relief; but it
contains simply a thanksgiving, from which it appears that it was composed when
David had obtained peaceable possession of the kingdom, and lived in prosperity,
and in the enjoyment of all he could desire. That he might not, therefore, in
the time of his great prosperity, be like worldly men, who, when they seem to
themselves to be fortunate,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

luxuriously plunge themselves into their pleasures, he delights himself in God,
the author of all the blessings which he enjoyed. And he not only acknowledges
that the state of tranquillity in which he now lives, and his exemption from all
inconveniences and troubles, is owing to the goodness of God; but he also trusts
that through his providence he will continue happy even to the close of his
life, and for this end that he may employ himself in his pure

Jehovah is my shepherd.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although God, by
his benefits, gently allures us to himself, as it were by a taste of his
fatherly sweetness, yet there is nothing into which we more easily fall than
into a forgetfulness of him, when we are in the enjoyment of peace and comfort.
Yea, prosperity not only so intoxicates many, as to carry them beyond all bounds
in their mirth, but it also engenders insolence, which makes them proudly rise
up and break forth against God. Accordingly, there is scarcely a hundredth part
of those who enjoy in abundance the good things of God, who keep themselves in
his fear, and live in the exercise of humility and temperance, which would be so
becoming.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa495</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For this reason, we ought the more
carefully to mark the example which is here set before us by David, who,
elevated to the dignity of sovereign power, surrounded with the splendor of
riches and honors, possessed of the greatest abundance of temporal good things,
and in the midst of princely pleasures, not only testifies that he is mindful of
God, but calling to remembrance the benefits which God had conferred upon
him,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa496</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> makes them ladders by which he may
ascend nearer to Him. By this means he not only bridles the wantonness of his
flesh, but also excites himself with the greater earnestness to gratitude, and
the other exercises of godliness, as appears from the concluding sentence of the
psalm, where he says, "I<i> </i>shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for a length
of days." In like manner, in the 18th psalm, which was composed at a period of
his life when he was applauded on every side, by calling himself the servant of
God, he showed the humility and simplicity of heart to which he had attained,
and, at the same time, openly testified his gratitude, by applying himself to
the celebration of the praises of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Under the
similitude of a shepherd, he commends the care which God, in his providence, had
exercised towards him. His language implies that God had no less care of him
than a shepherd has of the sheep who are committed to his charge. God, in the
Scripture, frequently takes to himself the name, and puts on the character of a
shepherd, and this is no mean token of his tender love towards us. As this is a
lowly and homely manner of speaking, He who does not disdain to stoop so low for
our sake, must bear a singularly strong affection towards us. It is therefore
wonderful, that when he invites us to himself with such gentleness and
familiarity, we are not drawn or allured to him, that we may rest in safety and
peace under his guardianship. But it should be observed, that God is a shepherd
only to those who, touched with a sense of their own weakness and poverty, feel
their need of his protection, and who willingly abide in his sheepfold, and
surrender themselves to be governed by him. David, who excelled both in power
and riches, nevertheless frankly confessed himself to be a poor sheep, that he
might have God for his shepherd. Who is there, then, amongst us, who would
exempt himself from this necessity, seeing our own weakness sufficiently shows
that we are more than miserable if we do not live under the protection of this
shepherd? We ought to bear in mind, that our happiness consists in this, that
his hand is stretched forth to govern us, that we live under his shadow, and
that his providence keeps watch and ward over our welfare. Although, therefore,
we have abundance of all temporal good things, yet let us be assured that we
cannot be truly happy unless God vouchsafe to reckon us among the number of his
flock. Besides, we then only attribute to God the office of a Shepherd with due
and rightful honor, when we are persuaded that his providence alone is
sufficient to supply all our
necessities.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa497</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As those who enjoy the greatest
abundance of outward good things are empty and famished if God is not their
shepherd; so it is beyond all doubt that those whom he has taken under his
charge shall not want a full abundance of all good things. David, therefore,
declares that he is not afraid of wanting any thing, because God is his
Shepherd.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#732;br</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rabats, to lie down, </i>or <i>repose, </i>seems to have a reference to the
same thing. David has used the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the quiet
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to express gently flowing
waters; for rapid streams are inconvenient for sheep to drink in, and are also
for the most part hurtful. In this verse, and in the verses following, he
explains the last clause of the first verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall not
want.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He relates how abundantly God had
provided for all his necessities, and he does this without departing from the
comparison which he employed at the commencement. The amount of what is stated
is, that the heavenly Shepherd had omitted nothing which might contribute to
make him live happily under his care. He, therefore, compares the great
abundance of all things requisite for the purposes of the present life which he
enjoyed, to meadows richly covered with grass, and to gently flowing streams of
water; or he compares the benefit or advantage of such things to sheep-cots; for
it would not have been enough to have been fed and satisfied in rich pasture,
had there not also been provided waters to drink, and the shadow of the
sheep-cot to cool and refresh him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He restoreth my
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As it is the duty of a good
shepherd to cherish his sheep, and when they are diseased or weak to nurse and
support them, David declares that this was the manner in which he was treated by
God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The restoring of the
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as we have translated it, or
<i>the conversion of the soul, </i>as it is, literally rendered, is of the same
import as <i>to make anew, </i>or <i>to recover, </i>as has been already stated
in the 19th psalm, at the seventh verse. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the paths of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means easy and plain
paths.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa498</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As he still continues his metaphor, it
would be out of place to understand this as referring to the direction of the
Holy Spirit. He has stated a little before that God liberally supplies him with
all that is requisite for the maintenance of the present life, and now he adds,
that he is defended by him from all trouble. The amount of what is said is, that
God is in no respect wanting to his people, seeing he sustains them by his
power, invigorates and quickens them, and averts from them whatever is hurtful,
that they may walk at ease in plain and straight paths. That, however, he may
not ascribe any thing to his own worth or merit, David represents the goodness
of God as the cause of so great liberality, declaring that God bestows all these
things upon him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for his own
name's sake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And certainly his choosing
us to be his sheep, and his performing towards us all the offices of a shepherd,
is a blessing which proceeds entirely from his free and sovereign goodness, as
we shall see in the sixty-fifth psalm.<b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though I should
walk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>True believers, although they
dwell safely under the protection of God, are, notwithstanding, exposed to many
dangers, or rather they are liable to all the afflictions which befall mankind
in common, that they may the better feel how much they need the protection of
God. David, therefore, here expressly declares, that if any adversity should
befall him, he would lean upon the providence of God. Thus he does not promise
himself continual pleasures; but he fortifies himself by the help of God
courageously to endure the various calamities with which he might be visited.
Pursuing his metaphor, he compares the care which God takes in governing true
believers to a shepherd's staff and crook, declaring that he is satisfied with
this as all-sufficient for the protection of his life. As a sheep, when it
wanders up and down through a dark valley, is preserved safe from the attacks of
wild beasts and from harm in other ways, by the presence of the shepherd alone,
so David now declares that as often as he shall be exposed to any danger, he
will have sufficient defense and protection in being under the pastoral care of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We thus see how, in his prosperity, he
never forgot that he was a man, but even then seasonably meditated on the
adversities which afterwards might come upon him. And certainly, the reason why
we are so terrified, when it pleases God to exercise us with the cross, is,
because every man, that he may sleep soundly and undisturbed, wraps himself up
in carnal security. But there is a great difference between this sleep of
stupidity and the repose which faith produces. Since God tries faith by
adversity, it follows that no one truly confides in God, but he who is armed
with invincible constancy for resisting all the fears with which he may be
assailed.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa499</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet David did not mean to say that he
was devoid of all fear, but only that he would surmount it so as to go without
fear wherever his shepherd should lead him. This appears more clearly from the
context. He says, in the first place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will fear no
evil;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but immediately adding the reason
of this, he openly acknowledges that he seeks a remedy against his fear in
contemplating, and having his eyes fixed on, the staff of his
shepherd:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy staff and thy
crook comfort me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What need would he
have had of that consolation, if he had not been disquieted and agitated with
fear? It ought, therefore, to be kept in mind, that when David reflected on the
adversities which might befall him, he became victorious over fear and
temptations, in no other way than by casting himself on the protection of God.
This he had also stated before, although a little more obscurely, in these
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou art with me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This implies that he had been afflicted with
fear. Had not this been the case, for what purpose could he desire the presence
of God?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa500</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Besides, it is not against the common
and ordinary calamities of life only that he opposes the protection of God, but
against those which distract and confound the minds of men with the darkness of
death. For the Jewish grammarians think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twmlx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsalmaveth, </i>which we have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the shadow of
death,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a compound word, as if one
should say <i>deadly shade.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa501</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here makes an allusion to
the dark recesses or dens of wild beasts, to which when an individual approaches
he is suddenly seized at his first entrance with an apprehension and fear of
death. Now, since God, in the person of his only begotten Son, has exhibited
himself to us as our shepherd, much more clearly than he did in old time to the
fathers who lived under the Law, we do not render sufficient honor to his
protecting care, if we do not lift our eyes to behold it, and keeping them fixed
upon it, tread all fears and terrors under our
feet.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa502</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
23:5-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> Thou wilt prepare a table
before me in the presence of my persecutors: thou wilt anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows. <b>6.</b> Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the
days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for a length of
days.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thou wilt prepare.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words, which
are put in the future tense, here denote a continued act. David, therefore, now
repeats, without a figure, what he has hitherto declared, concerning the
beneficence of God, under the similitude of a shepherd. He tells us that by his
liberality he is supplied with all that is necessary for the maintenance of this
life. When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
preparest a table before me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means
that God furnished him with sustenance without trouble or difficulty on his
part, just as if a father should stretch forth his hand to give food to his
child. He enhances this benefit from the additional consideration, that although
many malicious persons envy his happiness, and desire his ruin, yea, endeavor to
defraud him of the blessing of God; yet God does not desist from showing himself
liberal towards him, and from doing him good. What he subjoins concerning
<i>oil, </i>has a reference to a custom which then prevailed. We know that in
old time, ointments were used at the more magnificent feasts, and no man thought
he had honourably received his guests if he had not perfumed them therewith.
Now, this exuberant store of <i>oil, </i>and also this overflowing <i>cup,
</i>ought to be explained as denoting the abundance which goes beyond the mere
supply of the common necessaries of life; for it is spoken in commendation of
the royal wealth with which, as the sacred historian records, David had been
amply furnished. All men, it is true, are not treated with the same liberality
with which David was treated; but there is not an individual who is not under
obligation to God by the benefits which God has conferred upon him, so that we
are constrained to acknowledge that he is a kind and liberal Father to all his
people. In the meantime, let each of us stir up himself to gratitude to God for
his benefits, and the more abundantly these have been bestowed upon us, our
gratitude ought to be the greater. If he is ungrateful who, having only a coarse
loaf, does not acknowledge in that the fatherly providence of God, how much less
can the stupidity of those be tolerated, who glut themselves with the great
abundance of the good things of God which they possess, without having any sense
or taste of his goodness towards them? David, therefore, by his own example,
admonishes the rich of their duty, that they may be the more ardent in the
expression of their gratitude to God, the more delicately he feeds them.
Farther, let us remember, that those who have greater abundance than others are
bound to observe moderation not less than if they had only as much of the good
things of this life as would serve for their limited and temperate enjoyment. We
are too much inclined by nature to excess; and, therefore, when God is, in
respect of worldly things, bountiful to his people, it is not to stir up and
nourish in them this disease. All men ought to attend to the rule of Paul, which
is laid down in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:12, that they "may know both how<i> </i>to be abased, and how to abound." That
want may not sink us into despondency, we need to be sustained by patient
endurance; and, on the other hand, that too great abundance may not elate us
above measure, we need to be restrained by the bridle of temperance.
Accordingly, the Lord, when he enriches his own people, restrains, at the same
time, the licentious desires of the flesh by the spirit of confidence, so that,
of their own accord, they prescribe to themselves rules of temperance. Not that
it is unlawful for rich men to enjoy more freely the abundance which they
possess than if God had given them a smaller portion; but all men ought to
beware, (and much more kings,) lest they should be dissolved in voluptuous
pleasures. David, no doubt, as was perfectly lawful, allowed himself larger
scope than if he had been only one of the common people, or than if he had still
dwelt in his father's cottage, but he so regulated himself in the midst of his
delicacies, as not at all to take pleasure in stuffing and fattening the body.
He knew well how to distinguish between the table which God had prepared for him
and a trough for swine. It is also worthy of particular notice, that although
David lived upon his own lands, the tribute money and other revenues of the
kingdom, he gave thanks to God just as if God had daily given him his food with
his own hand. From this we conclude that he was not blinded with his riches, but
always looked upon God as his householder, who brought forth meat and drink from
his own store, and distributed it to him at the proper
season.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely goodness and
mercy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having recounted the blessings
which God had bestowed upon him, he now expresses his undoubted persuasion of
the continuance of them to the end of his life. But whence proceeded this
confidence, by which he assures himself that the beneficence and mercy of God
will accompany him for ever, if it did not arise from the promise by which God
is accustomed to season the blessings which he bestows upon true believers, that
they may not inconsiderately devour them without having any taste or relish for
them? When he said to himself before, that even amidst the darkness of death he
would keep his eyes fixed in beholding the providence of God, he sufficiently
testified that he did not depend upon outward things, nor measured the grace of
God according to the judgment of the flesh, but that even when assistance from
every earthly quarter failed him, his faith continued shut up in the word of
God. Although, therefore, experience led him to hope well, yet it was
principally on the promise by which God confirms his people with respect to the
future that he depended. If it is objected that it is presumption for a man to
promise himself a continued course of prosperity in this uncertain and changing
world, I answer, that David did not speak in this manner with the view of
imposing on God a law; but he hoped for such exercise of God's beneficence
towards him as the condition of this world permits, with which he would be
contented. He does not say, My cup shall be always full, or, My head shall be
always perfumed with oil; but in general he entertains the hope that as the
goodness of God never fails, he will be favorable towards him even to the
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will dwell in the house
of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this concluding sentence
he manifestly shows that he does not confine his thoughts to earthly pleasures
or comforts; but that the mark at which he aims is fixed in heaven, and to reach
this was his great object in all things. It is as if he had said, I do not live
for the mere purpose of living, but rather to exercise myself in the fear and
service of God, and to make progress daily in all the branches of true
godliness. He makes a manifest distinction between himself and ungodly men, who
take pleasure only in filling their bellies with luxuriant fare. And not only
so, but he also intimates that to live to God is, in his estimation, of so great
importance, that he valued all the comforts of the flesh only in proportion as
they served to enable him to live to God. He plainly affirms, that the end which
he contemplated in all the benefits which God had conferred upon him was, that
he might dwell in the house of the Lord. Whence it follows, that when deprived
of the enjoyment of this blessing, he made no account of all other things; as if
he had said, I would take no pleasure in earthly comforts, unless I at the same
time belonged to the flock of God, as he also writes in another
place,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Why did he desire go greatly to frequent the temple,
but to offer sacrifices there along with his fellow-worshippers, and to improve
by the other exercises of religion in meditation upon the celestial life? It is,
therefore, certain that the mind of David, by the aid of the temporal prosperity
which he enjoyed, was elevated to the hope of the everlasting inheritance. From
this we conclude, that those men are brutish who propose to themselves any other
felicity than that which arises from drawing near to God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
24.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As God stands related to all mankind as their Creator
and Governor, David, from this consideration, magnifies the special favor which
God manifested towards the children of Abraham, in choosing them to be his
peculiar people, in preference to the rest of mankind, and in erecting his
sanctuary as his house that he might dwell among them. He shows, at the same
time, that although the sanctuary was open to all the Jews, God was not near to
all of them, but only to those who feared and served him in sincerity, and who
had cleansed themselves from the pollutions of the world, in order to devote
themselves to holiness and righteousness. Moreover, as the grace of God was more
clearly manifested after the temple was built, he celebrates that grace in a
strain of splendid poetry, to encourage true believers with the more alacrity to
persevere in the exercise of serving and honoring him.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of

therein:<b> 2.</b> For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
the floods. <b>3.</b> Who shall ascend unto the hill of Jehovah? who shall stand
in his holy place? <b>4.</b> He who is clean of hands, and pure of heart; who
hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The earth is
Jehovah's.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We will find in many other places
the children of Abraham compared with all the rest of mankind, that the free
goodness of God, in selecting them from all other nations, and in embracing them
with his favor, may shine forth the more conspicuously. The object of the
beginning of the psalm is to show that the Jews had nothing of themselves which
could entitle them to approach nearer or more familiarly to God than the
Gentiles. As God by his providence preserves the world, the power of his
government is alike extended to all, so that he ought to be worshipped by all,
even as he also shows to all men, without exception, the fatherly care he has
about them. But since he preferred the Jews to all other nations, it was
indispensably necessary that there should be some sacred bond of connection
between him and them, which might distinguish them from the heathen nations. By
this argument David invites and exhorts them to holiness. He tells them that it
was reasonable that those whom God had adopted as his children, should bear
certain marks peculiar to themselves, and not be altogether like strangers. Not
that he incites them to endeavor to prejudice God against others, in order to
gain his exclusive favor; but he teaches them, from the end or design of their
election, that they shall then have secured to them the firm and peaceful
possession of the honor which God had conferred upon them above other nations,
when they devote themselves to an upright and holy
life.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa504</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In vain would they have been collected
together into a distinct body, as the peculiar people of God, if they did not
apply themselves to the cultivation of holiness. In short, the Psalmist
pronounces God to be the King of the whole world, to let all men know that, even
by the law of nature, they are bound to serve him. And by declaring that he made
a covenant of salvation with a small portion of mankind, and by the erection of
the tabernacle, gave the children of Abraham the symbol of his presence, thereby
to assure them of his dwelling in the midst of them, he teaches them that they
must endeavor to have purity of heart and of hands, if they would be accounted
the members of his sacred family.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With respect
to the word <i>fullness</i>, I admit that under it all the riches with which the
earth is adorned are comprehended, as is proved by the authority of Paul; but I
have no doubt that the Psalmist intends by the expression men themselves, who
are the most illustrious ornament and glory of the earth. If they should fail,
the earth would exhibit a scene of desolation and solitude, not less hideous
than if God should despoil it of all its other riches. To what purpose are there
produced so many kinds of fruit, and in so great abundance, and why are there so
many pleasant and delightful countries, if it is not for the use and comfort of
men?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa505</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Accordingly, David explains, in the
following clause, that it is principally of men that he speaks. It is his usual
manner to repeat the same thing twice, and here <i>the fullness of the earth,
</i>and<i> the inhabitants of the world</i>, have the same meaning. I do not,
however, deny that the riches with which the earth abounds for the use of men,
are comprehended under these expressions. Paul, therefore,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461026&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:26) when discoursing concerning meats, justly quotes this passage
in support of his argument, maintaining that no kind of food is unclean,
because, "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness
thereof."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he hath founded it upon
the seas.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Psalmist here confirms the truth,
that men are rightfully under the authority and power of God, so that in all
places and countries they ought to acknowledge him as King. And he confirms it
from the very order manifested in the creation; for the wonderful providence of
God is clearly reflected in the whole face of the earth. In order to prove this,
he brings forward the proof of it, which is most evident. How is it that the
earth appears above the water, but because God purposely intended to prepare a
habitation for men? Philosophers themselves admit, that as the element of the
water is higher than the earth, it is contrary to the nature of the two
elements</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa506</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for any part of the earth to continue
uncovered with the waters, and habitable. Accordingly, Job
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;182811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
28:11, 25) extols, in magnificent terms, that signal miracle by which God
restrains the violent and tempestuous ragings of the sea, that it may not
overwhelm the earth, which, if not thus restrained, it would immediately do and
produce horrible confusion. Nor does Moses forget to mention this in the history
of the creation. After having narrated that the waters were spread abroad so as
to cover the whole earth, he adds, that by an express command of God they
retired into one place, in order to leave empty space for the living creatures
which were afterwards to be created,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:9) From that passage we learn that God had a care about men before they
existed, inasmuch as he prepared for them a dwelling-place and other
conveniences; and that he did not regard them as entire strangers, seeing he
provided for their necessities, not less liberally than the father of a family
does for his own children. David does not here dispute philosophically
concerning the situation of the earth, when he says, that <i>it
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has been founded upon the
seas</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He uses popular language, and adapts
himself to the capacity of the unlearned. Yet this manner of speaking, which is
taken from what may be judged of by the eye, is not without reason. The element
of earth, it is true, in so far as it occupies the lowest place in the order of
the sphere, is beneath the waters; but the habitable part of the earth is above
the water, and how can we account for it, that this separation of the water from
the earth remains stable, but because God has put the waters underneath, as it
were for a foundation? Now, as from the creation of the world, God extended his
fatherly care to all mankind, the prerogative of honor, by which the Jews
excelled all other nations, proceeded only from the free and sovereign choice by
which God distinguished them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall ascend
unto.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It being very well known that it was of
pure grace that God erected his sanctuary, and chose for himself a
dwelling-place among the Jews, David makes only a tacit reference to this
subject.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa507</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He insists principally on the other
point contained in the verse, that of distinguishing true Israelites from the
false and bastards. He takes the argument by which he exhorts the Jews to lead a
holy and righteous life from this, that God had separated them from the rest of
the world, to be his peculiar inheritance. The rest of mankind, it is true,
seeing they were created by him, belong to his empire; but he who occupies a
place in the church is more nearly related to him. All those, therefore, whom
God receives into his flock he calls to holiness; and he lays them under
obligations to follow it by his adoption. Moreover, by these words David
indirectly rebukes hypocrites, who scrupled not falsely to take to themselves
the holy name of God, as we know that they are usually lifted up with pride,
because of the titles which they take without having the excellencies which
these titles imply, contenting themselves with bearing only outside
distinctions;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa508</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yea, rather he purposely magnifies this
singular grace of God, that every man may learn for himself, that he has no
right of entrance or access to the sanctuary, unless he sanctify himself in
order to serve God in purity. The ungodly and wicked, it is true, were in the
habit of resorting to the tabernacle; and, therefore, God, by the Prophet
Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:12) reproaches them for coming unworthily into his courts, and wearing the
pavement thereof. But David here treats of those who may lawfully enter into
God's sanctuary. The house of God being holy, if any rashly, and without a
right, rush into it, their corruption and abuse are nothing else but polluting
it. As therefore they do not go up thither lawfully, David makes no account of
their going up; yea, rather, under these words there is included a severe
rebuke, of the conduct of wicked and profane men, in daring to go up into the
sanctuary, and to pollute it with their impurity. On this subject I have spoken
more fully on the 15th psalm. In the second part of the verse he seems to denote
perseverance, as if he had said, Who shall go up into the hill of Sion, to
appear and stand in the presence of God? The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kum</i>, it is true, sometimes signifies <i>to rise up</i>, but it is
generally taken for <i>to stand</i>, as we have seen in the first psalm. And
although this is a repetition of the same idea, stated in the preceding clause,
it is not simply so, but David, by expressing the end for which they ought to go
up, illustrates and amplifies the subject; and this repetition and amplification
we find him often making use of in other psalms. In short, how much soever the
wicked were mingled with the good in the church, in the time of David, he
declares how vain a thing it is to make an external profession unless there be,
at the same time, truth in the inward man. What he says concerning the
tabernacle of the covenant must be applied to the continual government of the
church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who is clean of hands, and
pure of heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Under the purity of the hands
and of the heart, and the reverence of God's name, he comprehends all religion,
and denotes a well ordered life. True purity, no doubt, has its seat in the
heart, but it manifests its fruits in the works of the hands. The Psalmist,
therefore, very properly joins to a pure heart the purity of the whole life; for
that man acts a ridiculous part who boasts of having a sound heart, if he does
not show by his fruits that the root is good. On the other hand, it will not
suffice to frame the hands, feet, and eyes, according to the rule of
righteousness, unless purity of heart precede outward continence. If any man
should think it absurd that the first place is given to the hands, we answer
without hesitation, that effects are often named before their causes, not that
they precede them in order, but because it is sometimes advantageous to begin
with things which are best known. David, then, would have the Jews to bring into
the presence of God pure hands, and these along with an unfeigned heart.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To lift
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or <i>to take his soul</i>, I have no doubt
is here put for to swear. It is, therefore, here required of the servants of
God, that when they swear, they do it with reverence and in good
conscience,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa509</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, under one particular, by
synecdoche, is denoted the duty of observing fidelity and integrity in all the
affairs of life. That mention is here made of oaths, appears from the words
which immediately follow, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
hath not sworn deceitfully</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which are added as
explanatory of what goes before. As, however, there is a twofold reading of the
Hebrew word for soul, that is to say, as it may be read, <i>my soul</i>, or
<i>his soul</i>, on account of the point <i>hirek</i>, some Jewish commentators
read, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath not lifted up my
soul to
vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa510</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and understand the word <i>my</i> as
spoken of God, an exposition which I reject as harsh and strained. It is a
manner of speaking which carries in it great emphasis, for it means, that those
who swear offer their souls as pledges to God. Some, however, may perhaps prefer
the opinion, that <i>to lift up the soul</i>, is put for <i>to apply it to
lying</i>, an interpretation to the adoption of which I have no great objection,
for it makes little difference as to the sense. A question may here be raised
&#8212; it may be asked, why David does not say so much as one word concerning
faith and calling upon God. The reason of this is easily explained. As it seldom
happens that a man behaves himself uprightly and innocently towards his
brethren, unless he is so endued with the true fear of God as to walk
circumspectly before him, David very justly forms his estimate of the piety of
men towards God by the character of their conduct towards their fellow-men. For
the same reason, Christ
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:23) represents judgment, mercy, and faith, as the principal points of the
law; and Paul calls "charity" at one time "the end of the law,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:5) and at another "the bond of perfection"

	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall receive
blessing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The more effectually to move the
minds of the Israelites, David declares that nothing is more desirable than to
be numbered among the flock of God, and to be members of the church. We must
here consider that there is an implied contrast between true Israelites and
those of them who were degenerate and bastards. The more license the wicked give
themselves, the more presumptuous are they in pretending to the name of God, as
if he were under obligation to them, because they are adorned with the same
outward symbols or badges as true believers. Accordingly, the demonstrative
pronoun <i>this</i>, in the following verse, is of great weight, for it
expressly excludes all that bastard generation which gloried only in the mask of
external ceremonies. And in this verse, when he speaks of blessing, he intimates
that it is not those who boast of being the servants of God, while they have
only the name, who shall be partakers of the promised <i>blessing</i>, but those
only who answer to their calling with their whole heart, and without hypocrisy.
It is, as we have already observed, a very powerful inducement to godliness and
an upright life, when the faithful are assured that they do not lose their labor
in following righteousness, since God has in reserve for them a blessing which
cannot fail them. The word <i>righteousness</i> may be explained two ways. It
either means all the benefits of God, by which he proves himself to be righteous
and faithful towards his people in keeping his promises to them, or it denotes
the fruit or reward of the believer's righteousness. Indeed, David's meaning is
abundantly manifest. He intends to show on the one hand, that it is not to be
expected that the fruit or reward of righteousness will be bestowed on those who
unrighteously profane God's sacred worship; and on the other hand, that it is
impossible for God to disappoint his true worshippers; for it is his peculiar
office to give evidence of his righteousness by doing them
good.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
generation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I have just now observed, that by
the demonstrative pronoun <i>this</i>, the Psalmist erases from the catalogue of
the servants of God all counterfeit Israelites, who, trusting only to their
circumcision and the sacrifices of beasts, have no concern about offering
themselves to God; and yet, at the same time, they rashly thrust themselves into
the church. Such persons may pretend to have delight in the service of God, by
often coming to his temple, but they have no other design than to withdraw
themselves from him as far as they can. Now, as nothing was more common in the
mouths of each of them than to say, that they all belonged to the holy seed, the
Psalmist has limited the name of holy generation to the true observers of the
law; as if he had said, All who have sprung from Abraham, according to the
flesh, are not, on that account, his legitimate children. It is, no doubt, truly
said in many other places, as we shall see in Psalm 27, that those sought the
face of God who, to testify their godliness, exercised themselves in the
ceremonies before the ark of the covenant; that is to say, if they were brought
thither by a pure and holy affection. But as hypocrites seek God externally in a
certain way, as well as true saints, while yet they shun him by their windings
and false pretences,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa512</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David here declares that God is not
sought in truth unless there go before a zealous cultivation of holiness and
righteousness. To give the sentence greater emphasis, he repeats it, using the
second person, and addressing his discourse to
God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa513</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is as if he summoned before the
judgment-seat of God hypocrites, who account it nothing falsely to use the name
of God before the world; and he thus teaches us, that whatever they may say in
their empty talk among men, the judgment of God will be a very different matter.
He adds the word Jacob, for the confirmation of the same doctrine putting it for
those who were descended from Jacob; as if he had said, Although circumcision
distinguishes all the seed of Jacob according to the flesh from the Gentiles,
yet we can only distinguish the chosen people by the fear and reverence of God,
as Christ said, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lift up your heads, O ye
gates!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The magnificent and splendid
structure of the temple, in which there was more outward majesty than in the
tabernacle, not being yet erected, David here speaks of the future building of
it. By doing this, he encourages the pious Israelites to employ themselves more
willingly, and with greater confidence, in the ceremonial observances of the
law. It was no ordinary token of the goodness of God that he condescended to
dwell in the midst of them by a visible symbol of his presence, and was willing
that his heavenly dwelling-place should be seen upon earth. This doctrine ought
to be of use to us at this day; for it is an instance of the inestimable grace
of God, that so far as the infirmity of our flesh will permit, we are lifted up
even to God by the exercises of religion. What is the design of the preaching of
the word, the sacraments, the holy assemblies, and the whole external government
of the church, but that we may be united to God? It is not, therefore, without
good reason that David extols so highly the service of God appointed in the law,
seeing God exhibited himself to his saints in the ark of the covenant, and
thereby gave them a certain pledge of speedy succor whenever they should invoke
him for aid. God, it is true, "dwelleth not in temples made with hands," nor
does he take delight in outward pomp; but as it was useful, and as it was also
the pleasure of God, that his ancient people, who were rude, and still in their
infancy, should be lifted up to him by earthly elements, David does not here
hesitate to set forth to them, for the confirmation of their faith, the
sumptuous building of the temple, to assure them that it was not a useless
theater; but that when they rightly worshipped God in it, according to the
appointment of his word, they stood as it were in his presence, and would
actually experience that he was near them. The amount of what is stated is, that
in proportion as the temple which God had commanded to be built to him upon
mount Sion, surpassed the tabernacle in magnificence, it would be so much the
brighter a mirror of the glory and power of God dwelling among the Jews. In the
meantime, as David himself burned with intense desire for the erection of the
temple, so he wished to inflame the hearts of all the godly with the same ardent
desire, that, aided by the rudiments of the law, they might make more and more
progress in the fear of God. He terms the <i>gates</i>, <i>everlasting</i>,
because the promise of God secured their continual stability. The temple
excelled in materials and in workmanship, but its chief excellence consisted in
this, that the promise of God was engraven upon it, as we shall see in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14, "This is my rest for ever." In terming the gates <i>everlasting</i>, the
Psalmist, at the same time, I have no doubt, makes a tacit contrast between the
tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle never had any certain abiding place,
but being from time to time transported from one place to another, was like a
wayfaring man. When, however, mount Sion was chosen, and the temple built, God
then began to have there a certain and fixed place of abode. By the coming of
Christ, that visible shadow vanished, and it is therefore not wonderful that the
temple is no longer to be seen upon mount Sion, seeing it is now so great as to
occupy the whole world. If it is objected, that at the time of the Babylonish
captivity the gates which Solomon had built were demolished, I answer, God's
decree stood fast, notwithstanding that temporary overthrow; and by virtue of
it, the temple was soon after rebuilt; which was the same as if it had always
continued entire. The Septuagint has from ignorance corrupted this
passage.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa514</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y&ccedil;ar</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rashim</i>, which we have rendered <i>heads</i>, is no doubt sometimes taken
metaphorically for <i>princes</i>; but the word <i>your</i>, which is here
annexed to it, sufficiently shows that we cannot draw from it another sense than
this &#8212; that the gates lift up their heads, otherwise we must say, Your
princes. Some, therefore, think that kings and magistrates are here admonished
of their duty, which is to open up the way, and give entrance to God. This is a
plausible interpretation, but it is too much removed from the design and words
of the prophet. Above all, from the natural sense of the words, we may perceive
how foolishly and basely the Papists have abused this passage for the
confirmation of the gross and ridiculous notion by which they introduce Christ
as knocking at the gate of the infernal regions, in order to obtain
admission.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa515</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us, therefore, learn from this, to
handle the holy word of God with sobriety and reverence, and to hold Papists in
detestation, who, as it were, make sport of corrupting and falsifying it in this
manner, by their execrable impieties.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa516</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is this King of glory?
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The praises by which the power of God is
here magnified are intended to tell the Jews that he did not sit idle in his
temple, but took up his abode in it, in order to show himself ready to succor
his people. It is to be observed, that there is great weight both in the
interrogation, and in the repetition of the same sentence. The prophet assumes
the person of one who wonders thereby to express with greater effect that God
comes armed with invincible power to maintain and save his people, and to keep
the faithful in safety under his shadow. We have already said, that when God is
spoken of as dwelling in the temple, it is not to be understood as if his
infinite and incomprehensible essence had been shut up or confined within it;
but that he was present there by his power and grace, as is implied in the
promise which he made to Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"In all places where I
record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
20:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That this was no vain and empty promise, but that God
truly dwelt in the midst of the people, is what the faithful experienced who
sought him not superstitiously, as if he had been fixed to the temple, but made
use of the temple and of the service which was performed in it for elevating
their hearts to heaven. The amount of what is stated is, that whenever the
people should call upon God in the temple, it would manifestly appear, from the
effect which would follow, that the ark of the covenant was not a vain and an
illusory symbol of the presence of God, because he would always stretch forth
his omnipotent arm for the defense and protection of his people. The repetition
teaches us that true believers cannot be too constant and diligent in meditation
on this subject. The Son of God, clothed with our flesh, has now shown himself
to be <i>King of glory</i> and <i>Lord of hosts</i>, and he is not entered into
his temple only by shadows and figures, but really and in very deed, that he may
dwell in the midst of us. There is, therefore, nothing to hinder us from
boasting that we shall be invincible by his power. Mount Sion, it is true, is
not at this day the place appointed for the sanctuary, and the ark of the
covenant is no longer the image or representation of God dwelling between the
cherubim; but as we have this privilege in common with the fathers, that, by the
preaching of the word and the sacraments, we may be united to God, it becomes us
to use these helps with reverence; for if we despise them by a detestable pride,
God cannot but at length utterly withdraw himself from us.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
25.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm consists of meditations mingled with
prayers. Being rudely treated, and grievously distressed, by the cruelty of his
enemies, David, in order to obtain assistance from God, first acknowledges that
God had justly made use of this as a means of chastising and punishing him for
his sins; and, therefore, he prays for their forgiveness, that he may at once
enjoy assurance of the divine favor, and obtain deliverance. He then implores
the aid of the Holy Spirit, that, sustained by it, he might, even in the midst
of so many temptations, continue in the fear of God. And in various places he
intermingles meditation, as the means of stirring up himself to increased
confidence in God, and of withdrawing his thoughts from the allurements of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of

have lifted up my soul <b>2.</b> O my God! I have put my trust in thee; let me
not be ashamed; let not mine enemies rejoice over me. <b>3.</b> Yea, none of
those that wait on thee shall be ashamed; but they shall be ashamed that deal
falsely without cause.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto thee, O Jehovah!
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist declares at the very
outset, that he is not driven hither and thither, after the manner of the
ungodly, but that he directs all his desires and prayers to God alone. Nothing
is more inconsistent with true and sincere prayer to God, than to waver and gaze
about as the heathen do, for some help from the world; and at the same time to
forsake God, or not to betake ourselves directly to his guardianship and
protection. Those who imagine that David here declares that he had devoted
himself entirely to God, as if he had offered up himself in sacrifice, do not
properly understand the import of the passage. The meaning rather is, that in
order to strengthen the hope of obtaining his request, he declares, what is of
the greatest importance in prayer, that he had his hope fixed in God, and that
he was not ensnared by the allurements of the world, or prevented from lifting
up his soul fully and unfeignedly to God. In order, therefore, that we may pray
aright to God, let us be directed by this rule &#8212; not to distract our minds
by various and uncertain hopes, nor to depend on worldly aid, but to yield to
God the honor of lifting up our hearts to him in sincere and earnest prayer.
Moreover, although the verb is properly rendered, <i>I will lift up, </i>yet I
have followed other interpreters in changing it into the past tense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have lifted
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the future tense, however, David
denotes a continued act.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my God! I have put my trust
in thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this verse we learn, (what
will appear more clearly afterwards,) that David had to do with men; but as he
was persuaded that his enemies were, as it were, the scourges of God, he with
good reason asks that God would restrain them by his power, lest they should
become more insolent, and continue, to exceed all bounds. By the word <i>trust
</i>he confirms what he had just said of the lifting up of his soul to God; for
the term is employed either as descriptive of the way in which the souls of the
faithful are lifted up, or else faith and hope are added as the cause of such an
effect, namely, the lifting up of the soul. And, indeed, these are the wings by
which our souls, rising above this world, are lifted up to God. David, then, was
carried upward to God with the whole desire of his heart, because, trusting to
his promises, he thereby hoped for sure salvation. When he asks
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God would not suffer him to
be put to shame</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he offers up a prayer
which is taken from the ordinary doctrine of Scripture, namely, that they who
trust in God shall never be ashamed. The reason which is added, and which he
here pleads, to induce God to have pity upon him, ought also to be noticed. It
is this, that he might not be exposed to the derision of his enemies, whose
pride is no less hurtful to the feelings of the godly than it is displeasing to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, none of those,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If these words should be explained
in the form of a desire, as if David had said, Let none who wait on thee be put
to shame,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa517</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> then, in this verse, he continues his
prayer, and extends to all the faithful in common what he had spoken of himself
alone. But I am rather inclined to understand the words in a different sense,
and to view them as meaning that David shows the fruit of divine grace which
should proceed from his deliverance. And there is peculiar force in the word
<i>yea; </i>for as he knew that he was seen by many, and that the report of his
confidence in God was widely spread, his meaning is, that what shall be done in
his person shall extend far and wide, as an example to others, and shall have
the effect of reviving and animating all the children of God,<i> </i>on the one
hand, and of casting to the ground the arrogance of the wicked, on the other.
The words might also be understood in another sense, namely, that David, for the
strengthening of his faith, sets before himself a promise which God frequently
makes in his word. But the sense in which I have interpreted them seems to be
more suitable. By the wicked </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
deal falsely without cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he no doubt
means especially his enemies. Accordingly, he declares that when he is delivered
he will not enjoy exclusively the benefit of it; but that its fruit shall extend
to all true believers; just as on the other hand, the faith of many would have
been shaken if he had been forsaken of God. In the last clause of the verse,
which he puts in opposition to the first, he argues that when the wicked lie
confounded, it redounds to the glory of God, because the vaunting in which they
indulge in their prosperity is an open mockery of God, while, in despite of his
judgment, they break forth more boldly in doing evil. When he adds, <i>without
cause, </i>it only tends to show the aggravated nature of the offense. The
wickedness of a man is always the more intolerable, when, unprovoked by wrongs,
he sets himself, of his own accord, to injure the innocent and
blameless.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
25:4-7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> O Jehovah! make me to know

for thou art the God of my salvation: I have waited for thee all the day.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the ways of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>David sometimes means, as we have
seen in another place, the happy and prosperous issue of affairs, but more
frequently he uses this expression to denote the rule of a holy and righteous
life. As the term <i>truth </i>occurs in the immediately following verse, the
prayer which he offers up in this place is, in my opinion, to this effect:Lord,
keep thy servant in the firm persuasion of thy promises, and do not suffer him
to turn aside to the right hand or to the left. When our minds are thus composed
to patience, we undertake nothing rashly or by improper means, but depend wholly
upon the providence of God. Accordingly, in this place David desires not merely
to be directed by the Spirit of God, lest he should err from the right way, but
also that God would clearly manifest to him his truth and faithfulness in the
promises of his word, that he might live in peace before him, and be free from
all impatience.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa518</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If any one would rather take the words
in a general sense, as if David committed himself wholly to God to be governed
by him, I do not object to it. As, however, I think it probable, that, under the
name of <i>truth </i>in the next verse, he explains what he means by the ways
and paths of God, of which he here speaks, I have no hesitation in referring the
prayer to this circumstance, namely, that David, afraid of yielding to the
feeling of impatience, or the desire of revenge, or some extravagant and
unlawful impulse, asks that the promises of God may be deeply impressed and
engraven on his heart. For I have said before, that as long as this thought
prevails in our minds, that God takes care of us, it is the best and most
powerful means for resisting temptations. If, however, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the ways and paths of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>any would rather understand his
doctrine, I, nevertheless, still hold this as a settled point, that in the
language of the Psalmist there is an allusion to those sudden and irregular
emotions which arise in our minds when we are tossed by adversity, and by which
we are precipitated into the devious and deceitful paths of error, till they are
in due time subdued or allayed by the word of God. Thus the meaning is, Whatever
may happen, suffer me not, O Lord, to fall from thy ways, or to be carried away
by a wilful disobedience to thy authority, or any other sinful desire; but
rather let thy truth preserve me in a state of quiet repose and peace, by an
humble submission to it. Moreover, although he frequently repeats the same
thing, asking that God would make him to know his ways, and teach him in them,
and lead him in his truth, there is no redundancy in these forms of speech. Our
adversities are often like mists which darken the eyes; and every one knows from
his own experience how difficult a thing it is, while these clouds of darkness
continue, to discern in what way we ought to walk. But if David, so
distinguished a prophet and endued with so much wisdom, stood in need of divine
instruction, what shall become of us if, in our afflictions, God dispel not from
our minds those clouds of darkness which prevent us from seeing his light? As
often, then, as any temptation may assail us, we ought always to pray that God
would make the light of his truth to shine upon us, lest, by having recourse to
sinful devices, we should go astray, and wander into devious and forbidden
paths.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the same time, we ought to observe the
argument which David here employs to enforce his prayer. By calling God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of his
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does so in order to
strengthen his hope in God for the future, from a consideration of the benefits
which he had already received from him; and then he repeats the testimony of his
confidence towards God. Thus the first part of the argument is taken from the
nature of God himself, and the duty which, as it were, belongs to him; that is
to say, because he engages to maintain the welfare of the godly, and aids them
in their necessities, on this ground, that he will continue to manifest the same
favor towards them even to the end. But as it is necessary that our confidence
in God should correspond to his great goodness towards us, David alleges it, at
the same time, in connection with a declaration of his perseverance. For, by the
expression <i>all the day, </i>or <i>every day, </i>he signifies that with a
fixed and untiring constancy he depended upon God alone. And, doubtless, it is
the property of faith always to look to God, even in the most trying
circumstances, and patiently to wait for the aid which he has promised. That the
recollection of the divine blessings may nourish and sustain our hope, let us
learn to reflect upon the goodness which God has already manifested towards us,
as we see that David did in making this the ground of his confidence, that he
had found in his own personal experience God to be the author of
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember, O
Jehovah;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this it appears, in the
first place, that David was grievously afflicted and tried, so much so that he
had lost all sense of God's mercy:for he calls upon God to remember for him his
favor, in such a manner as if he had altogether forgotten it. This, therefore,
is the complaint of a man suffering extreme anguish, and overwhelmed with grief.
We may learn from this, that although God, for a time, may withdraw from us
every token of his goodness, and, apparently regardless of the miseries which
afflict us, should, as if we were strangers to him, and not his own people,
forsake us, we must fight courageously, until, set free from this temptation, we
cordially present the prayer which is here recorded, beseeching God, that,
returning to his former manner of dealing, he would again begin to manifest his
goodness towards us, and to deal with us in a more gracious manner. This form of
prayer cannot be used with propriety, unless when God is hiding his face from
us, and seems to take no interest at all in us. Moreover David, by having
recourse to the mercy or compassion and goodness of God, testifies that he
trusts not to his own merit as any ground of hope. He who derives every thing
from the fountain of divine mercy alone, finds nothing in himself entitled to
recompense in the sight of God. But as the intermission which David had
experienced was an obstacle which prevented his free access to God, he rises
above it, by the very best remedy &#8212; the consideration, that although God,
who from his very nature is merciful, may withdraw himself, and cease for a time
to manifest his power, yet he cannot deny himself; that is to say, he cannot
divest himself of the feeling of mercy which is natural to him, and which can no
more cease than his eternal existence. But we must firmly maintain this
doctrine, that God has been merciful even from the beginning, so that if at any
time he seem to act with severity towards us, and to reject our prayers, we must
not imagine that he acts contrary to his real character, or that he has changed
his purpose. Hence we learn for what end it is that the Scriptures every where
inform us, that in all ages God has regarded his servants with a benignant eye,
and exercised his mercy towards them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa519</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This, at least, we ought to regard as a
fixed and settled point, that although the goodness of God may sometimes be
hidden, and as it were buried out of sight, it can never be
extinguished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember not the sins of my
youth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As our sins are like a wall
between us and God,<i> </i>which prevents him from hearing our prayers, or
stretching forth his hand to help us, David now removes this obstruction. It is
indeed true, in general, that men pray in a wrong way, and in vain, unless they
begin by seeking the forgiveness of their sins. There is no hope of obtaining
any favor from God unless he is reconciled to us. How shall he love us unless he
first freely reconcile us to himself? The right and proper order of prayer
therefore is, as I have said, to ask, at the very outset, that God would pardon
our sins. David here acknowledges, in explicit terms, that he cannot in any
other way become a partaker of the grace of God than by having his sins blotted
out. In order, therefore, that God may be mindful of his mercy towards us, it is
necessary that he forget our sins, the very sight of which turns away his favor
from us. In the meantime, the Psalmist confirms by this more clearly what I have
already said, that although the wicked acted towards him with cruelty, and
persecuted him unjustly, yet he ascribed to his own sins all the misery which he
endured. For why should he ask the forgiveness of his sins, by having recourse
to the mercy of God, but because he acknowledged, that by the cruel treatment he
received from his enemies, he only suffered the punishment which he justly
merited? He has, therefore, acted wisely in turning his thoughts to the first
cause of his misery, that he may find out the true remedy; and thus he teaches
us by his example, that when any outward affliction presses upon us, we must
entreat God not only to deliver us from it, but also to blot out our sins, by
which we have provoked his displeasure, and subjected ourselves to his
chastening rod. If we act otherwise, we shall follow the example of unskilful
physicians, who, overlooking the cause of the disease, only seek to alleviate
the pain, and apply merely adventitious remedies for the cure. Moreover, David
makes confession not only of some slight offenses, as hypocrites are wont to do,
who, by confessing their guilt in a general and perfunctory manner, either seek
some subterfuge, or else extenuate the enormity of their sin; but he traces back
his sins even to his very childhood, and considers in how many ways he had
provoked the wrath of God against him. When he makes mention of the sins which
he had committed in his youth, he does not mean by this that he had no
remembrance of any of the sins which he had committed in his later years; but it
is rather to show that he considered himself worthy of so much the greater
condemnation.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa520</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the first place, considering that he
had not begun only of late to commit sin, but that he had for a long time heaped
up sin upon sin, he bows himself, if we may so speak, under the accumulated
load; and, in the second place, he intimates, that if God should deal with him
according to the rigour of law, not only the sins of yesterday, or of a few
days, would come into judgment against him, but all the instances in which he
had offended, even from his infancy, might now with justice be laid to his
charge. As often, therefore, as God terrifies us by his judgments and the tokens
of his wrath, let us call to our remembrance, not only the sins which we have
lately committed, but also all the transgressions of our past life, proving to
us the ground of renewed shame and renewed lamentation. Besides, in order to
express more fully that he supplicates a free pardon, he pleads before God only
on the ground of his mere good pleasure; and therefore he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to thy compassion do
thou remember me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When God casts our
sins into oblivion, this leads him to behold us with fatherly regard. David can
discover no other cause by which to account for this paternal regard of God, but
that he is good, and hence it follows that there is nothing to induce God to
receive us into his favor but his own good pleasure. When God is said to
remember us according to his mercy, we are tacitly given to understand that
there are two ways of remembering which are entirely opposite; the one when he
visits sinners in his wrath, and the other when he again manifests his favor to
those of whom he seemed for a time to take no
account.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
25:8-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> Good and upright is

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Good and upright is
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Pausing for a little as it were
in the prosecution of his prayer, he exercises his thoughts in meditation upon
the goodness of God, that he may return with renewed ardor to prayer. The
faithful feel that their hearts soon languish in prayer, unless they are
constantly stirring themselves up to it by new incitements; so rare and
difficult a thing is it to persevere steadfastly and unweariedly in this duty.
And, indeed, as one must frequently lay on fuel in order to preserve a fire, so
the exercise of prayer requires the aid of such helps, that it may not languish,
and at length be entirely extinguished. David, therefore, desirous to encourage
himself to perseverance, speaks to himself, and affirms that God is <i>good and
upright, </i>that, gathering new strength by meditating on this truth, he may
return with the more alacrity to prayer. But we must observe this consequence
&#8212; that as God is good and upright, he stretches forth his hand <i>to
sinners </i>to bring them back again into <i>the way. </i>To attribute to God an
uprightness which he may exercise only towards the worthy and the meritorious,
is a cold view of his character, and of little advantage to sinners, and yet the
world commonly apprehends that God is good in no other sense. How comes it to
pass that scarcely one in a hundred applies to himself the mercy of God, if it
is not because men limit it to those who are worthy of it? No on the contrary,
it is here said, that God gives a proof of his uprightness when he shows to
transgressors the way; and this is of the same import as to call them to
repentance, and to teach them to live uprightly. And, indeed, if the goodness of
God did not penetrate even to hell, no man would ever become a partaker of it.
Let the Papists then boast as they please of their imaginary preparations, but
let us regard this as a sure and certain doctrine, that if God do not prevent
men by his grace, they shall all utterly perish. David, therefore, here commends
this preventing grace, as it is called, which is manifested either when God in
calling us at first renews, by the Spirit of regeneration, our corrupt nature,
or when he brings us back again into the right way, after we have gone astray
from him by our sins. For since even those whom God receives for his disciples
are here called sinners, it follows that he renews them by his Holy Spirit that
they may become docile and
obedient.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will guide the poor in
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here specifies
the second manifestation of his grace which God makes towards those who, being
subdued by his power, and brought under his yoke, bear it willingly, and submit
themselves to his government. But never will this docility be found in any man,
until the heart, which is naturally elated and filled with pride, has been
humbled and subdued. As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anavim, </i>denotes the <i>poor </i>or <i>afflicted, </i>and is employed in a
metaphorical sense, to denote <i>the meek and humble, </i>it is probable that
David, under this term, includes the afflictions which serve to restrain and
subdue the frowardness of the flesh, as well as the grace of humility itself; as
if he had said, When God has first humbled them, then he kindly stretches forth
his hand to them, and leads and guides them throughout the whole course of their
life. Moreover, some understand these terms,<i> judgment </i>and <i>way of the
Lord, </i>as denoting a righteous and well ordered manner of life. Others refer
them to the providence of God, an interpretation which seems more correct, and
more agreeable to the context, for it is immediately added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the ways of Jehovah are mercy
and truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning therefore is,
that those who are truly humbled in their hearts, and brought to place their
confidence in God, shall experience how much care he has for his
children,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa522</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and how well he provides for their
necessities. The terms, <i>judgment </i>and <i>way of the Lord, </i>therefore,
are simply of the same import in this place as his government, in the exercise
of which he shows that he, as a kind father, has a special interest in the
welfare of his children, by relieving them when they are oppressed, raising them
up when cast down, cheering and comforting them when sorrowful, and succouring
them when afflicted. We perceive, then, by what order God proceeds in the
manifestation of his grace towards us. First, he brings us again into the way
when we are wandering and going astray from him, or rather, when we are already
fugitives and exiles from him, he restrains our frowardness; and whereas we were
before froward and rebellious, he now subdues us to the obedience of his
righteousness:and, secondly, after he has afflicted and tried us, he does not
forsake us; but after he has moulded and trained us by the cross to humility and
meekness, he still shows himself to be a wise and provident father in guiding
and directing us through life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the ways of

interpreted by those who think that the doctrine of the law is here described as
true and sweet, and that those who keep it feel it indeed to be so, as if this

Christ,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Such an interpretation is not only strained, but may
also be easily disproved by many similar passages in which the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The ways of the Lord,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is taken in a passive signification, for the
paternal manner in which he acts towards those who are his people, in defending
and cherishing them; nay, even for his whole conduct in the government and
direction of the affairs of this world. The amount of what is said is, that God
acts in such a manner towards his people, as that, in all respects, they may
find from experience that he is merciful and faithful. David is not here
speaking of the character in which God acts towards mankind in general, but what
his own children find him to be. We have already seen in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:26, that he is stern and severe towards the obstinate and rebellious; and
even though he act with kindness towards them, in mercifully exercising
forbearance towards them notwithstanding their iniquity, yet we find, that so
far from seeking their full enjoyment in him, and trusting to his promises, they
have no sense of his goodness. Nay, as soon as any adversity befalls them, they
either become passionate and fretful, accuse God of acting cruelly towards them,
or else complain that he is deaf to their prayers; and when they enjoy
prosperity, they despise and neglect him, and as much as they are able flee from
his presence. David, therefore, in speaking of the <i>mercy </i>and
<i>faithfulness </i>of God, justly describes them as a treasure peculiar to the
godly; as if he had said, We have no reason to be afraid that God will deceive
us if we persevere in his covenant. These words, <i>covenant </i>and
<i>testimony, </i>are of the same import, unless that the second is added as an
explanation of the first. They comprehend the whole doctrine of the law, by
which God enters into covenant with his chosen
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy name's sake, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As in the original text the
copulative <i>and </i>is inserted between the two clauses of this verse, some
think that the first clause is incomplete, and that some word ought to be
supplied; and then they read these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be thou merciful to mine
iniquity, etc.,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as a distinct sentence
by itself. And thus, according to their opinion, the sense would be, Lord,
although I have not fully kept thy covenant, yet do not on that account cease to
show thy kindness towards me; and that mine iniquity may not prevent thy
goodness from being extended towards me, do thou graciously pardon it. But I am
rather of the opinion of others, who consider that the copulative is here, as it
is in many other places, superfluous, so that the whole verse may form one
connected sentence. As to the tense of the verb, there is also a diversity of
opinion among interpreters. Some render it in the past tense thus, <i>Thou hast
been merciful, </i>as if David here renders thanks to God because he had
pardoned his sin. But the other interpretation, which is the one more generally
received, is also the most correct, namely, that David, in order to obtain
pardon, again resorts to the mercy of God as his only refuge. The letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau, </i>which is equivalent to <i>and, </i>has often the force of changing
the tense in the Hebrew verbs, so that the future tense is often taken in the
sense of the optative. Moreover, I connect this verse with the preceding one in
this way:The prophet, having reflected upon this, that God is kind and faithful
to those who serve him, now examines his own heart, and acknowledges that he
cannot be accounted of their number, unless God grant unto him the forgiveness
of his sins; and, therefore, he betakes himself to prayer for pardon:as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
19:13, after having spoken of the reward which is laid up for the faithful who
keep the law, he instantly exclaims, "Who can understand his errors?"
Accordingly, although David is not ignorant that God promises liberally to
bestow upon those who keep his covenant every thing which pertains to a life of
happiness, yet, at the same time, considering how far he is as yet from the
perfect righteousness of the law, he does not rest his confidence upon it, but
seeks a remedy for the manifold offenses of which he feels himself to be guilty.
And thus, in order that God may reckon us of the number of his servants, we
ought always to come to him, entreating him, after the example of David, in his
fatherly loving-kindness, to bear with our infirmities, because, without the
free remission of our sins, we have no reason to expect any reward of our works.
At the same time, let it be observed, that in order to show more distinctly that
he depends entirely upon the free grace of God, he expressly says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for thy name's
sake</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>meaning by this, that God, as
often as he vouchsafes to pardon his people, does so from no other cause than
his own good pleasure; just as he had said a little before, in the same verse,
<i>for thy goodness' sake. </i>He was also constrained, by a consideration of
the magnitude of his offense, to call upon the name of God:for he immediately
adds, by way of confession,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because mine iniquity is
great</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>manifold, </i>(for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">br</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rab, </i>may be translated in both ways;) as if he had said, My sins are,
indeed, like a heavy burden which overwhelms me, so that the multitude or
enormity of them might well deprive me of all hope of pardon; but, Lord, the
infinite glory of thy name will not suffer thee to cast me
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

character in which God manifests himself towards his servants, he derives new
strength and courage. For we have said, that nothing more readily occurs than a
relaxation in earnest and attentive prayer, unless it be sustained by the
recollection of God's promises. There can, however, be no doubt, that David both
accuses himself, and by entertaining a better hope, takes encouragement to
continue in the fear of God. In the first place, by intimating that men are
destitute of right understanding and sound judgment, because they yield not
themselves to be governed by God with reverence and fear, he imputes it to his
own indolence, that by reason of the darkness of his mind, he had wandered so
far astray after his own lusts; and yet, on the other hand, he promises himself
the guidance and direction of the Holy Spirit, if he only yield himself wholly
to God, and show that he is willing to learn. Moreover, the interrogatory style
of speaking, which he here employs, seems designed to show how few there are who
fear God:for, although all men in general pray, and manifest some appearance of
piety, yet where is there one among so many who is really in earnest? Instead of
this, almost all men indulge themselves in their own drowsiness. The fear of
God, therefore, is very rare; and on this account it is that the world, for the
most part, continues destitute of the Spirit of counsel and
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some interpreters render the word
<i>choose </i>in the present tense, instead of the future, <i>shall choose;
</i>as if it had been said, that God shows the way which he approves, and in
which he wishes men to walk. With this interpretation I cannot agree; for, in my
judgment, the word <i>choose </i>rather refers to every individual; as if it had
been said, Provided we are disposed to fear God,<i> </i>he will not be wanting
on his part, but will always direct us by the Spirit of wisdom to choose the
right way. When we are called upon to adopt some particular course in life, we
find ourselves as it were placed between two ways, and know not which of them to
follow;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa524</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nay, in almost all our affairs we are
held in suspense and doubt, unless God appear to show us the way. David
therefore says, that although men know not what is right, and what they ought to
choose, yet provided they submit to God with pious docility of mind, and are
willing to follow him, he will always manifest himself towards them as a sure
and faithful guide. As, however, the fear of God is not naturally in us, it were
foolish for any man to argue from this place, that God does not begin to take
care of men until, by their own previous efforts, they insinuate themselves into
his favor, that he may aid them in their pious endeavors. David has just
declared, that this grace comes directly from God, when he says that God teaches
the transgressors:and now he adds, in the second place, that after men have once
been subdued and moulded to meekness of spirit, God still takes them under his
charge, guiding and directing them till they are able, by the illumination of
the Holy Spirit, to know what is their
duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His soul shall dwell in

consists in undertaking or attempting nothing except by the warrant of God, it
follows that it is also a high and incomparable benefit to have him for our
conductor and guide through life, that we may never go astray. But, in addition
to this, an earthly blessing is here promised, in which the fruit of the
preceding grace is distinctly shown, as Paul also teaches,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Godliness is profitable
unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to

Timothy 4:8,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is, that those who truly serve God are not
only blessed as to spiritual things, but are also blessed by him as to their
condition in the present life. It is indeed true, that God does not always deal
with them according to their desires, and that the blessings which they would
wish do not always flow in a certain and uniform manner. On the contrary, it
often happens that they are tossed with sickness and trouble, whilst the wicked
enjoy prosperity. But we must know, that as often as God withdraws his blessing
from his own people, it is for the purpose of awakening them to a sense of their
condition, and discovering to them how far removed they still are from the
perfect fear of God. And yet, in so far as it is expedient for them, they now
enjoy the blessings of God, so that, in comparison of worldly men, and the
despisers of God, they are truly happy and blessed, because, even in their
greatest poverty, they never lose the assurance that God is present with them;
and being sustained by this consolation, they enjoy peace and tranquillity of
mind. It is indeed true, that all our miseries proceed from this one source
&#8212; that by our sins we prevent the divine blessing from flowing down in a
uniform course upon us; and yet, amidst such a state of confusion, his grace
never ceases to shine forth, so that the condition of the godly is always better
than that of others:for although they are not satiated with good things, yet
they are continually made to experience a sense of the fatherly favor of God.
And to this I am willing to refer the word <i>soul, </i>namely, that, in the
reception of the gifts of God, they do not devour them without feeling a sense
of their sweetness, but really relish them, so that the smallest competency is
of more avail to satisfy them than the greatest abundance is to satisfy the
ungodly. Thus, according as every man is contented with his condition, and
cheerfully cherishes a spirit of patience and tranquillity, his soul is said
<i>to dwell in good. </i>Some interpreters apply this word <i>to dwell </i>or
<i>abide </i>to the time of death; but this interpretation is more subtle than
solid. The inspired penman rather speaks, as we have already said, of the
condition of the present life.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa525</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He adds, in the second place, by way of
illustration, that the posterity of the faithful
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall inherit the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and from this it follows, that God
continues to extend his favor towards them. Hence we may again infer, that the
death of God's servants does not imply their utter destruction, and that they do
not cease to exist when they pass out of this world, but continue to live for
ever. It would be absurd to suppose that God would totally deprive of life those
for whose sake he does good even to others. As to what is here said, that the
children of the saints shall inherit the land, it has been touched upon
elsewhere, and it will be shown still more fully on the thirty-seventh Psalm, in
what respects, and how this is
accomplished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The counsel of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here confirms what
he had just said in a preceding verse, namely, that God will faithfully
discharge the office of a teacher and master to all the godly; and, after his
usual manner, he repeats the same sentiment twice in the same verse for the
<i>covenant of God </i>is nothing else than his <i>secret </i>or <i>counsel.
</i>By the use of the term <i>secret, </i>he means to magnify and extol the
excellency of the doctrine which is revealed to us in the law of God. However
much worldly men, through the pride and haughtiness of their hearts, despise
Moses and the prophets, the faithful nevertheless acknowledge, that in the
doctrine which they contain, the secrets of heaven, which far surpass the
comprehension of man, are revealed and unfolded. Whoever, therefore, desires to
derive instruction from the law, let him regard with reverence and esteem the
doctrine which it contains. We are, farther, by this place admonished to
cultivate the graces of meekness and humility, lest, in reliance upon our own
wisdom, or trusting to our own understanding, we should attempt, by our own
efforts, to comprehend those mysteries and secrets, the knowledge of which David
here declares to be the prerogative of God alone. Again, since the fear of the
Lord is said to be the beginning, and as it were the way that leads to a right
understanding of his will,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
111:10,) according as any one desires to increase in faith, so also let him
endeavor to advance in the fear of the Lord. Moreover, when piety reigns in the
heart, we need have no fear of losing our labor in seeking God. It is indeed
true, that the covenant of God is a secret which far exceeds human
comprehension; but as we know that he does not in vain enjoin us to seek him, we
may rest assured that all those who endeavor to serve him with an upright desire
will be brought, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, to the knowledge of that
heavenly wisdom which is appointed for their salvation. But, in the meantime,
David indirectly rebukes those who falsely and groundlessly boast that they are
interested in the covenant of God, while they rest merely in the letter of the
law, and have no saving impressions of the fear of God. God, it is true,
addresses his word indiscriminately to the righteous and the wicked; but men do
not comprehend it, unless they have sincere piety; just as
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:11, says, that as regards the ungodly, the law is like "a book that is
sealed." And, therefore, it is no wonder that there is here made a distinction
between those who truly serve God, and to whom he makes known his secret, and
the wicked or hypocrites. But when we see David in this confidence coming boldly
to the school of God, and leading others along with him, let us know, as he
clearly shows, that it is a wicked and hateful invention to attempt to deprive
the common people of the Holy Scriptures, under the pretense of their being a
hidden mystery; as if all who fear him from the heart, whatever their state or
condition in other respects may be, were not expressly called to the knowledge
of God's covenant.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mine eyes are continually
towards Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here speaks of
his own faith, and of its perseverance, not in the way of boasting, but to
encourage himself in the hope of obtaining his requests, so that he might give
himself the more readily and cheerfully to prayer. As the promise is made to all
who trust in God, that they shall not be disappointed of their hope, and that
they shall never be put to shame, the saints often make this their shield of
defense. Meanwhile, David shows to others, by his own example, the right manner
of prayer, telling them that they should endeavor to keep their thoughts fixed
upon God. As the sense of sight is very quick, and exercises an entire influence
over the whole frame, it is no uncommon thing to find all the affections denoted
by the term <i>eyes. </i>The reason which immediately follows shows still more
plainly, that in the mind of David hope was associated with desire; as if he had
said, That in resting his confidence in the help of God, he did so, not in doubt
or uncertainty, but because he was persuaded that he would be his deliverer. The
pronoun <i>He, </i>it ought to be observed, is also emphatic. It shows that
David did not gaze around him in every direction, after the manner of those who,
being in uncertainty, devise for themselves various methods of deliverance and
salvation, but that he was contented with God
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

suggest to our minds that God has forgotten us, when he ceases to manifest his
power in aiding us, David here follows the order which nature dictates, in
asking God to have respect unto him, as if he had altogether neglected him
before. Now, it appears to me that the words might be explained thus:Have
respect unto me, in order to pity me. He accounts it at once the cause and the
source of his salvation to be regarded of God; and then he adds the effect of
it:for as soon as God, of his own good pleasure, shall vouchsafe to regard us,
his hand also will be ready to help us. Again, in order to excite the compassion
of God, he sets forth his own misery, expressly stating that he is <i>alone,
</i>that is to say, <i>solitary;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa528</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then he describes himself as
<i>poor. </i>There can be no doubt that, in speaking thus, he alludes to the
promises in which God declares that he will be always present with the afflicted
and oppressed, to aid and help them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The troubles of my heart are
enlarged.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse he acknowledges
not only that he had to contend outwardly with his enemies and the troubles
which they occasioned him, but that he was also afflicted inwardly with sorrow
and anguish of heart. It is also necessary to observe the manner of expression
which he here employs, and by which he intimates that the weight and number of
his trials had accumulated to such an extent that they filled his whole heart,
even as a flood of waters bursting every barrier, and extending far and wide,
covers a whole country. Now, when we see that the heart of David had sometimes
been wholly filled with anguish, we need no longer wonder if at times the
violence of temptation overwhelm us; but let us ask with David, that even whilst
we are as it were at the point of despair, God would succor
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look upon mine
affliction.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By repeating these
complaints so frequently, he plainly shows that the calamities with which he was
assailed were not some slight and trivial evils. And this ought to be carefully
marked by us, so that when trials and afflictions shall have been measured out
to us after the same manner, we may be enabled to lift up our souls to God in
prayer; for the Holy Spirit has set before our view this representation, that
our minds may not fail us under the multitude or weight of afflictions. But in
order to obtain an alleviation of these miseries, David again prays that his
sins may be pardoned, recalling to his recollection what he had already stated,
that he could not expect to enjoy the divine favor, unless he were first
reconciled to God by receiving a free pardon. And, indeed, they are very
insensible who, contented with deliverance from bodily affliction, do not search
out the evils of their own hearts, that is to say, their sins, but as much as in
them lies rather desire to have them buried in oblivion. To find a remedy,
therefore, to his cares and sorrows, David begins by imploring the remission of
his sins, because, so long as God is angry with us, it must necessarily follow,
that all our affairs shall come to an unhappy termination; and he has always
just ground of displeasure against us so long as our sins continue, that is to
say, until he pardons them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa529</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And although the Lord has various ends
in view in bringing his people under the cross, yet we ought to hold fast the
principle, that as often as God afflicts us, we are called to examine our own
hearts, and humbly to seek reconciliation with
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold mine
enemies.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse David complains
of the number and cruelty of his enemies, because the more the people of God are
oppressed, the more is he inclined to aid them; and in proportion to the
magnitude of the danger by which they are surrounded, he assists them the more
powerfully. The words, <i>hatred of
violence,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa530</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are here to be understood of a
cruel and sanguinary hatred. Now, as the rage of David's enemies was so great,
that nothing short of his death would satisfy them, he calls upon God to become
the guardian and protector of his life; and from this it may be inferred, as I
have already said, that he was now placed in extreme danger. The clause which
immediately follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may
not be ashamed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be understood in two
ways. Some retain the future tense, <i>I shall not be ashamed, </i>as if David
felt assured that he was already heard by God, and as the reward of his hope
promised himself a gracious answer to his prayers. I am rather inclined to the
opposite opinion &#8212; to consider these words as still forming a part of his
prayer. The amount of what is stated therefore is, that as he trusts in God, he
prays that the hope of salvation which he had formed might not be disappointed.
There is nothing better fitted to impart a holy ardor to our prayers, than when
we are able to testify with sincerity of heart that we confide in God. And,
therefore, it behoves us to ask with so much the greater care, that he would
increase our hope when it is small, awaken it when it is dormant, confirm it
when it is wavering, strengthen it when it is weak, and that he would even raise
it up when it is overthrown.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let integrity and uprightness
preserve me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some are of opinion, that
in these words David simply prays that he may be preserved from all mischief, on
the ground that he had conducted himself inoffensively towards others, and had
abstained from all deceit and violence. Others make the words to contain a
twofold subject of prayer, and understand them as including at the same time a
desire that God would bestow upon him a sincere and upright purpose of heart;
and all this lest he should break forth into revenge, and other unlawful means
of preserving his life. Thus the meaning would be:Lord, although my flesh may
urge me to seek relief from whatever quarter it may appear, and mine enemies
also may constrain me to it by their importunity, yet do thou subdue within me
every sinful passion, and every perverse desire, so that I may always exercise
over my mind a pure and entire control; and let integrity and uprightness
suffice as two powerful means of preserving me. We prefer the first
interpretation, because he immediately subjoins a proof of his integrity.
Whosoever waits upon God with a meek and quiet spirit, will rather suffer any
thing which men can inflict, than allow himself to contend unrighteously with
his enemies. In my opinion, therefore, David protests that such was the
rectitude of his behavior amongst men, that the persecution of his enemies was
wholly unmerited and unjust; and being conscious of having given no offense to
any, he calls upon God as the protector of his innocence. But as he has already,
in three different places, acknowledged that he was justly visited with
affliction, it may seem strange that he should now glory in his integrity. This
apparent inconsistency has already been explained in another place, where we
have shown that the saints, in respect of themselves, always come into the
presence of God with humility, imploring his forgiveness:and yet this does not
prevent them from setting forth before him the goodness of their cause, and the
justice of their claims. At the same time, in saying that he <i>trusted
</i>in<i> </i>God, he only states what indeed is essentially necessary; for, in
undertaking our defense, it is not enough that we have justice on our side,
unless depending upon his promises, we rely with confidence upon his protection.
It often happens, that men of firmness and prudence, even when their cause is
good, do not always succeed in its defense, because they confide in their own
understanding, or rely upon fortune. In order, therefore, that God may become
the protector and defender of our innocence, let us first conduct ourselves
uprightly and innocently towards our enemies, and then commit ourselves entirely
to his protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do thou, O God! redeem
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this conclusion David shows
of what character the enemies were of whom he complained. From this it would
appear that they were domestic enemies, who, like some disease raging within the
bowels, were now the cause of trouble and vexation to the people of God. By the
word <i>redeem, </i>which he here employs, we may infer that the Church was at
that time oppressed with hard bondage; and, therefore, I have no doubt that in
this psalm he alludes to Saul and others who reigned with him in a tyrannical
manner. At the same time, he shows that he has respect not merely to his own
benefit, but that he comprehends in his prayer the state of the whole realm,
just as the mutual communion and connection which subsist among the saints
require that every individual, deeply affected by a sense of the public
calamities which befall the Church at large, should unite with all the others in
lamentation before God. This contributed in no small degree to confirm the faith
of David, when, regarding himself as in all things connected with the whole body
of the faithful, he considered that all the afflictions and wrongs which he
endured were common to himself with them. And we ought to regard it as of the
greatest importance, that in accordance with this rule, every one of us, in
bewailing his private miseries and trials, should extend his desires and prayers
to the whole Church.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
26.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm, for the most part, is similar to the
preceding. The prophet, oppressed with numerous wrongs, and finding no succor in
the world, implores the aid of God, entreating him to undertake the cause of a
man unrighteously afflicted, and to assert his innocence. And as his contest was
with hypocrites, he appeals to the judgment of God, sharply reproving them for
making a false profession of God's name. In the conclusion, as if he had
obtained his wish, he promises a sacrifice of praise to God for his
deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of
David.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
26:1-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Judge me, O Jehovah!
because I have walked in mine integrity, and trusted in Jehovah, I shall not
stumble. <b>2.</b> Prove me, O Jehovah! and try me; search my reins and my
heart. <b>3.</b> For thy goodness is before mine eyes: I have therefore walked
in thy truth. <b>4.</b> I have not sat with vain men, neither will I walk with
deceitful men.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judge me, O Jehovah!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">I have just said, that David betakes himself to
the judgment of God, because he found neither equity nor humanity among men. The
Hebrew word which is rendered to <i>judge, </i>signifies to undertake the
cognisance of a cause. The meaning here, therefore, is as if David called upon
God to be the defender of his right.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa531</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When God leaves us for a time to the
injuries and petulance of our enemies, he seems to neglect our cause; but when
he restrains them from assailing us at their pleasure he clearly demonstrates
that the defense of our cause is the object of his care. Let us, therefore,
learn from the example of David, when we are destitute of man's aid, to have
recourse to the judgment-seat of God, and to rely upon his protection. The
clause which follows is variously explained by interpreters. Some read it in
connection with the first clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judge me, O Jehovah! because I
have walked in mine integrity;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but
others refer it to the last clause, <i>Because I have walked in mine integrity,
therefore I shall not stumble. </i>In my opinion, it may be properly connected
with both. As it is the proper work of God to maintain and defend righteous
causes, the Psalmist, in constituting him his defender, summons him as the
witness of his integrity and trust, and thus conceives the hope of obtaining his
aid. If, on the other hand, any one thinks that the clauses should be separated,
it seems most probable that this sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge me, O
Lord!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>should be read by itself; and then
that the second prayer should follow,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God would not allow him to
stumble, because he had behaved himself inoffensively and
uprightly,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> etc. </i>But there is a force in
the possessive pronoun <i>my, </i>which interpreters have overlooked. For David
does not simply aver that he had been upright, but that he had constantly
proceeded in an upright course, without being driven from his purpose, however
powerful the devices by which he had been assailed. When wicked men attack us
with a view to overwhelm us, either by force or fraud, we know how difficult it
is to preserve always the same fortitude. We place our hope of victory in
endeavoring resolutely and vigorously to oppose force to force, and art to art.
And this is a temptation which so much the more affects honest and steady men,
who are otherwise zealous to do well, when the cruelty of their enemies compels
them to turn aside from the right path. Let us, therefore, learn from the
example of David, even when an opportunity of injuring our enemies is offered
us, and when by various methods they force and provoke us, to remain firm in our
course, and not suffer ourselves to be diverted in any manner from persevering
in the path of our integrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prove
me,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa532</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The more that David observed
himself basely and undeservedly pursued with calumnies, the more powerfully was
he excited by the vehemence of his grief fearlessly to assert his rectitude. Nor
does he merely clear himself of outward sins; he glories also in the uprightness
of his heart, and the purity of its affections, tacitly comparing himself, at
the same time, with his enemies. As they were gross hypocrites, proudly boasting
of their reverence for God, he lays open before him their shameless effrontery
and hardihood. This protestation, too, shows how intimately acquainted he was
with himself, when he durst offer to submit the whole recesses of his heart to
the examination of God. It is to be observed, however, that it was the
wickedness of his enemies which forced him to commend himself so much. Had he
not been unjustly condemned by men, he would have humbly deprecated such an
examination, as he well knew, notwithstanding his zeal to act aright, that he
was far from perfection. But when he felt himself to be falsely accused, the
injustice and cruelty of men emboldened him to appeal to God's judgment-seat
without hesitation. And as he knew that an external appearance of innocence was
of no avail there, he brings forward the honest uprightness of his heart. The
distinction which some make here, that <i>the heart </i>signifies the higher
affections, and <i>the reins </i>those that are sensual (as they term them) and
more gross, is more subtle than solid. We know that the Hebrews understood by
the term <i>reins </i>that which is most secret in men. David, therefore,
conscious of his innocence, offers the whole man to the examination of God; not
like careless, or rather stupid men, who, flattering themselves, imagine that
they will deceive God with their pretences. It is evident, on the contrary, that
he had honestly and thoroughly searched himself, before he presented himself
with such confidence in the divine presence. And this we must especially bear in
mind, if we would desire to obtain the approbation of God, that when unjustly
persecuted, we must not only abstain from retaliation, but also persevere in a
right spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy goodness is before
mine eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse may be viewed as
one sentence, or divided into two parts, but with almost the same sense. If the
former reading is adopted, both the verbs will be emphatic, after this
manner:"Because<i> </i>thy goodness, O Lord, has been ever before mine eyes, and
I have trusted in thy faithfulness, I have restrained all wicked lusts in my
heart, lest, provoked by the malice of mine enemies, I should be forced to
retaliate." By this interpretation there would be the rendering of a cause. The
other exposition, also, is not unsuitable, namely, "Because thy goodness has
been before mine eyes, I have walked in the truth which thou commandest." In
this case the conjunction, as is common among the Hebrews, is superfluous. But
although this exposition is allied to the former, I would rather prefer one less
remote from the words. As it is a rare and difficult virtue, not only to refrain
one's self from wicked actions, when greatly tempted thereto, but also to
preserve integrity of heart; the prophet declares in what manner he pursued his
course in the midst of such powerful temptations, telling us that it was by
setting the goodness of God, which so carefully preserves his servants, before
his eyes, lest, declining to evil practices, he might deprive himself of his
protection; and by confiding in his faithfulness, he possessed his soul in
patience, firmly persuaded that God would never forsake his faithful people who
trusted in him. And certainly, had he not relied upon the goodness of God, he
could not have so constantly prosecuted the path of integrity amidst such
numerous and such severe assaults. It is, indeed, a remarkable difference
between the children of God and worldly men, that the former, in the hope of a
favorable issue at the Lord's hand, rely upon his word, and are not driven by
restlessness to mischievous practices; while the latter, although they maintain
a good cause, yet because they are ignorant of the providence of God, are
hurried hither and thither; follow unlawful counsels; betake themselves to
craftiness; and, in short, have no other object than to overcome evil with evil.
Whence, accordingly, their miserable and sorrowful, and often their tragical
ends, but because, despising the favor of God, they give themselves up to
cunning and deceit? In short, David was steady in preserving his uprightness,
because he had resolved that God should be his guide. In the first place,
<i>therefore, </i>he mentions his <i>goodness, </i>and afterwards he adds, his
<i>truth, </i>because his goodness, which enables us to walk with unyielding
courage in the midst of all temptations, is only known to us by his
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I have not sat with vain men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again
declares the very great dissimilarity which existed between him and his
adversaries. For the contrast is always to be observed, that wicked men, by all
the harm and mischief they wrought against him, could never drive him from the
path of rectitude. This verse might likewise be joined with the former, as if
completing the sentence, in this way, That David, by confiding in the favor of
God, had withdrawn himself from deceivers. The words, <i>sitting </i>and
<i>walking, </i>denote <i>sharing in counsel and fellowship in working,
</i>according to what is said in the first psalm. David denies that he had any
intercourse with vain and deceitful men. And certainly the best remedy to recall
and save us from the assembly of the wicked is to fix our eyes upon God's
goodness; for he who walks in the confidence of God's protection, committing all
events to his providence, will never imitate their deceitfulness. Those whom he
denominates in the first clause, <i>men of vanity, </i>he soon after terms
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yml[n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>na&auml;lamim, </i>that is, <i>close and wrapped up in
craftiness.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa533</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For in this consists the vanity
of dissimulation, that deceitful men conceal in their hearts another thing than
that which their tongues declare. It is, however, absurd to derive this word
from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;l[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
alam, to play, </i>for it is out of place here to compare their impostures to
children's play. I confess, indeed, that those who give themselves to craftiness
are mockers; but why have recourse to such a forced exposition, when it is plain
that the word shows the source from which all lying and deceit proceed? Thus
faith, which steadily looks to God's promises, is aptly opposed to all the
crooked and iniquitous counsels in which unbelief involves us as often as we
ascribe not proper honor to the guardianship of God. David teaches, by his own
example, that we have not the slightest cause to fear that our integrity will
make us a prey to the ungodly, when God promises us safety under his hand. The
children of God, indeed, are prudent, but their prudence is altogether different
from that of the flesh. Under the guidance and government of the Holy Spirit,
they take every necessary precaution against snares, but in such a manner as not
to practice any craftiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I hate the

how greatly he abhorred the ungodly. Formerly he denied that he had any
fellowship with them; now he still more explicitly declares that he fled from
their company with loathing, for that is the meaning of the phrase, <i>I hate.
</i>It is indeed true, that the wicked are everywhere hated; but how few
withdraw themselves from them, that they may not imitate their vices! David
asserts both; he tells us that he hated their society, and that he had no
communion with them, from which it appears that he warred not so much with their
persons as with their evil doings. He mentions also as another qualification,
that he shunned the wicked in such a manner as not on that account to forsake
the congregation of God, or withdraw himself from the company of those with whom
he was commanded by divine appointment to associate. Many err in this way
grievously; imagining when they see the evil mingled with the good, that they
will be infected with pollution, unless they immediately withdraw themselves
from the whole congregation. This preciseness drove the Donatists of old, and
prior to them the Cathari and the Novatians, into mischievous schisms. In our
own times, too, the Anabaptists, from a similar conceit, have separated
themselves from the sacred assemblies, because they reckoned them not so free
from all defilement as could have been wished. Moreover, the Donatists made
themselves a laughing-stock in a certain process, by tenaciously clinging to
mere words. When an assembly was held to settle dissensions, and they were
invited by the president of the meeting, with a view to do honor to them, to
take a seat, they replied, they would stand, because it was not lawful to "sit
with the wicked." Why then, wittily replied Augustine, did your conscience
permit you to come in amongst us? for the one is written as well as the other,
<i>I will not go in to the wicked, neither will I sit with the ungodly.
</i>David, therefore, prudently moderates his zeal, and while separating himself
from the ungodly, ceases not to frequent the temple, as the divine commandment
and the order prescribed in the law required. When he denominates them <i>the
assembly </i>of the ungodly, we may unquestionably conclude, that their number
was not few; nay, it is probable that they flaunted about at that time, as if
they alone were exalted above the people of God, and were lords over them:yet
this did not prevent David from coming as usual to the sacrifices. Public care,
indeed, is to be used that the Church be not defiled by such wickedness, and
every man ought privately to endeavor, in his own place, that his <i>remissness
</i>and forbearance do not cherish the disorders which these vices occasion.
Although, however, this strictness should not be exercised with that care which
is necessary, there is nothing in this to hinder any of the faithful from
piously and holily remaining in the fellowship of the Church. It is to be
observed, in the meantime, that what retained David, was his communion with God
and with sacred things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will wash my hands in
purity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Referring, in these words, to
the ordinary use of the sacrifices, he makes a distinction between himself and
those who professed to offer the same divine worship, and thrust themselves
forward in the services of the sanctuary, as if they alone had the sole right to
perform them. As David, therefore, and these hypocrites were one in this
respect, that they entered the sanctuary, and surrounded the sacred altar
together, he proceeds to show that he was a true worshipper, declaring, that he
not only diligently attended to the external rites, but came to worship God with
unfeigned devotion. It is obvious that he alludes to the solemn rite of washing
which was practiced under the law.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa535</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He, accordingly, reproves the gross
superstition of hypocrites, who in seeking only the purification of water,
neglected true purification; whereas it was God's design, in the appointment of
the outward sign, to put men in mind of their inward pollution, and thus to
encourage them to repentance. The outward washing alone, instead of profiting
hypocrites, kept them at a greater distance from God. When the Psalmist,
therefore, says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will wash my
hands in innocence,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates that
they only gather more pollution and filth by their washings. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nikkayon, </i>signifies the cleanness of any thing, and is figuratively used
for <i>innocence. </i>We thus see, that as hypocrites derive no moral purity
whatever from their washings, David mocks at the labor with which they vainly
toil and torment themselves in such rites. However high, therefore, the wicked
may be exalted in the Church, and though crowds of them should fill our
sanctuaries, let us, after the example of David, celebrate the outward
profession of our faith in such a manner as not deceitfully to substitute its
external rites in the room of true devotion. Thus shall we be pure and free from
all stain of wickedness. Moreover, as the people were not permitted to touch the
altar, David uses the word
<i>encompass.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa536</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may make men to hear,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words, he shows that he
referred the sacrifices to their proper use and design, which hypocrites were
far from doing. They neither know, nor do they consider, for what purpose God
appointed the services of worship, but think it sufficient to thrust themselves
into the divine presence with the pomp and form of their dissimulation. David,
therefore, wishing to distinguish spiritual worship from that which is
fictitious and counterfeit, affirms that he came into the sanctuary to set forth
the praise of God's name. There is, however, a synecdoche in his words, as only
one kind of worship is mentioned, although, in offering the sacrifices, the
exercise of repentance and faith was required, as well as the giving of thanks.
But as the ultimate design of the sacrifices, or at least their principal object
was to celebrate the goodness of God in thus acknowledging his blessings, there
was no impropriety in comprehending the other parts of worship under this. Thus,
in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
50:14, the sacrifice of praise is preferred to all external ceremonies, as if
the whole of devotion consisted in it alone. Likewise in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:12, it is said, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits? I
will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord." Moreover,
that he may the better commend the acknowledged power of God, and more
impressively extol his benefits, David employs the phrase <i>wondrous; </i>as if
he had said, that it was in no ordinary way that God had helped
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
26:8-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> O Jehovah! I have loved
the habitation of thy house,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

maliciousness, and their right hand is full of bribes. <b>11.</b> But I will

me.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! I have loved,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this verse he confirms what he had said
before, that he came not into the sanctuary in a careless manner, but with
serious devotion. Irreligious men, although they often resort to the sacred
assemblies, frequent them merely as lurking places, where they may escape the
eye of God. On the contrary, the truly pious and pure in heart resort to them,
not for the sake of vain ostentation, but as they are sincerely bent on seeking
God, they willingly and affectionately employ the helps which he there affords
them; and the advantage which they derive from them creates love to them in
their hearts, and longings after them. This declaration farther shows, that
however David excelled others in faith, yet he was not without fear lest the
violence of his enemies might deprive him of the ordinary means of instruction
which God had conferred on his Church. He felt his need of the Church's common
discipline and order, and he therefore anxiously labored to retain his enjoyment
of them. From this we infer the impious pride of those who look with contempt on
the services of religion as unnecessary, although David himself could not live
without them. Another consideration, indeed, existed in those days, I confess,
while the law, like a schoolmaster, held the ancient people in a state of
servitude compared with ours. Our case, however, is one with theirs in this
respect, that the weakness of our faith requires help as well as theirs. And as
God for this purpose has appointed the sacraments, as well as the whole order of
the Church, woe to the pride of those who recklessly desert the services which
we perceive to have been held in such high esteem by the pious servants of God.
The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>me-on, </i>according to some, is derived from a
word</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa539</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which signifies <i>an eye; </i>and they
translate it <i>comeliness, </i>or <i>appearance. </i>This is the translation of
the Septuagint.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa540</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as the word is almost every where
used to signify <i>a dwelling-place, </i>which is more simple, I prefer to
retain it. The sanctuary is called <i>God's house, </i>and <i>the dwelling-place
of his glory; </i>and we know how frequently expressions of this kind are
employed in Scripture to bear testimony to the presence of God. Not that God
either dwelt in a tent, or wished to confine the minds of his people to earthly
symbols; but it was needful to remind the faithful of God's present goodness,
that they might not think they sought him in vain, as we have elsewhere already
said. Now, that God's glory may dwell among us, it is necessary that a lively
image of it should shine forth in word and sacraments. From this it follows,
that the temples which are reckoned such among Papists are only filthy brothels
of Satan.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gather not my soul with
wicked men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having now affirmed his
innocence, he has recourse again to prayer, and calls upon God to defend him. At
first sight, indeed, it appears strange to pray that God would not involve a
righteous man in the same destruction with the wicked; but God, with paternal
indulgence, allows this freedom in prayer, that his people may themselves in
this way correct their anxieties, and overcome the fears with which they are
tempted. David, when he conceived this supplication, in order to free himself
from anxiety and fear, placed before his eyes the righteous judgment of God, to
whom nothing is more abhorrent than to mingle good and bad together without
distinction. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">psa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asaph, </i>sometimes signifies <i>to gather together, </i>and sometimes <i>to
destroy. </i>In this place, I am of opinion it signifies to <i>gather into a
heap, </i>as was wont to be the case in a confused slaughter. This was the
objection stated by Abraham,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"That
be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the
wicked:and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
18:25,)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us remember, therefore, that these
forms of prayer are dictated by the Holy Spirit, in order that the faithful may
unhesitatingly assure themselves that God still sits in inquisition upon every
man's case, in order to give righteous judgment at last. In the second clause,
instead of the phrase, <i>wicked men, </i>he uses <i>bloody men, </i>amplifying
what he had said. For although many wicked men rush not all at once to murder,
yet in process of time they harden themselves to cruelty; nor does Satan allow
them to rest until he precipitate them into deeds of
blood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in their hands is
maliciousness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmz</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
zimmah, </i>signifies properly <i>an inward stratagem, </i>or <i>device.</i> But
here it is not improperly applied to <i>the hands,</i> because David wished
to<i> </i>intimate, that the wicked, of whom he was speaking, not only secretly
imagined deceits, but also vigorously executed with their hands the malice which
their hearts devised. When he farther says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their right hands are full of
bribes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we may infer from this, that it
was not the common people whom he pointed out for observation, but the nobility
themselves, who were most guilty of practising this corruption. Although the
common and baser sort of men may be hired for reward, and suborned as agents in
wickedness, yet we know that bribes are offered chiefly to judges, and other
great men who are in power; and we likewise know, that at the time referred to
here the worst of men bore sway. It was no wonder, therefore, that David
complained that justice was exposed to sale. We are farther admonished by this
expression, that those who delight in gifts can scarcely do otherwise than sell
themselves to iniquity. Nor is it in vain, unquestionably, that God declares
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"gifts blind the eyes of
the wise, and pervert the hearts of the righteous,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I will walk in mine
integrity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this repetition there is
to be remarked a circumstance which more clearly illustrates David's
righteousness; namely, that, in the midst of so many temptations, he steadily
held on his way. He saw many become suddenly rich by gifts, as we still see
those who sit at the helm of affairs accumulating to themselves, in a very brief
space, a great abundance of wealth, building sumptuous palaces, and extending
their lands far and wide. As no allurements could induce him to imitate their
example in this, he gave a proof of rare and heroic virtue. He therefore affirms
with truth, that although the world accounted them happy, he had not been
seduced from his wonted integrity, that thus it might appear that he ascribed
more to the providence of God than to evil practices. He, therefore, beseeches
God <i>to redeem him, </i>because, being oppressed with wrongs, and tempted in
various ways, he relied only on God, trusting that he would deliver him. From
this we may conclude, that he was at this time reduced to great straits. He
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be merciful to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he shows that this
deliverance flows from the grace of God, as its true source; and we have already
seen that the cause is often put for the
effect.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
26:12	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b> My foot hath stood in

fa541</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the congregations will I bless thee,
O Jehovah!	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">This verse may be explained in
two ways. Some are of opinion that David declares how carefully he had studied
uprightness among men; but I rather think that he celebrates the grace of God
towards him, and, at the same time, vows his gratitude. By the use of the
metaphor, therefore, he tells us that he was preserved in safety. And as he knew
that it was the hand of God alone which enabled him to stand, he therefore
addresses himself to the exercise of praise and thanksgiving. Nor does he merely
say, that he will acknowledge in private the goodness of God bestowed upon him,
but in public also, that the assemblies of God's people may be witnesses of it.
It is highly necessary that every one should publicly celebrate his experience
of the grace of God, as an example to others to confide in
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fa542</font></sup><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
27.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this psalm, David rehearses the desires and
meditations with which he had exercised himself in the midst of his great
dangers. The thanksgivings which he mingles with them show that it was composed
after his deliverance. It is also probable that he repeats at once the prayers
which had exercised his thoughts in his different meditations. Hence it is to be
seen here with what invincible fortitude of soul the holy man was endued, that
he might overcome the most grievous assaults of his enemies. His wonderful piety
shines forth in this, that he wished to live for no other purpose than to serve
God:nor could he be turned aside from this purpose by any anxiety or
trouble.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of
David.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
27:1-3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Jehovah is my light and my
salvation, whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life, of whom shall
I be afraid? <b>2.</b> When the wicked came upon me to eat up my flesh, when my
oppressors and mine enemies came upon me, they stumbled and fell. <b>3.</b>
Though armies should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war
should rise against me, in this will I be
confident.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is my
light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This commencement may be
understood as meaning that David, having already experienced God's mercy,
publishes a testimony of his gratitude. But I rather incline to another meaning,
namely, that, perceiving the conflict he had to wage with the sharpest
temptations, he fortifies himself beforehand, and as it were brings together
matter for confidence:for it is necessary that the saints earnestly wrestle with
themselves to repel or subdue the doubts which the flesh is so prone to cherish,
that they may cheerfully and speedily betake themselves to prayer. David,
accordingly, having been tossed with various tempests, at length recovers
himself, and shouts triumphantly over the troubles with which he had been
harassed, rejoicing that whenever God displays his mercy and favor, there is
nothing to be feared. This is farther intimated by the accumulation of terms
which he employs, when he calls God not only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
rock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strength of his
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>His object was, to put a threefold
shield, as it were, against his various fears, as sufficient to ward them off.
The term <i>light, </i>as is well known, is used in Scripture to denote joy, or
the perfection of happiness. Farther, to explain his meaning, he adds that God
was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the strength of his
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as it was by his help that he felt
himself safe, and free from the terrors of death. Certainly we find that all our
fears arise from this source, that we are too anxious about our life, while we
acknowledge not that God is its preserver. We can have no tranquillity,
therefore, until we attain the persuasion that our life is sufficiently guarded,
because it is protected by his omnipotent power. The interrogation, too, shows
how highly David esteemed the Divine protection, as he thus boldly exults
against all his enemies and dangers. Nor assuredly do we ascribe due homage to
God, unless, trusting to his promised aid, we dare to boast of the certainty of
our safety. Weighing, as it were, in scales the whole power of earth and hell,
David accounts it all lighter than a feather, and considers God alone as far
outweighing the whole.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us learn, therefore,
to put such a value on God's power to protect us as to put to flight all our
fears. Not that the minds of the faithful can, by reason of the infirmity of the
flesh, be at all times entirely devoid of fear; but immediately recovering
courage, let us, from the high tower of our confidence, look down upon all our
dangers with contempt. Those who have never tasted the grace of God tremble
because they refuse to rely on him, and imagine that he is often incensed
against them, or at least far removed from them. But with the promises of God
before our eyes, and the grace which they offer, our unbelief does him grievous
wrong, if we do not with unshrinking courage boldly set him against all our
enemies. When God, therefore, kindly allures us to himself, and assures us that
he will take care of our safety, since we have embraced his promises, or because
we believe him to be faithful, it is meet that we highly extol his power, that
it may ravish our hearts with admiration of himself. We must mark well this
comparison, What are all creatures to God? Moreover, we must extend this
confidence still farther, in order to banish all fears from our consciences,
like Paul, who, when speaking of his eternal salvation, boldly
exclaims,</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the wicked,

this sentence, as some interpreters do, into the future
tense.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa543</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But while we retain the past tense
which the prophet employs, the words may be explained in a twofold manner. The
meaning but in the prophetic writings it is often used for the future. There
does not, however, as Calvin remarks, appear to be any necessity for translating
the verbs into the future tense in this passage, in which David may be
considered as contemplating the past evidences of the goodness of God towards
him, and from them taking encouragement with respect to the future. either is,
that David celebrates the victory which he had obtained by the blessing of God;
or there is a reference to the manner in which he had encouraged himself to hope
the best, even in the midst of his temptations, namely, by thinking of God's
former favors. The latter is the exposition which I prefer. They both, however,
amount to the same thing, and imply that David had no reason henceforth to doubt
of God's assistance when he considered his former experience; for nothing is of
greater use to confirm our faith, than the remembrance of those instances in
which God has clearly given us a proof not only of his grace, but of his truth
and power. I connect this verse, accordingly, with the following one. In the
former, David recalls to mind the triumphs which, by God's help, he had already
obtained; and from this he concludes, that by what hosts soever he may be
environed, or whatever mischief his enemies may devise against him, he would
fearlessly stand up against them. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brq</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
karab, </i>signifies <i>to approach; </i>but here it refers to the irruption
that David's enemies made upon him when they assaulted him. Some translate it
<i>to fight, </i>but this translation is flat. To testify his innocence, he
calls them <i>wicked or froward, </i>and by saying that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came upon him to eat up his
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa544</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he expresses their savage
cruelty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though armies should
encamp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He infers from his former
experience, as I have already mentioned, that whatever adversity may befall him,
he ought to hope well, and to have no misgivings about the divine protection,
which had been so effectually vouchsafed to him in his former need. He had
asserted this, indeed, in the first verse, but now, upon farther proof of it, he
repeats it. Under the terms, <i>camps </i>and <i>armies, </i>he includes
whatever is most formidable in the world:as if he had said, Although all men
should conspire for my destruction, I will disregard their violence, because the
power of God, which I know is on my side, is far above theirs. But when he
declares, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My heart shall not
fear,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this does not imply that he would
be entirely devoid of fear, &#8212; for that would have been more worthy of the
name of insensibility than of virtue; but lest his heart should faint under the
terrors which he had to encounter, he opposed to them the shield of faith. Some
transfer the word translated <i>in this </i>to the following verse, meaning that
he was confident that he would dwell in God's house; but I am of opinion that it
belongs rather to the preceding doctrine. For then does faith bring forth its
fruit in due season, when we remain firm and fearless in the midst of dangers.
David, therefore, intimates, that when the trial comes, his faith will prove
invincible, because it relies on the power of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
27:4-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> One thing have I desired

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One thing have I
desired.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some consider this as a
prophecy of the perpetuity of David's kingdom, on which not only his own
personal happiness depended, but also the happiness of his whole people; as if
he had said, I am so well contented with this singular proof of God's favor,
that I can think on nothing else night and day. In my opinion, however, it
appears a simpler interpretation to view the words as meaning, that although
David was banished from his country, despoiled of his wife, bereft of his
kinsfolk; and, in fine, dispossessed of his substance, yet he was not so
desirous for the recovery of these, as he was grieved and afflicted for his
banishment from God's sanctuary, and the loss of his sacred privileges. Under
the word <i>one, </i>there is an implied antithesis, in which David,
disregarding all other interests, displays his intense affection for the service
of God; so that it was bitterer to him to be an exile from the sanctuary, than
to be denied access to his own house. That David desired only one thing,
therefore, namely, to dwell in the house of the Lord, must be read in one
sentence. For there is no probability that he means by this some secret wish
which he suppressed, seeing he distinctly proclaims what it was that chiefly
troubled him. He adds, too, steadiness of purpose, declaring that he will not
cease to reiterate these prayers. Many may be seen spurring on with great
impetuosity at first, whose ardor, in process of time, not only languishes, but
is almost immediately extinguished. By declaring, therefore, that he would
persevere in this wish during his whole life, he thereby distinguishes between
himself and hypocrites.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must, however,
observe by what motive David was so powerfully stimulated. "Surely," some may
say, "he could have called on God beyond the precincts of the temple. Wherever
he wandered as an exile, he carried with him the precious promise of God, so
that he needed not to put so great a value upon the sight of the external
edifice. He appears, by some gross imagination or other, to suppose that God
could be enclosed by wood and stones." But if we examine the words more
carefully, it will be easy to see, that his object was altogether different from
a mere sight of the noble building and its ornaments, however costly. He speaks,
indeed, of the beauty of the temple, but he places that beauty not so much in
the goodliness that was to be seen by the eye, as in its being the celestial
pattern which was shown to Moses, as it is written in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022540&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
25:40,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And look that thou make
them after this pattern which was showed thee in the mount."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the fashion of the temple was not framed according
to the wisdom of man, but was an image of spiritual things, the prophet directed
his eyes and all his affections to this object. Their madness is, therefore,
truly detestable who wrest this place in favor of pictures and images, which,
instead of deserving to be numbered among temple ornaments, are rather like dung
and filth, defiling all the purity of holy things. We should now consider,
whether the faithful are to be like-minded under the Christian or Gospel
dispensation.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa546</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I own, indeed, that we are in very
different circumstances from the ancient fathers; but so far as God still
preserves his people under a certain external order, and draws them to him by
earthly instructions, temples have still their beauty, which deservedly ought to
draw the affections and desires of the faithful to them. The Word, sacraments,
public prayers, and other helps of the same kind, cannot be neglected, without a
wicked contempt of God, who manifests himself to us in these ordinances, as in a
mirror or image.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he shall hide me in his
tent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist promises himself
that his prayer would not be in vain. Although he is deprived of the visible
sanctuary for a time, he doubts not that, wherever he may be, he shall
experience the protecting power of God. And he alludes to the temple, because it
was a symbol to the faithful of the divine presence; as if he had said, that in
making the request which he mentioned he by no means lost his labor; for every
one who shall seek God sincerely, and with a pure heart, shall be safely
concealed under the wings of his protection. The figure of the temple, he
therefore affirms, was not an unmeaning one, for there God, so to speak, spread
forth his wings to gather true believers under his protection. From this he
concludes, that as he had no greater desire than to flee for refuge under these
wings, there would be a shelter ready for him in times of adversity, under the
divine protection, which, under the figure of a <i>rock, </i>he tells us, would
be impregnable like towers, which, for the sake of strength, were wont to be
built, in ancient times, in lofty places. Although he was, therefore, at this
time, environed by enemies on every side, yet he boasts that he shall overcome
them. It is, indeed, a common form of speech in the Scriptures to say, that
those who are oppressed with grief walk with a bowed down back and dejected
countenance, while, on the other hand, they lift up their heads when their
joyfulness is restored. Thus David spake,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
3:4, "Thou, Lord, art the lifter up of mine head." But because besieging is here
put in opposition to this, he meant to say, that in that divine refuge he would
be as it were lifted on high, so that he might fearlessly disregard the darts of
his enemies, which might have otherwise pierced him. And in hoping for victory,
though he was reduced to such straits as threatened instant death, he gives us a
remarkable proof of his faith; by which we are taught not to measure the aid of
God by outward appearances or visible means, but even in the midst of death to
hope for deliverance from his powerful and victorious
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>

fa547</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in his
tabernacle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By making a solemn vow of
thanksgiving, after he shall have been delivered from dangers, he confirms
himself again in the hope of deliverance. The faithful under the Law, we know,
were wont, by a solemn rite, to pay their vows, when they had experienced any
remarkable blessing from God. Here, therefore, David, though in banishment, and
prohibited from approaching the temple, boasts that he would again come to the
altar of God, and offer the sacrifice of praise. It appears, however, that he
tacitly sets the holy rejoicing and songs, in which he promises to give thanks
to God, in opposition to the profane triumphings of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, O Jehovah! my
voice.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist returns again to
prayer, and in doing so, he declares with what armor he was furnished to break
through his temptations. By the word <i>cry, </i>he expresses his vehemence, as
I have elsewhere said, that he may thereby move God the sooner to help him. For
the same purpose, also, he a little after mentions his misery, because the more
the faithful are oppressed, the more does their very need induce God to extend
his favor towards them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My heart said to
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The change of person in the verbs
has occasioned a variety of interpretations of this verse. But whoever closely
examines David's design will perceive that the text runs perfectly well. As it
becomes us not rashly to rush into the presence of God, until he first calls us,
David first tells us, that he carefully considered how gently and sweetly God
prevents his people, by spontaneously inviting them to seek his face; and then,
recovering his cheerfulness, he declares he would come wheresoever God may call
him. The sense of the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>leka, </i>is somewhat ambiguous. It may mean the same thing as <i>tibi, to
thee, </i>in Latin. But as the Hebrew letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>is often used for the preposition <i>of</i>, or <i>concerning,
</i>it may properly enough be translated, <i>my heart hath said of thee; </i>an
exposition to which the majority of interpreters incline. More probably,
however, in my opinion, it denotes a mutual conversation between God and the
prophet. I have just said, that no one can believingly rise to seek God until
the way is first opened by God's invitation, as I have elsewhere shown from the
prophet's declaration,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will say, It is my
people; and they shall say, The Lord is my God,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;381309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
13:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David accordingly says, that in this way the door was
opened for him to seek God:he brings forward this promise, and thus responds, as
it were, to God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa550</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And, certainly, if this symphony does
not precede, no man will conduct aright the chorus of the invitation. As soon,
therefore, as we hear God presenting himself to us, let us cordially reply,
Amen; and let us think with ourselves of his promises, as if they were
familiarly addressed to us. Thus true believers have no need to seek any subtle
artifice or tedious circuits to introduce themselves into God's favor, since
this preface prepares so easy a way for them, "However unworthy we are to be
received by thee, O Lord, yet thy commandment, by which thou enjoinest upon us
to come to thee, is sufficient encouragement to us." The voice of God,
therefore, ought to resound in our hearts, like an echo in hollow places, that
from this mutual concord there may spring confidence to call upon
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The term, <i>face, </i>is commonly
explained to mean <i>help </i>or <i>succor; </i>as if it had been said, Seek me.
But I am persuaded that the allusion here is also to the sanctuary, and that
David refers to the mode of manifestation in which God was wont to render
himself in some degree visible. No doubt, it is unlawful to form any gross or
carnal idea of him, but as he appointed the ark of the covenant to be a token of
his presence, it is, without any impropriety, every where denominated his face.
It is indeed true, that we are far from God so long as we abide in this world,
because faith is far removed from sight; but it is equally true, that we now see
God as in a mirror, and darkly,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 13:12,) until he shall openly show himself to us at the last day.
Under this word, therefore, I am persuaded, are represented to us those helps by
which God raises us to his presence, descending from his inconceivable glory to
us, and furnishing us on earth with a vision of his heavenly glory. But as it is
according to his own sovereign pleasure that God vouchsafes us to look upon him,
(as he does in Word and sacraments,) it becomes us steadily to fix our eyes on
this view, that it may not be with us as with the Papists, who, by means of the
wildest inventions, wickedly transform God into whatever shapes please their
fancy, or their brains have
conceived.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hide not thy face from
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist elegantly continues the
same form of speech, but with a different meaning. <i>The face of God </i>is now
employed to describe the sensible effects of his grace and favor:as if it had
been said, Lord, make me truly to experience that thou hast been near to me, and
let me clearly behold thy power in saving me. We must observe the distinction
between the theoretical knowledge derived from the Word of God and what is
called the experimental knowledge of his grace. For as God shows himself present
in operation, (as they usually speak,) he must first be sought in his Word. The
sentence which follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cast not
away thy servant in thine anger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>some
Jewish interpreters expound in too forced a manner to mean, Suffer not thy
servant to be immersed in the wicked cares of this world, which are nothing but
anger and madness. I, however, prefer to translate the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hfn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>natah, </i>as many translate it, <i>to turn away from, </i>or <i>to remove.
</i>Their meaning is more probable who interpret it, Make not thy servant to
decline to anger. When a person is utterly forsaken by God, he cannot but be
agitated within by murmuring thoughts, and break forth into the manifestations
of vexation and anger. If any one think that David now anticipates this
temptation, I shall not object, for he was not without reason afraid of
impatience, which weakens us and makes us go beyond the bounds of reason. But I
keep to the first exposition, as it is confirmed by the two words which follow;
and thus the term <i>anger </i>imports a tacit confession of sin; because,
although David acknowledges that God might justly cast him off, he deprecates
his anger. Moreover, by recalling to mind God's former favors, he encourages
himself to hope for more, and by this argument he moves God to continue his
help, and not to leave his work
imperfect.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

sacred history, that Jesse, so far as his opportunity admitted, performed his
duty to his son David, some are of opinion that the nobles and councillors are
here mentioned allegorically; but this is not suitable. Nor is it with any
reason that they urge this scruple. David does not complain that he was
unnaturally betrayed by his father or mother; but by this comparison he
magnifies the grace of God, declaring, that he would ever find him ready to help
him, although he might be forsaken of all men. The Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
ki, </i>for the most part, signifies<i> for, </i>but it is also known to be
often employed for the adverb of time, <i>when. </i>David, therefore, meant to
intimate, that whatever benevolence, love, zeal, attention, or service, might be
found among men, they are far inferior to the paternal mercy with which God
encircles his people. The highest degree of love among men, it is true, is to be
found in parents who love their children as their own bowels. But God advances
us higher, declaring, by the prophet Isaiah, that though a mother may forget the
child of her womb, he would always be mindful of us,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:15.) In this degree does David place him, so that he who is the source of all
goodness far surpasses all mortals, who are naturally malevolent and niggardly.
It is, however, an imperfect mode of speech, like that in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:16,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Doubtless, thou art our
Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us
not."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The purport of the whole is this:However inclined by
nature earthly parents are to help their children, nay, though they should
endeavor to cherish them with the greatest ardor of affection, yet should
affection be wholly extinguished in the earth, God would fulfill the duty both
of father and mother to his people. From which it follows, that we basely
undervalue the grace of God, if our faith rise not above all the affections of
nature; for sooner shall the laws of nature be overturned a hundred times, than
God shall fail his people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teach me thy way, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many think that David here
requests that God would guide him by his Spirit, lest he should surpass his
enemies in acting violently and wickedly. This doctrine is, no doubt, very
useful, but it does not seem to agree with the scope of the passage. It is a
simpler interpretation, in my opinion, to consider that David desires, in order
to escape the snares and violence of his enemies, that God would extend to him
his hand, and safely conduct him, so as to give a happy issue to his affairs. He
sets <i>the right path </i>in opposition to the difficulties and impediments
which are in places which are rough, and of difficult access, to overcome which
he was unequal, unless God undertook the office of a guide to lead him. But he
who thus desires to commit himself to the safeguard and protection of
God,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa552</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> must first renounce crafty and wicked
devices. We must not expect that God, who promises to grant a happy issue only
to the single in heart, and those who trust in his faithfulness, will bless
crooked and wicked counsels.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give me not up to the desire
of mine oppressors.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Hebrew noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nephesh, </i>signifies <i>lust, will, </i>or <i>desire; </i>and the language
of David implies, Deliver me not up to the pleasure or lust of mine enemies, and
thus he intimates, that they greedily gaped for his destruction. God delivers
his people in two ways; either by appeasing the cruelty of the wicked, and
rendering them meek; or, if he permit them to burn with fury, by restraining
their power and violence, so that they desire and endeavor in vain to do
mischief. The Psalmist afterwards adds, that he is persecuted both with slanders
and false accusations, and also by open violence; for when he says, that they
<i>bring forth violence,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa553</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means that they speak of
nothing but of war and slaughter. We thus see that the holy man was miserably
oppressed on every side. Even his integrity, which we know to have been
singular, could not free him from bitter and deadly calumnies, and he was at the
same time overwhelmed by the violence and force of his enemies. If the ungodly,
therefore, should at any time rise against us, not only with menaces and cruel
violence, but to give the semblance of justice to their enmity, should slander
us with lies, let us remember the example of David, who was assaulted in both
ways; nay, let us recall to mind that Christ the Son of God suffered no less
injury from lying tongues than from
violence.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

agreed among interpreters, that this sentence is incomplete. Some, however, are
of opinion, that the Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alwl</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>lul&euml;, </i>is used for the purpose of affirmation, as if it were a
species of oath; the Hebrews being accustomed to swear elliptically; for
breaking off in the middle of the discourse and leaving it imperfect, they
supplied an imprecation, namely, that God would punish them in case they
perjured themselves. But the greater number give a different interpretation,
namely, that David intimates that he was supported solely by faith, otherwise he
had perished a hundred times. The meaning which they elicit, accordingly, is,
Had I not relied on the promise of God, and been assuredly persuaded that he
would safely preserve me, and had I not continued firm in this persuasion, I had
utterly perished:There was no other remedy. Some understand by <i>the land of
the living, </i>the heavenly inheritance; but this interpretation is forced, and
disagrees with the usual style of Scripture. When Hezekiah laments in his song
recorded in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:11, that he had no hope of seeing God "in the land of the living," he means,
without all doubt, the present life, as he immediately adds, "I shall behold man
no more with the inhabitants of the world." A similar form of speech occurs also
in another place,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
11:19.) David then believed that he would still enjoy the goodness of God in
this world, although he was now deprived of all experience of his favor, and
could see no spark of light. From the darkness of death, therefore, he promises
himself a view of the divine favor, and by this persuasion his life is
sustained, although, according to the judgment of carnal reason, it was past
recovery and lost. It is to be observed, however, that David does not rashly go
beyond the divine promise. It is true that "godliness is profitable unto all
things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8;) but he would have never dared to entertain this persuasion had he
not been informed by a special revelation, and assuredly promised a successor,
who should always sit upon his throne,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:11, 12.) He was, therefore, justly persuaded that he would not die till this
promise was fulfilled. Lest any man, therefore, by an unwarranted imitation of
his example, should overleap the boundaries of faith, it is necessary to
understand what was peculiar to him, and did not belong to us. In general,
however, we ought all to hope that, although God may not openly work deliverance
for us, or show us his favor in a visible manner, he will, nevertheless, be
always merciful to us, even in the present
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wait thou on
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It may be doubted whether
David, having in the preceding verses spoken of himself, here addresses his
discourse to others, and exhorts them by his own example to fortitude and
persevering patience, as he does in the conclusion of
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
31:19, where, after speaking concerning himself particularly, he makes a
transition, and addresses himself to all the godly. But as he speaks here in the
singular number, and uses no mark to show that he directs his discourse to
others, it is in my opinion probable that he applies it to himself, the more to
encourage his confidence in God, lest at any time his heart should
faint.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa556</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As he was conscious of his weakness,
and knew that his faith was the great means of preserving him safe, he
seasonably strengthens himself for the future. Under the word <i>waiting,
</i>too, he puts himself in mind of new trials, and sets before his eyes the
cross which he must bear. We are then said to wait on God, when, withdrawing his
grace from us, he suffers us to languish under afflictions. David, therefore,
having got through one conflict, prepares himself to encounter new ones. But as
nothing is more difficult than to give God the honor of relying upon him, when
he hides himself from us, or delays his assistance, David stirs himself up to
collect strength; as if he had said, If fearfulness steal upon thee; if
temptation shake thy faith; if the feelings of the flesh rise in tumult, do not
faint; but rather endeavor to rise above them by an invincible resolution of
mind. From this we may learn, that the children of God overcome, not by
sullenness, but by patience, when they commit their souls quietly to God; as
Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"In<i> </i>quietness and
in confidence shall be your
strength,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">As David did not feel himself equal to great and
difficult efforts, he borrows strength from God by prayer. Had he said no more
than <i>Act like a man,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

the motions of his own free-will, but as he immediately adds, by way of
correction, that God would be at hand <i>to strengthen his heart, </i>he plainly
enough shows, that when the saints strive vigorously, they fight in the strength
of another, and not in their own. David does not, like the Papists, put his own
efforts into the van, and afterwards supplicate for divine aid, but having done
his own duty, although he knew that he was destitute of strength in himself, he
requests that his deficiency may be supplied by the grace of the Holy Spirit.
And as he knew that the war must be continued during his whole life, and that
new conflicts would daily arise, and that the troubles of the saints are often
protracted for a long period, he again repeats what he had said about waiting on
God:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wait thou alone on

dangers, David, in this psalm, according to his custom, first records the vows
that he had made in the midst of his difficulties, and then his thanksgivings
and praises to God, to induce others to follow his example. It is probable that
he speaks of his persecutions by Saul.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto thee, O Jehovah! will I
cry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist begins by declaring
that he would betake himself to the help of God alone, which shows both his
faith and his sincerity. Although men labor every where under a multitude of
troubles, yet scarcely one in a hundred ever has recourse to God. Almost all
having their consciences burdened with guilt, and having never experienced the
power of divine grace which might lead them to betake themselves to it, either
proudly gnaw the bit or fill the air with unavailing complaints, or, giving way
to desperation, faint under their afflictions. By calling God <i>his strength,
</i>David more fully shows that he confided in God's assistance, not only when
he was in the shade and in peace, but also when he was exposed to the severest
temptations. In comparing himself to the dead, too, he intimates how great his
straits were, although his object was not merely to point out the magnitude of
his danger, but also to show that when he needed succor, he looked not here and
there for it, but relied on God alone, without whose favor there remained no
hope for him. It is, therefore, as if he had said, I am nothing if thou leavest
me; if thou succourest me not, I perish. It is not enough for one who is in such
a state of affliction to be sensible of his misery, unless, convinced of his
inability to help himself, and renouncing all help from the world, he betake
himself to God alone. And as the Scriptures inform us that God answers true
believers when he shows by his operations that he regards their supplications,
so the word <i>silent </i>is set in opposition to the sensible and present
experience of his aid, when he appears, as it were, not to hear their
prayers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear the voice of my prayers
when I cry to thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This repetition is a
sign of a heart in anguish. David's ardor and vehemence in prayer are also
intimated by the noun signifying <i>voice, </i>and the verb signifying <i>to
cry. </i>He means that he was so stricken with anxiety and fear, that he prayed
not coldly, but with burning, vehement desire, like those who, under the
pressure of grief, vehemently cry out. In the second clause of the verse, by
synecdoche, the thing signified is indicated by the sign. It has been a common
practice in all ages for men to lift up their hands in prayer. Nature has
extorted this gesture even from heathen idolaters, to show by a visible sign
that their minds were directed to God alone. The greater part, it is true,
contented with this ceremony, busy themselves to no effect with their own
inventions; but the very lifting up of the hands, when there is no hypocrisy and
deceit, is a help to devout and zealous prayer. David, however, does not say
here that he lifted his hands to heaven, but to <i>the sanctuary, </i>that,
aided by its help, he might ascend the more easily to heaven. He was not so
gross, or so superstitiously tied to the outward sanctuary, as not to know that
God must be sought spiritually, and that men then only approach to him when,
leaving the world, they penetrate by faith to celestial glory. But remembering
that he was a man, he would not neglect this aid afforded to his infirmity. As
the sanctuary was the pledge or token of the covenant of God, David beheld the
presence of God's promised grace there, as if it had been represented in a
mirror; just as the faithful now, if they wish to have a sense of God's nearness
to them, should immediately direct their faith to Christ, who came down to us in
his incarnation, that he might lift us up to the Father. Let us understand,
then, that David clung to the sanctuary with no other view than that by the help
of God's promise he might rise above the elements of the world, which he used,
however, according to the appointment of the Law. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rybd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>debir, </i>which we have rendered
<i>sanctuary,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa558</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>signifies the inner-room of the
tabernacle or temple, or the most holy place, where the ark of the covenant was
contained, and it is so called from the answers or oracles which God gave forth
from thence, to testify to his people the presence of his favor among
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
28:3-5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> Draw me not away with
wicked men, nor with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their

according to the work of their hands; render them their reward. <b>5.</b>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Draw me not away with wicked
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning is, that in
circumstances so dissimilar, God should not mingle the righteous with the wicked
in the same indiscriminate
destruction.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa559</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Undoubtedly, too, in speaking of his
enemies, he indirectly asserts his own integrity. But he did not pray in this
manner, because he thought that God was indiscriminately and unreasonably angry
with men; he reasons rather from the nature of God, that he ought to cherish
good hope, because it was God's prerogative to distinguish between the righteous
and the wicked, and to give every one his due reward. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the workers of
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means man wholly addicted
to wickedness. The children of God sometimes fall, commit errors, and act amiss
in one way or other, but they take no pleasure in their evil doings; the fear of
God, on the contrary, stirs them up to repentance. David afterwards defines and
enlarges upon the wickedness of those whom he describes; for, under pretense of
friendship they perfidiously deceived good men, professing one thing with their
tongue, while they entertained a very different thing in their hearts. Open
depravity is easier to be borne with than this craftiness of the fox, when
persons put on fair appearances in order to find opportunity of doing
mischief.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa560</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This truth, accordingly, admonishes us
that those are most detestable in God's sight, who attack the simple and unwary
with fair speeches as with poison.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give them according to their
works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having thus requested God to have
a regard to his innocence, the Psalmist thunders forth a curse against his
enemies. And the accumulation of words shows that he had groaned long and
grievously under the burden before he broke forth to desire such vengeance. He
intimates that the wicked of whom he speaks had transgressed not once, nor for a
short time, nor in one way, but that they had proceeded so far in their constant
evil doings, that their audacity was no longer to be endured. We know how
troublesome and grievous a temptation it is to see the ungodly proceeding
without measure or end, as if God connived at their wickedness. David,
therefore, wearied as it were with continual forbearing, and fainting under the
burden, implores God, at length, to restrain the wantonness of his enemies, who
of late ceased not to heap wickedness upon wickedness. Thus we perceive that
there is nothing superfluous in this verse, when to <i>works </i>he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wickedness of their
doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the work of their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and thrice petitions that they
may receive the <i>reward </i>which they have deserved. Add to this, that he at
the same time bears testimony to his own faith, to which boasting hypocrites
often compel the children of God, while by their deceit and cavils, they impose
upon the judgments of the world. We see how men who are distinguished for
wickedness, not content with impunity themselves, cannot abstain from oppressing
the innocent by false accusations, just as the wolf, desirous of making a
prey</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa561</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the lambs, according to the common
proverb, accused them of troubling the water. David is therefore compelled by
this exigency to call upon God for protection. Here again occurs the difficult
question about praying for vengeance, which, however, I shall despatch in few
words, as I have discussed it elsewhere. In the first place, then, it is
unquestionable, that if the flesh move us to seek revenge, the desire is wicked
in the Sight of God. He not only forbids us to imprecate evil upon our enemies
in revenge for private injuries, but it cannot be otherwise than that all those
desires which spring from hatred must be disordered. David's example, therefore,
must not be alleged by those who are driven by their own intemperate passion to
seek vengeance. The holy prophet is not inflamed here by his own private sorrow
to devote his enemies to destruction; but laying aside the desire of the flesh,
he gives judgment concerning the matter itself. Before a man can, therefore,
denounce vengeance against the wicked, he must first shake himself free from all
improper feelings in his own mind. In the second place, prudence must be
exercised, that the heinousness of the evils which offend us drive us not to
intemperate zeal, which happened even to Christ's disciples, when they desired
that fire might be brought from heaven to consume those who refused to entertain
their Master,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420954&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
9:54.) They pretended, it is true, to act according to the example of Elias; but
Christ severely rebuked them, and told them that they knew not by what spirit
they were actuated. In particular, we must observe this general rule, that we
cordially desire and labor for the welfare of the whole human race. Thus it will
come to pass, that we shall not only give way to the exercise of God's mercy,
but shall also wish the conversion of those who seem obstinately to rush upon
their own destruction. In short, David, being free from every evil passion, and
likewise endued with the spirit of discretion and judgment, pleads here not so
much his own cause as the cause of God. And by this prayer, he farther reminds
both himself and the faithful, that although the wicked may give themselves
loose reins in the commission of every species of vice with impunity for a time,
they must at length stand before the judgment-seat of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they regard not the
doings of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse he lays
open the root of impiety, declaring that the ungodly are so bold to do mischief,
because, while they are thus indulging their hatred, and perpetrating every
species of wickedness, they think that they have nothing to do with God. And
when conscience stings them, they soothe themselves with false hopes, and at
last stubbornly harden themselves into insensibility. First, being intoxicated
with prosperity, they flatter themselves that God is their friend, while he has
no regard for those good men who are overwhelmed with so many afflictions; and,
next, they persuade themselves that the world is governed by chance, thus
blinding themselves in the midst of the clear light of day. In this manner,
David's adversaries, willingly ignorant that God had appointed him to be king,
emboldened themselves to persecute him. He therefore complains of their gross
ignorance of this, just as Isaiah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:20) brings the same complaint, in general terms, against all the ungodly of
his days. This doctrine, then, has a twofold use. First, it is no small
consolation to the children of God to be persuaded, while they are unrighteously
vexed, that by the providence of God they are thus profitably exercised to
patience; and that while the affairs of this world are all in a state of
disturbance and confusion, God nevertheless sits supreme in heaven conducting
and governing all things.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa562</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the second place, this is a very
proper curb to subdue the passions of our flesh, that we may not, like the
Andabates,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa563</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> contend in the dark, and with shut
eyes, as if God saw not and cared not about what is done here below. Let us,
therefore, learn carefully to consider that the judgments which God executes are
just so many proofs of his righteousness in governing mankind, and that although
all things should be huddled together in confusion, the eye of faith should be
directed to heaven, to consider God's secret judgments. And as God never ceases,
even in the midst of the greatest darkness, to give some tokens of his
providence, it is inexcusable indolence not to attend to them. This perverseness
the prophet aggravates, by repeating again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the works of God's
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He thus intimates, that the
ungodly, by recklessly pursuing their course, trample under foot whatever of
God's works they may meet with to check their
madness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him destroy them,
and not build them up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some are of
opinion that the first part of this verse is the nominative in the room of a
substantive to the verbs in the last clause; as if David had said, This brutal
madness shall destroy them; but the name of God should rather be supplied, and
then the context will run excellently. As the verbs, however, in the Hebrew are
in the future tense</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa564</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the sentence may be explained as
meaning that David now assures himself of the destruction of the reprobates for
which he had lately prayed. I do not reject this interpretation; but, in my
opinion, the words are just a continuance of his petitions. In this way, he
prays that the wicked may be overthrown, so as not to rise again, or recover
their former state. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him destroy them, and not
build them up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is a common figure of
speech among the Hebrews, according to what Malachi says concerning Edom,
"Thus<i> </i>saith the Lord of Hosts, They shall build, but I shall throw down,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:4.) Lest we should be struck, therefore, with an incurable plague, let us
learn to awake our minds to the consideration of God's works, that we may be
taught to fear him, to persevere in patience, and to advance in
godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
28:6-8	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> Blessed be Jehovah, for he
hath heard the voice of my supplication. <b>7.</b> Jehovah is my strength and my
shield, my heart hath trusted in him, and I have been helped: therefore shall my
heart rejoice, and with my song will I praise him. <b>8.</b> Jehovah is their
strength; and he is also the strength of the salvations [or deliverances] of his
anointed.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be Jehovah, who hath
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the second part of the
psalm in which the prophet begins to give thanks to God. We have already seen
how he employed himself in prayer in the midst of his dangers; and now by this
thanksgiving he teaches us that his prayers were not in vain. Thus he confirms
by his own example, that God is ready to bring help to his people whenever they
seek him in truth and sincerity. He declares the same truth more fully in the
next verse, calling God <i>his strength </i>and <i>his shield; </i>for he was
persuaded that God had heard him from this, that he had been wonderfully
preserved. He adds, that he had been <i>helped </i>in respect of his confidence
and hope; for it often comes to pass, that those who call upon God,
notwithstanding come short of his grace through their own unbelief. Thirdly, he
says that he will add to his joy a testimony of his gratitude. Wicked men and
hypocrites flee to God when they are overwhelmed with difficulties, but as soon
as they escape from them, forgetting their deliverer, they rejoice with frantic
mirth. In short, David trusted not in vain, since he truly found by experience
that God possesses ever present power to preserve his servants; and that this
was matter of true and solid joy to him, that he found God ever favorable to
him. On this account, likewise, he promises that he would be mindful of God, and
grateful to him. And undoubtedly, when God spreads cheerfulness through our
hearts, it is to open our mouths to sing his
praises.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is their
strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By way of explanation, he
repeats what he had said before, that God had been his strength; namely, because
he had blessed his armies. David had indeed employed the hand and labor of men,
but to God alone he ascribes the victory. As he knew that whatever help he had
obtained from men proceeded from God, and that his prosperous success flowed
likewise from his gratuitous favor, he discerned his hand in these means, as
palpably as if it had been stretched forth from heaven. And surely it is passing
shameful, that human means, which are only the instruments of God's power,
should obscure his glory; although there is no sin more common. It is a manner
of speaking which has great weight, when, speaking of his soldiers, he uses only
the pronoun <i>their, </i>as if he pointed to them with the finger. The second
clause assigns the reason of the other. He declares that himself and his whole
army were endued with victorious valor from heaven, because he fought under the
standard of God. This is the meaning of the word <i>anointed; </i>for, had not
God appointed him king, and freely adopted him, he would not have favored him
any more than he did Saul. By this means, in extolling solely the power of God
which advanced him to the kingdom, he attributes nothing to his own policy or
power. In the meantime, we may learn, that when one is satisfied of the
lawfulness of his calling, this doctrine encourages him to entertain good hope
with respect to the prosperous issue of his affairs. In particular, it is to be
observed, as we have briefly noticed in another place, that the fountain whence
all the blessings God bestows upon us flows is, that he hath chosen us in
Christ. David employs <i>salvations </i>or <i>deliverances </i>in the plural
number, because he had been often and in various ways preserved. The meaning,
therefore, is, that from the time when God had anointed him by the hand of
Samuel, he never ceased to help him, but delivered him in innumerable ways,
until he had accomplished the work of his grace in
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
28:9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b> Save thy people, and bless
thine inheritance; feed them, and lift them up for
ever.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">In this verse he shows that it was
not so much his own welfare as the welfare of the whole Church which was the
object of his concern, and that he neither lived nor reigned for himself, but
for the common good of the people. He well knew that he was appointed king for
no other end. In this he declares himself to be a type of the Son of God, of
whom, when Zechariah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
9:9) predicts that he would come "having salvation," there is no doubt that he
promises nothing to him apart from his members, but that the effects of this
salvation would diffuse themselves throughout his whole body. By this example,
accordingly, he prescribes a rule to earthly kings, that, devoting themselves to
the public good, they should only desire to be preserved for the sake of their
people.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa565</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> How very far otherwise it is, it is
needless to say. Blinded with pride and presumption they despise the rest of the
world, just as if their pomp and dignity raised them altogether above the common
state of man. Nor is it to be wondered at, that mankind are so haughtily and
contumeliously trampled under foot of kings, since the greatest part cast off
and disdain to bear the cross of
Christ.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa566</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us therefore remember that David is
like a mirror, in which God sets before us the continual course of his grace.
Only we must be careful, that the obedience of our faith may correspond to his
fatherly love, that he may acknowledge us for his people and inheritance. The
Scriptures often designate David by the name of a shepherd; but he himself
assigns that office to God, thus confessing that he is altogether unfit for
it,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

he has struck fear into the proud, who are reluctant to yield, and addressed an

design to lead all men to worship and reverence God; but as it is more difficult
to reduce great men, who excel in rank, to order, he expressly addresses himself
to them. It is obvious, that the LXX, in giving the translation, <i>sons of
rams,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa569</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>were led into a mistake by the
affinity of the Hebrew words.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa570</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> About the signification of the word,
indeed, the Jewish commentators are all agreed; but when they proceed to speak
of its meaning, they pervert and obscure it by the most chilling comments. Some
expound it of the angels,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa571</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> some of the stars; and others will have
it, that by the great men who are referred to are meant the holy fathers. But
David only intended to humble the princes of this world, who, being intoxicated
with pride, lift up their horns against God. This, accordingly, is the reason
why he introduces God, with a terrific voice, subduing by thunders, hail-storms,
tempests, and lightnings, these stubborn and stiff-necked giants, who, if they
are not struck with fear, refuse to stand in awe of any power in heaven. We see,
therefore, why, passing by others, he directs his discourse particularly to the
sons of the mighty. The reason is, because there is nothing more common with
them than to abuse their lofty station by impious deeds, while they madly
arrogate to themselves every divine prerogative. At least that they may modestly
submit themselves to God, and, mindful of their frailty, place their dependence
upon his grace, it is necessary, as it were, to compel them by force. David,
therefore, commands them <i>to give strength unto Jehovah, </i>because, deluded
by their treacherous imaginations, they think that the power which they possess
is supplied to them from some other quarter than from heaven. In short, he
exhorts them to lay aside their haughtiness, and their false opinion about their
own strength, and to glorify God as he deserves. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the glory of God's
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(ver. 2,) he means that which is
worthy of his majesty, of which the great men of this world are wont to deprive
him. The repetition, also, shows that they must be vehemently urged ere a proper
acknowledgement be extorted from them. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the brightness of God's
sanctuary</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa572</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to be understood, not heaven
as some think, but the tabernacle of the covenant, adorned with the symbols of
the divine glory, as is evident from the context. And the prophet designedly
makes mention of this place, in which the true God had manifested himself, that
all men, bidding adieu to superstition, should betake themselves to the pure
worship of God. It would not be sufficient to worship any heavenly power, but
the one and unchangeable God alone must be worshipped, which cannot come to pass
until the world be reclaimed from all foolish inventions and services forged in

daring in their contempt of God are most afraid of thunderings, storms, and such

with some sense of the existence of a
God,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

sluggish and regardless they are. He says not that the sun rises from day to
day, and sheds abroad his life-giving beams, nor that the rain gently descends
to fertilise the earth with its moisture; but he brings forward thunders,
violent tempests, and such things as smite the hearts of men with dread by their
violence. God, it is true, speaks in all his creatures, but here the prophet
mentions those sounds which rouse us from our drowsiness, or rather our
lethargy, by the loudness of their noise. We have said, that this language is
chiefly directed to those who with stubborn recklessness, cast from them, as far
as they can, all thought of God. The very figures which he uses sufficiently
declare, that David's design was to subdue by fear the obstinacy which yields
not willingly otherwise. Thrice he repeats that God's voice is heard in great
and violent tempests, and in the subsequent verse he adds, that it is full of
power and majesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

hearken not to the voice of God in his thunders, rending the air with his
lightnings, shaking the lofty mountains, prostrating and overthrowing the
loftiest trees. What a monstrous thing is it, that while all the irrational
portion of the creation tremble before God, men alone, who are endued with sense
and reason, are not moved! Moreover, though they possess genius and learning,
they employ enchantments to shut their ears against God's voice, however
powerful, lest it should reach their hearts. Philosophers think not that they
have reasoned skilfully enough about inferior causes, unless they separate God
very far from his works. It is a diabolical science, however, which fixes our
contemplations on the works of nature, and turns them away from God. If any one
who wished to know a man should take no notice of his face, but should fix his
eyes only on the points of his nails, his folly might justly be derided. But far
greater is the folly of those philosophers, who, out of mediate and proximate
causes, weave themselves vails, lest they should be compelled to acknowledge the
hand of God, which manifestly displays itself in his works. The Psalmist
particularly mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cedars
of Lebanon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because lofty and beautiful
cedars were to be found there. He also refers to <i>Lebanon </i>and <i>Mount
Hermon, </i>and to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wilderness
of
Kadesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa575</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because these places were best
known to the Jews. He uses, indeed, a highly poetical figure accompanied with a
hyperbole, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
Lebanon skips like a calf at God's voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and <i>Sirion </i>(which is also called Mount
Hermon</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa576</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) <i>like a unicorn, </i>which, we know,
is one of the swiftest animals. He also alludes to the terrific noise of
thunder, which seems almost to shake the mountains to their foundations. Similar
is the figure, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Lord striketh out flames of fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which
is done when the vapours, being struck, as it were, with his hammer, burst forth
into lightnings and thunderbolts. Aristotle, in his book on Meteors, reasons
very shrewdly about these things, in so far as relates to proximate causes, only
that he omits the chief point. The investigation of these would, indeed, be both
a profitable and pleasant exercise, were we led by it, as we ought, to the
Author of Nature himself. But nothing is more preposterous than, when we meet
with mediate causes, however many, to be stopped and retarded by them, as by so
many obstacles, from approaching God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa577</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for this is the same as if a man were
to remain at the very rudiments of things during his whole life, without going
farther. In short, this is to learn in such a manner that you can never know any
thing. That shrewdness alone, therefore, is worthy of praise, which elevates us
by these means even to heaven, in order that not a confused noise only may
strike our ears, but that the voice of the Lord may penetrate our hearts, and
teach us to pray and serve God. Some expound the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyjy</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
yachil, </i>which we have translated to <i>tremble, </i>in another way, namely,
that <i>God maketh the wilderness of Kadesh to travail in
birth;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa578</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because<i> </i>of the manifold wonders
which were wrought in it as the Israelites passed through it. But this sense I
object to, as far too subtle and strained. David appears rather to refer to the
common feelings of men; for as wildernesses are dreadful of themselves, they are
much more so when they are filled with thunders, hail, and storms. I do not,
however, object that the wilderness may be understood, by synecdoche, to mean
the wild beasts which lodge in it; and thus the next verse, where hinds are
mentioned, may be considered as added by way of
exposition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
29:9-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b> The voice of Jehovah
maketh the hinds to bring forth, and discovereth [or maketh bare] the forests,
and in his temple every one speaketh of his praise. <b>10.</b> Jehovah sitteth
upon the flood; Jehovah, I say, sitteth king for ever. <b>11.</b> Jehovah will
give strength to his people; Jehovah will bless his people with
peace.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice of Jehovah maketh
the hinds to bring forth</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa579</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A tacit comparison, as I have
said, is here made. It is worse than irrational, it is monstrous, that men are
not moved at God's voice, when it has such power and influence on wild beasts.
It is base ingratitude, indeed, in men not to perceive his providence and
government in the whole course of nature; but it is a detestable insensibility
that at least his unusual and extraordinary works, which compel even wild beasts
to obey him, will not teach them wisdom. Some interpreters think that <i>hinds
</i>are mentioned, rather than other beasts, on account of their difficulty in
bringing forth their young; which I disapprove not.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is also said <i>to discover </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make bare the
forests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>either because there is no
covering which can prevent it from penetrating into the most secret recesses and
caverns; or, because lightnings, rains, and stormy winds, beat off the leaves
and make the trees bare. Either sense is
appropriate.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his
temple.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God's voice fills the whole
world, and spreads itself to its farthest limits; but the prophet declares that
his glory is celebrated only in his church, because God not only speaks
intelligibly and distinctly there, but also there gently allures the faithful to
himself. His terrible voice, which thunders in various ways in the air, strikes
upon the ears, and causes the hearts of men to beat in such a manner, as to make
them shrink from rather than approach him not to mention that a considerable
portion turn a deaf ear to its sound in storms, rains, thunder, and lightnings.
As men, therefore, profit not so much in this common school as to submit
themselves to God, David wisely says especially that the faithful sing the
praises of God in his temple, because, being familiarly instructed there by his
fatherly voice, they devote and consecrate themselves wholly to his service. No
man proclaims the glory of God aright but he who worships him willingly. This
may be understood likewise as a complaint, in which David reproves the whole
world of being silent in so far as the glory of God is
concerned,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa580</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and laments that although his voice
resounds through all regions, yet his praises are no where sung but in his
temple alone. He appears, however, after the example of all the godly, to exhort
the whole of mankind to praise God's name, and designedly to erect a temple as a
receptacle for his glory, for the purpose of teaching us, that in order truly to
know God, and praise him as is his due, we need another voice than that which is
heard in thunders, showers, and storms in the air, in the mountains, and in the
forests; for if he teach us not in plain words, and also kindly allure us to
himself, by giving us a taste of his fatherly love, we will continue dumb. It is
the doctrine of salvation alone, therefore, which cheers our hearts and opens
our mouths in his praises, by clearly revealing to us his grace, and the whole
of his will. It is from thence that we must learn how we ought to praise him. We
may also unquestionably see that at that time there was nothing of the light of
godliness in the whole world, except in Judea. Even philosophers, who appeared
to approach nearest to the knowledge of God, contributed nothing whatever that
might truly glorify him. All that they say concerning religion is not only
frigid, but for the most part insipid. It is therefore in his word alone that
there shines forth the truth which may lead us to true piety, and to fear and
serve God aright.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa581</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah sitteth upon the
flood.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that David here
alludes to that memorable instance of God's vengeance, when he drowned the world
at once by the flood,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa582</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and thus testified to all ages that he
is the judge of mankind. I agree to this in part, but extend his meaning still
farther. In my opinion, he prosecutes the former subject, putting us in mind
that those floods, which still threaten destruction to the earth, are controlled
by the providence of God in such a way, as to make it evident that it is he
alone who governs all things at all
times.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa583</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David, therefore, mentions this among
other proofs of God's power, that even when the elements appear to be mingled
and confounded together by the utmost fury of the weather, God controls and
moderates these commotions from his throne in heaven. He accordingly adds, for
the sake of explanation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God sits
King for ever.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will give strength to his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He returns to his former
doctrine, namely, that although God exhibits his visible power to the view of
the whole world indiscriminately, yet he exerts it in a peculiar manner in
behalf of his elect people. Moreover, he here describes him in a very different
manner from what he did formerly; that is to say, not as one who overwhelms with
fear and dread those to whom he speaks, but as one who upholds, cherishes, and
strengthens them. By the word <i>strength </i>is to be understood the whole
condition of man. And thus he intimates that every thing necessary to the
preservation of the life of the godly depends entirely upon the grace of God. He
amplifies this by the word <i>bless; </i>for God is said <i>to bless with peace
</i>those whom he treats liberally and kindly, so that nothing is awanting to
the prosperous course of their life, and to their complete happiness. From this
we may learn, that we ought to stand in awe of the majesty of God, in such a
manner as, notwithstanding, to hope from him all that is necessary to our
prosperity; and let us be assuredly persuaded, that since his power is infinite,
we are defended by an invincible fortress.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
30.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David having been delivered from great danger, not
only renders thanks to God apart by himself, but at the same time invites and
exhorts all the pious to perform the same duty. He then confesses that he had
flattered himself too confidently in his prosperity, and that his security had
justly been chastised. In the third place, having briefly expressed his sorrow,
he returns again to thanksgiving.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A psalm sung at the
dedication of David's house.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters doubt whether this psalm was composed by
David, or by some of the prophets after the return of the Jews from the
Babylonish captivity; for <i>house </i>means, in their opinion, <i>the temple.
</i>But as the title expressly mentions David's name, it is more probable that
it is David's private house which is here spoken of. Moreover, the supposition
entertained by some, that when he was about to dedicate his palace, he was
seized with heavy sickness, is founded upon no solid reason. We may rather
conjecture from what is stated in sacred history, that as soon as he had built
his royal palace, he dwelt in it quietly and at his ease. He said to the prophet
Nathan, that he felt ashamed comfortably "to dwell within an house of cedar,"
while "the ark of God dwelt under curtains,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:2.) Besides, to restrict that to sickness which is here spoken
generally concerning some kind of danger, is altogether groundless. It is more
probable, that Absalom being dead, and his faction extinguished, and the fatal
commotion which they had raised put down, David celebrated the divine favor
toward him, as one who had returned from exile to his former station in his
kingdom. For he mentions that he was chastised by God's hand, because, exulting
too much in his happy estate, and almost intoxicated with it, he falsely and
foolishly promised himself entire freedom from adversity. Moreover, when he
began to inherit the magnificent and royal palace, of which I have just spoken,
his kingdom was yet scarcely restored to peace. It was not yet time, therefore,
for forgetfulness of human frailty to creep upon him, which might provoke the
wrath of God, and expose him to dangers which might bring him to the very verge
of destruction. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to suppose, that in this
psalm he celebrates God's favor to him in restoring him to his former state. It
was necessary again to dedicate his house, which had been defiled by the
incestuous whoredoms of Absalom, and other wickednesses; and under this word
seems to be denoted a double blessing, both his restoration to life and to his
kingdom:as if he had said, that after settling the public affairs of his
kingdom, he sung this song, and solemnly dedicated his house to God that he
might live in his own family. But it must be briefly observed concerning this
ceremony of the law, that as we are very slow and cold in thinking of God's
benefits, this exercise was enjoined upon his ancient people, that they might
understand that there is no pure and lawful use of any thing without
thanksgiving to God. As by offering the first-fruits to God, therefore, they
acknowledged that they received the increase of the whole year from him, in like
manner, by consecrating their houses to God, they declared that they were God's
tenants, confessing that they were strangers, and that it was he who lodged and
gave them a habitation there.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa584</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If a levy for war, therefore, took
place, this was a just cause of exemption, when any one alleged that he had not
yet dedicated his house.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa585</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Besides, they were at the same time
admonished by this ceremony, that every one enjoyed his house aright and
regularly, only when he so regulated it that it was as it were a sanctuary of
God, and that true piety and the pure worship of God reigned in it. The types of
the law have now ceased, but we must still keep to the doctrine of Paul, that
whatever things God appoints for our use, are still "sanctified by the word of
God and prayer,"

I will extol thee, O Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As David
had been brought, as it were, from the grave to the life-giving air, he promises
to extol the name of God. It is God who lifts us up with his own hand when we
have been plunged into a profound gulf; and therefore it is our duty, on our
part, to sing his praises with our tongues. By <i>the foes </i>who, he says,
obtained no matter of rejoicing over him, we may understand both domestic and
foreign enemies. Although wicked and evil disposed persons flattered him with
servile adulation, they at the same time cherished secret hatred against him,
and were ready to insult him as soon as an opportunity should occur. In the
second verse, he concludes that he was preserved by the favor of God, alleging
in proof of this, that when he was at the very point of death he directed his
supplications to God alone, and that he immediately felt that he had not done so
in vain. When God hears our prayers, it is a proof which enables us to conclude
with certainty that he is the author of our salvation, and of the deliverance
which we obtain. As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">apr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rapha, </i>signifies <i>to heal, </i>interpreters have been led, from this
consideration, to restrict it to sickness. But as it is certain, that it
sometimes signifies <i>to restore, </i>or<i> to set up again, </i>and is
moreover applied to an altar or a house when they are said to be repaired or
rebuilt, it may properly enough mean here any deliverance. The life of man is in
danger in many other ways than merely from disease; and we know that it is a
form of speech which occurs every where in the Psalms, to say that David was
restored to life whenever the Lord delivered him from any grievous and extreme
danger. For the sake of amplification, accordingly, he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast brought up my soul from
the grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He reckoned that he could not
sufficiently express in words the magnitude of the favor which God had conferred
upon him, unless he compared the darkness of that period to a grave and pit,
into which he had been forced to throw himself hastily, to protect his life by
hiding, until the flame of insurrection was quenched. As one restored to life,
therefore, he proclaims that he had been marvellously delivered from present
death, as if he had been restored to life after he had been dead. And assuredly,
it appears from sacred history, how completely he was overwhelmed with despair
on every side.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

his gratitude, David calls upon all the saints to join with him in singing the
praises of God; and under one class he describes the whole body. As he had been
preserved beyond all expectation, and by this instance had been instructed
concerning God's continual and infinite goodness towards all the godly, he
breaks forth into this exhortation, in which he includes the general deliverance
of the whole church as well as his own. He rehearses not only what God had been
to himself, but also how bountifully and promptly he is accustomed to assist his
people. In short, confirmed by one particular instance he turns his thoughts to
the general truth. The meaning of the Hebrew term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydysj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chasidim, </i>which we have translated <i>meekness, </i>by which David often
describes the faithful, has been already shown in the sixteenth Psalm. Their
heavenly adoption ought to excite them to the exercise of beneficence, that they
may imitate their Father's disposition,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"who maketh his sun to

clause of the verse, may refer to the tabernacle; as if David had exhorted all
the children of God to go before the ark of the covenant, which was the memorial
of God's presence. The Hebrew letter</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa591</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>often denotes a place. I readily subscribe, however, to their
opinion, who think that <i>memorial </i>signifies the same thing as <i>name;
</i>for God has assuredly rendered himself worthy of remembrance by his works,
which are a bright representation of his glory, the sight of which should stir
us up to praise him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For his anger is only for a
moment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is beyond all controversy
that <i>life </i>is opposed here to <i>for a moment, </i>and consequently
signifies long continuance, or the constant progress of time from day to day.
David thus intimates that if God at any time chastise his people, he not only
mitigates the rigour of their punishment, but is immediately appeased, and
moderates his anger; whereas he prolongs his kindness and favor for a long time.
And, as I have already observed, he chose rather to couch his discourse in
general terms, than to speak particularly of himself, that the godly might all
perceive that this continued manifestation of God's favor belongs to them. We
are hereby taught, however, with how much meekness of spirit, and with what
prompt obedience he submitted his back to God's rod. We know that from the very
first bloom of youth, during almost his whole life, he was so tried by a
multiplied accumulation of afflictions, that he might have been accounted
miserable and wretched above all other men; yet in celebrating the goodness of
God, he acknowledges that he had been lightly afflicted only for a short period,
and as it were in passing. Now, what inspired him with so great meekness and
equanimity of mind was, that he put a greater value upon God's benefits, and
submitted himself more quietly to the endurance of the cross, than the world is
accustomed to do. If we are prosperous, we devour God's blessings without
feeling that they are his, or, at least, we indolently allow them to slip away;
but if any thing sorrowful or adverse befall us, we immediately complain of his
severity, as if he had never dealt kindly and mercifully with us. In short, our
own fretfulness and impatience under affliction makes every minute an age;
while, on the other hand, our repining and ingratitude lead us to imagine that
God's favor, however long it may be exercised towards us, is but for a moment.
It is our own perversity, therefore, in reality, which hinders us from
perceiving that God's anger is but of short duration, While his favor is
continued towards us during the whole course of our life. Nor does God in vain
so often declare that he is merciful and gracious to a thousand generations,
long-suffering, slow to anger, and ready to forgive. And as what he says by the
prophet Isaiah has a special reference to the kingdom of Christ, it must be
daily fulfilled,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For a small moment have
I afflicted thee, but with everlasting mercies will I gather thee,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
54:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our condition in this world, I confess, involves us
in such wretchedness, and we are harassed by such a variety of afflictions, that
scarcely a day passes without some trouble or grief. Moreover, amid so many
uncertain events, we cannot be otherwise than full of daily anxiety and fear.
Whithersoever, therefore, men turn themselves, a labyrinth of evils surrounds
them. But however much God may terrify and humble his faithful servants, with
manifold signs of his displeasure, he always be-sprinkles them with the
sweetness of his favor to moderate and assuage their grief. If they weigh,
therefore his <i>anger </i>and <i>his favor </i>in an equal balance, they will
always find it verified, that while the former is but for a moment, the latter
continues to the end of life; nay, it goes beyond it, for it were a grievous
mistake to confine the favor of God within the boundaries of this transitory
life. And it is unquestionably
certain,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa592</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that none but those whose minds have
been raised above the world by a taste of heavenly life really experience this
perpetual and uninterrupted manifestation of the divine favor, which enables
them to bear their chastisements with cheerfulness. Paul, accordingly, that he
may inspire us with invincible patience, refers to this in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:17,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For our light
affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at
the things which are not seen."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, it is to be observed that God never
inflicts such heavy and continued chastisements on his people, without
frequently mitigating them, and sweetening their bitterness with some
consolation. Whoever, therefore, directs his mind to meditation upon the
heavenly life, will never faint under his afflictions, however long continued;
and, comparing them with the exceeding great and manifold favors of God towards
him, he will put such honor on the latter as to judge that God's goodness, in
his estimation, outweighs his displeasure a hundred-fold. In the second clause,
David repeats the same thing
figuratively:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Weeping will lodge
in the evening, and rejoicing shall come in the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not simply mean, that
the affliction would be only for one night, but that if the darkness of
adversity should fall upon the people of God, as it were, in the evening, or at
the setting of the sun, light would soon after arise upon them, to comfort their
sorrow-stricken spirits. The amount of David's instruction is, that were we not
too headstrong, we would acknowledge that the Lord, even when he appears to
overwhelm us for a time with the darkness of affliction, always seasonably
ministers matter of joy, just as the morning arises after the
night.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tranquillity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

upon me on every side, and no danger appeared to occasion fear, my mind sunk as
it were into a deep sleep, and I flattered myself that my happy condition would
continue, and that things would always go on in the same course. This carnal
confidence frequently creeps upon the saints when they indulge themselves in
their prosperity, and so to speak, wallow upon their
dunghill.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa596</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence Jeremiah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:18) compares himself to a wild bullock before the Lord tamed him and
accustomed him to the yoke. This may at first sight appear to be but a small
crime, yet we may gather from its punishment how much it is displeasing to God;
nor will we wonder at this when we consider the root from which it springs and
the fruits which it bears. As deaths innumerable continually hover before our
eyes, and as there are so many examples of change to awaken us to fear and
caution, those must be bewitched with devilish pride who persuade themselves
that their life is privileged above the common lot of the world. They see the
whole earth jumbled together in undistinguishing variety, and its individual
parts in a manner tossed hither and thither; and yet, as if they did not belong
to the human race, they imagine that they shall always continue stable and
liable to no changes. Hence that wantonness of the flesh, with which they so
licentiously indulge their lusts; hence their pride and cruelty, and neglect of
prayer. How indeed should those flee to God, who have no sense of their need to
instigate or move them to that? The children of God have also a pious security
of their own, which preserves their minds in tranquillity amidst the troublesome
storms of the world; like David, who, although he had seen the whole world made
to shake, yet leaning upon the promise of God, was bound to hope well concerning
the continuance of his kingdom. But although the faithful, when raised aloft on
the wings of faith, despise adversity, yet, as they consider themselves liable
to the common troubles of life, they lay their account with enduring them,
&#8212; are every hour prepared to receive wounds, &#8212; shake off their
sluggishness, and exercise themselves in the warfare to which they know that
they were appointed, - and with humility and fear put themselves under God's
protection; nor do they consider themselves safe anywhere else than under his
hand. It was otherwise with David, who, when ensnared by the allurements of his
prosperous state, promised himself unbroken tranquillity not from the word of
God but from his own feelings. The same thing also occurred to the pious King
Hezekiah, who, although lately afflicted with a sore disease, as soon as all was
well and according to his wish, was hurried by the vanity of the flesh to pride
and vain boasting,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 32:24.) By this we are taught to be on our guard when in prosperity,
that Satan may not bewitch us with his flatteries. The more bountifully God
deals with any one, the more carefully ought he to watch against such snares. It
is not, indeed, probable that David had become so hardened as to despise God and
defy all misfortunes, like many of the great men of this world, who, when
immersed among their luxuries and surfeitings, insolently scoff at all God's
judgments; but an effeminate listlessness having come over his mind, he became
more lukewarm in prayer, nor did he depend on the favor of God; in short, he put
too much confidence in his uncertain and transitory
prosperity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! of thy good
pleasure.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse describes the
difference which exists between the confidence which is founded upon the word of
God and the carnal security which springs from presumption. True believers, when
they rely upon God, are not on that account neglectful of prayer. On the
contrary, looking carefully at the multitude of dangers by which they are beset,
and the manifold instances of human frailty which pass before their eyes, they
take warning from them, and pour out their hearts before God. The prophet now
failed in duty as to this matter; because, by anchoring himself on his present
wealth and tranquillity, or spreading his sails to the prosperous winds, he
depended not on the free favor of God in such a manner as to be ready at any
time to resign into his hands the blessings which he had bestowed upon him. The
contrast should be observed between that confidence of stability which arises
from the absence of trouble, and that which rests upon the gracious favor of
God. When David says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strength was established to his
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>some interpreters expound it
of mount Zion. Others understand by it a stronghold or fortified tower, because
in old time fortresses were usually built upon mountains and lofty places. I
understand the word metaphorically to signify a solid support, and therefore
readily admit that the prophet alludes to mount Zion. David thus blames his own
folly, because he considered not, as he ought to have done, that there was no
stability in the nest which he had formed for himself, but in God's good will
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast hidden thy
face.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he confesses, that, after he
was deprived of God's gifts, this served to purge his mind as it were by
medicine from the disease of perverse confidence. A marvellous and incredible
method surely, that God, by hiding his face, and as it were bringing on
darkness, should open the eyes of his servant, who saw nothing in the broad
light of prosperity. But thus it is necessary that we be violently shaken, in
order to drive away the delusions which both stifle our faith and hinder our
prayers, and which absolutely stupify us with a soothing infatuation. And if
David had need of such a remedy, let us not presume that we are endued with so
good a state of heart as to render it unprofitable for us to be in want, in
order to remove from us this carnal confidence, which is as it were diseased
repletion which would otherwise suffocate us. We have, therefore, no reason to
wonder, though God often hides his face from us, when the sight of it, even when
it shines serenely upon us, makes us so wretchedly
blind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! I cried unto
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Now follows the fruit of David's
chastisement. He had been previously sleeping profoundly, and fostering his
indolence by forgetfulness; but being now awakened all on a sudden with fear and
terror, he begins to cry to God. As the iron which has contracted rust cannot be
put to any use until it be heated again in the fire, and beaten with the hammer,
so in like manner, when carnal security has once got the mastery, no one can
give himself cheerfully to prayer, until he has been softened by the cross, and
thoroughly subdued. And this is the chief advantage of afflictions, that while
they make us sensible of our wretchedness, they stimulate us again to supplicate
the favor of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What profit is there in my
blood?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain the verse after this
manner:What will it avail me to have lived, unless thou prolongest my life till
I shall have finished the course of my vocation? But this exposition seems too
strained, especially as the term <i>blood </i>here signifies <i>death, </i>not
<i>life:</i>as if David had said, What profit wilt thou derive from my death?
This interpretation is farther confirmed by the following clause, where he
complains that his lifeless body will then be useless for celebrating the
praises of God. And he seems expressly to mention the <i>truth </i>of God, to
intimate that it would be unsuitable to the character of God to take him out of
the world by an untimely death, before God had accomplished the promise which he
had made to him concerning his future heir. As there is a mutual relation
between God's promises and our faith, truth is, as it were, the medium by which
God openly shows that he does not merely make liberal promises to us in words,
to feed us with empty hopes, and afterwards to disappoint us. Moreover, to
obtain a longer life, David draws an argument from the praises of God, to
celebrate which we are born and nourished:as if he had said, For what purpose
hast thou created me, O God! but that through the whole course of my life I may
be a witness and a herald of thy grace to set forth the glory of thy name? But
my death will cut short the continuance of this exercise, and reduce me to
eternal silence. A question, however, arises here, Does not, it may be said, the
death of true believers glorify God as well as their life? We answer, David
speaks not simply of death, but adds a circumstance which I have already treated
of in the sixth Psalm. As God had promised him a successor, the hope of living
longer being taken from him, he had good reason to be afraid lest this promise
should be frustrated by his death, and was therefore compelled to exclaim,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What profit is there in my
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>It highly concerned the glory of
God that he should be preserved alive, until by obtaining his desire, he should
be able to bear witness to God's faithfulness in completely fulfilling his
promise to him. By inquiring in the end of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall the dust praise
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>he does not mean that the dead are
altogether deprived of power to praise God, as I have already shown in the sixth
Psalm. If the faithful, while encumbered with a burden of flesh, exercise
themselves in this pious duty, how should they desist from it when they are
disencumbered, and set free from the restraints of the body? It ought to be
observed, therefore, that David does not professedly treat of what the dead do,
or how they are occupied, but considers only the purpose for which we live in
this world, which is this, that we may mutually show forth to one another the
glory of God. Having been employed in this exercise to the end of our life,
death at length comes upon us and shuts our
mouth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this clause the Psalmist softens
and corrects his former complaint; for it would have been absurd to expostulate
with God like one who despaired of safety, and to leave off in this fretful
temper. Having asked, therefore, with tears, what profit God would derive from
his death, he encourages himself to a more unconstrained manner of prayer, and,
conceiving new hope, calls upon God for mercy and help. He puts God's favor,
however, in the first place, from whom alone he could expect the help which he
implored.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
30:11-12	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11. </b>Thou hast turned my
mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness.<b> 12.</b> That my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent: O
Jehovah my God! I will set forth thy praise for
ever.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast turned my mourning into
dancing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David concludes the psalm as he
had begun it, with thanksgiving. He affirms that it was by the help and blessing
of God that he had escaped safe; and he then adds, that the final object of his
escape was, that he might employ the rest of his life in celebrating the praises
of God. Moreover, he shows us that he was not insensible or obdurate under his
afflictions, but mourned in heaviness and sorrow; and he also shows that his
very mourning had been the means of leading him to pray to God to deprecate his
wrath. Both these points are most worthy of our observation, in order, first,
that we may not suppose that the saints are guilty of stoical insensibility,
depriving them of all feeling of grief; and, secondly, that we may perceive that
in their mourning they were exercised to repentance. This latter he denotes by
the term <i>sackcloth. </i>It was a common practice among the ancients to clothe
themselves with sackcloth when
mourning,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa597</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for no other reason, indeed, than that
like guilty criminals, they might approach their heavenly Judge, imploring his
forgiveness with all humility, and testifying by this clothing their humiliation
and dissatisfaction with themselves.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa598</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We know also that the orientals were
addicted beyond all others to ceremonies. We perceive, therefore, that David,
although he patiently submitted himself to God, was not free from grief. We also
see that his sorrow was "after a godly sort," as Paul speaks,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10;) for to testify his penitence he clothed himself with
sackcloth. By the term <i>dancing, </i>he does not mean any wanton or profane
leaping, but a sober and holy exhibition of joy like that which sacred Scripture
mentions when David conveyed the ark of the covenant to its place,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 6:16.) If we may conjecture, however, we may gather from this, that the
great danger of which David speaks in this psalm is by some improperly
restricted to sickness, as it was very improbable that he would put on sackcloth
when he was confined to a sick-bed. This, indeed, would not be a sufficient
reason of itself, but in a doubtful case, as this is, it is not destitute of
force. David therefore means, that, laying aside his mourning apparel, he
returned from a state of heaviness and sorrow to joy; and this he ascribes to
the grace of God alone, asserting that he had been his
deliverer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That my glory may sing praise
to thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse he more fully
expresses his acknowledgement of the purpose for which God had preserved him
from death, and that he would be careful to render him a proper return of
gratitude. Some refer the word <i>glory </i>to the body, and some to the soul,
or the higher powers of the mind. Others, as the pronoun <i>my, </i>which we
have supplied, is not in the Hebrew text, prefer to translate it in the
accusative case, supplying the word <i>every man, </i>in this way:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That every man may celebrate thy
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if the prophet had said, This
is a blessing worthy of being celebrated by the public praises of all men. But
as all these interpretations are strained, I adhere to the sense which I have
given. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwbk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kebod, </i>which signifies <i>glory, </i>it is well known, is sometimes
employed metaphorically to signify <i>the tongue, </i>as we have seen in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:9. And as David adds immediately after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will celebrate thy praise for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the context demands that he should
particularly speak of his own duty in this place. His meaning, therefore, is, O
Lord, as I know that thou hast preserved me for this purpose, that thy praises
may resound from my tongue, I will faithfully discharge this service to thee,
and perform my part even unto death.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To sing, and not be
silent,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a Hebrew <i>amplification;

glory.</font><br></div>

all the saints to be of good hope, as they had in him a most excellent and

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee, O Jehovah! have I
put my trust.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some are of opinion that
this psalm was composed by David, after he had most unexpectedly escaped out of
the wilderness of Maon; to which I do not object, although it is only a doubtful
conjecture. Certainly he celebrates one or more of the greatest of his dangers.
In the commencement he tells us what kind of prayer he offered in his agony and
distress; and its language breathes affection of the most ardent nature. He
takes it for a ground of hope that he trusted in the Lord, or continued to trust
in him; for the verb in the past tense seems to denote a continued act. He held
it as a principle, that the hope which depends upon God cannot possibly be
disappointed. Meanwhile, we see how he brings forward nothing but faith alone;
promising himself deliverance only because he is persuaded that he will be saved
by the help and favor of God. But as this doctrine has been expounded already,
and will yet occur oftener than once, it is sufficient at present to have
glanced at it. Oh! that all of us would practice it in such a manner as that,
whenever we approach to God, we may be able with David to declare that our
prayers proceed from this source, namely, from a firm persuasion that our safety
depends on the power of God. The particle signifying<i> for ever </i>may be
explained in two ways. As God sometimes withdraws his favor, the meaning may not
unsuitably be, Although I am now deprived of thy help, yet cast me not off
utterly, or for evermore. Thus David, wishing to arm himself with patience
against his temptations, would make a contrast between these two things, &#8212;
being in distress for a time, and remaining in a state of
confusion.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa600</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if any one choose rather to
understand his words in this way, "Whatever afflictions befall me, may God be
ready to help me, and ever and anon stretch forth his hand to me, as the case
requires," I would not reject this meaning any more than the other. David
desires to be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivered in the
righteousness of God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because God
displays his righteousness in performing his promise to his servants. It is too
much refinement of reasoning to assert that David here betakes himself to the
righteousness which God freely bestows on his people, because his own
righteousness by works was of no avail. Still more out of place is the opinion
of those who think that God preserves the saints according to his righteousness;
that is to say, because having acted so meritoriously, justice requires that
they should obtain their reward. It is easy to see from the frequent use of the
term in The Psalms, that God's righteousness means his faithfulness, in the
exercise of which he defends all his people who commit themselves to his
guardianship and protection. David, therefore, confirms his hope from the
consideration of the nature of God, who cannot deny himself, and who always
continues like
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
incline thine ear unto me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words
express with how much ardor David's soul was stimulated to pray. He affects no
splendid or ornate language, as rhetoricians are wont to do; but only describes
in suitable figures the vehemence of his desire. In praying that he may be
delivered <i>speedily </i>there is shown the greatness of his danger, as if he
had said, All will soon be over with my life, unless God make haste to help me.
By the words, <i>house of defense, fortress, </i>and <i>rock, </i>he intimates,
that, being unable to resist his enemies, his hope rests only on the protection
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou art my
rock.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse may be read as one
sentence, thus:As thou art like a tower for my defense, for thy name's sake
direct and guide me during my whole life. And thus the conjunction, as in many
similar cases, would be superfluous. But I rather prefer a different sense,
namely, that David, by interjecting this reflection, encourages himself not only
to earnestness in prayer, but also in the confident hope of obtaining his
requests. We know, at all events, that it is usual with him to mingle such
things in his prayers as may serve to remove his doubts, and to confirm his
assurance. Having, therefore, expressed his need, he assures himself, in order
to encourage and animate himself, that his prayer shall certainly have a happy
answer. He<i> </i>had formerly said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be thou my strong rock and
fortress</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assuredly thou art my rock, and
my fortress</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>intimating, that he did not
throw out these words rashly, like unbelievers, who, although they are
accustomed to ask much from God, are kept in suspense by the dread of uncertain
events. From this he also draws another encouragement, that he shall have God
for his guide and governor during the whole course of his life. He uses two
words, <i>lead </i>and <i>guide, </i>to express the same thing, and this he does
(at least so I explain it) on account of the various accidents and unequal
vicissitudes by which the lives of men are tried:as if he had said, Whether I
must climb the steep mountain, or struggle along through rough places, or walk
among thorns, I trust that thou wilt be my continual guide. Moreover, as men
will always find in themselves matter for doubt, if they look to their own
merits,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa601</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David expressly asks that God may be
induced to help <i>him for his own name's sake, </i>or from regard to his own
glory, as, properly speaking, there is no other thing which can induce him to
aid us. It must therefore be remembered, that <i>God's name, </i>as it is
opposed to all merit whatever, is the only cause of our salvation. In the next
verse, under the metaphor of a <i>net, </i>he appears to designate the snares
and artifices with which his enemies encompassed him. We know that conspiracies
were frequently formed against his life, which would have left him no room for
escape; and as his enemies were deeply skilled in policy, and hating him with an
inconceivable hatred, were eagerly bent on his destruction, it was impossible
for him to be saved from them by any human power. On this account he calls God
<i>his strength; </i>as if he had said, He alone is sufficient to rend asunder
all the snares with which he sees his afflicted people
entangled.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
31:5-8	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> Into thy hand I commit my

that give heed to lying vanities; but I have trusted in Jehovah. <b>7.</b> I
will be glad and rejoice in thy goodness, because thou hast regarded my
affliction: thou hast known my soul in distresses. <b>8.</b> And thou hast not
shut me up in the hand of mine enemy:</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into thy hand I commit my
spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David again declares his faith
to God, and affirms that he had such high thoughts of his providence, as to cast
all his cares upon it. Whoever commits himself into God's hand and to his
guardianship, not only constitutes him the arbiter of life and death to him, but
also calmly depends on him for protection amidst all his dangers. The verb is in
the future tense, "I will commit," and it unquestionably denotes a continued
act, and is therefore fitly translated into the present tense. It is also to be
observed, that no man can possibly commit his life to God with sincerity, but he
who considers himself exposed to a thousand deaths, and that his life hangs by a
thread, or differs almost nothing from a breath which passes suddenly away.
David being thus at the point of despair, leaves nothing to himself to do but
this &#8212; to go on his way, trusting in God as the keeper and governor of his
life. It is marvellous, that, although many things distress us all, scarcely one
in a hundred is so wise as to commit his life into God's hand. Multitudes live
from day to day as merry and careless as if they were in a quiet nest, free from
all disturbance; but as soon as they encounter any thing to terrify them, they
are ready to die for anguish. It thus happens that they never betake themselves
to God, either because they deceive themselves with vain delusions, flattering
themselves that all will yet be well,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa603</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or because they are so stricken with
dread and stupified with amazement, that they have no desire for his fatherly
care. Farther, as various tempests of grief disturb us, and even sometimes throw
us down headlong, or drag us from the direct path of duty, or at least remove us
from our post, the only remedy which exists for setting these things at rest is
to consider that God, who is the author of our life, is also its preserver.
This, then, is the only means of lightening all our burdens, and preserving us
from being swallowed up of over-much sorrow. Seeing, therefore, that God
condescends to undertake the care of our lives, and to support them, although
they are often exposed to various sorts of death, let us learn always to flee to
this asylum; nay, the more that any one is exposed to dangers, let him exercise
himself the more carefully in meditating on it. In short, let this be our shield
against all dangerous attacks &#8212; our haven amidst all tossings and tempests
&#8212; that, although our safety may be beyond all human hope, God is the
faithful guardian of it; and let this again arouse us to prayer, that he would
defend us, and make our deliverance sure. This confidence will likewise make
every man forward to discharge his duty with alacrity, and constantly and
fearlessly to struggle onward to the end of his course. How does it happen that
so many are slothful and indifferent, and that others perfidiously forsake their
duty, but because, overwhelmed with anxiety, they are terrified at dangers and
inconveniences, and leave no room for the operation of the providence of
God?</font><br><font face="Palatino">To conclude, whoever relies not on the
providence of God, so as to commit his life to its faithful guardianship, has
not yet learned aright what it is to live. On the other hand, he who shall
entrust the keeping of his life to God's care, will not doubt of its safety even
in the midst of death. We must therefore put our life into God's hand, not only
that he may keep it safely in this world, but also that he may preserve it from
destruction in death itself, as Christ's own example has taught us. As David
wished to have his life prolonged amidst the dangers of death, so Christ passed
out of this transitory life that his soul might be saved in death. This is a
general prayer, therefore, in which the faithful commit their lives to God,
first, that he may protect them by his power, so long as they are exposed to the
dangers of this world; and, secondly, that he may preserve them safe in the
grave, where nothing is to be seen but destruction. We ought farther to assure
ourselves, that we are not forsaken of God either in life or in death; for those
whom God brings safely by his power to the end of their course, he at last
receives to himself at their death. This is one of the principal places of
Scripture which are most suitable for correcting distrust. It teaches us, first,
that the faithful ought not to torment themselves above measure with unhappy
cares and anxieties; and, secondly, that they should not be so distracted with
fear as to cease from performing their duty, nor decline and faint in such a
manner as to grasp at vain hopes and deceitful helps, nor give way to fears and
alarms; and, in fine, that they should not be afraid of death, which, though it
destroys the body, cannot extinguish the soul. This, indeed, ought to be our
principal argument for overcoming all temptations, that Christ, when commending
his soul to his Father, undertook the guardianship of the souls of all his
people. Stephen, therefore, calls upon him to be his keeper, saying, "Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440759&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

used to signify life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
hast redeemed me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some translate the
past tense here into the future; but, in my opinion, without any reason. For it
is evident to me, that David is here encouraging himself to continued confidence
in God, by calling to remembrance the proofs of his favor which he had already
experienced.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa604</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is no small encouragement to us for
the future, to be assuredly persuaded that God will watch over our life, because
he hath been our deliverer already. Hence the epithet by which David recognises
God. He calls him <i>true </i>or<i> faithful, </i>because he believes that he
will continue the same to him for ever that he has already been. Accordingly,
this is as it were a bond by which he joins to the former benefits which God had
conferred upon him confidence in prayer, and the hope of aid for the time to
come:as if he had said, Lord, thou who art ever the same, and changest not thy
mind like men, hast already testified in very deed that thou art the defender of
my life:now, therefore, I commit my life, of which thou hast been the preserver,
into thy hands. What David here declares concerning his temporal life, Paul
transfers to eternal salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I

much confidence from temporal deliverance, it is more than wicked and ungrateful
on our part, if the redemption purchased by the blood of Christ does not furnish
us with invincible courage against all the devices of
Satan.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I hate all that give heed to lying vanities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>In order the better to express that his faith was firmly fixed on God, he
affirms that he was free from the vile affections which usually turn away our
minds from God, and under which unbelievers for the most part labor. For we know
that by contrasting things which are opposite, a subject is better illustrated.
To restrict the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lbh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hebel, </i>which we have rendered <i>vanities, </i>to<i> </i>magical arts, as
some interpreters do, is absurd.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa605</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I confess, indeed, that the Orientals
were so much addicted to these impostures, that it was a common evil among them.
But as the devices by which Satan ensnares the minds of men, and the allurements
by which he draws them away from God, are innumerable, it is not at all probable
that the prophet mentions one species only. Whatever vain hopes, therefore, we
form to ourselves, which may draw us off from our confidence in God, David
generally denominates <i>vanities, </i>yea, <i>false </i>or <i>lying vanities,
</i>because, although they feed us for a time with magnificent promises, in the
end they beguile and disappoint us. He affirms, therefore, that casting away the
vanities which men usually invent to support their hopes, he relies solely on
God. And as men not only intoxicate themselves personally with the deceitful
allurements of the world, but in this respect also deceive one another, the
prophet expressly declares, with a view that we may carefully avoid them, unless
we wish to be wilfully entangled in their dangerous toils, that he hated all who
involved themselves in such lies. The second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have trusted in
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>must be read in connection with
the first, because it both assigns the cause of his hatred of lying vanities,
and shows that it is impossible for men to have any true faith in God, unless
they abhor whatever would draw them away from
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be glad and rejoice in
thy goodness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is inserted a
thanksgiving, although many are rather of opinion that David's prayer is
suspended, and that he makes a vow, when he shall be delivered from present
danger. But as no condition is annexed, I am rather inclined to think that
stopping all at once in the middle of his prayer, he promises himself a
deliverance, for which he will have abundant matter for giving thanks. Nor is it
to be wondered at that different feelings are mingled in the psalms in which
David has set forth his own temptations, as well as the resistance which his
faith made to them, considering also that when he sung the praises of God, after
having already obtained deliverance from him, he embraces different periods in
his song, as he here says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
God had regarded his affliction, intimating</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by
this the effect of the assistance which God had afforded him. And that he may
the better confirm this, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he had not been delivered
into the hands of his enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>in which
words there is an implied antithesis, namely, that when he was encompassed on
every side by severe afflictions, he was marvellously delivered by God. This is
also farther intimated by the following sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast set my feet in a large
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa606</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which denotes a sudden and
unexpected change.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
31:9-13	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b> Have mercy upon me, O
Jehovah! for I am in trouble: mine eye, my soul, and my belly, are consumed by
reason of anger. <b>10.</b> For my life is wasted by reason of grief, and my

consumed. <b>11.</b> I was a reproach by reason of all mine enemies, yea,
exceedingly to my neighbors, and a fear to my acquaintances; and they who saw me

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy upon me, O
Jehovah! </i></font><font face="Palatino">To move God to succor him, he
magnifies the greatness of his misery and grief by the number of his complaints;
not that God needs arguments to persuade him, but because he allows the faithful
to deal familiarly with him, that they may disburden themselves of their cares.
The greater the number of afflictions with which they are oppressed, the more do
they encourage themselves, while bewailing them before God, in the hope of
obtaining his assistance. These forms of expression may seem hyperbolical, but
it is obvious that it was David's purpose to declare and set forth what he had
felt in his own person. First, he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his eyes, his soul, and his
belly, were consumed with grief.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From
this it appears that it was neither lightly nor for a short time that he was
thus tormented and vexed by these calamities. Indeed, he was endued with so much
meekness of spirit that he would not allow himself to be excited easily, and by
a slight circumstance, nor vexed by immoderate sorrow. He had also been for a
long time inured to the endurance of troubles. We must, therefore, admit that
his afflictions were incredibly severe, when he gave way to such a degree of
passion. By the word <i>anger, </i>too, he shows that he was not at all times of
such iron-like firmness, or so free from sinful passion, as that his grief did
not now and then break forth into an excess of impetuosity and keenness. Whence
we infer that the saints have often a severe and arduous conflict with their own
passions; and that although their patience has not always been free from
peevishness, yet by carefully wrestling against it, they have at last attained
this much, that no accumulation of troubles has overwhelmed them. By <i>life
</i>some understand the vital senses, an interpretation which I do not
altogether reject. But I prefer to explain it as simply meaning, that, being
consumed with grief, he felt his life and his years sliding away and failing.
And by these words again, David bewails not so much his pusillanimity of mind as
the grievousness of his calamities; although he was by no means ashamed to
confess his infirmity, for which he was anxiously seeking a remedy. When he
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his strength failed
under his sorrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>some interpreters
prefer reading, <i>under his iniquity; </i>and I confess that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>on, </i>bears both significations,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa608</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nay, more frequently it signifies <i>an
offense </i>or <i>a fault. </i>But as it is sometimes used for <i>punishment,
</i>I have chosen the sense which appears most agreeable to the context. And
although it is true that David was accustomed to ascribe the afflictions which
he at any time suffered to his own fault, yet, as he is only recounting his
miseries here, without mentioning the cause of them, it is probable that,
according to his usual manner, he expresses the same thing twice by different
words.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was a reproach by reason of
all mine enemies.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Others translate thus
-<i> more than mine enemies, </i>and as the Hebrew letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
mem, </i>is often used as a sign of comparison, they interpret this clause to
mean that David's friends and acquaintances reproached him more than all his
enemies. But, in my opinion, he intended to express a different idea, namely,
that as he was everywhere hated, and his enemies had induced almost the whole
realm to take part with them against him, he had an evil name even among his
friends and neighbors; just as popular opinion, like a violent tempest, usually
carries all before it. I suppose, therefore, that the Hebrew copula
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
vau, </i>is used for the sake of amplification, to show that David was an object
of detestation, not only to strangers to whom he was formerly unknown, but also
to his principal friends. He adds, likewise, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when they saw him abroad they
fled from him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the adverb, <i>abroad,
</i>he means to say, that they did not think the miserable man worthy of a near
approach to them; nay, that they fled from the very sight of him, at however
great a distance, lest the contagion of his misery should reach them, and
because they reckoned it would be injurious and disgraceful to them to show him
any sign of friendship.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am forgotten as one
dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist still pursues the
same idea, and complains that he was as completely blotted out of all men's
remembrance as if he had been dead. The memory of some men after their death
flourishes for a time among survivors, but it more frequently vanishes; for
there is no longer any intercourse between the quick and the dead, nor can the
living be of any farther service to the dead. David illustrates this idea by the
metaphor of <i>a broken vessel,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa609</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which denotes utter contempt and
meanness; as if he had said, that he was accounted no longer worthy of any place
or respect. He adds, in fine, that he was railed upon by the multitude, and
agitated with terrors. I would, however, prefer translating the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rabbim, </i>by <i>the great,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa610</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>rather than by <i>many. </i>When
great men, who are often as powerful in judgment as in authority, slander and
defame us as wicked persons, this adds to the indignity with which we are
treated, because, whatever they say in condemnation of us has the effect of
prejudicing the common people against us. It will therefore be very suitable to
understand the words as meaning that David was ignominiously condemned by the
whole order of the nobility; and thus the innocence of this afflicted man was
thrown into the shade by their greatness. This interpretation is confirmed by
what immediately follows:&#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear encloseth me on every
side,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa611</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> while they consult
together against me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As he is still
speaking of the same persons, it is certain that this language applies more
appropriately to the nobles than to the common people. Moreover, we see that the
primary object of the wicked in the deceitful counsels by which they conspired
to destroy David, was to create among the whole people hatred against him as a
wicked and reprobate man. We also see that while they mangled his reputation,
they did it in such a manner as that they covered their wickedness under the
appearance of grave and considerate procedure, in consulting among themselves to
destroy him as a man who no longer ought to be tolerated on the earth. It is not
to be wondered at, therefore, that his mind was wounded, as we have just seen,
by so many and so sharp
temptations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

<i>And I have trusted in thee; </i>but the Hebrew copulative particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau, and, </i>is used here instead of the adversative particle <i>yet, </i>or
<i>nevertheless. </i>David, setting the steadfastness of his faith in opposition
to the assaults of the temptations of which he has made mention, denies that he
had ever fainted, but rather maintains, on the contrary, that he stood firm in
his hope of deliverance from God. Nor does this imply that he boasted of being
so magnanimous and courageous that he could not be overthrown through the
infirmity of the flesh. However contrary to one another they appear, yet these
things are often joined together, as they ought to be, in the same person,
namely, that while he pines away with grief, and is deprived of all strength, he
is nevertheless supported by so strong a hope that he ceases not to call upon
God. David, therefore, was not so overwhelmed in deep sorrow, and other direful
sufferings, as that the hidden light of faith could not shine inwardly in his
heart; nor did he groan so much under the weighty load of his temptations, as to
be prevented from arousing himself to call upon God. He struggled through many
obstacles to be able to make the confession which he here makes. He next defines
the manner of his faith, namely, that he reflected with himself thus that God
would never fail him nor forsake him. Let us mark his manner of
speech:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have said, Thou art my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In these words he intimates that he
was so entirely persuaded of this truth, that God was his God, that he would not
admit even a suggestion to the contrary. And until this persuasion prevails so
as to take possession of our minds, we shall always waver in uncertainty. It is,
however, to be observed, that this declaration is not only inward and secret -
made rather in the heart than with the tongue - but that it is directed to God
himself, as to him who is the alone witness of it. Nothing is more difficult,
when we see our faith derided by the whole world, than to direct our speech to
God only, and to rest satisfied with this testimony which our conscience gives
us, <i>that he is our God. </i>And certainly it is an undoubted proof of genuine
faith, when, however fierce the waves are which beat against us, and however
sore the assaults by which we are shaken, we hold fast this as a fixed
principle, that we are constantly under the protection of God, and can say to
him freely, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art our
God.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My times are in thy
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That he might the more cheerfully
commit the preservation of his person to God, he assures us, that, trusting to
his divine guardianship, he did not trouble himself about those casual and
unforeseen events which men commonly dread. The import of his language is, Lord,
it is thy prerogative, and thou alone hast the power, to dispose of both my life
and my death. Nor does he use the plural number, in my opinion, without reason;
but rather to mark the variety of casualties by which the life of man is usually
harassed. It is a cold exposition to restrict the phrase, <i>my times, </i>to
the time which he had to live, as if David meant no more than that his time or
his days on earth were in God's hand. On the contrary, I am of opinion that,
while he mused on the various revolutions and manifold dangers which continually
hang over us, and the manifold unlooked-for events which from time to time
happen, he nevertheless confidently reposed upon the providence of God, which he
believed to be, according to the common saying, the arbiter both of good and of
evil fortune. In the first clause we see that he not only denominates God the
governor of the world in general, but also affirms that his life is in his hand;
and not only so, but that to whatever agitations it might be subjected, and
whatever trials and vicissitudes might befall him, he was safe under his
protection. On this he founds his prayer, that God would preserve and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver him from the hand of his
enemies.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have said formerly, and we
shall see in many instances hereafter, that this form of speech is taken from
the common apprehension of men, who think that God regards them not, unless he
really show his care of them by its effects. According to the judgment of sense,
afflictions hide his countenance, just as clouds obscure the brightness of the
sun. David therefore supplicates that <i>God, </i>by affording him immediate
assistance, would make it evident to him that he enjoyed his grace and favor,
which it is not very easy to discern amidst the darkness of afflictions. Now,
God is said to lift the light of his countenance upon us in two ways; either
when he opens his eyes to take care of our affairs, or when he shows to us his
favor. These two things are indeed inseparable, or rather, the one depends upon
the other. But by the first mode of speech, we, according to our carnal
conceptions, attribute to God a mutability which, properly speaking, does not
belong to him:whereas the second form of speech indicates, that our own eyes,
rather than the eyes of God, are shut or heavy when he seems to have no regard
to our afflictions. By the word <i>preserve </i>David explains what he meant by
the former expression; but as there was at that time no way of safety apparent
to him, he encourages himself to hope for it by setting before him <i>the
goodness of God.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! let me not be
ashamed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words, the Psalmist
continues his prayer, and to strengthen his hopes, he contrasts himself with his
enemies; for it would have been more than absurd to permit those who by their
wickedness so openly provoked the wrath of God to escape with impunity, and that
one who was innocent and relied upon God should be disappointed and made a
laughing-stock. Here, accordingly, we perceive what the Psalmist's comparison
implies. Moreover, instead of speaking of his hope or trust, he now speaks of
his calling upon God, saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have called on thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he does this
with good reason, for he who relies on the providence of God must flee to him
with prayers and strong cries. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
be silent in the grave,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>implies that
death, when it befalls the ungodly, restrains and prevents them from doing
farther injury. This silence is opposed both to their deceitful and treacherous
devices, and to their outrageous insolence. In the very next verse, therefore,
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let lying lips be put to
silence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which, in my opinion, includes
both their craftiness, and the false pretences and calumnies by which they
endeavor to accomplish their designs, and also the vain boasting in which they
indulge themselves. For he tells us that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they speak with harshness and
severity against the righteous, in pride and
scorn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>because it was their froward
conceit, which almost always begets contempt, that made David's enemies so bold
in lying. Whoever proudly arrogates to himself more than is his due, will almost
necessarily treat others with
contempt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

The interrogatory form of the sentence has a peculiar emphasis; for David not
only asserts that God is good, but he is ravished with admiration of the
goodness which he had experienced. It was this experience, undoubtedly, which
caused him break out into the rapturous language of this verse; for he had been
marvellously and unexpectedly delivered from his calamities. By his example,
therefore, he enjoins believers to rise above the apprehension of their own
understanding, in order that they may promise themselves, and expect far more
from the grace of God than human reason is able to conceive. He says that the
goodness of God is <i>hidden </i>for his servants, because it is a treasure
which is peculiar to them. It, no doubt, extends itself in various ways to the
irreligious and unworthy, and is set before them indiscriminately; but it
displays itself much more plenteously and clearly towards the faithful, because
it is they alone who enjoy all God's benefits for their salvation.

<div><font face="Palatino">and shows himself bountiful even to the irrational
creation; but he declares himself a Father, in the true and full sense of the
term, to those only who are his servants. It is not without reason, therefore,
that the goodness of God is said to be hidden for the faithful, whom alone he
accounts worthy of enjoying his favor most intimately and tenderly. Some give a
more subtle interpretation of the phrase, <i>the goodness of God is hidden,
</i>explaining it as meaning that <i>God, </i>by often exercising his children
with crosses and afflictions, hides his favor from them, although, at the same
time, he does not forget them. It is more probable, however, that it should be
understood of a treasure which God has set apart and laid up in store for them,
unless perhaps we choose to refer it to the experience of the saints, because
they alone, as I have said, experience in their souls the fruit of divine
goodness; whereas brutish stupidity hinders the wicked from acknowledging God as
a beneficent Father, even while they are devouring greedily his good things. And
thus it comes to pass, that while the goodness of God fills and overspreads all
parts of the world, it is notwithstanding generally unknown. But the mind of the
sacred writer will be more clearly perceived from the contrast which exists
between the faithful and those who are strangers to God's love. As a provident
man will regulate his liberality towards all men in such a manner as not to
defraud his children or family, nor impoverish his own house, by spending his
substance prodigally on others; so God, in like manner, in exercising his
beneficence to aliens from his family, knows well how to reserve for his own
children that which belongs to them as it were by hereditary right; that is to
say, because of their adoption.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa613</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The attempt of Augustine to prove from
these words that those who unbelievingly dread God's judgment have no experience
of his goodness, is most inappropriate. To perceive his mistaken view of the
passage, it is only necessary to look to the following clause, in which David
says that God makes the world to perceive that he exercises inestimable goodness
towards those who serve him, both in protecting them and in providing for their
welfare. Whence we learn, that it is not of the everlasting blessedness which is
reserved for the godly in heaven that the Psalmist here speaks, but of the
protection and other blessings which belong to the preservation of the present
life; which he declares to be so manifest that even the ungodly themselves are
forced to become <i>eye-witnesses </i>of them. The world, I admit, passes over
all the works of God with its eyes shut, and is especially ignorant of his
fatherly care of the saints; still it is certain that there shine forth such
daily proofs of it, that even the reprobate cannot but see them, except in so
far as they willingly shut their eyes against the light. David, therefore,
speaks according to truth, when he declares that God gives evidences of his
goodness to his people <i>before the sons of men, </i>that it may be clearly
seen that they do not serve him unadvisedly or in
vain.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt hide them in the
secret of thy countenance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse
the Psalmist specially commends the grace of God, because it preserves and
protects the faithful against all harm. As Satan assiduously and by innumerable
means opposes their welfare, and as the greater part of the world is at deadly
war with them, they must be exposed to many dangers. Unless God, therefore,
protected them by his power, and came from time to time to their aid, their
condition would be most miserable. The Psalmist makes an allusion to <i>the
hiding </i>which he had just mentioned, and although the metaphor may, at first
sight, appear somewhat harsh, it very aptly expresses, that provided the Lord
take care of them, the faithful are perfectly safe under his protection alone.
By this eulogium, therefore, he sublimely extols the power of divine Providence,
because it alone suffices to ward off every species of evil, and while it shines
upon the godly, it blinds the eyes of all the wicked, and weakens their
hands.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa615</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the opinion of some, the Psalmist,
when he speaks </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the secret of
God's countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>refers to the
sanctuary, an interpretation which I do not altogether reject, although it does
not appear to me sufficiently solid. Again, he says that God hides the faithful
from </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the pride of man and the
strife of tongues,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because, if God
restrain not the wicked, we know that they have the audacity to break forth with
outrageous violence against the truly godly; but however unbridled their lust
and insolence may be, God preserves his people from harm, by wondrously covering
them with the brightness of his countenance. Some translate the Hebrew word

without any reason; nor, indeed, does the etymology of the word admit of it, for
it comes from a root which signifies <i>to lift up, </i>or <i>to elevate. </i>To
<i>pride </i>is added <i>the strife of tongues, </i>because God's children have
cause to fear not only the inhuman deeds of their enemies, but also their still
more wicked and violent calumnies, as David himself more than enough
experienced. And as our innocence ought to be justly dearer to us than our life,
let us learn to cultivate uprightness in such a manner as that, trusting to
God's protection, we may disregard every false calumny. And let us always
remember that it is God's peculiar prerogative to vindicate his people from all
unjust reproaches.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be

Psalmist here proceeds to apply to his own circumstances, and he declares that
the goodness of God in preserving his life was wondrously displayed. As he
speaks of aid which had been suddenly and unexpectedly afforded him in very
desperate circumstances, those interpreters judge aright who here supply <i>as,

been.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

distrust he deserved to be deserted by God and left to perish. It is true that
to confess this before men he felt to be a shameful thing; but that he may the
more fully illustrate the grace of God to him, he hesitates not to publish the
shame of his fault. He repeats almost the same acknowledgement in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:11, "I said in my haste, All men are liars." I am aware that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zpj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chaphaz, </i>is explained by some as meaning <i>flight; </i>as if David, in
fleeing from death, because he was unable to make resistance, was stricken with
this fear. But I refer it rather to his trouble of mind. Whether, therefore, we
translate it <i>haste </i>or <i>fear, </i>it means that he had been, as it were,
carried headlong to entertain the thought that he was neglected by God. And this
haste is opposed to calm and deliberate consideration; for although David was
stricken with fear, he did not faint under the trial, and this persuasion did
not continue fixed in his mind. For we know that the faithful are often
disquieted by fears and the heat of impatience, or driven headlong as it were by
their too hasty or precipitate wishes, but afterwards they come to themselves.
That David's faith had never been overthrown by this temptation appears from the
context, for he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God had heard the voice of
his supplications</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but if his faith had
been extinguished, he could not have brought his mind earnestly to engage in
prayer, and therefore this complaint was only a lapse of the tongue uttered in
haste. Now if peevish hastiness of thought could drive this holy prophet of God,
a man who was adorned with so many excellencies, to despair, how much reason
have we to fear, lest our minds should fail and fatally ruin us? This confession
of David, as we have already observed, serves<i> </i>to magnify the grace of
God; but at the same time he sufficiently shows, in the second clause of the
verse, that his faith, although severely shaken, had not been altogether
eradicated, because he ceased not meanwhile to pray. The saints often wrestle in
this manner with their distrust, that partly they may not despond, and that
partly they may gather courage and stimulate themselves to prayer. Nor does the
weakness of the flesh, even when they are almost overthrown, hinder them from
showing that they are unwearied and invincible champions before God. But
although David stoutly resisted temptation, he nevertheless acknowledges himself
unworthy of God's grace, of which he in some measure deprived himself by his
doubt. For the Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ka</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aken, </i>is here to be understood adversatively and rendered <i>yet,
</i>intimating that David had been preserved without any desert of his own,
inasmuch as God's immeasurable goodness strove with his unbelief. But as it is a
sign of affirmation in Hebrew, I have thought proper to translate it, <i>Yet
truly. </i>I have no doubt that he opposes his language to the various
temptations with which, it is probable, his mind had been driven hither and
thither.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O love Jehovah, all ye his
meek ones!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In my opinion, the Psalmist
does not here exhort the saints to fear and reverence God, as many think, but
encourages them to confide in him; or, in other words, to devote themselves
wholly to him, to put all their hope in him, and to rely entirely upon him,
without seeking to any other. Whence is it that our own fond devices delight us,
but because we do not delight in God so much as we ought, and because our
affections do not cleave to him? This love of God, therefore, comprehends in it
all the desires of the heart. By nature, all men greatly desire to be in a
prosperous or happy state; but while the greater number are fascinated by the
allurements of the world, and prefer its lies and impostures, scarcely one in a
hundred sets his heart on God. The reason which immediately follows confirms
this interpretation; for the inspired Psalmist exhorts <i>the meek </i>to love
God, because he <i>preserves the faithful, </i>which is as if he had desired
them to rest satisfied with his guardianship, and to acknowledge that in it they
had sufficient succor.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa620</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the meantime, he admonishes them to
keep a good conscience, and to cultivate uprightness, since God promises to
preserve only such as are upright and faithful. On the other hand, he declares
that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plentifully recompenses
the proud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that when we observe
them succeeding prosperously for a time, an unworthy emulation may not entice us
to imitate them, and that their haughtiness, and the outrage they commit, while
they think they are at liberty to do what they please, may not crush and break
our spirits. The amount of the whole is this, Although the ungodly flatter
themselves, while they proceed in their wickedness with impunity, and believers
are harassed with many fears and dangers, yet devote yourselves to God, and rely
upon his grace, for he will always defend the faithful, and reward the proud as
they deserve. Concerning the meaning of the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rtyAl[</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
al-yether, </i>which we have rendered
<i>plentifully,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa621</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>interpreters are not agreed.
Some translate it <i>pride, </i>meaning that to those who behave themselves
proudly, God will render according to their pride; others translate it <i>to
overflowing, </i>or <i>beyond measure, </i>because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rty</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
yether, </i>signifies in Hebrew <i>residue </i>or <i>remnant; </i>instead of
which I have translated it <i>plentifully. </i>Some understand it as extending
to their children and children's children, who shall remain the residue of their
seed. Besides, as the same word is frequently used for
<i>excellence,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa622</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have no doubt that the prophet
elegantly rebukes the proud, who imagine that their fancied excellence is not
only a shield to them, but, an invincible fortress against God. As their
groundless authority and power blind, or rather bewitch them, so that they vaunt
themselves intemperately and without measure against those who are lowly and
feeble, the prophet elegantly says that there is a reward in store for them
proportioned to the haughtiness with which they are puffed
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be of good
courage.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This exhortation is to be
understood in the same way as the preceding; for the steadfastness which the
Psalmist here enjoins is founded on the love of God of which he had spoken, when
renouncing all the enticements of the world, we embrace with our whole hearts
the defense and protection which he promises to us. Nor is his exhortation to
courage and firmness unnecessary; because, when any one begins to rely on God,
he must lay his account with and arm himself for sustaining many assaults from
Satan. We are first, then, calmly to commit ourselves to the protection and
guardianship of God, and to endeavor to have the experience of his goodness
pervading our whole minds. Secondly, thus furnished with steady firmness and
unfailing strength, we are to stand prepared to sustain every day new conflicts.
As no man, however, is able of himself to sustain these conflicts, David urges
us to hope for and ask the spirit of fortitude from God, a matter particularly
worthy of our notice. For hence we are taught, that when the Spirit of God puts
us in mind of our duty, he examines not what each man's ability is, nor does he
measure men's services by their own strength, but stimulates us rather to pray
and beseech God to correct our defects, as it is he alone who can do
this.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
32.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David having largely and painfully experienced what a
miserable thing it is to feel God's hand heavy on account of sin, exclaims that
the highest and best part of a happy life consists in this, that God forgives a
man's guilt, and receives him graciously into his favor. After giving thanks for
pardon obtained, he invites others to fellowship with him in his happiness,
showing, by his own example, the means by which this may be
obtained.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of David
giving instruction.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The title of this psalm gives some idea of its
subject. Some think that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maskil, </i>which we have rendered <i>giving
instruction,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

7th;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa624</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but it is more accurate to consider it
as a title given to the psalm in accordance with its whole scope and subject
matter. David, after enduring long and dreadful torments, when God was severely
trying him, by showing him the tokens of his wrath, having at length obtained
favor, applies this evidence of the divine goodness for his own benefit, and the
benefit of the whole Church, that from it he may teach himself and them what
constitutes the chief point of salvation. All men must necessarily be either in
miserable torment, or, which is worse, forgetting themselves and God, must
continue in deadly lethargy, until they are persuaded that God is reconciled
towards them. Hence David here teaches us that the happiness of men consists
only in the free forgiveness of sins, for nothing can be more terrible than to
have God for our enemy; nor can he be gracious to us in any other way than by
pardoning our transgressions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
32:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Blessed are they whose
iniquity is forgiven, and whose transgression is covered. <b>2.</b> Blessed is
the man to whom Jehovah imputeth no sin, and in whose spirit there is no
guile.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed are they whose
iniquity is forgiven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This exclamation
springs from the fervent affection of the Psalmist's heart as well as from
serious consideration. Since almost the whole world turning away their thoughts
from God's judgment, bring upon themselves a fatal forgetfulness, and intoxicate
themselves with deceitful pleasures; David, as if he had been stricken with the
fear of God's wrath, that he might betake himself to Divine mercy, awakens
others also to the same exercise, by declaring distinctly and loudly that those
only are blessed to whom God is reconciled, so as to acknowledge those for his
children whom he might justly treat as his enemies. Some are so blinded with
hypocrisy and pride, and some with such gross contempt of God, that they are not
at all anxious in seeking forgiveness, but all acknowledge that they need
forgiveness; nor is there a man in existence whose conscience does not accuse
him at God's judgment-seat, and gall him with many stings. This confession,
accordingly, that all need forgiveness, because no man is perfect, and that then
only is it well with us when God pardons our sins, nature herself extorts even
from wicked men. But in the meantime, hypocrisy shuts the eyes of multitudes,
while others are so deluded by a perverse carnal security, that they are touched
either with no feelings of Divine wrath, or with only a frigid feeling of
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this proceeds a twofold error:first,
that such men make light of their sins, and reflect not on the hundredth part of
their danger from God's indignation; and, secondly, that they invent frivolous
expiations to free themselves from guilt and to purchase the favor of God. Thus
in all ages it has been everywhere a prevailing opinion, that although all men
are infected with sin, they are at the same time adorned with merits which are
calculated to procure for them the favor of God, and that although they provoke
his wrath by their crimes, they have expiations and satisfactions in readiness
to obtain their absolution. This delusion of Satan is equally common among
Papists, Turks, Jews, and other nations. Every man, therefore, who is not
carried away by the furious madness of Popery, will admit the truth of this
statement, that men are in a wretched state unless God deal mercifully with them
by not laying their sins to their charge. But David goes farther, declaring that
the whole life of man is subjected to God's wrath and curse, except in so far as
he vouchsafes of his own free grace to receive them into his favor; of which the
Spirit who spake by David is an assured interpreter and witness to us by the
mouth of Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:6.) Had Paul not used this testimony, never would his readers have penetrated
the real meaning of the prophet; for we see that the Papists, although they
chant in their temples, "Blessed<i> </i>are they whose iniquities are forgiven,"
etc., yet pass over it as if it were some common saying and of little
importance. But with Paul, this is the full definition of the righteousness of
faith; as if the prophet had said, Men are then only blessed when they are
freely reconciled to God, and counted as righteous by him. The blessedness,
accordingly, that David celebrates utterly destroys the righteousness of works.
The device of a partial righteousness with which Papists and others delude
themselves is mere folly; and even among those who are destitute of the light of
heavenly doctrine, no one will be found so mad as to arrogate a perfect
righteousness to himself, as appears from the expiations, washings, and other
means of appeasing God, which have always been in use among all nations. But yet
they do not hesitate to obtrude their virtues upon God, just as if by them they
had acquired of themselves a great part of their
blessedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">David, however, prescribes a very
different order, namely, that in seeking happiness, all should begin with the
principle, that God cannot be reconciled to those who are worthy of eternal
destruction in any other way than by freely pardoning them, and bestowing upon
them his favor. And justly does he declare that if mercy is withheld from them,
all men must be utterly wretched and accursed; for if all men are naturally
prone only to evil, until they are regenerated, their whole previous life, it is
obvious, must be hateful and loathsome in the sight of God. Besides, as even
after regeneration, no work which men perform can please God unless he pardons
the sin which mingles with it, they must be excluded from the hope of salvation.
Certainly nothing will remain for them but cause for the greatest terror. That
the works of the saints are unworthy of reward because they are spotted with
stains, seems a hard saying to the Papists. But, in this they betray their gross
ignorance in estimating, according to their own conceptions, the judgment of
God, in whose eyes the very brightness of the stars is but darkness. Let this
therefore remain an established doctrine, that as we are only accounted
righteous before God by the free remission of sins, this is the gate of eternal
salvation; and, accordingly, that they only are blessed who rely upon God's
mercy. We must bear in mind the contrast which I have already mentioned between
believers who,<i> </i>embracing the remission of sins, rely upon the grace of
God alone, and all others who neglect to betake themselves to the sanctuary of
Divine grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, when David thrice
repeats the same thing, this is no vain repetition. It is indeed sufficiently
evident of itself that the man must be blessed whose iniquity is forgiven; but
experience teaches us how difficult it is to become persuaded of this in such a
manner as to have it thoroughly fixed in our hearts. The great majority, as I
have already shown you, entangled by devices of their own, put away from them,
as far as they can, the terrors of conscience and all fear of Divine wrath. They
have, no doubt, a desire to be reconciled to God; and yet they shun the sight of
him, rather than seek his grace sincerely and with all their hearts. Those, on
the other hand, whom God has truly awakened so as to be affected with a lively
sense of their misery, are so constantly agitated and disquieted that it is
difficult to restore peace to their minds. They taste indeed God's mercy, and
endeavor to lay hold of it, and yet they are frequently abashed or made to
stagger under the manifold assaults which are made upon them. The two reasons
for which the Psalmist insists so much on the subject of the forgiveness of sins
are these, - that he may, on the one hand, raise up those who are fallen asleep,
inspire the careless with thoughtfulness, and quicken the dull; and that he may,
on the other hand, tranquillise fearful and anxious minds with an assured and
steady confidence. To the former, the doctrine may be applied in this
manner:"What mean ye, O ye unhappy men! that one or two stings of conscience do
not disturb you? Suppose that a certain limited knowledge of your sins is not
sufficient to strike you with terror, yet how preposterous is it to continue
securely asleep, while you are overwhelmed with an immense load of sins?" And
this repetition furnishes not a little comfort and confirmation to the feeble
and fearful. As doubts are often coming upon them, one after another, it is not
sufficient that they are victorious in one conflict only. That despair,
therefore, may not overwhelm them amidst the various perplexing thoughts with
which they are agitated, the Holy Spirit confirms and ratifies the remission of
sins with many declarations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is now proper to
weigh the particular force of the expressions here employed. Certainly the
remission which is here treated of does not agree with satisfactions. God, in
lifting off or taking away sins, and likewise in covering and not imputing them,
freely pardons them. On this account the Papists, by thrusting in their
satisfactions and works of supererogation as they call them, bereave themselves
of this blessedness. Besides, David applies these words to complete forgiveness.
The distinction, therefore, which the Papists here make between the remission of
the punishment and of the fault, by which they make only half a pardon, is not
at all to the purpose. Now, it is necessary to consider to whom this happiness
belongs, which may be easily gathered from the circumstance of the time. When
David was taught that he was blessed through the mercy of God alone, he was not
an alien from the church of God; on the contrary, he had profited above many in
the fear and service of God, and in holiness of life, and had exercised himself
in all the duties of godliness. And even after making these advances in
religion, God so exercised him, that he placed the alpha and omega of his
salvation in his gratuitous reconciliation to God. Nor is it without reason that
Zacharias, in his song, represents "the knowledge of salvation" as consisting in
knowing "the<i> </i>remission of sins,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420177&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:77.) The more eminently that any one excels in holiness, the farther he feels
himself from perfect righteousness, and the more clearly he perceives that he
can trust in nothing but the mercy of God alone. Hence it appears, that those
are grossly mistaken who conceive that the pardon of sin is necessary only to
the beginning of righteousness. As believers are every day involved in many
faults, it will profit them nothing that they have once entered the way of
righteousness, unless the same grace which brought them into it accompany them
to the last step of their life. Does any one object, that they are elsewhere
said to be blessed "who fear the Lord," "who<i> </i>walk in his ways," "who<i>
</i>are upright in heart," etc., the answer is easy, namely, that as the perfect
fear of the Lord, the perfect observance of his law, and perfect uprightness of
heart, are nowhere to be found, all that the Scripture anywhere says, concerning
blessedness, is founded upon the free favor of God, by which he reconciles us to
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In whose spirit there is no guile.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In
this clause the Psalmist distinguishes believers both from hypocrites and from
senseless despisers of God, neither of whom care for this happiness, nor can
they attain to the enjoyment of it. The wicked are, indeed, conscious to
themselves of their guilt, but still they delight in their wickedness; harden
themselves in their impudence, and laugh at threatenings; or, at least, they
indulge themselves in deceitful flatteries, that they may not be constrained to
come into the presence of God. Yea, though they are rendered unhappy by a sense
of their misery, and harassed with secret torments, yet with perverse
forgetfulness they stifle all fear of God. As for hypocrites, if their
conscience as any time stings them, they soothe their pain with ineffectual
remedies:so that if God at any time cite them to his tribunal, they place before
them I know not what phantoms for their defense; and they are never without
coverings whereby they may keep the light out of their hearts. Both these
classes of men are hindered by inward guile from seeking their happiness in the
fatherly love of God. Nay more, many of them rush frowardly into the presence of
God, or puff themselves up with proud presumption, dreaming that they are happy,
although God is against them. David, therefore, means that no man can taste what
the forgiveness of sins is until his heart is first cleansed from guile. What he
means, then, by this term, <i>guile, </i>may be understood from what I have
said. Whoever examines not himself, as in the presence of God, but, on the
contrary, shunning his judgment, either shrouds himself in darkness, or covers
himself with leaves, deals deceitfully both with himself and with God. It is no
wonder, therefore, that he who feels not his disease refuses the remedy. The two
kinds of this guile which I have mentioned are to be particularly attended to.
Few may be so hardened as not to be touched with the fear of God, and with some
desire of his grace, and yet they are moved but coldly to seek forgiveness.
Hence it comes to pass, that they do not yet perceive what an unspeakable
happiness it is to possess God's favor. Such was David's case for a time, when a
treacherous security stole upon him, darkened his mind, and prevented him from
zealously applying himself to pursue after this happiness. Often do the saints
labor under the same disease. If, therefore, we would enjoy the happiness which
David here proposes to us, we must take the greatest heed lest Satan, filling
our hearts with guile, deprive us of all sense of our wretchedness, in which
every one who has recourse to subterfuges must necessarily pine
away.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
32:3-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> When I kept silence, my
bones wasted away, and when I cried out all the day. <b>4.</b> For day and night
thy hand was heavy upon me; and my greenness was turned into the drought of

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I kept silence, my bones
wasted away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here David confirms, by his
own experience, the doctrine which he had laid down; namely, that when humbled
under the hand of God, he felt that nothing was so miserable as to be deprived
of his favor:by which he intimates, that this truth cannot be rightly understood
until God has tried us with a feeling of his anger. Nor does he speak of a mere
ordinary trial, but declares that he was entirely subdued with the extremest
rigour. And certainly, the sluggishness of our flesh, in this matter, is no less
wonderful than its hardihood. If we are not drawn by forcible means, we will
never hasten to seek reconciliation to God so earnestly as we ought. In fine,
the inspired writer teaches us by his own example, that we never perceive how
great a happiness it is to enjoy the favor of God, until we have thoroughly felt
from grievous conflicts with inward temptations, how terrible the anger of God
is. He adds, that whether he was silent, or whether he attempted to heighten his
grief by his crying and roaring,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa625</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> his bones waxed old; in other words,
his whole strength withered away. From this it follows, that whithersoever the
sinner may turn himself, or however he may be mentally affected, his malady is
in no degree lightened, nor his welfare in any degree promoted, until he is
restored to the favor of God. It often happens that those are tortured with the
sharpest grief who gnaw the bit, and inwardly devour their sorrow, and keep it
enclosed and shut up within, without discovering it, although afterwards they
are seized as with sudden madness, and the force of their grief bursts forth
with the greater impetus the longer it has been restrained. By the term
<i>silence, </i>David means neither insensibility nor stupidity, but that
feeling which lies between patience and obstinacy, and which is as much allied
to the vice as to the virtue. For his bones were not consumed with age, but with
the dreadful torments of his mind. His silence, however, was not the silence of
hope or obedience, for it brought no alleviation of his
misery.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For day and night thy hand
was heavy upon me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse he
explains more fully whence such heavy grief arose; namely, because he felt the
hand of God to be sore against him. The greatest of all afflictions is to be so
heavily pressed with the hand of God, that the sinner feels he has to do with a
Judge whose indignation and severity involve in them many deaths, besides
eternal death. David, accordingly, complains that his moisture was dried up, not
merely from simply meditating on his sore afflictions, but because he had
discovered their cause and spring. The whole strength of men fails when God
appears as a Judge and humbles and lays them prostrate by exhibiting the signs
of his displeasure. Then is fulfilled the saying of Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The grass withereth, the
flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
40:77)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist, moreover, tells us, that it was no
common chastisement by which he had been taught truly to fear the divine wrath;
for the hand of the Lord ceased not to be heavy upon him both day and night.
From a child, indeed, he had been inspired with the fear of God, by the secret
influence of the Holy Spirit, and had been taught in true religion and godliness
by sound doctrine and instruction. And yet so insufficient was this instruction
for his attainment of this wisdom, that he had to be taught again like a new
beginner in the very midst of his course. Yea, although he had now been long
accustomed to mourn over his sins, he was every day anew reduced to this
exercise, which teaches us, how long it is ere men recover themselves when once
they have fallen; and also how slow they are to obey until God, from time to
time, redouble their stripes, and increase them from day to day. Should any one
ask concerning David, whether he had become callous under the stripes which he
well knew were inflicted on him by the hand of God, the context furnishes the
answer; namely, that he was kept down and fettered by perplexing griefs, and
distracted with lingering torments, until he was well subdued and made meek,
which is the first sign of seeking a remedy. And this again teaches us, that it
is not without cause that the chastisements by which God seems to deal cruelly
with us are repeated, and his hand made heavy against us, until our fierce
pride, which we know to be un-tameable, unless subdued with the heaviest
stripes, is humbled.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

I have acknowledged my sin unto thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The prophet now describes the issue of his misery, in order to show to all
the ready way of obtaining the happiness of which he makes mention. When his
feeling of divine wrath sorely vexed and tormented him, his only relief was
unfeignedly to condemn himself before God, and humbly to flee to him to crave
his forgiveness. He does not say, however, that his sins merely came to his
remembrance, for so also did the sins of Cain and Judas, although to no profit;
because, when the consciences of the wicked are troubled with their sins, they
cease not to torment themselves, and to fret against God:yea, although he forces
them unwillingly to his bar, they still eagerly desire to hide themselves. But
here there is described a very different method of acknowledging sin; namely,
when the sinner willingly betakes himself to God, building his hope of salvation
not on stubbornness or hypocrisy, but on supplication for pardon. This voluntary
confession is always conjoined with faith; for otherwise the sinner will
continually seek lurking-places where he may hide himself from God. David's
words clearly show that he came unfeignedly and cordially into the presence of
God, that he might conceal nothing. When he tells us that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he acknowledged his
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did not hide
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the latter clause is added,
according to the Hebrew idiom, for the sake of amplification. There is no doubt,
therefore, that David, when he appeared before God, poured out all his heart.
Hypocrites, we know, that they may extenuate their evil doings, either disguise
or misrepresent them; in short, they never make an honest confession of them,
with an ingenuous and open mouth. But David denies that he was chargeable with
this baseness. Without any dissimulation he made known to God whatever grieved
him; and this he confirms by the words, <i>I have said</i>.<i> </i>While the
wicked are dragged by force, just as a judge compels offenders to come to trial,
he assures us that he came deliberately and with full purpose of mind; for the
term, <i>said, </i>just signifies that he deliberated with himself. It therefore
follows, that he promised and assured himself of pardon through the mercy of
God, in order that terror might not prevent him from making a free and an
ingenuous confession of his sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The phrase,
<i>upon myself, </i>or <i>against myself, </i>intimates that David put away from
him all the excuses and pretences by which men are accustomed to unburden
themselves, transferring their fault, or tracing it to other people. David,
therefore, determined to submit himself entirely to God's judgment, and to make
known his own guilt, that being self-condemned, he might as a suppliant obtain
pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou didst remit
the guilt of my sin. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This clause is set in
opposition to the grievous and direful agitations by which he says he was
harassed before he approached by faith the grace of God. But the words also
teach, that as often as the sinner presents himself at the throne of mercy, with
ingenuous confession, he will find reconciliation with God awaiting him. In
other words, the Psalmist means that God was not only willing to pardon him, but
that his example afforded a general lesson that those in distress should not
doubt of God's favor towards them, so soon as they should betake themselves to
him with a sincere and willing mind. Should any one infer from this, that
repentance and confession are the cause of obtaining grace, the answer is easy;
namely, that David is not speaking here of the cause but of the manner in which
the sinner becomes reconciled to God. Confession, no doubt, intervenes, but we
must go beyond this, and consider that it is faith which, by opening our hearts
and tongues, really obtains our pardon. It is not admitted that every thing
which is necessarily connected with pardon is to be reckoned amongst its causes.
Or, to speak more simply, David obtained pardon by his confession, not because
he merited it by the mere act of confessing, but because, under the guidance of
faith, he humbly implored it from his judge. Moreover, as the same method of
confession ought to be in use among us at this day, which was formerly employed
by the fathers under the law, this sufficiently refutes that tyrannical decree
of the Pope, by which he turns us away from God, and sends us to his priests to
obtain pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore shall every one
that is meek pray unto thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the
Psalmist expressly states that whatever he has hitherto set forth in his own
person belongs in common to all the children of God. And this is to be carefully
observed, because, from our native unbelief, the greater part of us are slow and
reluctant to appropriate the grace of God. We may also learn from this, that
David obtained forgiveness, not by the mere act of confession, as some speak,
but by faith and prayer. Here he directs believers to the same means of
obtaining it, bidding them betake themselves to prayer, which is the true
sacrifice of faith. Farther, we are taught, that in David God gave an example of
his mercy, which may not only extend to us all, but may also show us how
reconciliation is to be sought. The words, <i>every one, </i>serve for the
confirmation of every godly person; but the Psalmist at the same time shows,
that no one can obtain the hope of salvation but by prostrating himself as a
suppliant before God, because all without exception stand in need of his
mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The time of
finding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which immediately follows, some
think, refers to the ordinary and accustomed hours of prayer; but others more
accurately, in my opinion, compare it</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa628</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with that place in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
55:6,) where it is said, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon
him while he is near." It is never out of season, indeed, to seek God, for every
moment we need his grace, and he is always willing to meet us. But as
slothfulness or dullness hinders us from seeking him, David here particularly
intimates the critical seasons when believers are stimulated by a sense of their
own need to have recourse to God. The Papists have abused this place to warrant
their doctrine, that we ought to have advocates in heaven to pray for
us;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa629</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the attempt to found an argument in
support of such a doctrine from this passage is so grossly absurd that it is
unworthy of refutation. We may see from it, however, either how wickedly they
have corrupted the whole Scripture, or with what gross ignorance they blunder in
the plainest matters.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
flood of many waters.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression
agrees with that prophecy of Joel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Whosoever shall call on
the name of the Lord, shall be delivered."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joel
2:32)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that although the deep whirlpools of
death may compass us round on every side, we ought not to fear that they shall
swallow us up; but rather believe that we shall be safe and unhurt, if we only
betake ourselves to the mercy of God. We are thus emphatically taught that the
godly shall have certain salvation even in death, provided they betake
themselves to the sanctuary of God's grace. Under the term<i> flood </i>are
denoted all those dangers from which there appears no means of
escape.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At last the Psalmist gives himself to
thanksgiving, and although he uses but few words to celebrate the divine favor,
there is, notwithstanding, much force in his brevity. In the first place, he
denies that there is any other haven of safety but in God himself. Secondly, he
assures himself that God will be his faithful keeper hereafter; for I willingly
retain the future tense of the verb, though some, without any reason, translate
it into the past. He is not, however, to be understood as meaning that he
conceived himself safe from future tribulations, but he sets God's guardianship
over against them. Lastly, whatever adversity may befall him, he is persuaded
that God will be his deliverer. By the word <i>compass, </i>he means manifold
and various kinds of deliverance; as if he had said, that he should be under
obligation to God in innumerable ways, and that he should, on every side, have
most abundant matter for praising him. We may observe in the meantime, how he
offers his service of gratitude to God, according to his usual method, putting
<i>songs of deliverance </i>instead of
<i>help.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

have the greater force, the divine speaker directs his discourse to every man
individually; for the doctrine which is spoken penetrates the mind more readily,
when every man applies it particularly to himself. When the way of salvation is
here shown to the children of God, the greatest care must be taken that no man
depart from it in the slightest degree. We may also learn from this place, that
we are reconciled to God upon condition that every man endeavor to make his
brethren partakers of the same benefit. David, the more strongly to mark his
care about them, describes it by <i>the sight of the
eye.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa632</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the way it should be
observed, that those who are solicitous about our welfare are appointed by the

solicitude which he has about us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not like the horse or
mule.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now briefly explains the
amount of the counsel which he formerly said he would give. He exhorts all to
learn with quietness, to lay aside stubbornness, and to put on the spirit of
meekness. There is much wisdom, too, in the advice which he gives to the godly
to correct their hardihood; for if we were as attentive to God's corrections as
we ought, every one would eagerly hasten to seek his favor. Whence is so much
slowness to be found in all, but that we are either stupid or refractory? By
likening the refractory, therefore, to brute beasts, David puts them to shame,
and at the same time declares that it will avail them nothing to "kick against
the pricks." Men, says he, know how to tame the fierceness of horses by bridles
and bits; what then do they think God will do when he finds them
intractable?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many sorrows shall be to the
wicked.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Without a figure he here
declares what will be the condition of the rebellious and
stiff-necked.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa633</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He mentioned before that God wanted not
bridles and bits with which to restrain their frowardness; and now he adds, that
there would be no end or measure of their miseries until they were utterly
consumed. Although God, therefore, may spare us for a time, yet let this
denunciation fill us with fear, and preserve us from hardening ourselves,
because we are as yet unpunished; nor let our prosperity, which is cursed by
God, so deceive us as to close our minds against reflecting on those unseen
sorrows which he threatens against all the wicked. And as the Psalmist has told
us, on the one hand, that God is armed with innumerable plagues against the
wicked, so he adds, on the other hand, that he is furnished with infinite
goodness, with which he can succor all who are his. The sum is, that there is no
other remedy for our afflictions but to humble ourselves under God's hand, and
to found our salvation on his mercy alone; and that those who rely on God shall
be blessed in all respects, because, on whatever side Satan may assault them,
there will the Lord oppose him, and shield them with his protecting
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be glad in
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After teaching how ready and
accessible true happiness is to all the godly, David, with much reason, exhorts
them to gladness. He commands them to rejoice in the Lord, as if he had said,
There is nothing to prevent them from assuring themselves of God's favor, seeing
he so liberally and so kindly offers to be reconciled to them. In the meantime,
we may observe that this is the incomparable fruit of faith which Paul likewise
commends, namely, when the consciences of the godly being quiet and cheerful,
enjoy peace and spiritual joy. Wherever faith is lively, this holy rejoicing
will follow. But since the world's own impiety prevents it from participating in
this joy, David, therefore, addresses the righteous alone, whom he denominates
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the upright in
heart,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to teach us that the external
appearance of righteousness which pleases men is of no avail in the sight of
God. But how does he call those righteous, whose whole happiness consists in the
free mercy of God not imputing their sins to them? I answer, that none others
are received into favor but those who are dissatisfied with themselves for their
sins, and repent with their whole heart; not that this repentance merits pardon,
but because faith can never be separated from the spirit of regeneration. When
they have begun to devote themselves to God, he accepts the upright disposition
of their hearts equally as if it were pure and perfect; for faith not only
reconciles a man to God, but also sanctifies whatever is imperfect in him, so
that by the free grace of God, he becomes righteous who could never have
obtained so great a blessing by any merit of his own.</font><br></div>

showing at the same time how necessary it is that the godly should be cherished

believers or the righteous by name, because they alone are capable of
proclaiming the glory of God. Unbelievers, who have never tasted his goodness,
cannot praise him from the heart, and God has no pleasure in his name being
pronounced by their unholy tongues. But the context shows more distinctly why
this exhortation is suitable for believers only. Many, accordingly, expound the
latter clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise is comely
for the upright</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as meaning, that if the
ungodly or hypocrites attempt this exercise, it will turn to the reproach and
dishonor of God rather than to his praise; nay, more, that they only profane his
holy name. It is, no doubt, very true, as I have already remarked, that God
creates for himself a church in the world by gracious adoption, for the express
purpose, that his name may be duly praised by witnesses suitable for such a
work. But the real meaning of the clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise is comely for the
upright,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, that there is no exercise
in which they can be better employed. And, assuredly, since God by his daily
benefits furnishes them with such matter for celebrating his glory, and since
his boundless goodness, as we have elsewhere seen, is laid up as a peculiar
treasure for them, it were disgraceful and utterly unreasonable for them to be
silent in the praises of God. The amount of the matter is, that the principal
exercise in which it becomes the righteous to be employed is to publish among
men the righteousness, goodness, and power of God, the knowledge of which is
implanted in their minds. Following other interpreters, I have translated the
clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise is
comely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but the word rendered <i>comely
</i>may also be properly rendered <i>desirable, </i>if we view it as derived
from the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>avah, </i>which signifies to <i>wish </i>or <i>desire. </i>And certainly,
when God allures believers so sweetly, it is proper that they employ themselves
in celebrating his praises with their whole hearts. It is also to be observed,
that when the prophet, after having in the first clause used the appellation,
<i>the righteous, </i>immediately adds the words, <i>the upright, </i>which
comprehend the inward integrity of the heart, he defines what true righteousness
is, or in what it consists.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise Jehovah upon the
harp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is evident that the Psalmist
here expresses the vehement and ardent affection which the faithful ought to
have in praising God, when he enjoins musical instruments to be employed for
this purpose. He would have nothing omitted by believers which tends to animate
the minds and feelings of men in singing God's praises. The name of God, no
doubt, can, properly speaking, be celebrated only by the articulate voice; but
it is not without reason that David adds to this those aids by which believers
were wont to stimulate themselves the more to this exercise; especially
considering that he was speaking to God's ancient people. There is a
distinction, however, to be observed here, that we may not indiscriminately
consider as applicable to ourselves, every thing which was formerly enjoined
upon the Jews. I have no doubt that playing upon cymbals, touching the harp and
the viol, and all that kind of music, which is so frequently mentioned in the
Psalms, was a part of the education; that is to say, the puerile instruction of
the law:I speak of the stated service of the temple. For even now, if believers
choose to cheer themselves with musical instruments, they should, I think, make
it their object not to dissever their cheerfulness from the praises of God. But
when they frequent their sacred assemblies, musical instruments in celebrating
the praises of God would be no more suitable than the burning of incense, the
lighting up of lamps, and the restoration of the other shadows of the law. The
Papists, therefore, have foolishly borrowed this, as well as many other things,
from the Jews. Men who are fond of outward pomp may delight in that noise; but
the simplicity which God recommends to us by the apostle is far more pleasing to
him. Paul allows us to bless God in the public assembly of the saints only in a
known tongue,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:16.) The voice of man, although not understood by the generality,
assuredly excels all inanimate instruments of music; and yet we see what St Paul
determines concerning speaking in an unknown
tongue.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa636</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What shall we then say of chanting,
which fills the ears with nothing but an empty sound? Does any one object, that
music is very useful for awakening the minds of men and moving their hearts? I
own it; but we should always take care that no corruption creep in, which might
both defile the pure worship of God and involve men in superstition. Moreover,
since the Holy Spirit expressly warns us of this danger by the mouth of Paul, to
proceed beyond what we are there warranted by him is not only, I must say,
unadvised zeal, but wicked and perverse
obstinacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

of the mighty works of God, and particularly concerning the preservation of the
Church, it is not wonderful that he exhorts the righteous to sing a new, that
is, a rare and choice song. The more closely and diligently that believers
consider the works of God, the more will they exert themselves in his praises.
It is no common song, therefore, which he exhorts them to sing, but a song
corresponding to the magnificence of the subject. This is also the meaning of
the second clause, in which he urges them <i>to sing loudly. </i>In this sense,

right.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As I have just remarked, the
Psalmist first sets forth God's general providence by which he governs the whole
world; and he tells us that he so exerts his power in the whole course of his
operations, that the most perfect equity and faithfulness shine forth
everywhere. Some will have the terms <i>word </i>and <i>work </i>to be
synonymous; but I think there is a distinction, and that <i>word </i>means the
same thing as <i>counsel </i>or <i>ordinance, </i>while <i>work </i>signifies
the effect or execution of his counsel. I grant that here the same subject is
repeated in different words, as is the case in other places; but a slight
variation will be found in such repetitions, that the same thing may he
expressed in various ways. The amount of what is stated is, that whatever God
appoints and commands is right; and whatever he brings to pass in actual
operation is faithful and true. Meanwhile, it ought to be observed, that the
term <i>word </i>is not to be understood of doctrine, but of the method by which
God governs the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
33:5-9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> He loveth righteousness
and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of Jehovah.<b> 6.</b> By the

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He loveth righteousness and
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a confirmation of the
preceding verse, and intimates to us that God of his own nature loves
righteousness and equity. It therefore follows, that froward affections cannot
hurry him, after the manner of men, to evil devices. At first sight, indeed,
this appears but a common commendation of God, and of small importance, because
all confess that he observes the most perfect rule of righteousness in all his
works. Why then, may some one say, has a new song just been spoken of, as if it
had been about some unusual matter? We answer, in the first place, because it is
too obvious how wickedly a great part of the world shut their eyes to God's
righteousness, while they either carelessly overlook innumerable proofs of his
providence, or imagine that they happen by chance. But there is often a worse
fault than this; namely, that if our wishes are not gratified, we instantly
murmur against God's righteousness; and although the maxim, "God<i> </i>doeth
all things righteously," is in every man's mouth, yet scarcely one in a hundred
firmly believes it in his heart, otherwise, as soon as this truth is pronounced,
"Thus<i> </i>it pleaseth God," every man would obediently submit himself to
God's will. Now, as men in adversity are with the utmost difficulty brought to
this point - to acknowledge that God is just, and as, in prosperity, they soon
fall from the acknowledgement of it, it is not to be wondered at that the
prophet, in order to persuade men that God is an upright governor, affirms that
he loveth righteousness. Whoever, therefore, has thoroughly embraced this
doctrine, let him know that he has profited
much.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others explain this to mean, that God
loveth righteousness in men. This, indeed, is true; but it is far from the sense
of the text, because the design of the Holy Spirit here is to maintain the glory
of God in opposition to the poison of ungodliness, which is deeply seated in
many hearts. In the second clause of the verse, the Psalmist commends another
part of God's excellence, namely, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the earth is full of his
goodness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The righteousness of God ought
justly to incite us to praise him, but his goodness is a more powerful motive;
because, the more experience which any man has of his beneficence and mercy, the
more strongly is he influenced to worship him. Farther, the discourse is still
concerning all the benefits of God which he scatters over the whole human race.
These, the inspired writer declares, meet us wherever we turn our
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the word of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That he may stir us up to think
more closely of God's works, he brings before us the creation of the world
itself; for until God be acknowledged as the Creator and Framer of the world,
who will believe that he attends to the affairs of men, and that the state of
the world is controlled by his wisdom and power? But the creation of the world
leads us by direct consequence to the providence of God. Not that all men reason
so justly, or are endued with so sound a judgment, as to conclude that the world
is at this day maintained by the same divine power which was once put forth in
creating it:on the contrary, the great majority imagine that he is an idle
spectator in heaven of whatever is transacted on earth. But no man truly
believes that the world was created by God unless he is also firmly persuaded
that it is maintained and preserved by him. Wisely and properly, therefore, does
the prophet carry us back to the very origin of the world, in order to fix in
our minds the certainty of God's providence in the continual order of nature. By
the figure synecdoche, he uses the term <i>heavens </i>for the whole fabric of
the world, because, as I have elsewhere remarked, the sight of the heavens more
than all the other parts of creation transports us with admiration. He therefore
immediately adds, <i>And all the host of them, </i>by which phraseology,
according to the usual method of Scripture, he means the stars and planets; for
if the heavens were destitute of this ornament, they would in a manner be empty.
In saying that the heavens were created by <i>the word of God, </i>he greatly
magnifies his power, because by his nod
alone,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa638</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> without any other aid or means, and
without much time or labor,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa639</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he created so noble and magnificent a
work. But although the Psalmist sets
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the</i> <i>word of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the breath of his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in opposition both to all external
means, and to every idea of painful labor on God's part, yet we may truly and
certainly infer from this passage, that the world was framed by God's Eternal
Word, his only begotten Son. Ancient interpreters have, with considerable
ingenuity, employed this passage as a proof of the eternal Deity of the Holy
Spirit against the Sabellians. But it appears from other places, particularly
from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:4, that by <i>the breath of the mouth </i>is meant nothing else but
<i>speech. </i>For it is there said concerning Christ, "He<i> </i>shall smite
the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he
slay the wicked." As powerful and effective speech is there allegorically
denominated <i>the rod of his mouth; </i>so in like manner, for another purpose
it is denominated in the immediately succeeding clause <i>the breath of his
mouth, </i>to mark the difference that exists between God's speech and the empty
sounds which proceed from the mouths of men. In proving the Divinity of the Holy
Spirit, therefore, I durst not press this text against Sabellius. Let us account
it sufficient that God has formed the heavens by his Word in such a manner as to
prove the eternal Deity of Christ. Should any object that these divine persons
would not appear distinct if the terms <i>Word </i>and <i>Breath </i>are
synonymous; I answer, that the term <i>breath </i>is not employed here simply as
in other places, in which there is evidently a distinction made between the
<i>Word </i>and the <i>Spirit; </i>but <i>the breath of his mouth </i>is used
figuratively for the very utterance of speech; as if it had been said, As soon
as God uttered the breath of his mouth, or proclaimed in word what he wished to
be done, the heavens were instantly brought into existence, and were furnished,
too, with an inconceivable number and variety of stars. It is indeed true that
this similitude is borrowed from men; but the Scriptures often teach in other
places, that the world was created by that Eternal Word, who, being the only
begotten Son of God, appeared afterwards in
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He gathered together the
waters of the sea as into a heap.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa640</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist does not speak
of all that might have been said of every part of the world, but under one
department he comprehends all the rest. He celebrates, however, a signal and
remarkable miracle which we see in looking on the surface of the earth; namely,
that God gathers together the element of water, fluid and unstable as it is,
into a solid heap, and holds it so at his pleasure. Natural philosophers
confess, and experience openly proclaims, that the waters occupy a higher place
than the earth. How is it then that, as they are fluid and naturally disposed to
flow, they do not spread abroad and cover the earth, and how is it that the
earth, which is lower in position, remains dry? In this we certainly perceive
that God, who is ever attentive to the welfare of the human race, has inclosed
the waters within certain invisible barriers, and keeps them shut up to this
day; and the prophet elegantly declares that they stand still at God's
commandment, as if they were a heap of firm and solid matter. Nor is it without
design that the Holy Spirit, in various passages, adduces this proof of divine
power, as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
5:22, and
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;183808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
38:8.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second part of the verse, he seems
to repeat the same idea, but with amplification. God not only confines the
immense mass of waters in the seas, but also hides them, by a mysterious and
incomprehensible power, in the very bowels of the earth. Whoever will compare
the elements among themselves, will reckon it contrary to nature that the
bottomless depths, or the immeasurable gulfs of waters, whose native tendency is
rather to overwhelm the earth, should lie hid under it. That so many hollow
channels and gulfs, accordingly, should not swallow up the earth every moment,
affords another magnificent display of divine power; for although now and then
some cities and fields are engulfed, yet the body of the earth is preserved in
its place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let all the earth fear
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist concludes that
there is just reason why the whole world should reverently submit itself to the
government of God, who gave it being, and who also preserves it.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To fear
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and <i>to stand in awe of him,
</i>just means to do honor to, and to reverence his mighty power. It is a mark
of great insensibility not to bow at God's presence, from whom we have our
being, and upon whom our condition depends. The prophet alludes to both these
things, affirming that the world appeared as soon as God spake, and that it is
upheld in being by his commandment; for it would not have been enough for the
world to have been created in a moment, if it had not been supported in
existence by the power of God. He did not employ a great array of means in
creating the world, but to prove the inconceivable power of his word, he ordered
that so soon as he should as it were pronounce the word, the thing should be
done.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa641</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The word <i>command, </i>therefore,
confirms what I formerly said, that his speech was nothing else than a nod, or
wish, and that <i>to speak </i>implies the same thing as to command. It is
proper, however, to understand that in this nod, or command, the eternal wisdom
of God displayed itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
33:10-12	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10. </b>Jehovah scattereth the

Jehovah scattereth the counsel of the
nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After briefly touching upon the
creation of the world, the Psalmist returns to his former subject, namely, to
show that the events which daily come to pass are undoubted proofs of the
providence of God. And lest any man should be surprised, that he should exhibit
God as an adversary to men, scattering their counsels rather than establishing
and bringing them to a happy issue, he selects an instance which had the
greatest power to comfort the saints. We know how many things men continually
venture upon and contrive against all law and justice, and how they endeavor by
their devices to turn the world upside down, that they may tyrannically acquire
power to trample upon the good and simple. What creatures then would be more
miserable than we, if men, possessed of such a variety of wicked affections,
were permitted to act with unlicensed wantonness towards us? But when God
declares from heaven to us, that it is his work to dash in pieces their devices,
and to bring their determinations to nought, there is no reason why we should
not keep ourselves quiet, even when they bestir themselves most tumultuously.
God is, therefore, said to overthrow the counsels of men, not because he
professedly delights in frustrating them, but to check their wantonness; for
they would immediately throw all things into confusion were they to succeed
according to their wishes:yea, as in outraging equity, and vexing the upright
and innocent, they fail not to fight against God himself, it is very necessary
to consider that God's power and protection is set in opposition to their fury.
And as the great majority of men, despising all modesty, rush headlong into
indiscriminate licentiousness, the prophet speaks not only of individual men,
but of whole nations; in other words, he affirms, that however men may conspire
among themselves, and determine to attempt this or that with great hosts, yet
shall their purposes be brought to nought, because it is as easy for God to
scatter multitudes as to restrain a few. But although it is God's design in this
place to fortify us with good hope against the boldness of the wicked, he warns
us, at the same time, to undertake nothing without his command and
guidance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The counsel of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The prophet extols the infinite
power of God in such a manner as that he may build up our faith in its
greatness; for he does not here commend a counsel of God which is hidden in
heaven, and which he would have us to honor and revere at a distance. But as the
Lord everywhere in Scripture testifies that he loveth righteousness and truth;
that he cares for the righteous and good; and that he is ever inclined to succor
his servants when they are wrongfully oppressed; &#8212; the prophet means, that
all this shall remain sure and steadfast. Thus he declares for what end God
bringeth to nought the counsels of the nations, namely, because without
discrimination they run headlong into the violation of all
order.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the first place, then, let us learn to
look at God's counsel in the glass of his word; and when we have satisfied
ourselves that he has promised nothing but what he has determined to perform,
let us immediately call to mind the steadfastness of which the prophet here
speaks. And as many, or rather whole, nations sometimes endeavor to impede its
course by innumerable hinderances, let us also remember the preceding
declaration, that when men have imagined many devices, it is in God's power, and
often his pleasure, to bring them to nought. The Holy Spirit unquestionably
intended to have our faith exercised in this practical knowledge; otherwise what
he here says of the counsel of God would be but cold and fruitless. But when we
shall have once persuaded ourselves of this, that God will defend his servants
who call upon his name, and rid them of all dangers; whatever mischief the
wicked may practice against them, their endeavors and attempts shall in nowise
terrify us, because, so soon as God sets himself in opposition to their
machinations, no craft on their part will be able to defeat his
counsel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed are the people whose God
is Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse excellently
agrees with the preceding, because it would profit us little to observe what is
said of the stability of God's counsel if that counsel referred not to us. The
prophet, therefore, in proclaiming that they are blessed whom God receives into
his protection, reminds us that the counsel which he had just mentioned is not a
secret which remains always hidden in God, but is displayed in the existence and
protection of the Church, and may there be beheld. Thus we see, that it is not
those who coldly speculate about the power of God, but those alone who apply it
to their own present benefit, who rightly acknowledge God as the Governor of the
world. Moreover, when the Psalmist places all our blessedness in this, that
<i>Jehovah is our God, </i>in touching upon the fountain of divine love towards
us, he comprehends, in one word, whatever is wont to be desired to make life
happy. For when God condescends to undertake the care of our salvation, to
cherish us under his wings, to provide for our necessities, to aid us in all our
dangers, all this depends on our adoption by him. But lest it should be thought
that men obtain so great a good by their own efforts and industry, David teaches
us expressly that it proceeds from the fountain of God's gracious electing love
that we are accounted the people of God. It is indeed true, that, in the person
of Adam, men were created at first for the very purpose that they should be the
sons of God; but the estrangement which followed upon sin deprived us of that
great blessing. Until God, therefore, freely adopt us, we are all by nature
wretched, and we have no other entrance to or means of attaining happiness but
this, that God, of his own good pleasure, should choose us who are altogether
unworthy. It appears, accordingly, how foolishly they corrupt this passage, who
transfer to men what the prophet here ascribes to God, as if men would choose
God for their inheritance. I own, indeed, that it is by faith that we
distinguish the true God from idols; but this principle is always to be held
fast, that we have no interest in him at all unless he prevent us by his
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
33:13-17	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b> Jehovah looked down
from heaven; he beheld the children of Adam. <b>14.</b> From the dwelling-place
of his throne he looked on all the inhabitants of the earth. <b>15.</b> He who
fashioned their hearts altogether,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

<b>16.</b> A king is not saved for the multitude of his host, nor a giant

of his strength.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah looked down from
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Psalmist still proceeds with the
same doctrine, namely, that human affairs are not tossed hither and thither
fortuitously, but that God secretly guides and directs all that we see taking
place. Now he here commends God's inspection of all things, that we on our part
may learn to behold, and to contemplate with the eye of faith, his invisible
providence. There are, no doubt, evident proofs of it continually before our
eyes; but the great majority of men, notwithstanding, see nothing of them, and,
in their blindness, imagine that all things are under the conduct of a blind
fortune. Nay, the more plenteously and abundantly that he sheds his goodness
upon us, the less do we raise our thoughts to him, but preposterously settle
them down immovably on the external circumstances which surround us. The prophet
here rebukes this base conduct, because no greater affront can be offered to God
than to shut him up in heaven in a state of idleness. This is the same as if he
were to lie buried in a grave. What kind of life would God's life be, if he
neither saw nor took care of any thing? Under the term <i>throne, </i>too, the
sacred writer shows, from what is implied in it, what an absurd infatuation it
is to divest God of thought and understanding. He gives us to understand by this
word, that heaven is not a palace in which God remains idle and indulges in
pleasures, as the Epicureans dream, but a royal court, from which he exercises
his government over all parts of the world. If he has erected his throne,
therefore, in the sanctuary of heaven, in order to govern the universe, it
follows that he in no wise neglects the affairs of earth, but governs them with
the highest reason and wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who fashioned their hearts
altogether.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It appears that this is
added for the express purpose of assuredly persuading believers, that, however
the wicked might craftily, deceitfully, and by secret stratagems, attempt to
withdraw themselves from God's sight, and hide themselves in caverns, yet his
eyes would penetrate into their dark hiding-places. And the Psalmist argues from
the very creation that God cannot but bring men's devices and doings into
reckoning and judgment; because, though each man has intricate recesses
concealed in his bosom, so that there is a wonderful diversity of different
minds in this respect, and this great variety creates a most confounding
obscurity; yet the eyes of God cannot be dazzled and darkened, so that he may
not be a competent judge and take cognisance of his own work. By the adverb
<i>together, </i>therefore, he does not mean that the hearts of men were formed
at the same moment of time; but that all of them were fashioned even to one, and
without a single exception; so that those manifest great folly who attempt to
hide, or to withdraw the knowledge of their hearts from him who framed them. The
discourse may also be understood as meaning, that men cannot, by the erring
devices of their own thoughts, diminish the authority of God over them, so that
he may not govern by his secret providence the events which seem to them to
happen by chance. We see, indeed, he in forming their vain hopes, they despoil
God of his power, and transfer it to the creatures, at one time to this object,
and at another time to that, conceiving that they have no need of his aid, so
long as they are furnished with outward means and helps to protect
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It therefore follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A king is not saved for the
multitude of his host, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this the
inspired writer means to teach us, that the safety of men's lives depends not
upon their own strength, but upon the favor of God. He names particularly
<i>kings </i>and <i>giants </i>rather than others; because, as they are not of
the common class of men, but of a higher condition, they appear to themselves to
be beyond the reach of all danger from darts, and if any adversity befall them,
they promise themselves an easy deliverance from it. In short, intoxicated with
a presumptuous confidence of their own strength, they scarcely think themselves
mortal. They are still more hardened in this pride by the foolish admiration of
the common people, who stand amazed at the greatness of their power. If,
therefore, neither a king is saved by his troops, nor a giant by his strength,
when they are exposed to danger, in vain do mankind neglect the providence of
God, and look around them for human help. From this it follows, that the
condition, both of the strong and the weak, is miserable, until they learn to
rely on the protection of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A horse is a deceitful thing
for safety.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse, the Psalmist,
by the figure synecdoche under the name of <i>horse, </i>is to be understood as
meaning any kind of help. The sense is, that in general those who conceive that
their life is well protected by earthly means, are commonly disappointed at the
very crisis of danger, and are miserably beguiled to their utter undoing, so
that God therein clearly shows them their folly. It is true, that kings are not
armed with the sword in vain, nor is the use of horses superfluous, nor are the
treasures and resources which God furnishes to defend men's lives unnecessary,
provided a right method of employing them be observed. But as the greater part
of men the more they are surrounded with human defences, withdraw themselves the
farther from God, and by a false imagination persuade themselves that they are
in a haven safe from all disturbance, God acts most justly in disappointing this
madness. This is the reason why his gifts often pass away without effect,
because the world, by separating them from the giver, is also justly deprived of
his blessing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
33:18-19	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18. </b>Behold, the eye of
Jehovah is upon them that fear him, upon those who hope in his mercy; <b>19.</b>
To deliver their souls from death, and to give them life in the time of
famine.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the eye of Jehovah is
upon them that fear him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having shown
that what men account their best defences often profit them nothing, or rather
are utterly worthless, when men depend upon them; the Psalmist now shows, on the
other hand, that believers, although they are neither men of great power nor of
great wealth, are nevertheless sufficiently protected by God's favor alone, and
shall be safe for ever. His meaning is not a little illustrated by this
comparison, that kings and giants derive no aid from their invincible strength,
while God supports the life of the saints in famine and dearth, as really as if
he were to restore life to them when dead. We consequently understand better why
the prophet lays low all the strength of the world; not, surely, that men should
lie prostrate, or be so heart-broken as to pine away in despair; but that,
laying aside their pride, they should fix their thoughts on God alone, and
persuade themselves that their life depends on his protection. Moreover, in
saying that the eye of God is bent upon them that fear him to save them, he
expresses more than if he had said that his hand and power were sufficient to
preserve them. A doubt might creep into the minds of the weak, whether God would
extend this protection to every individual; but when the Psalmist introduces him
as keeping watch and ward, as it were, over the safety of the faithful, there is
no reason why any one of them should tremble, or hesitate with himself a moment
longer, since it is certain that God is present with him to assist him, provided
he remain quietly under his providence. From this, also, it appears still more
clearly how truly he had said a little before, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the people are blessed whose God
is Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because, without him, all
the strength and riches which we may possess will be vain, deceitful, and
perishing; whereas, with a single look he can defend his people, supply their
wants, feed them in a time of famine, and preserve them alive when they are
appointed to death. The whole human race, no doubt, are maintained by the
providence of God; but we know that his fatherly care is specially vouchsafed to
none but his own children, that they may feel that their necessities are truly
regarded by him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, when it is affirmed,
that God, in times of famine and dearth, has remedies in readiness to preserve
the lives of the godly, we are taught that the faithful only pay due honor to
his providence when they allow not their hearts to despond in the extremest
indigence; but, on the contrary, raise their hopes even from the grave. God
often suffers his servants to be hungry for a time that he may afterwards
satiate them, and he overspreads them with the darkness of death that he may
afterwards restore them to the light of life. Yea, we only begin to place our
trust firmly in him when death comes to present itself before our eyes; for,
until we have known by experience the vanity of the aids of the world, our
affections continue entangled in them, and wedded to them. The Psalmist
characterises believers by two marks, which comprehend the whole perfection of
our life. The first is, that we reverently serve the Lord; and the second, that
we depend upon his grace. Hypocrites may loudly boast of their faith, but they
have never tasted even a little of the divine goodness, so as to be induced to
look to him for what they need. On the contrary, when the faithful give
themselves with their whole heart to the service and fear of God, this affection
springs from faith; or rather the principal part of right worship, which the
faithful render to God, consists in this, that they depend upon his
mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
33:20-22	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b> Our soul waiteth upon

spoken concerning God's providence, and particularly concerning that faithful
guardianship by which he protects his people, he has spoken not so much from
himself as from the mouth of the Holy Spirit. He now, therefore, in the name of
the whole Church, raises his song to declare that there is nothing better than
to commit our welfare to God. Thus we see that the fruit of the preceding
doctrine is set forth to all true believers, that they may unhesitatingly cast
themselves with confidence, and with a cheerful heart, upon the paternal care of
God. In this matter, the Psalmist declares nothing concerning himself in
particular, but unites the whole of the godly with him in the acknowledgement of
the same faith. There is an emphasis in the word <i>soul </i>which should be
attended to; for, although this is a common mode of speech among the Hebrews,
yet it expresses earnest affection; as if believers should say, We sincerely
rely upon God with our whole heart, accounting him our shield and
help.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely our heart shall
rejoice in him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ki, </i>which is twice employed in this verse, has various meanings in Hebrew,
it may be understood in a twofold sense here. If we expound it affirmatively in
both clauses, the sense will be, that believers glory both in their joy and in
their hope. Nor do I think it improper that these two should be referred to
distinctly in the same context thus:Surely God shall always be our joy; surely
his holy name shall be like an impregnable fortress for our refuge. Whence is it
that believers continue perseveringly to call upon God, but because, satisfied
with his favor, they have always, amidst their sorrows and griefs, this comfort,
which is sufficient to maintain their cheerfulness? Justly, therefore, do
believers affirm, in the first place, that their heart rejoices in the Lord;
because, freed from wandering after the fascinations of the world, they neither
waver nor hesitate at every change of fortune, but place the whole felicity of
their life in enjoying the free and paternal favor of God. They afterwards add,
in the second place, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
trust in his holy name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If any one,
however, choose to understand the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ki</i>, as meaning <i>because, </i>assigning a cause or reason, the sense will
be no less properly and elegantly expressed in this way:Because our hope is
fixed on God, he will be equally ready on his part to minister to us continual
matter of joy. And experience undoubtedly proves, that when men are overwhelmed
with sorrow, and pine away with care, grief, and anxiety, it is that they may
receive the recompense of their folly; seeing that there is nothing to which
they are led with more difficulty, than to set their hopes on God alone, and not
to exult in their own deceitful imaginations, with which they please
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy mercy be on us, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>At length the psalm concludes
with a prayer, which the sacred writer offers in the name of all the godly, that
God would make them feel from the effect that they have not relied on the divine
goodness in vain. In the meantime, the Spirit, by dictating to us this rule of
prayer by the mouth of the prophet, teaches us, that the gate of divine grace is
opened for us when salvation is neither sought nor hoped for from any other
quarter. This passage gives us another very sweet consolation, namely, that if
our hope faint not in the midst of our course, we have no reason to fear that
God will fail to continue his mercy towards us, without intermission, to the end
of it.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
34.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of David, when he
changed his countenance before Abimelech, who banished him from his presence,
and he departed from him.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David gives thanks to God for a signal deliverance,
and takes occasion from it to celebrate his perpetual grace towards all the
saints, and to exhort them both to trust in him, and to the study of godliness;
affirming, that the only way to pass through life happily, is to walk holily and
harmlessly in the world, in the service and fear of God. It is obvious from the
title what particular instance of God's favor he here celebrates. When he was
driven to King Achish, as recorded in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;092702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 27:2,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa647</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whom, with the exception of Saul, he
accounted the deadliest of all his enemies, it was not probable that he would
ever be able to make his escape from him. The only means, therefore, he had of
saving his life was to feign himself mad by frothing at the mouth, looking
fiercely, and disfiguring his countenance. Nor is this to be wondered at; for
Achish, being disappointed of the confident hope of victory which he had, and
attributing to David alone both the loss which he had sustained and the dishonor
which he had received, burned with implacable hatred against him. In allowing
him to escape, therefore, contrary to his own expectation, and the expectation
of all other men, David acknowledges that there had been exhibited a memorable
instance of God's favor towards him, which may be serviceable for the general
instruction of the whole Church. Instead of
Achish,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa648</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Abimelech is here employed; and it is
probable that the latter name had been the common designation of the monarchs of
the Philistines, as Pharaoh was the common name of the monarchs of Egypt, and
Caesar that of the Roman Emperors, which was borrowed from the name of Julius
Caesar, who had first seized the imperial power among the Romans. We know that
many ages before David was born, the kings who reigned in Gerar in the time of
Abraham were called Abimelech. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that
this name should be handed down from age to age among their posterity, and
become the common name of all the kings of Palestine. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[f</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ta&auml;m, </i>which I have translated <i>countenance, </i>signifies also
<i>tasting, understanding,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa649</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and therefore might be
pertinently interpreted in this manner, that he appeared foolish and without
taste. The verb from which it is derived properly signifies <i>to taste, </i>and
therefore is often transferred to reason, understanding, and all the senses.
Accordingly, David having feigned himself mad, the term <i>understanding </i>is
very appropriate. Now, although he escaped by this subtle device, he doubts not
that he was delivered by the hand of God; nor does he ascribe the praise of his
safety to the pretense of madness, but rather acknowledges that the cruelty of
his enemy had been softened by the secret influence of God, so that he who
formerly burned with rage against him had been pacified by an artifice.
Certainly it was not to be expected that Achish would have driven away in
contempt from him so brave a man, whom he had found a dangerous enemy to his
whole kingdom, and from whom he had suffered such severe losses. This gives rise
to the question, Whether David feigned himself mad under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit? For by his appearing to connect together these two things, - the
pretense of madness and the happy result of this pretense, it might be inferred
that the same Spirit by whom this psalm was dictated suggested this
stratagem</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa650</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to the mind of David, and directed him
in deceiving King Achish. I answer, that although God sometimes delivers his
people, while at the same time they err in choosing the means, or even fall into
sin in adopting them, yet there is nothing inconsistent in this. The
deliverance, therefore, was the work of God, but the intermediate sin, which is
on no account to be excused, ought to be ascribed to David. In this way Jacob
obtained the blessing by the favor and good pleasure of God; and yet the
subtlety of the mother, with which the obtaining of it was mixed up, was, we
know, sinful on her part. It may then sometimes happen that the event shall be
brought to pass by the Spirit of God, and yet the saints whom he may employ as
instruments shall swerve from the path of duty. It would therefore be a
superfluous task to endeavor to exculpate David, who is rather to be blamed,
because, by not committing his life entirely to God, he exposed himself and the
grace of the Spirit, by whom he was governed, to the derision of the ungodly. I
would not positively assert it, but there appears in this deception some token
of infirmity. If it should be said that David here magnifies the grace of God,
because by changing his countenance and his speech he escaped death, I again
reply, that David expressly mentions this circumstance, in order to render the
grace of God still more illustrious, in that his fault was not laid to his
charge.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

fa651</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here extols the greatness
of God, promising to keep in remembrance during his whole life the goodness
which he had bestowed upon him. God assists his people daily, that they may
continually employ themselves in praising him; yet it is certain that the
blessing which is said to be worthy of everlasting remembrance is distinguished
by this mark from other benefits which are ordinary and common. This, therefore,
is a rule which should be observed by the saints &#8212; they should often call
into remembrance whatever good has been bestowed upon them by God; but if at any
time he should display his power more illustriously in preserving them from some
danger, so much the more does it become them earnestly to testify their
gratitude. Now if by one benefit alone God lays us under obligation to himself
all our life, so that we may never lawfully cease from setting forth his
praises, how much more when he heaps upon us innumerable
benefits?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa652</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In order to distinguish the praise
which he had before said would be continually in his mouth from the empty sound
of the tongue, in which many hypocrites boast, he adds, in the beginning of the
second verse, that it would proceed from the
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My soul shall make her boast
in Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The term <i>soul </i>in this
place signifies not the vital spirit, but the seat of the affections; as if
David had said, I shall always have ground of boasting with my whole heart in
God alone, so that I shall never suffer myself to fall into forgetfulness of so
great a deliverance. In the second clause he specifies this as the fruit of his
thanksgiving, that the afflicted and miserable shall derive from it ground of
hope. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anavim, </i>which we have rendered <i>humble, </i>signifies not all the
afflicted</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa653</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in general, but those who, being
humbled and subdued by afflictions, instead of breathing the spirit of pride,
are cast down, and ready to abase themselves to the very dust. These, he says,
shall be partakers of his joy; but not, as some have coldly explained it, simply
from a feeling of sympathy, but because, being persuaded that in the example of
David, God had given them a general testimony of his grace, their hearts would
recover from sorrow, and would be lifted up on high. Accordingly, he says that
this joy shall spring from hope, because, having received a pledge of their
deliverance, they shall cheerfully have recourse to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Magnify Jehovah with
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist shows still another
fruit which would be the result of his giving thanks to God, namely, that he
shall induce others by his example to the same exercise of devotion; nay more,
he calls upon all the godly to unite with him in this exercise, inviting and
exhorting them heartily and with one consent to extol the Lord. Let us therefore
learn, from the many instances in which God may have given helps to any of his
people, to abound in hope; and when each recites the personal benefits which he
has received, let all be animated unitedly and in a public manner to give praise
to God. We give thanks publicly to God, not only that men may be witnesses of
our gratitude, but also that they may follow our
example.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I sought Jehovah, and he
answered me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here explains
more plainly and more fully what he had said concerning joy. In the first place,
he tells us that his prayers had been heard. This he applies to all the godly,
that, encouraged by a testimony so precious, they might stir themselves up to
prayer. What is implied in <i>seeking God </i>is evident from the following
clause. In some places it is to be understood in a different sense, namely, to
bend the mind in earnest application to the service of God, and to have all its
thoughts directed to him. Here it simply means to have recourse to him for help;
for it immediately follows that God answered him; and he is properly said to
answer prayer and supplication. By <i>his fears </i>the Psalmist means, taking
the effect for the cause, the dangers which sorely disquieted his mind; yet
doubtless he confesses that he had been terrified and agitated by fears. He did
not look upon his dangers with a calm and untroubled mind, as if he viewed them
at a distance and from some elevated position, but being grievously tormented
with innumerable cares, he might justly speak of his fears and terrors. Nay
more, by the use of the plural number, he shows that he had been greatly
terrified not only in one way, but that he had been distracted by a variety of
troubles. On the one hand, he saw a cruel death awaiting him; while on the
other, his mind may have been filled with fear, lest Achish should send him to
Saul for his gratification, as the ungodly are wont to make sport to themselves
of the children of God. And since he had already been detected and betrayed
once, he might well conclude, even if he should escape, that the hired assassins
of Saul would lay wait for him on all sides. The hatred too which Achish had
conceived against him, both for the death of Goliath and the destruction of his
own army, might give rise to many fears; especially considering that his enemy
might instantly wreak his vengeance upon him, and that he had good reason to
think that his cruelty was such as would not be appeased by subjecting him to
some mild form of death.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa654</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We ought to mark this particularly, in
order that, if at any time we are terrified because of the dangers which
surround us, we may not be prevented by our effeminacy from calling upon God.
Even David, who is known to have surpassed others in heroism and bravery, had
not such a heart of iron as to repel all fears and alarms, but was sometimes
greatly disquieted and smitten with
fear.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look to him, and
shall flow to him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have already
intimated, that this verse and the following should be read in connection with
the preceding verse. In relating his own experience David has furnished an
example to others, that they should freely and without fear approach God in
order to present their prayers before him. Now, he says that they shall come,
and this too with a happy issue. The first two verbs are expressed in the past
time in the Hebrew; but I have, notwithstanding, no doubt that the sentence
ought to be explained thus:When they shall have looked to him, and flowed to
him, their faces shall not be ashamed. I have therefore translated them in the
future tense. David is not relating things which had happened, but is commending
the fruit of the favor which had been manifested to himself. Some interpreters,
I know, refer the words <i>to him </i>to
David,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa655</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because immediately after he speaks of
himself in the third person. Others with greater propriety explain it; of God
himself. A difference of opinion also exists as to the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wrhn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
naharu, </i>which some, supposing it to be derived from the root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>or, </i>render <i>to be
enlightened.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa656</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But, in my opinion, the natural
signification of the word appears very appropriate to this place; as if he had
said, There shall now be a mirror set forth, in which men may behold the face of
God serene and merciful; and therefore the poor and afflicted shall henceforth
dare to lift up their eyes to God, and to resort to him with the utmost freedom,
because no uncertainty shall any longer retard them or render them slothful. If,
however, any one should prefer the word <i>enlighten, </i>the meaning will be,
They who formerly languished in darkness shall lift up their eyes to God, as if
a light had suddenly appeared unto them, and they who were cast down and
overwhelmed with shame, shall again clothe their countenances with cheerfulness.
But as the meaning in either case is substantially the same, I am not much
disposed to contend which of the two interpretations ought to be
preferred.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This poor man cried, and
Jehovah heard him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here introduces
all the godly speaking of himself, the more emphatically to express how much
weight there is in his example to encourage them. This poor man, say they,
cried; therefore God invites all the poor to cry to him. They contemplate in
David what belongs to the common benefit of all the godly; for God is as willing
and ready at this day to hear all the afflicted who direct their sighs, wishes,
and cries, to him with the same faith, as he was at that time to hear
David.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i>David here discourses in general of God's fatherly favor towards all the
godly; and as the life of man is exposed to innumerable dangers, he at the same
time teaches us that God is able to deliver them. The faithful especially, who
are as sheep in the midst of wolves, beset as it were with death in every form,
are constantly harassed with the dread of some approaching danger. David
therefore affirms, that the servants of God are protected and defended by
angels. The design of the Psalmist is to show, that although the faithful are
exposed to many dangers, yet they may rest assured that God will be the faithful
guardian of their life. But in order to confirm them the more in this hope, he
adds at the same time, and not without reason, that those whom God would
preserve in safety he defends by the power and ministration of angels. The power
of God alone would indeed be sufficient of itself to perform this; but in mercy
to our infirmity he vouchsafes to employ angels as his ministers. It serves not
a little for the confirmation of our faith to know that God has innumerable
legions of angels who are always ready for his service as often as he is pleased
to aid us; nay, more, that the angels too, who are called principalities and
powers, are ever intent upon the preservation of our life, because they know
that this duty is intrusted to them. God is indeed designated with propriety the
wall of his Church, and every kind of fortress and place of
defense</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa658</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to her; but in accommodation to the
measure and extent of our present imperfect state, he manifests the presence of
his power to aid us through the instrumentality of his angels. Moreover, what
the Psalmist here says of one angel in the singular number, ought to be applied
to all the other angels:for they are distinguished by the general appellation
of</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"ministering spirits sent
forth to minister to them who shall be the heirs of salvation,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
1:14 ;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and the Scriptures in other places teach us, that
whenever it pleases God, and whenever he knows it to be for their benefit, many
angels are appointed to take care of each of his people,

of our enemies and the dangers by which we are surrounded may be, yet the angels
of God, armed with invincible power, constantly watch over us, and array
themselves on every side to aid and deliver us from all
evil.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Taste and see that Jehovah is
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse the Psalmist
indirectly reproves men for their dulness in not perceiving the goodness of God,
which ought to be to them more than matter of simple knowledge. By the word
<i>taste </i>he at once shows that they are without taste; and at the same time
he assigns the reason of this to be, that they devour the gifts of God without
relishing them, or through a vitiated loathing ungratefully conceal them. He,
therefore, calls upon them to stir up their senses, and to bring a palate endued
with some capacity of tasting, that God's goodness may become known to them, or
rather, be made manifest to them. The words literally rendered are,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Taste and see, for the Lord is
good;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki</i>, <i>for, </i>is taken exegetically. David's meaning, therefore, is,
that there is nothing on the part of God to prevent the godly, to whom he
particularly speaks in this place, from arriving at the knowledge of his
goodness by actual experience. From this it follows, that they also are infected
with the common malady of dulness. This doctrine is confirmed by the promise
immediately added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is the
man who trusteth in him;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for God never
disappoints the expectations of those who seek his favor. Our own unbelief is
the only impediment which prevents him from satisfying us largely and
bountifully with abundance of all good
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear Jehovah, ye his
saints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the people of God are
exhorted to the pursuit of holiness and righteousness, that they may open up a
channel for divine blessings. We know that men are accustomed to provide for
their wants, by resorting to fraud, plunder, and even to wrongful violence. Nor
is it possible but that the faithful must feel some stirrings of a desire to
imitate the wicked, and envy them in some degree in their prosperity, so that
they permit themselves sometimes to howl among the wolves. And although they
voluntarily abstain from all wrongful <i>violence, </i>yet the common way of
living among those around them carries them away like a tempest; and, in the
meantime, they think that the plea of necessity is sufficient to excuse them.
David represses, as with a bridle, these temptations, promising that all will be
well with the people of God, provided they keep themselves in the fear of God,
which he opposes to all wicked and deceitful counsels; because the greater part
of men reckon those to be fools who aim at simplicity, since in so doing they do
not consult their own interests and profit. While, therefore, ungodly men are
afraid of poverty, and carnal reason urges them to attempt whatever their fancy
may suggest for keeping themselves from it, David here testifies that God takes
care of the godly, so that he never suffers them to be in want. Let no fear or
distrust, says he, withdraw you from the pursuit of what is right, because God
never forsakes those who walk righteously before him. The Psalmist, therefore,
bids them yield to God the honor of expecting more from him alone than the
wicked expect from their deceitful traffic and unlawful practices. Moreover, as
iniquity rages with unbridled fury everywhere throughout the world, he calls
expressly upon the saints to be on their guard, because he would be of no
service to the promiscuous multitude. It is a sentiment contrary to the
generally received opinion among men, that while the integrity of the good and
simple is exposed to the will of the wicked, there should yet be greater
security in integrity than in all the resources of fraud and injustice. There
is, therefore, no inconsistency in his admonishing the saints who, of their own
accord, are endeavoring to walk uprightly, not to depart from the fear of God;
for we know how easily the light of piety may be obscured and extinguished, when
there appears no hope of living happily and prosperously, except in the pursuit
of the world and its enticing pleasures.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
Psalmist illustrates this doctrine by a very apposite comparison, namely, that
God provides every thing necessary for his people, and relieves their wants,
whilst the lions, which surpass in ferocity all the wild beasts of the earth,
prowl about in a famishing condition for their prey. Some think, that under the
name of <i>lions, </i>those men who are addicted to violence and plunder are
metaphorically described; but this, in my opinion, is too refined. David simply
asserts, that those who guard against all unrighteousness should profit more by
so doing than by rapine and plunder; because the Lord feeds his people, while
even the lions and other beasts of prey often suffer hunger. What he says, then,
is, that sooner shall the lions perish with hunger and want, than God will
disappoint of their necessary food the righteous and sincere, who, content with
his blessing alone, seek their food only from his hand. Whoever, therefore,
shall in this way cast his cares upon God, and confide implicitly in his
paternal goodness and bounty, shall live quietly and peaceably among men, and
suffer no injury. If it is objected, that the good and the virtuous are not
always exempted from penury, I answer, that the hand of God is stretched out to
succor them in due season, when they are reduced to the greatest straits, and
know not to what side to turn,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

seek not in vain from him whatever is necessary to the sustenance of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

increased earnestness, to exhort the faithful, that they may know that nothing
can be more profitable for them than to conduct themselves justly and harmlessly
towards all men. As the greater part of men imagine that the best and the
shortest way to attain a life of happiness and ease consists in striving to
surpass other men in violence, fraud, injustice, and other means of mischief, it
is necessary frequently to repeat this doctrine. Moreover, as it is necessary
that the minds of men should be brought to a chastened and humble state, by
calling them <i>his children, </i>he endeavors, by this gentle and courteous
appellation, to allay all froward affections. None will stand unmoved amidst so
many assaults, but those who have been endued by the Spirit of meekness with the
greatest modesty. The prophet, therefore, tells them at the outset, that the
rule of life which he prescribes can be observed and obeyed by those only who
are meek and submissive. To the same purpose is the word <i>come, </i>and the
command <i>to hearken; </i>and they imply, that men laying aside all wilfulness
of spirit, and having subdued the ardor and impetuosity of their minds, should
become docile and meek. He has put
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fear of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for the rule of a pious and holy
life:as if he had said, Whilst virtue and righteousness are in every man's
mouth, there are few who lead a holy life, and live as they ought; because they
know not what it is to serve God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is the man who desireth
life?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The prophet does not inquire if
there be any man so disposed, as if all men voluntarily brought upon themselves
the miseries which befall them; for we know that all men without exception
desire to live in the enjoyment of happiness. But he censures severely the
blindness and folly which men exhibit in the frowardness of their desires, and
the vanity of their endeavors to obtain happiness; for while all men are
seeking, and eagerly intent upon acquiring what is for their profit, there will
be found scarcely one in a hundred who studies to purchase peace, and a quiet
and desirable state of life, by just and equitable means. The prophet therefore
admonishes his disciples, that nearly the whole world are deceived and led
astray by their own folly, while they promise themselves a happy life from any
other source than the divine blessing, which God bestows only upon the sincere
and upright in heart. But there is in this exclamation still greater vehemence,
the more effectually to awaken dull and drowsy minds to the course of this
world; as if he had said, Since all men earnestly desire happiness, how comes it
to pass, that scarcely any one sets himself to obtain it, and that every man, by
his own fault, rather brings upon himself various troubles
?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep thy tongue from
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The precept which David here
delivers relates to a virtue which is very rare, namely, that we should be
truthful and free from deceit in our discourse. Some, indeed, understand it in a
much more extended sense, supposing that slander is condemned in this first
clause. But it seems to me more simple, and more to the purpose, to understand
this as of the same import with what he repeats in the second clause, that we
should not speak <i>deceitfully </i>with our neighbors, so as that our words may
prove the means of ensnaring them. And since nothing is more difficult than to
regulate our discourse in such a manner as that our speech may be a true
representation of our hearts, David calls upon us to exercise over it a strict
and watchful control, not suffering it to run riot, lest it should prove the
occasion of our deceiving others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turn away from evil, and do
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist commands the
children of God to abstain from all evil, and to devote themselves to the work
of doing good to their neighbors. This verse is generally quoted as if David
here treated of the two parts of repentance. The first step in the work of
repentance is, that the sinner forsake the vices to which he is addicted, and
renounce his former manner of life; and the second, that he frame his behavior
according to righteousness. But in this place we are more especially taught how
we ought to deal with our neighbors. As it often happens, that the man who is
not only liberal, but also prodigal towards some, or, at least, helps many by
acts of kindness, wrongs others by defrauding and injuring them, David, with
much propriety, begins by saying, that those who desire to have their life
approved before God, ought to abstain from doing evil. On the other hand, since
many think, that provided they have neither defrauded, nor wronged, nor injured
any man, they have discharged the duty which God requires from them, he has
added, with equal propriety, the other precept concerning doing good to our
neighbors. It is not the will of God that his servants should be idle, but
rather that they should aid one another, desiring each other's welfare and
prosperity, and promoting it as far as in them lies. David next inculcates the
duty of maintaining peace:<i>Seek peace, and pursue it. </i>Now we know that
this is maintained by gentleness and forbearance. But as we have often to do
with men of a fretful, or factious, or stubborn spirit, or with such as are
always ready to stir up strife upon the slightest occasion; and as also many
wicked persons irritate us; and as others by their own wickedness alienate, as
much as in them lies, the minds of good men from them, and others industriously
strive to find grounds of contention; he teaches us not merely that we ought to
seek peace, but if at any time it shall seem to flee from us, he bids us use our
every effort without ceasing in pursuing it. This, however, must be understood
with some limitation. It will often happen, that when good and humble men have
done every thing in their power to secure peace, so far from softening the
hearts of the wicked, or inclining them to uprightness, they rather excite their
malice. Their impiety, also, often constrains us to separate from them, and to
avoid them; nay, when they defy God, by proclaiming, as it were, open war
against him, it would be disloyalty and treason on our part not to oppose and
resist them. But here David means only that in our own personal affairs we
should be meek and condescending, and endeavor, as far as in us lies, to
maintain peace, though its maintenance should prove to us a source of much
trouble and inconvenience.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

patience is a firm persuasion that God regards us, and that according as every
man perseveres in a course of uprightness and equity, so shall he be preserved
in peace and safety under his protection. In order, therefore, that the faithful
may not think that they are exposed to the caprice of the world, while they are
endeavoring to keep themselves innocent, and that they may not, under the
influence of this fear, go astray from the right path, David exhorts them to
reflect upon the providence of God, and to rest assured that they are safe under
his wings. He says, then, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the eyes of the Lord are upon the
righteous,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to<i> </i>preserve them, in order
that the good and simple may persevere the more cheerfully in their uprightness.
At the same time, he encourages them to supplication and prayer, if at any time
the world should unjustly persecute them. In saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the ears of the Lord are open to
their cry,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he teaches that the man who
is wantonly and unjustly persecuted, will find a ready and suitable remedy in
all afflictions, by calling upon God as his avenger. On the other hand, he
declares, that although God sometimes appears to wink at the misdeeds of men,
and seems to overlook them, because he does not inflict immediate punishment
upon them, yet nothing escapes his inspection. Whilst the wicked, says he, by
reason of their impunity harden themselves in sin, God is watching, that he may
<i>cut off their remembrance from the earth,
</i>(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:10.) He speaks particularly of this kind of punishment, because the
ungodly not only expect that they shall be happy during their whole life, but
also imagine that they shall enjoy immortality in this world. Peter, in his
First Epistle,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa662</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> applies this passage very judiciously,
for the purpose of assuaging our sorrows and appeasing our impatience, as often
as the pride and arrogance of the wicked may carry us beyond due limits. Nothing
is more useful for preserving our moderation than to depend upon God's help, and
having the testimony of a good conscience, to rely upon his judgment. If it is
objected, that good men experience the contrary, who, after having been long
afflicted, at length find no help or comfort; I reply, that the aid which God
affords to the righteous is not always made manifest, nor bestowed in the same
measure; and yet he so alleviates their troubles as never to forsake them.
Besides, even the best of men often deprive themselves of the help of God; for
scarcely one in a hundred perseveres in such a course of integrity as not, by
his own fault, to deserve the infliction of some evil upon himself. But as soon
as they fall, lest sin should take root in them, God chastises them, and often
punishes them more severely than the reprobate, whom he spares to utter
destruction.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

that they are heard as often as they cry. This is a doctrine applicable to all
times; and David does not merely relate what God has done once or twice, but
what he is accustomed to do. It is also a confirmation of the preceding
sentence, where he had said that the ears of the Lord are open to the cry of the
righteous; for he now demonstrates by the effect, that God is not deaf when we
lay our complaints and groanings before him. By the word <i>cry</i> we are
taught, that although God defend the righteous, they are not exempt from
adversity. He regulates the protection which he affords them in such a wonderful
manner, as that he notwithstanding exercises them by various trials. In like
manner, when we here see that deliverance is promised only to those who call
upon God, this ought to prove no small encouragement to us to pray to him; for
it is not his will that the godly should so regard his providence as to indulge
in idleness, but rather that, being firmly persuaded that he is the guardian of
their safety, they should direct their prayers and supplications to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is nigh to those who are

and extends still more the preceding doctrine, that God is the deliverer of his
people, even when they are brought very low, and when they are, as it were,
half-dead. It is a very severe trial, when the grace of God is delayed, and all
experience of it so far withdrawn, as that our spirits begin to fail; nay more,
to say that God is nigh to the faithful, even when their hearts faint and fall
them, and they are ready to die, is altogether incredible to human sense and
reason. But by this means his power shines forth more clearly, when he raises us
up again from the grave. Moreover, it is meet that the faithful should be thus
utterly cast down and afflicted, that they may breathe again in God alone. From
this we also learn, that nothing is more opposed to true patience than the
loftiness of heart of which the Stoics boast; for we are not accounted truly
humbled until true affliction of heart has abased us before God, so that, having
prostrated ourselves in the dust before him, he may raise us up. It is a
doctrine full of the sweetest consolation, that God departs not from us, even
when we are overwhelmed by a succession of miseries, and, as it were, almost
deprived of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many are the afflictions of the
righteous.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here anticipates
the thought which often arises in the mind, "How can it be that God has a care
about the righteous, who are continually harassed with so many calamities and
trials? for what purpose does the protection of God serve, unless those who are
peaceably inclined enjoy peace and repose? and what is more unreasonable, than
that those who cause trouble to no one should themselves be tormented and
afflicted in all variety of ways?" That, therefore, the temptations by which we
are continually assailed may not shake our belief in the providence of God, we
ought to remember this lesson of instruction, that although God governs the
righteous, and provides for their safety, they are yet subject and exposed to
many miseries, that, being tested by such trials, they may give evidence of
their invincible constancy, and experience so much the more that God is their
deliverer. If they were exempted from every kind of trial, their faith would
languish, they would cease to call upon God, and their piety would remain hidden
and unknown. It is, therefore, necessary that they should be exercised with
various trials, and especially for this end, that they may acknowledge that they
have been wonderfully preserved by God amidst numberless deaths. If this should
seldom happen, it might appear to be fortuitous, or the result of chance; but
when innumerable and interminable evils come upon them in succession, the grace
of God cannot be unknown, when he always stretches forth his hand to them.
David, therefore, admonishes the faithful never to lose their courage, whatever
evils may threaten them; since God, who can as easily deliver them a thousand
times as once from death, will never disappoint their expectation. What he adds
concerning <i>their bones, </i>seems not a little to illustrate the truth of
this doctrine, and to teach us that those who are protected by God shall be free
from all danger. He therefore declares, that God will take care that not one of
their bones shall be broken; in which sense Christ also says,
that</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
ra&auml;h, </i>which I have translated <i>malice, </i>some would rather render
<i>misery, </i>so that the meaning would be, that the ungodly shall perish
miserably, because in the end they shall be overwhelmed with calamities. The
other translation, however, is more expressive, namely, that their wickedness,
with which they think themselves fortified, shall fall upon their own heads. As
David therefore taught before, that there was no defense better than a just and
blameless life, so now he declares, that all the wicked enterprises of the
wicked, even though no one should in any thing oppose them, shall turn to their
own destruction. In the second clause of the verse he states, that it is for the
sake of the righteous that it is ordered, that the ungodly are themselves the
cause and instruments of their own destruction. <i>Those, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who hate the righteous shall be
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Let this, therefore, be to us
as a wall of brass and sure defense; that however numerous the enemies which
beset us may be, we should not be afraid, because they are already devoted to
destruction. The same thing David confirms in the last verse, in which he says,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah redeems the soul of
his servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>How could they be
preserved in safety, even for a moment, among so many dangers, unless God
interposed his power for their defense? But by the word <i>redeem </i>there is
expressed a kind of preservation which is repugnant to the flesh. For it is
necessary that we should first be adjudged or doomed to death, before God should
appear as our redeemer. From this it follows, that those who hurry forward too
precipitately, and are unable to realize God's power unless he appear speedily,
working deliverance for them, intercept the communication of his grace.
Moreover, that none might form their judgment of the servants of God by moral or
philosophic virtue only, as it is called, David specifies this as a principal
mark by which they may be known, that they trust in God, on whom also their
salvation depends.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM

<div><font face="Palatino">So long as Saul was the enemy of David, the nobles,
and such as at that time bore any authority, had (according to the subservient
spirit which always prevails in the courts of kings) eagerly conspired to
destroy an innocent man. They had also succeeded in inducing the common people
to participate with them in their hatred and cruelty, so that all of them, from
the highest to the lowest, burned with implacable hatred against him. But as he
knew that the greatest part of them were thoughtlessly impelled to this by error
and folly, and ignorance of the true state of affairs, he accounts those only
his enemies who, from deliberate malice and wickedness, endeavored in this way
to please Saul, in order to obtain his favor. Against them he calls upon God for
vengeance. And, first, as he was conscious of no crime, he alleges his innocence
before God; and, secondly, as they sought to inflict unmerited punishment upon
him, he implores God for deliverance. After he has complained of their impious
cruelty, he calls down upon them the punishment which they deserved. Moreover,
as in confident reliance upon the oracle of God, which had been spoken by
Samuel, and the holy anointing, he hoped for a better issue, he intersperses
throughout the psalm testimonies of his thankfulness. Finally, he concludes the
psalm by saying, that after he has been delivered, he will celebrate the praises
of God all his life.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Plead my cause, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the enemies of David not
only avowedly sought to take away his life, but also troubled him by calumny and
misrepresentation, he pleads for the redress of both these grievances. In the
first place, by appealing to God for his aid in defense of his cause, he
intimates, that he has to do with wicked and maligning men. In the second place,
by urging him to take up arms, he shows that he was grievously oppressed. It was
a very dishonorable thing, that this holy man, alike eminent for his beneficence
and inoffensiveness towards all men, and who by his courtesy and meekness had
merited, both in public and private, the esteem and favor of all, was not
permitted to escape the reproach and calumny of wicked men; but it is important
for us to know this, and it sets before us a very profitable example. If even
David did not escape the malice of wicked men, it ought not to seem wonderful or
strange to us, if they blame and bite at us. The injuries they inflict upon us
may be grievous and painful, but there is incomparable consolation presented to
us in this consideration, that God himself interposes for our protection and
defense against false accusations. Though calumniators, then, should arise, and
tear us, as it were, to pieces, by falsely charging us with crimes, we need not
be disturbed, so long as God undertakes to plead our cause against them. There
can be no doubt, that in the second clause of the verse David implores God to
resist the armed violence of his enemies. The amount of the whole is, that being
falsely accused and cruelly persecuted, and finding no help at the hands of men,
the Prophet commits the preservation of his life and his reputation to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take the
shield.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words certainly cannot be
applied, in the strict and proper sense, to God, who has no need of the spear or
buckler:for by the breath of his mouth alone, or merely with his nod, he is able
to overthrow all his enemies. But although such figures at first sight appear
rude, yet the Holy Ghost employs them in accommodation to the weakness of our
understanding, for the purpose of impressing more effectually upon our minds the
conviction that God is present to aid us. When troubles and dangers arise, when
terrors assail us on every side, when even death presents itself to our view, it
is difficult to realize the secret and invisible power of God, which is able to
deliver us from all anxiety and fear; for our understandings, which are gross
and earthly, tend downward to the earth. That our faith, therefore, may ascend
by degrees to the heavenly power of God, he is here introduced armed, after the
manner of men, with sword and shield. In the same way, also, when he is in
another place termed "a man of war," it is doubtless in adaptation to the
imperfection of our present state, because our minds, from their limited
capacity, could in no other way comprehend the extent of that infinite power,
which contains in itself every form of help, and has no need of aid from any
other quarter. This, therefore, is a prayer that God, by the exercise of his
secret and intrinsic power, would show that he alone is able to encounter the
whole strength and forces of the ungodly. Some suppose that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsinnah, </i>here used, means <i>a dart, </i>or some other kind of weapon;
but as we have already seen, in the fifth psalm, that it properly signifies a
<i>buckler, </i>I see no reason why it should be differently interpreted in this
place. Nor is there any thing at all inconsistent in connecting here, as is
often done in other places, the buckler and the
shield.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa666</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If the expression here employed had
been designed to signify a dart, or a similar weapon, it would have been more
natural to connect it with the spear, of which mention is made in the following
verse. David, then, first makes mention of defensive armor, praying that God
would sustain and repel the assaults of the enemy. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qyr</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
rik, </i>which signifies <i>to unsheath, </i>or <i>make bare, </i>I take simply
to mean, <i>to draw out, </i>or <i>bring forth. </i>The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwgs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>segor, </i>which I have translated <i>to oppose, </i>literally signifies
<i>to shut </i>or <i>to close. </i>But as David's meaning is, that God, by
setting himself as a wall or rampart, would prevent his enemies from approaching
him, it appears to me that I have faithfully translated it. At the same time, if
any should prefer the translation to <i>shut, </i>or <i>close the way, </i>or
<i>to impede it by some obstacle, </i>the meaning; is substantially the same.
The opinion of those who contend that it is a
noun,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

probable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

thus:Declare to me by secret inspiration; and others, Make me to feel indeed
that my salvation is in thy hand. In my opinion, David desires to have it
thoroughly fixed in his mind, and to be fully persuaded that God is the author
of his salvation. This he was unable, from the present aspect of things, to
ascertain and determine; for such is the insensibility and dulness of our
natures, that God often delivers us whilst we sleep and are ignorant of it.
Accordingly, he makes use of a very forcible manner of expression, in praying
that God would grant him a lively sense of his favor, so that being armed with
this buckler, he might sustain every conflict, and surmount every opposing
obstacle; as if he had said, Lord, whatever may arise to discourage me, confirm
me in this persuasion, that my salvation is assuredly in thee; and although
temptations drive me hither and thither, recall my thoughts to thee in such a
manner, as that my hope of salvation may rise superior to all the dangers to
which I shall be exposed;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let those who seek my soul be
confounded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now calls upon God to
take vengeance upon his enemies; and he asks not only that he would disappoint
and destroy their designs, but also that he would recompense them according to
their deserts. In the first place, he desires that they may be confounded and
put to shame in seeing their expectation and desire fail; and then he proceeds
farther, desiring that while they imagine themselves to be firmly established,
and deeply rooted, they may be like chaff or stubble. As the chaff is driven
with the wind, so also he desires, that, being disquieted by the secret impulse
of the angel of the Lord, they may never have rest. The imprecation which
follows is even more dreadful, and it is this:that wherever they go they may
meet with darkness and slippery places; and that in their doubt and perplexity
the angel of the Lord would pursue them. In fine, whatever they devise, and to
whatever side they turn, he prays that all their counsels and enterprises may
come to a disastrous termination. When he desires that they may be driven by the
angel of the Lord, we learn from this that the reason why the ungodly are
troubled, though no man pursues them, is, that God smites them with a spirit of
amazement, and distracts them with such fears that they tremble and are
troubled.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The same thing he expresses more
clearly in the following verse, praying that the angel of the Lord would drive
them through dark and slippery places, so that reason and understanding might
fail them, and that they might not know whither to go, nor what to become, nor
have even time given them to draw their breath. We need not be surprised that
this work should be assigned to the angels, by whose instrumentality God
executes his judgments. At the same time, this passage may be expounded of the
devils as well as of the holy angels, who are ever ready to execute the divine
behests. We know that the devil is permitted to exercise his dominion over the
reprobate; and hence it is often said that "an evil spirit from God came upon
Saul,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 18:10.) But as the devils never execute the will of God, unless compelled
to do it when God wishes to serve himself of them; the Sacred Scriptures declare
that the holy and elect angels are in a much higher sense the servants of God.
God, then, executes his judgments by the wicked and reprobate angels; but he
gives the elect angels the pre-eminence over them. On this account, also, good
angels only are called rightfully "principalities," as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:10;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:16, and other similar passages. If it is objected that it is not meet that the
angels, who are the ministers of grace and salvation, and the appointed
guardians of the faithful, should be employed in executing judgment upon the
reprobate, the explanation is simply this, that they cannot watch for the
preservation of the godly without being prepared for fighting &#8212; that they
cannot succor them by their aid without also opposing their enemies, and
declaring themselves to be against them. The style of imprecation which the
Psalmist here employs can be explained only by bearing in mind what I have
elsewhere said, namely, that David pleads not simply his own cause, nor utters
rashly the dictates of passion, nor with unadvised zeal desires the destruction
of his enemies; but under the guidance of the Holy Spirit he entertains and
expresses against the reprobate such desires as were characterised by great
moderation, and which were far removed from the spirit of those who are impelled
either by desire of revenge or hatred, or some other inordinate emotion of the
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they have hid for me
without a cause.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>here declares
that he did not take the name of God in vain, nor call upon him for protection
without just cause, for he openly asserts his innocence, and complains that he
was thus severely afflicted without having committed any crime, or given any
occasion to his enemies. It becomes us carefully to mark this, so that no one
may rush unadvisedly into God's presence, nor call upon him for vengeance,
without the assurance and testimony of a good conscience. When he says that he
was assailed by stratagem, fraud, and wicked practices, there is implied in this
a tacit commendation of his own
integrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let confusion of which he is

prays that God would cause to return upon the head of his enemies the mischief
which they had directed against a just and an inoffensive man. The change from
the plural to the singular number, even when the same subject, is spoken of, is,
we know, a thing very common among the Hebrews. Accordingly, what is here said
of one man is applicable to all David's enemies in general, unless, perhaps, we
are rather inclined to suppose that allusion is here made to Saul or some one of
his nobles. But as it is certain that the prayer which he here offers against
Saul as the head extends to the whole body, in other words, to all his
followers,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa671</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it matters little in which way we
understand it. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">haw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shoah, </i>sometimes signifies <i>confusion, </i>and sometimes
<i>destruction; </i>and, therefore, many translate it, <i>Let destruction,
</i>or <i>desolation, </i>or <i>ruin, come upon him. </i>The other rendering,
however, seems more suitable, for he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let his own net which he hath
hidden catch him, let him fall into it with
confusion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The way in which others
render it, <i>Let him fall into destruction itself, </i>is certainly forced and
unnatural. But the meaning of the clause will be brought out very suitable if it
is viewed as a prayer of David, that as the wicked settle down like wine upon
the lees, in present enjoyments, and fear nothing, as if they were placed beyond
the reach of all danger, some calamity which they think not of may suddenly come
upon them like a tempest, and overwhelm them. It never for a moment occurs to
them as at all possible that their stratagems and craft, their wicked practices,
and all the snares which they lay for the good and the simple, turn to the
destruction of themselves who have devised them. David, therefore, very properly
desires that they may fall with confusion into the nets which they have laid; in
other words, that they may be filled with amazement and terror when they are
suddenly and unexpectedly visited with calamity. The more unbounded and
extravagant the exultation of men is, through their vainly and foolishly
imagining that they shall escape unpunished, the more are they filled with
amazement and fear when calamity suddenly overtakes them. I have, however, no
doubt that David here refers to some strange and extraordinary calamity. Let
<i>confusion, </i>then, of which he thinks not, come upon him; that is to say,
when he shall have persuaded himself that all goes well with him, and promised
himself peace in his deceitful fascinations, then let unwonted terror strike him
to the heart, and let him feel by his tumultuous fear that he is caught in his
own snares.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my soul is joyful in

optative mood, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May my soul
rejoice in Jehovah, and may it be glad in his
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But instead of continuing to
express his desires, David, in my opinion, rather promises in this verse that he
will be grateful to God. This is still more evident from the following verse, in
which extolling very highly the goodness of God, he says that he will celebrate
the remembrance of it with every member of his body. While, therefore, some
ascribe to fortune, and others to their own skill, the praise of their
deliverance from danger, and few, if any, yield the whole praise of it to God,
David here declares that he will not forget the favor which God had bestowed
upon him. My soul, says he, shall rejoice, not in a deliverance of the author of
which it is ignorant, but in the salvation of God. To place the matter in a
still stronger light, he assigns to his very bones the office of declaring the
divine glory. As if not content that his tongue should be employed in this, he
applies all the members of his body to the work of setting forth the praises of
God. The style of speaking which he employs is hyperbolical, but in this way he
shows unfeignedly that his love to God was so strong that he desired to spend
his sinews and bones in declaring the reality and truth of his
devotion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! who is like
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he explains more fully the
nature of his joy in the salvation of God of which he had spoken, showing that
it consisted in his ascribing entirely to God the deliverance which he had
obtained. Men, in general, praise God in such a manner that he scarcely obtains
the tenth part of his due. But David, distinguishing him from all others,
distinctly declares that the whole glory of his deliverance is due to him alone.
And, certainly, we then only yield to God what belongs to him, when, investing
him with his own power, we rest all our hopes on him. For what purpose does it
serve, loudly to celebrate the name of God with our mouths, if we tear in pieces
his power and goodness at our pleasure? David, therefore, in the true spirit of
godliness, extols the greatness of God by this high encomium, that he is the
guardian and defender of the poor, and rescues the needy and afflicted from the
hand of those who oppress them; as if he had said, It is God's peculiar duty to
succor the miserable. By these words we are taught to cling to the hope of
better things in adversity; for the power and resources of our enemies, however
great they may be, is no reason why we should lose our confidence, since God
declares to us from heaven that he reigns expressly for the purpose of resisting
the strong and powerful. If the children of this world, who employ their power
in injuring and oppressing the weak, had the least degree of sound
understanding, it would certainly serve to restrain their audacity, and prevent
them proceeding farther in provoking the wrath of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

up; </i>but in using the future tense, the Psalmist intimates that he is
speaking of what he had suffered for a long time. And he complains that he was
so oppressed with calumny that he had no opportunity of defending himself; than
which nothing more grievous and painful can ever happen to those of an ingenuous
mind, and who are conscious of no blame. Besides, he not only says that he had
been falsely accused, but he also condemns the audacity and insolence of those
who violently rose up to bear witness against him. To this belongs what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They charge me with things which
I know not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David then was not only
spoiled of his worldly goods, and basely driven into exile, but was also accused
and loaded with infamy under color of justice. Being involved in such distress,
he resorted directly to God, hoping that he would maintain his innocence. So
ought the children of God to walk through good report and bad report, and
patiently suffer reproach, until he assert and declare their innocence from on
high. In old times, it was a common proverb among the heathen, "There is no
theater more beautiful than a good conscience;" and in this they uttered a noble
sentiment; but no man can be sustained and supported by the purity of his
conscience unless he has recourse to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They render me evil for
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David again shows that the malice
of his enemies was of a very aggravated character, because they not only
oppressed him wrongfully, seeing he was innocent, and had given them no occasion
of offense, but also because even those who had received much enjoyment and many
favors from him, recompensed him in a very strange and ungrateful manner. Such
disgraceful conduct wounds the feelings of good men very severely, and seems
quite intolerable. But it is an inexpressibly great consolation when we can
testify before God, that we have attempted by every means in our power to soothe
the minds of our enemies, and to bow them to gentleness, although,
notwithstanding, they are hurried on by insatiable cruelty in desiring our hurt;
for God will not suffer this barbarous and brutal ingratitude to pass
unpunished. Their cruelty is farther expressed when it is said that they
endeavored to bereave (for so it is properly in the
Hebrew</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa674</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) the soul of a meek and peaceable man;
that is to say, to deprive it of comfort, and render it so desolate as to
overwhelm it with despair and destroy it. David afterwards recounts certain acts
of kindness which he had done them, and which, if they had had any sense of
equity and humanity, ought to have been as so many sacred bonds of mutual love.
He does not say that he aided them with money or with goods, or that he had by
some other means exercised liberality towards them, for it may sometimes happen
that when the hand is open the heart may be shut; but he mentions certain tokens
of true and genuine love &#8212; that he lamented their misfortunes before God,
and was troubled for them, as if he had mourned for the death of his mother;
and, finally, that he felt for and took an interest in them as if they had been
his own brothers. Since then he had thus laid them under high obligations to
him, of what baser ingratitude could they be guilty than to vomit against him in
his adversity the poison of their hatred? With respect to the meaning of the
words, I take the term <i>sickness, </i>in this place, to signify metaphorically
any kind of trouble or sorrow. David's meaning is, that as often as any calamity
had befallen them he was a partaker of their grief. A good evidence of this was
the prayer which he says he <i>poured out into his own bosom. </i>The proper
meaning of the expression is, that he did not ostentatiously utter his prayers
aloud before men, like many who pretend much more affection than they really
feel, but that by praying in secret, and without making the world privy to it,
he showed that he was sincerely and from the heart distressed by reason of their
affliction. As we say that a man rejoices in his own bosom, who is satisfied
with the secret and inward feeling of his heart, without declaring it to others,
so also one may be said to weep or pray in his own bosom, who pours not forth
his tears and prayers before men to secure their favor, but, contented with
having God alone for his witness, conceals his emotions in his own heart. I do
not, however, deny that in this manner of speaking there is expressed the
attitude of one who prays, as if the Psalmist had said, that he bowed down his
body, and prayed with his head hanging down, and his arms folded, as men in
heaviness are accustomed to do.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa675</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But this especially we ought to regard
as his meaning, that there was no dissimulation in his prayer. Some think that
there is an imprecation in his words, and they explain them in this sense. Lord,
if it is true that I have not desired all prosperity to them, let all mischief
fall upon me:but this is a forced explanation. There is still another
exposition, which has as little plausibility in it; and it is this:Because I
profited nothing by praying for them, the fruit of my prayer returned to myself.
The sense, which is more in unison with the purpose and also the words of the
prophet, is, I prayed for them just as I pray for myself. But what I have
already advanced concerning the secret affection of the Psalmist will, I hope,
prove satisfactory to the judicious reader. With respect to <i>sackcloth and
fasting, </i>he used them as helps to prayer. The faithful pray even after their
meals, and do not observe fasting every day as necessary for prayer, nor
consider it needful to put on sackcloth whenever they come into the presence of
God. But we know that those who lived in ancient times resorted to these
exercises when any urgent necessity pressed upon them. In the time of public
calamity or danger they all put on sackcloth, and gave themselves to fasting,
that by humbling themselves before God, and acknowledging their guilt, they
might appease his wrath. In like manner, when any one in particular was
afflicted, in order to excite himself to greater earnestness in prayer, he put
on sackcloth and engaged in fasting, as being the tokens of grief. When David
then, as he here tells us, put on sackcloth, it was the same as if he had taken
upon himself the sins of his enemies, in order to implore from God mercy for
them, while they were exerting all their power to accomplish his destruction.
Although we may reckon the wearing of sackcloth and sitting in ashes among the
number of the legal ceremonies, yet the exercise of fasting remains in force
amongst us at this day as well as in the time of David. When God, therefore,
calls us to repentance, by showing us signs of his displeasure, let us bear in
mind that we ought not only to pray to him after the ordinary manner, but also
to employ such means as are fitted to promote our humility. In conclusion, the
Psalmist says that he behaved and acted towards them as if each of them had been
his brother.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they rejoiced at my
halting.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I see no reason why
interpreters should trouble themselves as they do about the word <i>halting.
</i>Some conjecture that David had his leg put out of joint, and others suppose
that he halted from some disease. But when we consider carefully the whole
passage, nothing is more evident than that he refers by this expression to the
calamities which befell him; as if he had said, As soon as they saw me begin to
stagger and ready to fall, they did as it were gather together against me, and
endeavored entirely to overthrow me. There is, therefore, in this expression
almost the same metaphor as we have already seen in the word <i>sickness.
</i>Now, as men often relent at seeing the misfortunes of their enemies, so that
they cease to hate or persecute those who are already miserably wretched, it was
an evidence of the very cruel and fierce spirit by which David's former friends
were actuated against him, when, upon seeing him cast down and afflicted, they
were rather by this incited furiously and insolently to assail him. At the
commencement he speaks only of a few; but immediately after, in order to show
still farther the indignity which had been done to him, he adds to them the base
and ignoble of the common people; not that he blames all alike, but that he may
the better show with what bitter hostility he was assailed on all sides. It is
probable that those who were then in power were as it were firebrands, who
endeavored to kindle every where the flame of hatred against David, that the
people every where might rise up to destroy him, and strive with each other in
this enterprise. And he repeats twice
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they gathered themselves
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order to show how resolute
and determined they were in their opposition to him; unless, perhaps, some would
prefer to explain the words thus:They gathered themselves together, not only
those who had some pretext for doing so, but even the lowest of the people. The
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ykn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nekim, </i>literally signifies <i>the whipped, </i>or
<i>beaten,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa676</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but it is here to be understood
as denoting base and disreputable persons. Some interpreters, indeed, derive it
from the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hak</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ka&auml;h, </i>which signifies <i>to make sad, </i>and expound it actively,
Those who make me sad:but the previous interpretation agrees better with the
design of the passage, namely, that David was shamefully treated by the lowest
dregs of the people. The words, <i>I knew not, </i>may be referred to the cause
as well as to the persons. I, however, explain it as referring to the persons in
this sense:So far from having any cause to complain that I have offended them,
or done them any harm, I did not even know them. At the same time, these words
may be understood as implying a complaint on the part of David, that the people
were enraged against him without any cause, since he is conscious of no crime,
and can conceive of no ground for such fierce hatred towards him. As to the last
clause of the verse, also, although interpreters entertain different opinions,
it appears to me that I have given the true and natural meaning. Literally it
is, <i>they did cut, and ceased not; </i>but there can be no doubt that the
language is metaphorical, and that the word
<i>cut</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa677</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>signifies that they opened their
mouth; as if David had said, They have insolently poured forth with open mouth
their scoffing and reproachful words against me. The additional clause in the
sentence, <i>and ceased not, </i>is a repetition common in the Hebrew language,
and is employed to express the vehemence with which David's enemies proceeded
against him. It implies that there was no end or measure to their evil-speaking,
and that they continued to pour forth with distended throats whatever first
occurred to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

hypocrites, </i>but in my opinion David simply relates the combination of his
enemies. And the meaning of the expression is to this effect, That among men of
a crafty disposition, who had been addicted to deceit, and were consequently
lost to all sense of shame, the only and the constant subject of their
deliberations was, how they might destroy this afflicted man. David again
reverts to the leaders of the people, and to those in power, as the source
whence all the mischief took its rise; for this description could not apply to a
great part of the common people, who acted rather by thoughtless impulse. He
therefore speaks particularly of the rulers, and others of a similar character,
and accuses them of cruelty, saying, that they gnash their teeth upon him like
furious wild beasts. He first calls them <i>perfidious </i>or <i>wicked,
</i>that he may the more easily obtain help and aid of God, as if calling upon
him in the extremity of distress; and, secondly, he calls them <i>jesters </i>or
<i>mockers, </i>by which he means that they have such effrontery, and are so far
lost to all sense of shame, that there is nothing which they will not dare to
do. As to the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gw[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maog, </i>which follows, interpreters are not agreed. Properly, it signifies
bread baked upon the hearth upon the embers. Some, however, because they could
not elicit from it a meaning suitable to the passage, have thought that it
should be taken for talkative jesting, or idle speech. Others, presuming to give
a still wider range to their fancy, have supposed the meaning of the Psalmist to
be, that the scoffing of such persons was as bread to them, because they take
pleasure in scoffing and jesting. To me, it appears that we ought to retain the
proper signification of the word, while, at the same time, it may be understood
in a twofold sense. Some taking
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gw[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maog, </i>for <i>a cake </i>or <i>tart, </i>are of opinion that David here
censures people of a delicate taste, who seek after fine and dainty fare, many
of whom are always to be found in the courts of princes. Others rather suppose
that he rebukes persons of a servile and sordid spirit, who, for the most
trifling consideration, would employ their tongues in reviling others, just as
in all ages there have been found men who, for a bit of bread, as we say, set
their tongues to sale. When I carefully consider other passages in which David
describes the nature and character of his enemies, I am disposed to think that
those who indulged in jesting and scoffing at feasts, and who, in sitting over
their cups, consulted about putting David to death, are here referred to. He
therefore complains, that even in the midst of their feasting and banqueting,
the ungodly, who had shaken off all shame, communed how they might take away his
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Lord! how long wilt thou
look on?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning of the word which I
have translated <i>how long, </i>is ambiguous in the Hebrew. In Latin it
signifies, How long wilt thou see it, and suffer it without uttering a word? But
the other interpretation is equally appropriate, namely, After having seemed to
take no notice of the matter for a long time, when wilt thou at length begin to
see it? The meaning, however, is substantially the same, for David complains of
God's long forbearance, declaring that while the wicked are running to every
excess, God connives at them, and delays too much to take vengeance. And
although God inculcates upon the faithful the duty of quietly and patiently
waiting till the time arrive when he shall judge it proper to help them, yet he
allows them to bewail in prayer the grief which they experience on account of
his delay. At the same time, David shows, that in so speaking he is not carried
headlong merely by the importunity of his desire, but that he is constrained to
it by the extremity of his distress. For he says that they tumultuously rush
upon him to take away his life, and he compares them to <i>lions, </i>and calls
<i>his soul solitary, </i>or <i>alone. </i>Some think that the expression,
<i>only soul, </i>means <i>clear and precious, </i>or <i>well beloved; </i>but
such do not sufficiently consider the design of David, as has been stated in the
22nd Psalm at the twenty-first
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will magnify thee in the
great congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse David
again engages to give thanks to God for all his goodness, since the faithful can
render him no other recompense than the sacrifice of praise, as we shall see in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:17. Thus even whilst he was surrounded by the impetuous billows of fear and
danger, he sets himself to the exercise of giving thanks, as if he had already
obtained his desire; and by this he intended to encourage and confirm himself in
the assurance of obtaining his requests. In this we may discern a striking and
decided evidence of invincible fortitude, for though an outcast and a fugitive,
destitute of all help, and, in short, in a state of great extremity and despair
as to all his affairs, yet still he thinks of praising God's grace, and makes
vows of solemn sacrifice to him, as if, in the midst of the darkness of death,
he saw deliverance clearly shining upon him. And he speaks not only of giving
thanks in private, but of such thanksgiving as those who were delivered out of
any great perils were wont to yield in the public assembly, by the appointment
of the law. Some translate the latter clause of the verse <i>a strong and
powerful people,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fa682</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but I do not see the propriety
of it. It is a mere subtilty to argue that the Church is endued with great
strength, and therefore is called a <i>strong people. </i>But as David simply
means the great crowd and multitude of people who were wont to go up to the
sanctuary to hold their solemn assembly before God, I have no doubt that when he
speaks of the <i>great congregation, </i>and afterwards of <i>much people,
</i>he only repeats, according to his custom, the same thing twice, for the
Hebrew word is used in both these
senses.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i>Because David's enemies already exulted in the hope of seeing his overthrow
and destruction, he prays that God would not suffer them to realize a desire so
wicked. In order to render God favorable to his cause, he again protests that
they hated him without any fault or occasion on his part, and that it was their
own malice which urged them to such cruelty against him; for in order to secure
the help of God, it is necessary to come before him with the testimony of a good
conscience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rq&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
sheker, </i>which we have rendered <i>wrongfully, </i>is by some translated
<i>deceitfully, </i>as if David meant that his enemies lay in wait for him. But
this is to reason with too much subtilty. Besides, the repetition which
immediately follows shows that he complains of their wilful hatred, inasmuch as
of their own accord, and from deliberate design, they persecuted a man who had
given them no cause of offense, but was their friend and benefactor. The Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#732;rq</font><font face="Palatino">,

</i>as in

22:8, it denotes, <i>to wag the head, </i>and <i>to shoot out the
lip.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">In the following verse, that he may
cherish still greater confidence in God, David again declares, that he has to do
with enemies of an irreconcilable character, and who are fully bent upon
cruelty. Of this we ought to be firmly persuaded, that the more grievously we
are oppressed, so much the more certainly ought we to expect deliverance. He
therefore says, that they speak of nothing but of tumults and slaughter. The
meaning of the latter clause is somewhat obscure, arising from the ambiguous
signification of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gr</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
rige. </i>As the word from which it is derived sometimes signifies <i>to cut,
</i>and sometimes <i>to rest, </i>or <i>to be quiet and peaceable, </i>there are
some who translate it <i>the meek and peaceable of the earth:</i>others
translate it, <i>with the tranquil and easy of the earth; </i>meaning by this,
those who live in the midst of riches and abundance, in the enjoyment of
undisturbed repose. Both these seem to me to be forced interpretations. Others,
too, though not more correctly, expound the word <i>in caves </i>or <i>secret
places, </i>in order that, as they say, the wicked and deceitful counsels of
such persons may not come to light. But it may be very appropriately rendered,
<i>the clefts of the earth, </i>and by this metaphor are meant the miserable and
afflicted, who are, as it were, broken and maimed. David, therefore, declares
that as soon as his enemies see any opening, that is to say, some calamity
befall him, they instantly put forth all their efforts to accomplish his
destruction. Those who, in the time of his prosperity and power, never dared
even to utter a word against him, began now, when they saw that his influence
was feeble, to plot his ruin, just as we know that the wicked are for the most
part persons of a servile and cowardly disposition, and assume not the tone of
insolence save when an advantageous opportunity presents itself, as when the
good and simple are in adversity. To the same purpose he represents them in the
next verse, as crying out with open mouth, Aha! aha! and clapping their hands
for joy that they saw David overcome, and, as it were, laid prostrate in the
dust, a spectacle in which they took great
delight.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! thou hast also
seen it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is in these words an
implied contrast between the view which God is here represented as taking, and
the sight at which, as we are told in the preceding verse, the ungodly rejoiced.
The import of David's language is, You have rejoiced exceedingly at the sight of
my miseries; but God also sees and takes notice of the cruelty and malice of
those who feel a pleasure and gratification in seeing others afflicted and in
trouble. David, however, in thus speaking, stays not to reason with his enemies,
but rather addresses himself directly to God, and sets his providence as a
rampart of defense in opposition to all the assaults of those who sought to
shake his confidence, and who caused him much trouble. And certainly, if we
would fortify ourselves against the scoffing and derision of our enemies, the
best means which we can employ for this end is to overlook them, and to elevate
our thoughts to God, and in the confidence of his fatherly care over us, to
entreat him to show, in very deed, that our troubles are not unknown to him;
yea, that the more he sees the wicked eagerly watching every opportunity to
accomplish our ruin, he would the more speedily come to our aid. This David
expresses by these various forms of expression<i>
&#8212;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Keep not silence, be
not far from me, stir up thyself, awake for my
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He might justly make use of
such expressions, seeing he was already fully persuaded that God regards the
poor and afflicted, and marks all the wrongs which are done to them. If,
therefore, we would frame our requests aright, a clear conviction and persuasion
of the providence of God must first shine into our hearts; nor is it necessary
only that this should precede, in point of order, all our desires; it must also
restrain and govern them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
35:24-28	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24. </b>Judge me, O Jehovah my

of his servant. <b>28.</b> And my tongue shall declare thy righteousness and thy
praise all the day.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judge me, O Jehovah my God!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">David here confirms the prayer of the preceding
verse that God would be his defender, and would maintain his righteous cause.
Having been for a time subjected to suffering as one who had been forsaken and
forgotten, he sets before himself <i>the righteousness of God, </i>which forbids
that he should altogether abandon the upright and the just. It is, therefore,
not simply a prayer, but a solemn appeal to God, that as he is righteous, he
would manifest his righteousness in defending his servant in a good cause. And
certainly, when we seem to be forsaken and deprived of all help, there is no
remedy which we can employ, more effectual to overcome temptation than this
consideration, that the righteousness of God, on which our deliverance depends,
can never fail. Accordingly, the Apostle Paul, in exhorting the faithful to
patience, says in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:6,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"It is a righteous thing
with God to recompense
tribulation</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to them that trouble
you."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now David again appeals to God in this place, and
entreats him to manifest his righteousness in restraining the insolence of his
enemies:for the more proudly they assail us, God is so much the more ready to
help us. Besides, by again introducing them as speaking, he portrays in a
graphic style the cruelty of their desires; and by this he means to show, that
if things should happen according to their wishes, they would set no limit to
their frowardness. But as the more they vaunt themselves, the more they provoke
the wrath of God against them, David with good reason uses this as an argument
to encourage his hope, and employs it for his support and confirmation in
prayer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let those who rejoice at thy
hurt be ashamed and confounded together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This imprecation has already been expounded; and it is only necessary to
remark, that there is peculiar force in the expression, <i>together, </i>or
<i>at once. </i>It shows that it was not only one or two, but a great multitude,
who waged war against him, and that he yielded not to the influence of fear, but
believed that as soon as God should lift up his hand, he could at one stroke
easily overthrow them all. When it is said that they seek after and <i>rejoice
in David's hurt, </i>this shows that they were filled with cruel hatred against
him. And when it is said, that they <i>magnify themselves against him, </i>this
is a token of pride. David, therefore, in order to render them more hateful in
the sight of God, represents them as filled with pride and cruelty. And as this
form of prayer was dictated by the Holy Spirit to David, there can be no doubt
that the end of all the proud shall be such as is here predicted, that they
shall turn back overwhelmed with shame and
disgrace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let those who favor my
righteous cause rejoice and be glad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>These two expressions, which are rendered in the optative mood, might have
been translated with equal propriety in the future tense; but as this is a
matter of little consequence, I leave it undecided. David here extols the
deliverance which he asks of God, and exults in the results which should flow
from it; namely, that it would be an occasion of general rejoicing and good hope
to all the godly, while at the same time it would stir them up to celebrate the
praises of God. He attributes to all the faithful the credit of desiring, that
as an innocent man his righteous cause should be maintained. David, it is true,
was the object of almost universal hatred among the simple and unsuspecting, who
were imposed upon by false and unjust reports made concerning him; but it is
certain that there were among the people some who formed a just and impartial
estimate of things, and who were sorely grieved that a holy man, and one too
whose benevolence was well known, should have been so unjustly and so wrongfully
oppressed. And surely the common feelings of humanity require, that when we see
men unjustly oppressed and afflicted, if we are not able to help them, we should
at least pity them. When David uses the language, <i>Jehovah be magnified,
</i>his design seems to be tacitly to set this in opposition to the pride of the
wicked, of which he made mention above. As they presume in the pride, of their
hearts, and by their insolent and overbearing conduct, to obscure, as far as in
them lies, the divine glory, so may the faithful, on the other hand, with good
reason present the prayer that God would shine forth in the majesty of his
character, and demonstrate in very deed that he exercises a special care over
all his servants, and takes a peculiar pleasure in their peace. Finally, the
Psalmist again declares, in the conclusion of the psalm, his resolution to
celebrate in appropriate praises the righteousness of God, by which he had been
preserved and delivered.</font><br><br></div>

From the variety of interpretations of the same passages which we meet with in
Calvin's Commentary, and of which we have still more numerous specimens in
Poole's Synopsis Criticorum, it is by no means to be supposed that the meaning
of the language of Scripture is vague, uncertain, and unsettled. Had the
professed interpreters of Scripture always performed their task with judgment,
as well as learning and talent, and been guided by the rules of sound
hermeneutics, the reader would not have been bewildered with so many different
and contradictory interpretations. Still, however, there are words and
sentences, the exact import of which is more or less doubtful and uncertain, so
that it is difficult to determine between different senses which have been put
upon them. The reasons of this are so well stated by Cresswell, in his preface
to The Book of Psalms with Notes, (pp. 14, 15, 16,) and the passage has so
direct a bearing on a number of the various interpretations, which Calvin deals
with in this Commentary, that we shall quote it entire though it is long. "The
Hebrew is not only a dead language, but the oldest of all dead languages; it is,
moreover, the language of a people that lived under institutions and in a
climate very different from those of our own country, so that the idioms with
which it abounds cannot but be strange to our habits of thinking and our modes
of speech; nor have we any book but the Bible itself to consult for an
illustration of these phraseological peculiarities. The paucity of the words
also contained in that ancient tongue is such, that the same Hebrew term very
often bears a great variety of significations, the connection of which with each
other cannot always be satisfactorily ascertained:and, again, there are words,
each of which is found but once in the whole volume of Scripture, so that their
meanings can only be conjectured, either from their affinity to other words, or
from the purport of the passage wherein they occur. "The following are amongst
the many grammatical Hebraisms which we meet with in The Book of Psalms. The
future and past tenses are put almost indiscriminately, the one for the other,
and the former of them is used occasionally to designate not that which will
happen, but that which is accustomed to happen. The infinitive is put for every
other mood, and also for nouns even in the accusative case. The future tense is
sometimes expressed by a verb in the imperative mood. Two substantives are put
instead of a substantive and an adjective; a substantive is frequently used
adverbially; and the same substantive repeated denotes multitude When the
negative particle occurs in the first member of a sentence, it is sometimes to
be understood, and must be supplied, in the following members. Hebrew sentences
are also in other respects very often elliptical, broken, and imperfect; and in
the same sentence there is in many instances a change of person in the speaker,
without any express intimation of it. "From the peculiarities above mentioned,
and especially from the different ways in which an ellipse may be supplied, it
is plain that the text of Scripture must needs admit of a considerable latitude
of interpretation; so that although none of its important doctrines whether they
relate to faith or morals, are thereby left doubtful, yet does it contain
passages the exact meanings of which are more or less uncertain. The candid and
pious reader, however, will with Augustine gladly acknowledge that all which he
fully comprehends in the sacred volume is most excellent; whilst he looks with
feelings of veneration upon that smaller portion of it which he less perfectly
understands, but which the diligence and erudition of future times may, through
divine aid, be enabled to
elucidate."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Parallelism is the distinguishing characteristic of Hebrew poetry, and an
attention to it, it must be admitted, affords much assistance in elucidating
obscure, and explaining difficult passages. Some modern translations of The
Psalms, as French and Skinner's, have the lines so arranged as to make the
parallelisms apparent to the eye; which enables the reader to discover at a
glance niceties both of structure and of meaning, which, in the ordinary mode of
printing, might pass unnoticed after frequent and even close perusal. For a full
investigation of this subject, the reader is referred to Dr Lowth's elegant
Lectures on Sacred Poetry, and his Preliminary Dissertation prefixed to his
translation of the prophet Isaiah, works which created a new era in sacred
literature, by the light which they cast on the character of Hebrew poetry, with
respect to which the learned world were<b> </b>previously unsettled and
perplexed, from the obscurity which rested on the subject. Bishop Jebb, in his
"Sacred Literature," has also investigated the parallelism of Hebrew poetry with
much ability, and successfully controverted some of Bishop Lowth's
positions.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
That Calvin held this doctrine is evident from his Commentary on Acts 13:33,
where, after stating that the words of the second Psalm, above quoted, refer to
the unequivocal evidence by which the Father proved that Christ was his Son in
raising him from the dead, he observes "This, however, is no objection to the
doctrine that Christ, the personal Word, was begotten by the eternal Father
before time; but that generation is an inscrutable mystery. With respect to
those who argue from this passage in support of that doctrine, he says, "I know
that Augustine, and the greatest number of commentators, are better pleased with
the subtile speculation that 'to-day ' denotes a continued or an eternal act.
But when the Spirit of God himself is his own interpreter, and explains by the
mouth of Paul what was spoken by David, we are not warranted to invent and put
upon the words any other meaning.

Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, was highly distinguished for his wlt,
valor, and Patriotism. In two several tournaments he was honored by receiving
the prize from the hand of his mistress, Queen Elizabeth, baring been led armed,
by two ladies, into the Royal Presence Chamber. Walpole notes that he was an
admired poet, and reckoned the best waiter of comedy in his time. He died at a
very advanced age, June 24, 1604. It is extremely probable that Arthur Golding,
the old Translator, was related, perhaps not distantly, to this nobleman. It
appeals from Dugdale, and other authorities, that John, 16th Earl of Oxford, his
father, married Margaret, daughter of John Golding, and sister of Sir Edward
Golding, for his second wife, by whom he had Earl Edward, after whom it is
likely he was named, and a

"representing God as a warrior equipped with sword and bow, has besides for its
foundation the coarseness of sinners, and the weakness of faith on the part of

Those who adopt this rendering, support it from the reading of the Septuagint,
Vulgate, and Syriac versions, although the Chaldee version reads <i>persecuting;

Fry, from a comparison of the Hebrew word which Calvin renders <i>hollowed it
out, </i>with the cognate Arabic words supposes that it means "dug it over, so
as to cover and hide it." The imagery is taken from the common method of
catching lions and other wild beasts in the east, by digging pits on the spots
which they were observed to frequent, and covering them slightly over with reeds
or small branches of trees. Luther's translation of this clause is precisely the
same with that of Calvin; and, in his Commentary on the place, he well explains
the force of the expressions of the Psalmist. "See," says he, "how admirably he
expresses the hot burning fury of the ungodly, not simply declaring, <i>he has
dug a pit, </i>but adding to this, <i>and hollowed it out. </i>So active and
diligent are they to have the pit dug and the hole prepared. They try every
thing, they explore every thing, and not satisfied that they have dug a pit,
they clear it out and make it deep, as deep as they possibly can, that they may
destroy and subvert the
innocent."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta0127</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

The doctrine proposed to be illustrated in this psalm is the excellence of God's
name, or his power, goodness, and other perfections, as manifested in his
providence and government of the world; and this the Psalmist states in the
first verse. He then proceeds to establish and illustrate this doctrine:1. From
the case of infants; 2. From the starry heavens; and, 3. From God's being
mindful of man, and visiting him, notwithstanding his unworthiness, sinfulness,

Certainly the fact that Paul uses the word <i>angels </i>instead of <i>God,
</i>does not prove the inaccuracy of Calvin's rendering. As the Septuagint
version was in general use among the Jews in the time of Paul, he very naturally
quotes from it just as we do from our English version. And this was sufficient
for his purpose. His object was, to answer an objection which the Jews brought
against the Christian dispensation, as being inferior to the Mosaic, inasmuch as
angels were mediators of the latter, while the mediator or head of the former
was in their estimation but a man. This objection he answers from their own
Scriptures, and quotes this psalm to show, that Christ, in his human nature, was
little inferior to the angels, and that he is exalted far above them in respect
of the glory and dominion with which he is crowned. If the apostle had quoted
from the Hebrew Scriptures, and used
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Elohim, </i>God, meaning the Most High, his argument in support of the

"In the 12th verse," says Horsley, "the Psalmist having mentioned it as a part
of the divine character, that God forgetteth not the cry of the helpless,
naturally thinks upon his own helpless state, and in the 13th and 14th verses
cries for deliverance. The promise of the overthrow of the faction, which were
the principal instruments of his affliction, recurring to his thoughts, he
breaks out again in the 15th verse in strains of exultation." The transition
from the language of triumph, in the preceding part of the psalm, to the
language of prayer and complaint in the 13th verse, and the mixture of triumph
and complaint in the sequel of the psalm, are very remarkable. This was the
natural effect of the Psalmist's present distressed condition. The pressure of
his affliction excited him, on the one hand, to utter the language of dejection;
while his confident expectation of deliverance prompted him, on the other hand,
to utter the language of
triumph.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta164</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

The Chaldee version reads <i>fear, </i>but the Syriac, Ethiopic, and Vulgate
versions follow the Septuagint. The Arabic employs a word of nearly the same
import, signifying <i>a doctor or teacher of the law. </i>In it is , "O Lord set
a schoolmaster over them." Auguatine and Jerome, who adopted the reading of the
Septuagint, render the words, "Set, O Lord, a lawgiver over them;" and it was
their opinion that <i>lawgiver </i>means antichrist, to whom God in his wrath
gave dominion over the nations. According to others, lawgiver means Christ. Dr
Horsley reads, "O Jehovah, appoint thou a teacher over them." Ainsworth and Dr
Adam Clarke adopt the same rendering, and view the words as a prayer that the

Horsley reads "subtleties," and observes in a note, "I choose this ambiguous
word; being in doubt whether the petition against the wicked be that they may be
ruined by their own stratagems against the righteous, or that they may be the
dupes of their own atheistical speculations upon moral and religious subjects.

may signify either 'crafty tricks,' or 'refined theories,' and, in this latter

general description of the oppression of the righteous by apostate spirits,
atheists, and idolaters, who have all conspired against them, and not as
referring to any particular calamity of the Jewish nation, or of any

Calvin's meaning is, that according. to the Hebrew letters, the verb is in the
plural number; but according to the Hebrew punctuation, which regulates the
reading, it is in the singular. Piscator, in his commentary on this passage,
observes,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wdwn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nudi, </i>according to the points, is singular and feminine, and refers to
the soul of David; according to the letters it is plural,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wdwn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nudu, </i>and refers to David and his associates. This last reading appears
to me the most appropriate, both because it is followed by the relative in the
plural number, and because it does not seem to be a proper or natural mode of
expression, to speak of persons addressing the soul of another" The phrase,
<i>to my soul, </i>however, may simply mean <i>to me, </i>a sense in which it is
frequently used in
Scripture.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta224</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

It is the general opinion that this psalm was composed during the alarm and
danger which were occasioned by Absalom's rebellion, and that this is a
prediction of the failure of the conspiracy. But Calmet and Mudge refer the
psalm to the captivity in Babylon, and the latter supposes that in this and the
preceding verse there is an allusion to the great terror into which the heathen
were thrown, in the midst of their impious carousals; which some refer to the
scene which took place at Belshazzar's feast, when the hand was seen writing on
the wall. There is, however, great uncertainty as to the occasions on which most
of the psalms were composed; and those who have examined the different opinions

Though punishment had not as yet been actually inflicted on the oppressors of

this, "That a scene typical of futurity is presented to the prophet's

The Jews were prohibited by the law from taking usury or interest on money lent

other countries, (Deuteronomy. 23:20.) The manifest design of this prohibition
was, to promote humane and fraternal sentiments in the bosoms of the Israelites
towards each other. A more remote end seems also to have been aimed at, viz., to
check the formation of a commercial character among the Jews, and to confine
them as much as possible to those agricultural and private pursuits, which would
seclude them from intercourse with the surrounding nations, as it was not very

"My reins" is the literal rendering of the Hebrew text, and they denote the
working of the thoughts and affections of the soul. "Common experience," says
Parkhurst, "shows that the workings of the mind, particularly the passions of
joy, grief, and fear, have a very, remarkable effect on the <i>reins </i>or
<i>kidneys, </i>so, from their retired situation in the body, and their being
<i>hid </i>in fat, they are often used in Scripture to denote the most <i>secret
working </i>of the soul and affections" "The reins or kidneys," says Walford, in
a note on this passage, "are used to signify the interior faculties; and the
divine speaker observes, that in seasons of solitude, his thoughts were
instinctively employed in contemplating the heavenly discoveries that were
communicated to him." In Tyndale's Bible the reading of the last clause is, "My
reins also have <i>chastened me </i>in the night season." And Fry observes, that

"</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">glwssa

meaning. David uses the word <i>glory </i>for the organ by which God is
glorified or praised. The Apostle Peter, in quoting this passage,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

"The Hebrew word <i>shachath," </i>says Poole, "though sometimes, by a metonymy,
it signifies the pit or place of corruption, yet properly and generally it
signifies corruption or perdition. And so it must be understood here, although
some of the Jews, to avoid the force of this argument, render it the pit. But in
that sense it is not true, for whether it be meant of David, as they say, or of
Christ, it is confessed that both of them did see the pit, that is, were laid in
the grave." Hence he concludes that <i>corruption </i>is the proper rendering of
the original word. The phrase, however, <i>to see the pit, </i>may not mean to
be laid in the grave, but to continue in it for any length of time. The meaning
which Calvin attaches to the word <i>pit</i> is<i> </i>substantially that which
our English translators attached to the original word which they render
<i>corruption. </i>Hengstenberg adopts and defends Calvin's

aspiring to the kingdom, and seeking the life of Saul,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;092409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

Great difference of opinion has prevailed among critics, as to the rendering and
interpretation of this and the following verse. The third verse is rendered thus
in Tyndale's Bible:"Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night
seasons, thou hast tried me in the fire, and hast found no wickedness in me; for
I utterly purposed that my mouth should not offend." Geddes reads the third
clause of the verse "Thou hast smelted me, and found in me no dross;" and
observes, that <i>smelted </i>is "a metaphor taken from the smelting of metals
to purify them from extraneous <i>matter." &#8212; Geddes' New Translation of
the Book of Psalms, with Notes. </i>The last clause of the third verse is added
to the first clause of the fourth verse, in the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and
Arabic versions, and the reading is thus "My mouth has not transgressed as to
the evil designs of other men; that is, I have not countenanced or approved of
them by
word."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta329</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

The word in the Hebrew text

the word not as denoting that God is worthy to be praised, which is the meaning
attached to it in our English version, but as referring to the Psalmist's
resolution to praise God. The Septuagint reads,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ainwn epikalesomai
Kurion</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>Kytov, </i>"Praising I will call upon the

Here, where it is joined with encompassing, it is most fitly to be understood in
the former sense, because ropes or cords are proper for that turn, as for
holding and keeping in when they are inclosed." The Chaldee understands the word
in the other sense, and paraphrases the clause thus:"Distress hath compassed me
as a woman in travail which hath not strength to bring forth, and is in danger
of death," The Septuagint adopts the same view, reading,

Cocceius renders the words, "the waves of death," and he observes, that the
words "waves'" explains the verb "compassed me about." Death sent its sorrows

such violence that he was ready to be overwhelmed. The word

into the most efficient swords." Horsley reads, "Thou hast made my arms like a
brazen bow." This is also the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Jerome, and
all the versions. But the reading of Calvin, which is that of our English
version, seems preferable, and is more expressive. To bend a strong bow was
anciently considered a proof of great strength, much more to compress it so as
to break it. To bend a bow of <i>brass </i>is still more expressive, and still

this clause as a complete sentence by itself. He explains it thus:&#8212; "In
situations of power and strength, whatever a man's natural means of deliverance

French and Skinner's translation of these words is the same, and so also is that
of Rogers. This last author observes, "The common interpretation, <i>Thou shalt

(Rogers'<i> </i>Book of Psalms, in Hebrew, metrically arranged, vol. 2:p. 178.)
Poole takes the same view. Calvin, however, in his French version, gives a
translation much the same as that of our English version:"Tu les rendras comme
une fournaise de feu en temps de ta cholere." "Thou shalt make them like a
furnace of fire, in the time of thy anger." This is exactly the rendering of
Horsley, in which he is followed by Walford. "It describes," says the learned
prelate, "the smoke of the Messiah's enemies perishing by fire, ascending like
the smoke of a furnace. 'The smoke of their torment shall ascend for ever and
ever.'" "How awfully grand," says Bishop Mant, "is that description of the ruins
of the cities of the plain, as the prospect struck on Abraham's eye on the fatal
morning of their destruction:'And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and
toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo! the smoke of the country

This word has created much discussion. In the Hebrew Bible, the <i>kethib </i>or

reading of the Hebrew text was

<i>caaru. </i>The Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic, give a similar

<i>caari, as a lion, </i>renders the passage unintelligible. The Chaldee version

alteration; as otherwise, we have an incongruous mixture of physical and moral

Mudge conjectures that the expression, <i>encompass, </i>is probably taken from
the custom of forming a ring round the altar at the time of worship. And Goodwyn

encompassed the altar seven times, carrying branches of palm trees in their
hands in remembrance of the overthrow of Jericho, and singing hosannas.
&#8212;<i> Moses and Aaron, </i>p. 132. David, however, may refer to the
practice of the priests, who, when they offered sacrifices, went round about the
altar; and his meaning may simply be, that as the priests first washed their
hands, and then performed their sacred office at the altar; so he deeply felt
the necessity of personal purity, in order to his engaging in the service of

thee, Seek ye my face," he means that his heart reminded God of his command or

In the Hebrew this verse is elliptical, as Calvin here translates it. In the
French version he supplies the ellipsis, by adding to the end of the verse the
words, "C'estoit fait de moy," "I had perished." In our English version, the
words, "I had fainted," are introduced as a supplement, in the beginning of the
verse. Both the supplement of Calvin, and that of our English version, which are
substantially the same, doubtless explain the meaning of the passage; but they
destroy the elegant abrupt form of the expression employed by the Psalmist, who
breaks off in the middle of his discourse without completing the sentence,
although what he meant to say is very evident. "Unless I had believed to see the
goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, What! what, alas! should have

Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopic, exactly follow them. Jerome also reads, "Afferte
Domino filios arietum;" although he does not give a double translation of the
original words. But the correct rendering, we have no doubt, is, "Ye sons of the
mighty;" which is just a Hebrew idiomatic expression for "Ye mighty ones," or,
"Ye princes;" and to them the inspired writer addresses an invitation to
acknowledge and worship God from the manifestation of his majesty and power in

Bishop Lowth reads, "Maketh the oaks to tremble," (Lectures on Hebrew Poetry,
vol. 2:p.253,) in which he is followed by Dimock, Green, Seeker, Horsley, Fry,
and others. But Dathe, Berlin, De Rossi, Dr Adam Clarke, Rogers, etc., adhere to
the common interpretation, in which they are supported by all the ancient
versions, except the Syriac, which seems to favor the view of Lowth. A main
argument of Lowth and those who follow him in support of his rendering is, that
the common translation, which supposes the passage to relate to <i>the hinds
bring forth their young, </i>agrees very little with the rest of the imagery
either in nature or dignity; whereas the oak struck with lightning, is a far
nobler image, and one which falls in more naturally with the scattering of a
forest's foliage under the action of a storm. But Rogers justly observes, that
"we are not warranted in altering the Hebrew text, because the oriental imagery
which we meet with does not correspond with our ideas of poetical beauty and
grandeur," (Book of Psalms in Hebrew, metrically arranged, vol. it. p. 186.)
With respect to the sense conveyed by the common reading, it may be observed,
that birds bring forth their young with great difficulty and pain, bowing
themselves, bruising their young ones, and casting out their sorrows,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;183904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
39:4, 6;) and it therefore heightens the description given of the terrific
character of the thunder-storm, when the thunder, which is here called the voice
of God, is represented as causing, through the terror which it inspires, the
hinds in their pregnant state prematurely to drop their young; although,
according to our ideas of poetical imagery, this may not accord so well with the
other images in the passage nor appear so beautiful and sublime as the image of
the oaks trembling at the voice of
Jehovah.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta580</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Dr Geddes observes, that this is the literal translation of the Hebrew words;
"but," says he, "as negative propositions in Hebrew are often equivalent in
sense to opposite positives, I deemed it better to use an equivalent as more

Hammond considers "vanities" as referring to the practice of superstitiously
having recourse to auguries and divinations for advice and direction, a practice
which prevailed among the heathen, when they met with any difficulty or danger.
To the responses of augury, they showed the greatest regard; although they were
deceived and disappointed in the confidence which they reposed in them. David
declares that he detested all such practices, and trusted for aid to God alone.
French and Skinner, by <i>lying vanities, </i>understand <i>idols. </i>"Idols,"
says Walford, "are often thus denominated; though the term is not to be confined
to this sense, as all the pursuits of iniquity may be justly comprehended under
it. - Vide

in the Hiphil conjugation, signifies <i>to ponder, to consider, to be deep in
thought." </i>But according to the translation and exposition of Calvin, there
is no inconsistency between the first and the second clause of the verse. To
avoid the apparent contradiction of being at once <i>silent </i>and yet
<i>roaring </i>all the day long, Dr Boothroyd, instead of <i>roaring, </i>reads

This verse in the Hebrew is very elliptical and obscure. Hence, besides the
translation of Calvin, which agrees very well with the scope of the passage,
various other translations have been given of it. In our English Bible, the last
clause is rendered, "lest they come near unto thee," that is, to attack thee.
But this is evidently an incorrect translation. This is not the common practice
of these animals, which are timid, and not ferocious; bits and bridles are not
used for the purpose of keeping them away from us, but of subduing, guiding, and
making them subservient to our will; and were this the sense, the figure would
be inappropriate, since the object of the Psalmist is to induce men to approach
God. The clause, therefore, is rendered by many critics, "Or they will not come
nigh unto thee;" that is, they will flee from thee. The Hebrew for this last
phrase is, "There is not a coming to
thee."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta632</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Most commentators consider Jehovah as the person speaking in this verse. Calvin,
however, views David as the speaker. In this opinion he is followed by Walford.
"In
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:13," says this critic, "written about the same time and on the same occasion,
David urges as a reason why God should restore to him the joy of his salvation,
that he might be enabled to teach transgressors his ways, and that sinners might
be converted to him. So in the passage before us, he addresses himself to
sinners, and says, 'I will instruct time, and teach thee the way in which thou
shalt
go.'"</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta633</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

into one place, and let the dry land appear:and it was so." The Psalmist here
probably has a reference to that passage, as in the 9th verse there is evidently
an imitation of the style in which God is described in the first chapter of
Genesis as performing the work of
creation.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta641</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Those who take this view explain the words as meaning that the humble or
afflicted, upon looking to David, saw how graciously God had dealt with him, and
were enlightened, revived, and encouraged. They also consider, as Calvin himself
does, the humble or afflicted as the persons who speak in the sixth verse,
where, pointing as it were with the finger to David, they say, "This poor man
cried,"
etc.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fta656</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is the rendering adopted by Horsley, who understands by the expression the
illumination of the soul by the light of Divine truth. He reads the verb in the
imperative mood, and his translation of the entire verse is as follows:"Look
towards him, and thou shalt be enlightened; And your faces shall never be
ashamed." This reading is sanctioned by the Septuagint. It supposes two
alterations on the text. First, that instead of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wfybh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
they looked, </i>we should read
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wfybh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>habitu, look ye; </i>and this last reading is supported by several of Dr
Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. The other alteration is, that instead of

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;kynpw</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
