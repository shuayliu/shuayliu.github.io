ignorant that the Tables of the Law are usually divided in a different
manner;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for those, who make only one of the first
two Commandments, are obliged finally to mangle the last. Thus the prohibition
of God to covet either our neighbor's wife or his house, is foolishly separated
into two parts, whereas it is quite clear that only one thing is treated of, as
we gather from the words of Paul, who quotes them as a single Commandment.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:7.) There is, however, no need of a lengthened discussion here, since the fact
itself explains how one error has grown out of another; for, when they had
improperly hidden the Second Commandment under the First, and consequently did
not find the right number, they were forced to divide into two parts what was
one and indivisible. A frivolous reason is assigned by Augustine why they
comprised the First Table in three commandments, viz., that believers might
learn to worship God in the Trinity, and thus to adore one God in three persons.
By inconsiderately trifling with such subtleties, they have exposed God's law to
the mockeries of the ungodly.
Josephus</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> indeed rightly enumerates the Commandments
themselves in their proper order, but improperly attributes five Commandments to
each Table; as if God had had regard to arithmetic rather than to instruct His
people separately in the duties of charity, after having laid down for them the
rules of piety. For up to this point the rule of rightly serving God has been
delivered, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,<i> </i>the First Table embraces a summary of
piety; and now the Law will begin to show how men ought to live with each other,
otherwise one Table would have been enough, nor would God have divided his Law
without a purpose. But whereas
piety</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and justice comprise the perfect rule for
the direction of our lives, it was necessary to distinguish these two parts,
that the people might understand the object of the Law, of which we shall again
speak hereafter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Exodus 20:12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Honor thy
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Although charity (as being "the
bond of perfectness,"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:14) contains the sum of the Second Table, still, mutual obligation does not
prevent either parents or others, who are in authority, from retaining their
proper position. Nay, human society cannot be maintained in its integrity,
unless children modestly submit themselves to their parents, and unless those,
who are set over others by God's ordinance, are even reverently honored. But
inasmuch as the reverence which children pay to their parents is accounted a
sort of piety, some have therefore foolishly placed this precept in the First
Table. Nor are they supported in this by Paul, though he does not enumerate this
Commandment, where he collects the sum of the Second Table,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:9;) for he does this designedly, because he is there expressly teaching that
obedience is to be paid to the authority of kings and magistrates. Christ,
however, puts an end to the whole controversy, where, among the precepts of the
Second Table, He enumerates this, that children should honor their parents.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:19.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The name of the mothers is expressly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>introduced</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>lest their sex should render them contemptible to their male
children.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be now well to ascertain what
is the force of the word "honor," not as to its grammatical meaning, (for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dbk</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
cabad</i>,<i> </i>is nothing else but to pay due honor to God, and to men who
are in authority,) but as to its essential signification. Surely, since God
would not have His servants comply with external ceremonies only, it cannot be
doubted but that all the duties of piety towards parents are here comprised, to
which children are laid under obligation by natural reason itself; and these may
be reduced to three heads, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,<i> </i>that they should regard
them with reverence; that they should obediently comply with their commands, and
allow themselves to be governed by them; and that they should endeavor to repay
what they owe to them, and thus heartily devote to them themselves and their
services. Since, therefore, the name of Father is a sacred one, and is
transferred to men by the peculiar goodness of God, the dishonoring of parents
redounds to the dishonor of God Himself, nor can any one despise his father
without being guilty of an offense against God, (<i>sacrilegium</i>.)<i> </i>If
any should object that there are many ungodly and wicked fathers whom their
children cannot regard with honor without destroying the distinction between
good and evil, the reply is easy, that the perpetual law of nature is not
subverted by the sins of men; and therefore, however unworthy of honor a father
may be, that he still retains, inasmuch as he is a father, his right over his
children, provided it does not in anywise derogate from the judgment of God; for
it is too absurd to think of absolving under any pretext the sins which are
condemned by His Law; nay, it would be a base profanation to misuse the name of
father for the covering of sins. In condemning, therefore, the vices of a
father, a truly pious son will subscribe to God's Law; and still, whatsoever he
may be, will acknowledge that he is to be honored, as being the father given him
by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Obedience
</i></font><font face="Palatino">comes next, which is also circumscribed by
certain limits. Paul is a faithful interpreter of this Commandment, where he
bids "children obey their parents."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:20.) Honor, therefore, comprises subjection; so that he who shakes off the
yoke of his father, and does not allow himself to be governed by his authority,
is justly said to despise his father; and it will more clearly appear from other
passages, that those who are not obedient to their parents are deemed to despise
them. Still, the power of a father is so limited as that God, on whom all
relationships depend, should have the rule over fathers as well as children; for
parents govern their children only under the supreme authority of God. Paul,
therefore, does not simply exhort children to obey their parents, but adds the
restriction, "in the Lord;" whereby he indicates that, if a father enjoins
anything unrighteous, obedience is freely to be denied him. Immoderate
strictness, moroseness, and even cruelty must be born, so long as a mortal man,
by wickedly demanding what is not lawful, does not endeavor to rob God of His
right. In a word, the Law so subjects children to their parents, as that God's
right may remain uninfringed. An objection here arises in the shape of this
question: It may sometimes happen that a son may hold the office of a
magistrate, but that the father may be a private person, and that thus the son
cannot discharge his private duty without violating public order. The point is
easily solved: that all things may be so tempered by their mutual moderation as
that, whilst the father submits himself to the government of his
son,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet he may not be at all defrauded of his
honor, and that the son, although his superior in power, may still modestly
reverence his father.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The third head of honor
is, that children should take care of their parents, and be ready and diligent
in all their duties towards them. This kind of piety the Greeks call
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajntipelargi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because storks supply food to their
parents when they are feeble and worn out with old age, and are thus our
instructors in gratitude. Hence the barbarity of those is all the more base and
detestable, who either grudge or neglect to relieve the poverty of their
parents, and to aid their necessities.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now,
although the parental name ought, by its own sweetness, sufficiently to attract
children to ready submission, still a promise is added as a stimulus, in order
that they may more cheerfully bestir themselves to pay the honor which is
enjoined upon them. Paul, therefore, that children may be more willing to obey
their parents, reminds us that this "is the first commandment with promise,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:2;) for although a promise is annexed to the Second Commandment, yet it is not
a special one, as we perceive this to be. The reward, that the days of children
who have behaved themselves piously to their parents shall be prolonged, aptly
corresponds with the observance of the commandment, since in this manner God
gives us a proof of His favor in this life, when we have been grateful to those
to whom we are indebted for it; whilst it is by no means just that they should
greatly prolong their life who despise those progenitors by whom they have been
brought into it. Here the question arises, since this earthly life is exposed to
so many cares, and pains, and troubles, how can God account its prolongation to
be a blessing? But whereas all cares spring from the curse of God, it is
manifest that they are accidental; and thus, if life be regarded in itself, it
does not cease to be a proof of God's favor. Besides, all this multitude of
miseries does not destroy the chief blessing of life, viz., that men are created
and preserved unto the hope of a happy immortality; for God now manifests
Himself to them as a Father, that hereafter they may enjoy His eternal
inheritance. The knowledge of this, like a lighted lamp, causes God's grace to
shine forth in the midst of darkness. Whence it follows, that those had not
tasted the main thing in
life,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who have said that the best thing was not
to be born, and the next best thing to be cut off as soon as possible; whereas
God rather so exercises men by various afflictions, as that it should be good
for them nevertheless to be created in His image, and to be accounted His
children. A clearer explanation also is added in Deuteronomy, not only that they
should live, but that it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>may</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>well</i></font><font face="Palatino">
with them; so that not only is length of life promised them, but other
accessories also. And in fact, many who have been ungrateful and unkind to their
parents only prolong their life as a punishment, whilst the reward of their
inhuman conduct is repaid them by their children and descendants. But inasmuch
as long life is not vouchsafed to all who have discharged the duties of piety
towards their parents, it must be remembered that, with respect to temporal
rewards, an infallible law is by no means laid down; and still, where God works
variously and unequally, His promises are not made void,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a</i></font><font face="Palatino">
better compensation is secured in heaven for believers, who have been deprived
on earth of transitory blessings. Truly experience in all ages has shown that
God has not in vain promised long life to all who have faithfully discharged the
duties of true piety towards their parents. Still, from the principle already
stated, it is to be understood that this Commandment extends further than the
words imply; and this we infer from the following sound argument, viz., that
otherwise God's Law would be imperfect, and would not instruct us in the perfect
rule of a just and holy life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The natural sense
itself dictates to us that we should obey rulers. If servants obey not their
masters, the society of the human race is subverted altogether. It is not,
therefore, the least essential part of
righteousness</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f7
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that the people should willingly submit
themselves to the command of magistrates, and that servants should obey their
masters; and, consequently, it would be very absurd if it were omitted in the
Law of God. In this commandment, then, as in the others, God by
<i>synecdoche</i> embraces, under a specific rule, a general principle, viz.,
that lawful commands should obtain due reverence from us. But that all things
should not be distinctly expressed, first of all brevity itself readily accounts
for; and, besides, another reason is to be noticed, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. that God
designedly used a homely style in addressing a rude people, because He saw its
expediency. If He had said generally, that all superiors were to be obeyed,
since, pride is natural to all, it would not have been easy to incline the
greater part of men to pay submission to a few. Nay, since subjection is
naturally disagreeable, many would have kicked against it. God, therefore,
propounds a specific kind of subjection, which it would have been gross
barbarism to refuse, that thus, their ferocity being gradually subdued, He might
accustom men to bear the yoke. Hence the exhortations are derived, that people
should "honor the king;" that "every soul should be subject unto the higher
powers;" that "servants should obey their masters, even the froward and morose."

relates to the explanation of the Fifth Commandment, it confirms what I have
before shown, that the honor which God-commands to be paid to parents, does not
consist in reverence only, but also embraces obedience. For the reverence which
He now prescribes will render children submissive and compliant. Now, then, we
more clearly understand how parents are to be honored, when God exhorts their
children to beware of offending them; for this is, in a word, the true
manifestation of filial piety, calmly to bear the yoke of subjection, and to
prove by acts a sincere desire to obey.</font><br></div>

violation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet</i></font><font face="Palatino">
not so as to comprehend all who have in any respect sinned against their
parents, but sufficient to show that the rights of parents are sacred, and not
to be violated without the greatest criminality. We know that
parricides</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as being the most detestable of all men,
were formerly sewn up in a leathern sack and east into the water; but God
proceeds further, when He commands all those to be exterminated who have laid
violent hands on their
parents</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or addressed them in abusive language. For
to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smite</i></font><font face="Palatino">
does not only mean to kill, but refers to any violence, although no wound may
have been inflicted. If, then, any one had struck his father or mother with his
fist, or with a stick, the punishment of such an act of madness was the same as
for murder. And, assuredly, it is an abominable and monstrous thing for a son
not to hesitate to assault those from whom he has received his life; nor can it
be but that impunity accorded to so foul a crime must straightway produce cruel
barbarism. The second law avenges not only violence done to parents, but also,
abusive words, which soon proceed to grosser insults and atrocious contempt.
Still, if any one should have lightly let drop some slight reproach, as is often
the case ill a quarrel, this severe punishment was not to be inflicted upon
such, all inconsiderate piece of impertinence: and the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kalal</i>, from which the participle used by Moses is derived, not only means
to reproach, but also to curse, as well as to esteem lightly, and to despise.
Whilst, therefore, not every insult, whereby the reverence due to parents was
violated, received the punishment of death, still God would have that impious
pride, which would subvert the first principles of nature, held in abhorrence.
But, inasmuch as it might seem hard that a
word,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> however unworthy of a dutiful son, should
be the cause of death; this objection is met, by what is added by God in
Leviticus, "his blood shall be upon him,

What God had previously adverted to in two clauses, tie now embraces in a
general law, for it cannot be doubted but that by rebellious children all are
designated who are abusive or insulting to their father and mother. For if it be
a capital crime to be disobedient to parents, much more is it to strike, or beat
them, and to assail them with reproachful words. In sum, Moses declares that
those are deserving of death who are of such a stubborn and intractable
disposition as to reject the authority of their father and mother, and to hold
them in contempt. Whence also we infer what it is to honor our father and
mother, for the punishment is only denounced for the transgression of the
Commandment. When, therefore, the law delivers over to death all who
contumaciously rebel against the discipline of their parents, it follows that
they have refused them their due honor. An admirable means, however, of
moderating the severity of the law is introduced, when God requires the case to
be decided on the evidence of the father and mother; and commands that it should
be publicly heard, so that none may be condemned at the will of private
individuals. By the Roman law the power of life and death over his
children</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was given to the father, because it was
not probable that fathers would be carried away by such senseless inhumanity as
to deal cruelly with their own bowels; but, since sometimes fathers are found
who are not unlike wild beasts, and examples show us that many, blinded by hate
or avarice, have not spared their own children, this concession of the Roman law
is justly to be repudiated. I allow, indeed, that those who desired to inflict
punishment on their children called their friends into council; but, whereas,
the walls of a private dwelling conceal many disgraceful things, God imposed a
much better restraint on parents when He did not suffer them to go further than
to lay the information and to give their testimony. For, although he would have
credit given to their testimony, still, when the children were brought to the
tribunal of the judges, a legal trim undoubtedly ensued; and this form of
proceeding is prescribed, viz., that the father and mother should bring their
son and make their complaint before the judges of his incorrigible stubbornness.
It is true that the sentence is immediately subjoined; yet we must infer,
nevertheless, that the judges pronounced it before the criminal was stoned, else
it would have been ridiculous that they should sit there like cyphers. The very
mention of a trial, therefore, implies that the son was heard in his defense, so
as to clear himself of the crime, if he was not guilty of it: for, suppose the
moroseness of the father and mother were notorious; or that the father accused
the son by the instigation of a stepmother; or that any unworthy spite were
discovered; or that the father and mother had conspired to destroy their son in
a fit of passion: the defense of the cause is, therefore, implied in the adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then</i></font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for it would have been more than absurd
that the son should be condemned without being heard. Especially, when he was to
be stoned by the whole people, it was necessary that he should be first
convicted; and on this ground he was brought forth publicly, that he might be
allowed to plead his cause. But although those were condemned who were addicted
to other vices also, yet Moses expressly mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gluttons</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drunkards</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to</i></font><font face="Palatino">
show that, although no capital crime were alleged, still, dissolute profligacy
was sufficient, if the son could not be corrected by his parents; for it is
plain that those are in a desperate state who have so east away submissiveness
and shame as to receive no profit from the admonitions of their parents. From
the end of the verse we gather what was the twofold object of the punishment
&#8212; that the earth should be purged of the sins whereby it was in a manner,
polluted, and that the death of him who had transgressed might be an example to
all.</font><br></div>

These four passages confirm what I have said, that in the: Fifth Commandment are
comprised, by <i>synecdoche</i> all superiors in authority.: For it was not the
design of God to add to the Two Tables, as if something better and more perfect
had afterwards come into His mind; which it is sinful to suppose. He was
therefore content with the rule once laid down, although He afterwards spoke in
a more explanatory manner. But the precepts here given would be unconnected with
the Law, if they were not an adjunct, and therefore a part, of the Fifth
Commandment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First of all, He commands that we
should think and speak reverently of judges, and others, who exercise the office
of magistrate: nor is it to be questioned, that, in the ordinary idiom of the
Hebrew language, He repeats the same thing twice over; and consequently that the
same persons are called "gods," and "rulers of the people." The name of God is,
figuratively indeed, but most reasonably, applied to magistrates, upon whom, as
the ministers of His authority, He has inscribed a mark of His glory. For, as we
have seen that honor is due to fathers, because God has associated them with
Himself in the possession of the name, so also here His own dignity is claimed
for judges, in order that the people may reverence them, because they are God's
representatives, as His lieutenants, and vicars. And so Christ, the surest
expositor, explains it, when He quotes the passage from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
82:6, "I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431034&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:34,) viz., "that they are called gods, unto whom the word of God came," which
is to be understood not of the general instruction addressed to all God's
children, but of the special command to rule.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
is a signal exaltation of magistrates, that God should not only count them in
the place of parents, but present them to us dignified by His own name; whence
also it clearly appears that they are not to be obeyed only from fear of
punishment, "but also for conscience sake,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:5,) and to be reverently honored, lest God should be despised in them. If any
should object, that it would be wrong to praise the vices of those whom we
perceive to abuse their power; the answer is easy, that although judges are to
be borne with even if they be not the
best,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> still that the honor with which they are
invested, is not a covering for <i>vice</i>. Nor does God command us to applaud
their faults, but that the people should rather deplore them in silent sorrow,
than raise disturbances in a licentious and seditious spirit, and so subvert
political government.</font><br></div>

God teaches us that some sparks of His majesty shine forth in old men, whereby
they approach to the honor of parents. It is not my purpose to gather quotations
from profane authors in reference to the honor due to the old; let it
<i>suffice</i> that what God here commands is dictated by nature itself. This
appeared at Athens,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when an old man had come into the
theater, and found no place among his fellow-citizens; but, when at length he
was admitted with honor by the Spartan ambassador, (because old age is greatly
reverenced among the Lacedemonians,) applause was raised on all sides; and then
the Lacedemonian exclaimed, that "the Athenians knew what was right, but would
not do it." It was surely manifested by this universal consent of the people
that it is a natural law in the hearts of all to reverence and honor old men.
Many old men, indeed, either by their levity, or lewdness, or sloth, subvert
their own dignity; yet, although gray hairs may not always be accompanied by
courteous wisdom, still, in itself, age is venerable, according to God's
command.</font><br></div>

I have placed this passage among the Supplements of the Fifth Commandment, for,
if it pleases God that judges should be appointed for ruling the people, it
follows that their laws and edicts should be obeyed; and thus the parental
authority extends also to them. But, in order that the people may more readily
submit themselves to judges, God reminds them that the human race could not
otherwise be preserved. Public utility, therefore, renders the authority of
magistrates pleasant and agreeable, though it would else be hateful. But,
although it be not conceded to all to elect their judges, because God honored
His chosen people with this prerogative, still he here recommends in general a
regular government, since He signifies that human society cannot hold together
unless the lawful rulers have authority to execute justice. Whether, then,
magistrates are appointed by the suffrages of the people, or imposed in any
other way, let us learn that they are the necessary ministers of God, to confine
all men under the yoke of the laws. The latter passage, which I have annexed
from Deuteronomy 7, refers to the same thing, viz., that even in war discipline
is necessary, lest all things should be thrown into confusion. Now, if it
pleases God that certain superior officers should have the command, it follows
that they must be obeyed; for it would be ridiculous to appoint governors, if it
were lawful to despise them with impunity. When, therefore, God sets military
commanders over the people, He enforces the duty of humble
submission.</font><br></div>

this Commandment is, that we should not unjustly do violence to any one. In
order, however, that God may the better restrain us from all injury of others,
He propounds one particular form of it, from which men's natural sense is
abhorrent; for we all detest murder, so as to recoil from those whose hands are
polluted with blood, as if they carried contagion with them. Undoubtedly God
would have the remains of His image, which still shine forth in men, to continue
in some estimation, so that all might feel that every homicide is an offense
against Him, (<i>sacrilegium</i>.) He does not, indeed, here express the reason,
whereby He elsewhere deters men from murder, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., by asserting
that thus His image is violated,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
9:6;) yet, however precisely and authoritatively He may speak as a Legislator,
He would still have us consider, what might naturally occur to everybody's mind,
such as the statement of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:7, that man is our "own flesh." In order, then, that believers may more
diligently beware of inflicting injuries, He condemns a crime, which all
spontaneously confess to be insufferable. It will, however, more clearly appear
hereafter, that under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kill</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is included by <i>synecdoche</i> all violence, smiting, and aggression. Besides,
another principle is also to be remembered, that in negative precepts, as they
are called, the opposite affirmation is also to be understood; else it would not
be by any means consistent, that a person would satisfy God's Law by merely
abstaining from doing injury to others. Suppose, for example, that one of a
cowardly disposition, and not daring to assail even a child, should not move a
finger to injure his neighbors, would he therefore have discharged the duties of
humanity as regards the Sixth Commandment? Nay, natural common sense demands
more than that we should abstain from wrongdoing. And, not to say more on this
point, it will plainly appear from the summary of the Second Table, that God not
only forbids us to be murderers, but also prescribes that every one should study
faithfully to defend the life of his neighbor, and practically to declare that
it is dear to him; for in that summary no mere negative phrase is used, but the
words expressly set forth that our neighbors are to be loved. It is
unquestionable, then, that of those whom God there commands to be loved, He here
commends the lives to our care. There are, consequently, two parts in the
Commandment, &#8212; <i>first</i>, that we should not vex, or oppress, or be at
enmity with any; and, <i>secondly</i>, that we should not only live at peace
with men, without exciting quarrels, but also should aid, as far as we can, the
miserable who are unjustly oppressed, and should endeavor to resist the wicked,
lest they should injure men as they list. Christ, therefore, in expounding the
genuine sense of the Law, not only pronounces those transgressors who have
committed murder, but also that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"he
shall be in danger of the judgment who is angry with his brother without a
cause; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the
council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
5:22.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">For He does not there, as some have
ignorantly supposed, frame t~ new law, as if to east blame upon His Father; but
shows the folly and perversity of those interpreters of the Law who only insist
on the external appearance, and husk of things, as is vulgarly said; since the
doctrine of God must rather be estimated from a due consideration of. His
nature. Before earthly judges, if a man have carried a weapon for the purpose of
killing a man, he is found guilty of violence; and God, who is a spiritual
Lawgiver, goes even further. With Him, therefore, anger is accounted murder;
yea, inasmuch as He pierces even to the most secret feelings, He holds even
concealed hatred to be murder; for so we must understand John's words,
"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

condemnation, although it may not openly appear.</font><br></div>

by which translators</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

that we are not always to trust to the division of verses; and, since it is
clear that whatever precepts we meet with in the writings of Moses for the
regulation of our lives depend on the Decalogue, this sentence sufficiently
proves that murder was forbidden, not only in order that none should slay his
brother by his ]land, or by a weapon, but also that he should not indulge in
wrong-doing, by cherishing in himself hatred and ill-will. Hence the statement
of Paul is confirmed, that "the Law is spiritual,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:14;) and their folly is refuted who pretend that Moses was an earthly lawgiver
to the Jews, like Lycurgus or Solon, since he thus penetrates even to the secret
affections. It is also probable that John derived from this passage his saying,
"He that hateth his brother is a murderer,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:15;) for the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is here used emphatically; since, although no outward signs of hatred may
appear, yet the internal feeling is accounted murder before
God.</font><br></div>

odium contra filios populi tui: sed diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum: ego
Jehova.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it clearly appears that God
had a further object than that men should not kill each other, for He not only
restrains their hands, but requires their hearts to be pure from all hatred.
For, since the desire of vengeance is the fountain and cause of enmities, it
follows that under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kill</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is condensed whatever is opposed to brotherly love. And this is confirmed by the
<i>antithesis</i>, that none should hate his brother, but rather love him as
himself. We need, then, seek for no other expositor of the Commandment but God
Himself, who pronounces those to be guilty of murder who are affected with any
malevolence, and not only those who, when offended, desire to return evil for
evil, but those who do not sincerely love their neighbors, even when with
justice they deem them to be their enemies. Wherefore, in order that God may
absolve us from spiritual murder, let us learn to purify our hearts from all
desire of vengeance, and, laying aside hatred, to cultivate fraternal affection
with all men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although the latter part of the
verse embraces the sum of the whole Second Table, yet, because love is
contrasted with vengeance, I have not thought fit to separate things which are
so properly connected with each other, especially when one depends on the other.
The precept is indeed only given with reference to the children of Abraham,
because the crime of vengeance would be more atrocious between those who were
bound together by fraternal rights; yet it is not to be doubted but that God
generally condemns the vice. In the
schools</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

since the rule (as they say) is superior to what is regulated by it. they have

humanity exists in us, when we meet a blind man we shall be solicitous lest he
should stumble or fall, and, if he goes astray, we shall stretch out our hands
to him and try to bring him back into the way; we shall also spare the deaf, for
to insult them is no less absurd or barbarous than to assail stones with
reproaches. It is, therefore, gross brutality to increase the ills of those whom
our natural sense impels us to relieve, and who are already troubled more than
enough. Let us, then, learn from these words, that the weaker people are, the
more secure ought they to be from all oppression or injury, and that, when we

This Supplement: is of a mixed character, relating partly to the civil, and
partly to the criminal law. We are informed by it how precious to God is the
life of man; for, if a murder had been committed by some unknown person, He
requires an expiation to be made, whereby the neighboring cities should purge
themselves from the pollution of the crime. Whence it appears that the earth is
so polluted by human blood, that those who encourage murder by impunity,
implicate themselves in the guilt. The question here is as to a secret crime,
the guilt of which attaches to the neighboring cities, until, by the institution
of a diligent inquiry, they can testify that the author is not discovered; how
much less excusable, then, will they be, if they allow a murderer to escape with
impunity? The rite prescribed is, that the elders of the nearest city should
take a heifer which had not drawn in a yoke, and bring it into a stony and
barren valley, cut off its neck with the assistance of the priests, wash their
hands, and bear witness that their hands as well as their eyes are pure, as not
being cognizant of the criminal. God chose a heifer that had not born a yoke, in
order that the satisfaction made by innocent blood might be represented in a
more lively manner; whilst it was to be killed in a desert place, that the
pollution might be removed from the cultivated lands. For, if the blood of the
heifer had been shed in the middle of the market-place of the city, or in any
inhabited spot, the familiarity with the sight of blood would have hardened
their minds in inhumanity. For the purpose, therefore, of awakening horror, it
was drawn out into a solitary and uncultivated spot, that they might be thus
accustomed to detest cruelty. But although, properly speaking, this was not a
sacrifice which could be offered nowhere except in the sanctuary, still it
nearly approached to the nature of a sacrifice, because the Levites were in
attendance, and a solemn deprecation was made; nevertheless, they were not only
employed as ministers of the altar, but also as judges, for their office is
expressed in the words, that they were "chosen to minister to God, to bless the
people, and to pronounce sentence as to every
stroke."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.

The washing of their hands had the effect of stirring them up the more, so that
they should not inconsiderately protest in that solemn rite that they were pure
and guiltless; for it was just as if they had presented the corpse of the dead
mall before God, and had stood themselves opposite to it to purge away the
crime. At the same time, also, they ask for pardon, because it might have been
through their carelessness that the man was smitten; and again, since, by the
sacrilege of Achan alone the whole people were contaminated, it was to be feared
lest the vengeance of God should extend more widely on account of the offense
committed. And thus they were again taught how greatly God abominates murders,
when the people pray that they may be pardoned for the crime of another, as if,
by the very looking upon it, they had contracted guilt. God at length declares
that He will not impute it to them, when they have duly performed this rite of
expiation; not because the heifer was the price of satisfaction to propitiate
God, but because in this way they humbly reconciled themselves to Him, and shut
the door against murders for the time to come. On this account it is said
&#8212; "Thou shalt put away the blood from among you;" for if the murder be
passed over without observation, there remains a blot upon the people, and the
earth itself, in a manner, stinks before God.</font><br></div>

What precedes I have introduced in its proper place, viz., that they should not
kill the sacrifices anywhere but in the sanctuary, of which there was only one
in Judea. Here the permission to eat meat is given, provided that they do not
offer the animals to God, but eat of them as of wild beasts. By way of example,
two kinds are mentioned, the roe-buck and the hart, of which no offering was
made. They are, therefore, freely allowed to eat meat wheresoever they pleased,
with this exception, that they should not taste the blood; for, although this
was observed by their forefathers before the giving of the Law, God ratifies it
anew when He would gather a peculiar people to Himself. We know that immediately
after the deluge, Noah and his posterity were commanded to abstain from blood;
but, inasmuch as the greater part of mankind soon degenerated, it is probable
that all nations neglected God's command, and permitted to themselves a
universal license on this point; and it is even questionable whether this
observance, which was everywhere fallen into desuetude, prevailed among the
family of Shem. Certainly it may be conjectured from the renewed promulgation of
the law, that it was altogether obsolete; at any rate, God would have His chosen
people distinguished by this mark of separation from heathen
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The reason of the prohibition which is
now mentioned had already been
declared,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> viz., because the blood is the seat of
life. But although it, was allowable to kill an animal for food, yet, was it a
useful restraint to prevent inhumanity, that they should not touch the blood;
for if they abstained from the blood of beasts, much more necessary was it to
spare human blood. After God, therefore, has forbidden blood to be eaten, He
immediately proceeds to speak of men themselves: "Whose sheddeth man's blood, by
man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he
man."</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
9:4-6.) Hence I have deemed it appropriate to annex all the passages in which
God commands the people to abstain from blood, to the Sixth Commandment. In
itself, indeed, the eating of blood was a thing of no great importance: since,
therefore, God so often inculcates a point of so little weight, it may be
inferred that the law has some further object. To this may be added the severity
of the punishment, for surely it was not a crime worthy of death to taste the
blood of some little bird; and hence, also, it is manifested that the
prohibition had another meaning, viz., that cruelty might be abhorred. And the
words of Moses show that the eating of blood is not forbidden because it
infected man with its uncleanness, but that they might account the life of man
to be precious; for it is said, "the blood is the life," which, in the opinion
of Augustine,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is equivalent to its being "the sign of
life; " but Moses rather means that animal life is contained in the blood.
Wherefore, blood, which represents the life, was not interdicted without reason,
nor was it only sinful to eat the blood by itself, but also together with the
flesh, as is expressly declared both in Deuteronomy and in the last passage from
Leviticus.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.

It is not without cause that he earnestly exhorts them to inflexible firmness,
because it was both a matter trifling in appearance, and its observation
troublesome, whilst it was easy to decline from it on account of the universal
example of the Gentiles. For if they considered within themselves that it
contributed not to holiness that they should not touch blood, hence a snare to
indulgence might easily have arisen.</font><br></div>

God here not only condemns to death whosoever shall have polluted themselves by
eating of blood, but declares that He will Himself take vengeance on them,
though they may escape from the hands of the judges; for He not only prescribes
to the judges what it is right for them to do, but asserts for Himself the
office of inflicting the punishment. For, if we consider the intention of the
Law, is there anything to surprise us in this; for although it be not consistent
that the blood of a brute should be compensated for by the death of a man, still
we must remember that this mode of
instruction</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was necessary for a rude people, lest
they should speedily lapse into barbarism. But, lest they should complain that
no use remained for the blood, He reminds them that since it was given for
atonement, they would be very ungrateful if they were not content with so great
a blessing; and surely, since it was the price they were to pay for appeasing
God, this was an employment of it far to be preferred to food. If, then, they
desired to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exchange</i></font><font face="Palatino">
into ordinary food the blood, which was destined to the altar for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reconciliation</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of God, Moses indirectly reproves their ingratitude; for when God took away the
right of eating it, He left them something better, which should have abundantly
satisfied them. But we have
elsewhere</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f23
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">seen in what manner blood atones for souls,
<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., in a sacramental manner, upon which it must be observed that
what properly belongs to Christ is thus transferred by <i>metonomy</i> to
figures and symbols, yet in such a way that the similitude should neither be
empty nor inefficacious; for in so far as the fathers apprehended Christ in the
external <i>sacrifices</i>, atonement was truly exhibited in them. In this
passage also, I do not understand "the strangers" to be all such visitors as may
have journeyed amongst them on matters of business, but those who had devoted
themselves to the worship of God; for many foreigners, abandoning their
superstitions, were circumcised, and it behooved that such as these should be
expressly laid under the bonds of the Law, lest, if it had not referred to them,
they should have withdrawn themselves from obeying it. This point must,
therefore, be briefly adverted to, lest we should suppose that heathen
sojourners were prohibited from the eating of blood, whereas they were allowed
to buy for food</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> even flesh that had been torn by
beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since, however, the Patriarchs before
the Law had abstained from blood, and its prohibition had no reference to the
First Table or the legal service, hence it came to pass that when the Apostles
abrogated the ceremonial law, they did not dare to allow immediately the free
eating of blood, lest great scandal should arise from this new and unwonted
thing.

Churches, they commanded the Gentiles not to eat of blood; adding as the reason,
that those who were accustomed to read the writings of Moses, would be disturbed

from Paul.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

although he speaks briefly, like a legislator, there is no doubt but that he
would have those whom he adjudges to die put to death by the sentence of the
judges; the manner of executing the punishment we shall see in its proper place.
Now although God did not carry out to absolute perfection the laws which He
enacted, yet in their principle He desired that a clear and unreserved approval
of His Commandments should appear. And this was the reason why I commenced with

he now also subjects to punishment those who shall have mutilated the body of
their neighbor by blows; and this was necessary, because otherwise every very
great villain, who might be accomplished in the art of inflicting injury, would
have broken his brother's leg or arm, and then would not only have laughed at
the poor man himself, but also at God and His Law. If, therefore, a person had
injured a member of another, the law of retaliation is enacted, which has also
been in use among other
nations.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But God thus distinctly prescribes when
and how the injury was to be retaliated, that the law might not be open at all
to the foolish cavils with which Favorinus attacks the law of the Twelve Tables
in Gellius. And certainly the words of the Decemvirs were too obscure,
"<i>Si</i> <i>membrum</i> <i>fregeris</i> <i>meum</i>, <i>ex</i> <i>pacto</i>
<i>talio</i>. <i>est</i>." (If you have broken my limb; without agreement made,
there must be retaliation.) But God does not command an eye to be plucked out
for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth, till He has set forth that this was only to
be the <i>case</i> if any one had knowingly and willfully inflicted the injury;
thus, He does not bring to justice accidental blows, but only a premeditated
crime. It is vain to object that the members of different persons can hardly be

being alarmed by the severity of the punishment, men should abstain from
injuring others; and therefore these two things were connected together, If one
killeth a man, let him die, and if one hath taken away a part of life, let him
suffer a similar privation. And the same is the <i>tendency</i> of the

This passage, as I have said, more clearly explains the details, and first makes
a distinction between voluntary and accidental homicide; for, if a stone or an
axe
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
19:5.) may have slipped from a man unintentionally, and struck anybody, He would
not have it accounted a capital crime. And for this purpose the cities of refuge
were given, of which brief mention is here made, and whose rights will be
presently more fully spoken of, and where also the mode of distinguishing
between design and ignorance will be laid down. But it must be remarked, that
Moses declares that accidental homicide, as it is commonly called, does not
happen by chance or accident, but according to the will of God, as if He himself
led out the person, who is killed, to death. By whatever kind of death,
therefore, men are taken away, it is certain that we live or die only at His
pleasure; and surely, if not even a sparrow can fall to the ground <i>except</i>
by His will,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:29,) it would be very absurd that men created in His image should be
abandoned to the blind impulses of fortune. Wherefore it must be concluded, as
Scripture elsewhere teaches, that the term of each man's life is
appointed,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">It is true, indeed, that whatever has no apparent
cause or necessity seems to us to be fortuitous; and thus, whatever, according
to nature, might happen otherwise we call <i>accidents</i>,
(<i>contingentia</i>;) yet in the meantime it must be remembered, that what
might else incline either way is governed by God's secret counsel, so that
nothing is done without His arrangement and decree. In this way we do not
suppose a fate</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> such as the Stoics invented; for it is a
different tiling to say that things which of themselves incline to various and
doubtful events, are directed by the hand of God whithersoever He will, and to
say that necessity governs them in accordance with the perpetual complication of
causes,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

fit.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is no reason to follow the Jews here
in philosophizing more deeply, that none are delivered to death but those in
whom God finds cause for it. It is indeed certain, that with God there always
exists the best reason for His acts; but it is wrong to elicit from thence that
those who by tits guidance meet with death must be guilty of some offense. Nor
even if God should take away an innocent man, would it bc lawful to murmur
against Him; as if His justice were naught, because it is concealed from us, and
indeed incomprehensible.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

He expresses the same thing in different ways; for although there is a wide
difference between slaying a man
presumptuously</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and with guile, yet Moses applies them
both to a willful murder; for by <i>guile</i> he means a wicked disposition to
injure, and by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presumptuous</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he designates a violent assault, when a man in hate wantonly falls upon another.
And surely truculence, and violence, and all cruelty is presumptuous,
(<i>superba</i>;) for unless a man despised his brother, he would not assail him
as an enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Lest by overlooking murders they
should defile the land, God commands that murderers should be torn away even
from His altar, whereby He signifies that they are as unworthy of divine as of
human aid. For, although the sanctity of the altar might afford an asylum for
the protection of those who had transgressed through imprudence, or. error, yet
it would have been wrong that impunity for crimes should have been derived from
hence; because the sanctuary would have been thus converted into a den of
thieves, and religion would have been subjected to gross profanation. Wherefore,
although criminals embracing the altar should implore God's aid, the Law
commands them to be torn away from thence to punishment, because it would have
been disgraceful to abuse God's sacred name as affording license for sin. Hence
it appears how great was the folly of old in supposing that churches were
honored when they were made asylums for the encouragement of evil deeds. This,
indeed, was derived from the ordinary custom of the heathen; but it was a
foolish imitation thus to mix up God with idols in a spurious worship; although
in this respect the Gentiles served their idols more purely and virtuously than
the Christians</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> served God; for they refused the right of
asylum to the sacrilegious and impure, so that the temple of the Samothracians
was no secure hiding-place even to
Perseus,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the king of Macedon. Livy records the
following words, as having been spoken by a heathen, &#8212; "Since, at the
commencement of all our sacrifices, those whose hands are not pure are enjoined
to retire, will ye suffer your sanctuaries to be contaminated by the
blood-stained person of a robber?" Let us, then, be ashamed of polluting our
temples under the pretext of reverence for
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.

The punishment here enacted for wounds and blows is so slight, that it might
have served as a provocative to the mischievousness of the ill-disposed. Since
the Law of the Twelve Tables only inflicted a fine of twenty-five <i>asses</i>
upon a man who had beaten another unjustly, there was a certain Lucius
Veratius,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who, in mere wanton sport, did not
hesitate to box the ears of any one he met, and then to command one of his
slaves to pay the amount of the fine, so that it was at length thought better
that the law should fall into desuetude, than to suffer it to be thus
ridiculously abused. The same thing might easily happen among the <i>Jews</i>,
since a person, who had so beaten his neighbor as that he should lie in bed,
only had to pay what the unhappy man had expended on his cure. For who would not
willingly enjoy the pleasure of knocking down his enemies on this condition, of
providing for their subsistence whilst they lay in bed? But we must remember the
declaration of Christ, that on account of the perverse nature of the
<i>Jews</i>, many things were allowed them "because of the hardness of their
hearts,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:8, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
10:5,) amongst which this indulgent provision is to be reckoned. Still God seems
to have dealt more leniently with the man who had struck the blow, that He might
also chastise the other, who, though of inferior strength, had rashly engaged in
the conflict; for both were to be alike punished for the violence unjustly
inflicted. Equal lenity seems, therefore, to have been shown to both, since
compensation is only made to the person struck for his private

law. Whenever, therefore, God seems to pardon too easily: and with too much
clemency, let us recollect that He designedly deviated from the more perfect
rule, because He, had to do with an intractable
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.

Although in civil matters there was a wide distinction between slaves and
free-men, still, that God may show how dear and precious men's lives are to Him,
He has no respect to persons with regard to murder; but avenges the death of a
slave and a free-man in the same way, if he should die immediately of his wound.
Indeed, it was a proof of gross barbarism amongst the Romans and other nations,
to give to masters the power of life and death; for men are bound together by a
more sacred tie, than that it should be permitted to a master to kill with
impunity his wretched slave; nor are some men so set over others, as that they
should exercise tyranny, or robbery, neither does reason permit that any private
individual should usurp to himself the power of the sword. But, although unjust
cruelty was not prohibited, as it should have been, by the laws of Rome, yet
they</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> confessed that slaves should be used like
hired servants. The exception, which immediately follows, does not seem very
consistent, for, if the slave should die after some time, the penalty of murder
is remitted; whereas it would often be preferable to die at once of a single
wound, than to perish by a lingering illness; and it might happen that the slave
should be so bruised and maimed by blows, as to die some time afterwards. In
this ease, the cruelty of the master would be surely greater than if he had
committed the murder under the impulse of burning anger: wherefore the enactment
appears to be a very unjust one. But it must be remarked, that the murder of
those slaves, who had been obliged to take to their bed from their wounds, was
not unpunished. Whence we gather, that it was not allowable for cruel and
truculent masters to wound their slaves severely; and this is what the words
expressly imply, for the smiter is only exempted from punishment when he shall
have so restrained himself as that the marks of his cruelty should not appear.
For that the slaves should "stand for one or two
days,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is equivalent to saying, that they were
perfect and sound in all their members; but if a wound had been inflicted, or
there was any mutilation, the smiter was guilty of murder. None, therefore, is
absolved but he who only meant to chastise his slave; and where no injury
appears, it is probable that there was no intention to kill him. Whilst, then,
this law prohibits bloodthirsty assaults, it by no means gives greater license
to murder. The reason, which is added, must be restricted to the private loss;
because a murderer would never be absolved on the pretext that he had purchased
his slave with money, since the life of a man cannot be so
estimated.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.

This passage at first sight is ambiguous, for if the word
death</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> only applies to the pregnant woman, it
would not have been a capital crime to put an end to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foetus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which would be a great absurdity; for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foetus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
though enclosed in the womb of its mother, is already a human being,
(<i>homo</i>,) and it is almost a monstrous crime to rob it of the life which it
has not yet begun to enjoy. If it seems more horrible to kill a man in his own
house than in a field, because a man's house is his place of most secure refuge,
it ought surely to be deemed more atrocious to destroy a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foetus</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in the womb before it has come to light. On these grounds I am led to conclude,
without hesitation, that the words, "if death should follow," must be applied to
the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foetus</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as well as to the mother. Besides, it would be by no means reasonable that a
father should sell for a set sum the life of his son or daughter. Wherefore
this, in my opinion, is the meaning of the law, that it would be a crime
punishable with death, not only when the mother died from the effects of the
abortion, but also if the infant should be killed; whether it should die from
the wound abortively, or soon after its birth. But, since it could not fail but
that premature confinement would weaken both
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the</i></font><font face="Palatino">
mother and her offspring, the husband is allowed to demand before the judges a
money-payment, at their discretion, in compensation for his loss; for although
God's command is only that the money should be paid before the
judges,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> still He thus appoints them to settle the
amount as arbitrators, if the husband should chance to be too exorbitant. We
plainly perceive, by the repetition of the <i>lex</i> <i>talionis</i>, that a
just proportion is to be observed, and that the amount of punishment is to be
equally regulated, whether as to a tooth, or an eye, or life itself, so that the
compensation should correspond with the injury done; and therefore (what is
first said of the life</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f41 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">) is correctly applied also to the
several parts, so that he who has plucked out his brother's eye, or cut off his
hand, or broken his leg, should lose his own eye, or hand, or leg. In fine, for
the purpose of preventing all violence, a compensation is to be paid in
proportion to the injury. But although God commands punishment to be inflicted
on the guilty, still, if a man be injured, he ought not to seek for vengeance;
for God does not contradict Himself, who so often exhorts His children not only
to endure injuries patiently, but even to overcome evil with good. The murderer
is to be punished, or he who has maimed a member of his brother; but it is not
therefore lawful, if you have unjustly suffered violence, to indulge in wrath or
hatred, so as to render evil for evil. Since this error was rife among the Jews,
our Lord refutes it, and teaches that the punishment, which is publicly awarded
to the wrong-doer, is not subservient to every man's private passion, so that he
who is offended should make haste to retaliate.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400538&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

excite the desire of vengeance, but all violence is restrained by the fear of
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.

Since, in the sight of God, there is neither slave nor free-man, it is clear
that he sins as greatly who smites a slave, as if he had struck a free-man.
Still, a distinction is made as regards the civil law and human justice,
especially if any one have inflicted a wound on his own slave. For here a tooth
for a tooth, or an eye for an eye, is not required, but the superiority, which
he has improperly abused, is taken from the master; and in compensation for the
injury, liberty, which is almost half their life, is given to the male or female
slave. Thus, in consideration that it was his slave, t. he master is treated
more leniently, when the severity of the punishment is thus mitigated; whilst,
in compensation for his dislocation or fracture, the slave receives what is more
advantageous to him, viz., that, being set free, he should not be exposed to
another's cruelty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.

Moses now descends even to the brute animals, so that, if they injured any one,
by their punishment men may be more and more deterred from shedding blood. If,
therefore, a goring ox have killed a man, he commands that it should be stoned,
and that its carcass should be thrown away as abominable. Though censorious
persons mock at this law, as if it were childish to punish a wretched animal, in
which there is no criminality, their insolence requires but a brief refutation.
For, since oxen were created for man's good, so we need not wonder that their
death, as well as their life, should be made to contribute to the public
advantage. If, then, an ox that had killed a, man should be kept, men would
undoubtedly grow hardened in cruelty by beholding it; and to eat its flesh,
would be almost the same thing as eating the flesh of man. The cruelty of men,
therefore, could not better be restrained, so that they should hold the murder
of each other in abhorrence, than by thus avenging a man's death. In the second
place, God proceeds further, condemning the master of the ox himself to death,
if he had been previously admonished to beware; for such a warning takes away
the pretext of ignorance; nor should the punishment seem to be severe for gross
neglect, because to give free outlet to dangerous beasts is equivalent to
compassing men's death. He who knowingly and willfully exposes the life of his
brother to peril, is justly accounted his murderer. The exception which is
finally added, at first sight contains a kind of contradiction, because it was
forbidden by the Law to compound with a murderer for money. But inasmuch as a
delinquency (<i>delictum</i>) differs from a crime, although it was unlawful to
covenant with murderers for the remission of their punishment, still the judges
were permitted on their hearing of the case, to mitigate it, if a man were
excused by his unconsciousness or inadvertency. This, then, is a special
exception, which permits the judges to distinguish between the nature of
offenses; viz., that, if they discovered a man not to be worthy of death, they
should still punish his negligence by a pecuniary
fine.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.

I know not whether they are correct who refer this to age, as if any young
persons of either sex were meant by the words son and daughter; but I do not
reject this opinion. Still Moses seems to extend the law, as if, in case a
butting ox had killed its owner's son, the father himself should be subject to
the punishment, for not having taken more care of his children. It might,
however, be doubted, whether it would be just to condemn to death a father
already weighed down by the loss of his child; still it affords a useful
example, that parents should not escape with impunity, if their sons or
daughters should die by their fault.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.

It is not unreasonable that the punishment for the death of a slave should now
be set at less than for that of a free-man. As regarded the crime of voluntary
murder, there was no distinction between slaves and masters; but in a case of
mischance (<i>delicto</i>) the severity might in some degree be mitigated;
especially when the stoning of the ox sufficiently availed for bringing murder
into detestation. God, therefore, showed admirable moderation in condemning the
negligence of the master to be punished by the payment of thirty shekels; whilst
He proposed the ox as an example, and reminded all by its death, how very
precious in His sight is human blood.</font><br></div>

rates the life of men, so the qualification, which we find here, declares, that

credulity would often impel the judges to condemn the guiltless, He here applies
a remedy to this evil, forbidding that the crime should be punished unless
proved by sure testimony. Although He has naturally inscribed this law upon
every heart, yet he would have it written down, that its observance amongst the
Israelites might be more sacred; for nothing is more dangerous than to expose
men's lives to the tongue of a single individual; but, where the consent of two
or three is carefully weighed, any lurking falsehood is for the most part
detected.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Lest, therefore, any one should be

roofs of the Jewish houses were fiat, so that they might freely walk upon them.
If there were no railings round them, a fall would have been fatal; and every
house would have often been a house of mourning. God, therefore, commands the
edge to be fortified with battlements, or railings, or other inclosure, and
accompanies the injunction with a severe denunciation; for He declares that the
houses would be defiled with blood, if any one should fall from an uninclosed
roof. Now, if guile were thus <i>contracted</i> <i>by</i> mere incautiousness,
it hence appears how greatly He abominates deliberate cruelty; and, if it
behooved everybody to be thus solicitous as to the lives of their brethren, it
shows how criminal it is to injure them purposely and in

is not man-stealing only which is here condemned, but the accompanying evils of
cruelty and fraud, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., if he, who had stolen a man, had likewise

precept was to banish inhumanity and barbarism from the chosen people, and also
to impress upon them horror even of a just execution. And surely the body of a
man suspended on a cross is a sad and hideous spectacle; for the rights of
sepulture are ordained for man, both as a pledge and symbol of the resurrection,
and also to spare the eyes of the living, lest they should be defiled by the
sight of so horrible a thing. Moses does not here speak generally, but only of
those malefactors who are unworthy of the honor of burial; yet the public good
is regarded in the burial even of such as these, lest men should grow accustomed
to cruelty, and thus become more ready to commit murder. Moreover, that they may
take more careful heed in this matter, he declares that the land would be
defiled, if the corpse should be left hanging on the cross, since such
inhumanity pollutes and disgraces the land. And this was more intolerable in
Judea, which God had given as an inheritance to his elect people, that he might
be there worshipped reverentially, and purely, every profanation being excluded.
The man so hanged is
called</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "the curse of God," because this kind of
punishment is detestable in itself. God, indeed, does not forbid criminals to be
crucified, or hanged on a gallows, but rather gives His sanction to this mode of
punishment; He only, by His own example, exhorts the Israelites to abhor all
atrocity. Although, therefore, He does not disapprove of the punishment, He
still says that lie abominates those that are hanged on a tree, that the scandal
may be immediately removed; nor does He call them accursed, as if their
salvation was to be despaired of, but because the hanging was a mark of His
curse. This passage Paul applies to Christ, to teach us that He was made
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&gt;ra

mankind is implicated in the curse, there was no other mode of deliverance,

eum ultra plagis multis, vilescat frater tuus in oculis

are here enjoined, it is a Supplement of the Sixth Commandment. The sum is,
that, if any one is judicially condemned to be beaten with stripes, the
chastisement should not be excessive. The question, however, is as to a
punishment, which by lawyers is called a moderate
correction,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and which ought to be such, as that the
body torn by the whip should not be maimed or disfigured. Since, therefore, God
has so far spared the guilty, as to repress even just severity, much more would
He have regard paid to innocent blood; and since He prohibits the judge from
using too great rigor, much less will He tolerate the violence of a private
individual, if he shall employ it against his brother. But it was necessary that
zeal should be thus restrained, because judges, in other respects not unjust,
are often as severe against lesser offenses (<i>delicta</i>) as against crimes.
An equal measure of punishment is not indeed prescribed, as if all were to be
beaten alike; it is only prohibited that the judges should order more than forty
stripes in all to be inflicted for an offense. Thus the culprits were beaten
deliberately, and not in such an indiscriminate manner as when it was not
requisite to count the stripes; besides, they were not so injured for the future
as to be deprived of the use of any of their limbs. With the same intent God
would have the judges themselves to be present, that by their authority they may
prevent any excess: and the reason is added, lest "thy brother should seem vile
unto thee," because he had been beaten immoderately. This may be explained in
two ways, either, lest his body should be disfigured by the blows, and so he
should be rendered unsightly; or, lest, being stained for ever with ignominy and
disgrace, he should be discouraged in mind; for we know how grievous and bitter
it is to be mocked and insulted. A third
sense,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which some prefer, is too far-fetched,
viz., lest he should die like some vile and contemptible beast; for God only
provides that the wretched man should be improved by his chastisement, and not
that he should grow callous from his infamy. As the Jews were always
ostentatious of their zeal in trifling matters, they invented a childish
precaution, in order that they might more strictly observe this law; for they
were scrupulous in not proceeding to the fortieth stripe, but, by deducting one,
they sought after an empty reputation for clemency, as if they were wiser than
God Himself, and superior to Him in kindness. Into such folly do men fall, when
they dare out of their own heads to invent anything in opposition to God's word!
This superstition already prevailed in Paul's time, as we gather from his words,
where he reports that "five times he received forty stripes save one."

God manifests how great is His regard for human life, so that blood should not
be shed indiscriminately, when he forbids that children should be involved in
the punishment of their parents. Nor was this Law by any means supererogatory,
because on account of one man's crime his whole race was often severely dealt
with. It is not without cause, therefore, that God interposes for the protection
of the innocent, and does not allow the punishment to travel further than where
the crime exists. And surely our natural common sense dictates that it is an act
of barbarous madness to put children to death out of hatred to their father. If
any should object, what we have already seen, that God avenges "unto the third
and fourth generation," the reply is easy, that He is a law unto Himself, and
that He does not rush by a blind impulse to the exercise of vengeance, so as to
confound the innocent with the reprobate, but that He so visits the iniquity of
the fathers upon their children, as to temper extreme severity with the greatest
equity. Moreover, He has not so bound Himself by an inflexible rule as not to be
free, if it so pleases Him, to depart from the Law; as, for example, He
commanded the whole race of Canaan to be rooted out, because the land would not
be purged except by the extermination of their defilements; and, since they were
all reprobate, the children, no less than their fathers, were doomed to just
destruction. Nay, we read that, after Saul's death, his guilt was expiated by
the death of his children, (2 Samuel 21;) still, by this special exception, the
Supreme Lawgiver did not abrogate what He had commanded; but would have His own
admirable wisdom acquiesced in, which is the fountain from whence all laws

when they shall have come to take a city, they should first of all exhort its
inhabitants to obtain peace by capitulating; and if they should do so, to keep
them alive, and to be content with imposing a tribute on them. This principle of

justly lawful for them. Unquestionably, by the law of charity, even armed men
should be spared, if, casting away the sword, they crave for mercy; at any rate
it was not lawful to kill any but those who were taken in arms, and sword in
hand. This permission, therefore, to slaughter, which is extended to all the
males, is far distant from
perfection.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But, although in their ferocity the Jews
would have hardly suffered the perfection of equity to be prescribed to them,
still God would at least restrain their excessive violence from proceeding to
the extremity of cruelty. The question is as to cities taken by force, where it
sometimes happens that there is no distinction of sex or age regarded; this
inhumanity is here mitigated, since they might not kill either women or
children.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.

causes why He would have their race and memory radically destroyed; especially
since He had borne with them for four hundred years, whilst in their wicked
obstinacy they had not ceased to grow worse and worse, from whence their
desperate impiety was manifest. What had been said before is here, however,
repeated, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that since that land was consecrated to God's
service, its inhabitants were to be exterminated, who could do nothing but
contaminate it; and therefore this would be profitable for the Israelites, lest
by their wiles they should be attracted to false superstitions.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Deuteronomy 23:15,
16	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b> Thou shalt not deliver unto
his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:	<b>15.</b>

vim inferes ei.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino">Although this Law has a
tendency to humanity and kindness, it still does not appear to be altogether
just. Since many masters oppressed their slaves with tyrannical arrogance, their
wickedness rendered it necessary to afford some alleviation to the poor
creatures. Thus slaves were permitted to take refuge in temples, and at Rome at
the statues of the Caesars, so that if they proved themselves to have been
treated with injustice and inhumanity, they might, when their case was proved,
be transferred by sale to merciful masters. This, indeed, was endurable, but the
refuge which is here granted to slaves defrauds their masters of their just
right; since, without their case being heard, they have liberty given them to
reside in the land of Canaan; thus, too, the law of nations is violated, since
the land is opened to every fugitive. Besides, since runaway slaves are
generally wicked and criminal, whatever place may be their asylum, it will be
filled with many sources of infection. I know not whether there is sufficient
foundation for the opinion of some who think that the slaves were exempted by
privilege from their former
servitude,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in order that they might give themselves
up to God's service, and that thus true religion might be propagated. It
certainly does not seem consistent that filth and refuse of every sort should be
received into the Church, because, in the end, it would have been filled with
all kinds of corruptions; and besides, it was by no means decorous that whatever
crime had been elsewhere committed should be sheltered under God's name. For,
suppose a thief, or an adulterer, or a murderer, should leave his master, and
seek for an asylum in the Holy Land, what else would it have been to receive and
protect such guests, but to overthrow law and justice, and to set up a state of
foul barbarism? I think, therefore, that more is to be understood than the words
express, viz., that, if it should be found that the slaves had not fled in
consequence of their own evil doings, but on account of the excessive cruelty of
their masters, the people should not drive them away, which would have been
tantamount to giving them up to butchery. And, in fact, it may be inferred that
judicial proceedings were to be instituted, because a choice is given as to the
city in which they prefer to dwell.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Religion,
indeed, stood them in some stead, because those who sought a place and home in
the land of Canaan, were obliged to dedicate themselves to God, and to be
initiated in His worship; still, God would never have allowed His name to be
profaned by the reception of wicked persons without discrimination. Wherefore,
as I briefly slated before, God inculcates humanity upon His people, lest, by
the extradition of fugitive slaves, they should be necessary to the cruelty of
others; because their masters would have been their executioners; and, since lie
forbids the people from ill-treating them, He implies, by these words, that He
only so far provides for the safety of these wretched beings, as to allow them
to defend their innocence in a court of justice; wherefore I have thought fit to
place this law amongst the Supplements of the Sixth
Commandment.</font><br></div>

Regard was had, indeed, to the preservation of the breed; but, besides, when
birds are sitting, as being very lean, it is certain that they are not wholesome
food; still there is no question but that it was God's intention to accustom His
people to study humanity. For, if there be one drop of compassion in us, it will
never enter into our minds to kill an unhappy little bird, which so burns either
with the desire of offspring, or with love towards its little ones, as to be
heedless of its life, and to prefer endangering itself to the desertion of its
eggs, or its brood. Wherefore, it is not to be doubted but that in this
elementary lesson, God prohibited His people from savageness and
cruelty.</font><br></div>

exhorts His people to <i>exercise</i> the duties of humanity towards brute
animals, in order that they may be the more disposed to assist their brethren;
for we must bear in memory what Paul <i>teaches</i>, where God commands oxen to
be kindly treated, viz., that He does not <i>care</i> so much for them in this,
as for mankind.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:9.) God prescribes elsewhere, that if any should see the ox or ass
of his brother, or even of his enemy, going astray, he should catch it, and
restore it to its master,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
22:1-3, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
23:4;) but here He had another intention, i.e., that believers should testify
their forgiveness of their enemies, by being merciful to their animals. If it
had been simply said, that our enemies were to be helped, and that we must
contend with them by acts of kindness, to overcome their ill-will, all cruelty
would have been sufficiently condemned; but when God commands us not only to
succor our enemies, to point out their way to those who are straying, and to
lift up those who are fallen, but would also have us <i>exercise</i> these
kindnesses to their very beasts, He more emphatically and strongly expresses how
very far removed from hatred and the desire of vengeance He desires His children
to be. Wherefore we see that what Christ afterwards taught His disciples is
taught also in the Law, that we should love our enemies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400544&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:44.) Nor is it merely the desire of vengeance which is here restrained, but
something more is required, viz., that believers should conquer the ill-will of
their enemies by kindnesses: since to bring <i>back</i> <i>a</i> straying ox or
ass is a proof of sincere affection. But, in these two passages, what relates to
the Sixth Commandment is represented in a more striking manner, viz., that
assistance should be rendered to an ox or an ass, weighed down by its burden.
Interpreters</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are not agreed as to the meaning of the
words, and Jerome has departed most widely from them. But others, who desire to
translate them more accurately, read them interrogatively, &#8212; If thou shall
see an animal fall under its burden, etc., wilt thou hesitate to help? The other
sense seems more appropriate, &#8212; If thou shall; have seen and have
hesitated to help, still do thou help: for in this way God anticipates a person,
if, perchance, impelled at first by hatred, he should dislike to help his enemy:
and then commands him to <i>correct</i> his guilty thought. The meaning,
therefore, will be, &#8212; if the sight of thine enemy should delay thee from
aiding his beast, lay aside thine ill-will, and unite thyself with him, that you
may together be humane and merciful to the wretched animal. Thus an opportunity
was given to enemies for their mutual reconciliation. There is another

God appointed the cities of refuge, not only to make distinction between sills
of malice and error, but also lest innocent blood should be rashly shed. Thus
far we have seen how severely He would have murder punished: but, inasmuch as it
would have been by no means just that he, who had not willfully but accidentally
killed his neighbor, should be hurried away to the same punishment, to which
willful murderers were subjected, an exception is added here, in order that he
might escape who had killed another ignorantly, and unintentionally. Although,
as has been said, God had a, further object, viz., lest murder upon murder
should be committed, and the land should thus be polluted. Let us now examine
the details in order. Although at the outset He only mentions the cities on the
other side of Jordan, still we gather from what follows, that six cities were
chosen for this purpose, of which three were on this side Jordan. He would have
them so situated, that every part of the country should have one of them in its
neighborhood, lest the exile of the unhappy persons, who were guiltless, should
be rendered more painful by the distance they would have to travel. We have
already briefly pointed
out</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that these cities were to be in the
portions of Levi, in order that the dignity of the priesthood might the better
protect the exiles, and also, because it was probable that there would be more
prudence and serious feeling in the Levites, so that the refuge accorded to the
innocent should not also shield the
guilty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.

God appears to contradict Himself, when, a little further on, He absolves
involuntary murderers, although they may have inflicted the wound with iron or
with a stone; whilst here He absolutely declares that whosoever shall smite
another with wood, or iron, or a stone, shall be guilty of death; but this is
easily explained if we consider his meaning; for, after having pardoned the
unintentional act (<i>errori</i>,)
lest</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> any should misconstrue this as affording
impunity for crime, He at once anticipates them, and again inculcates what has
been said before. By the express mention of iron, wood, and stone, He more
dearly explains that no voluntary murders are to be pardoned; else, as laws are
wont to be evaded by various subtleties, they would have endeavored, perhaps, to
limit what had been said respecting the punishment of murderers to one single
species of murder, viz., when a person had been slain with a sword. It is not,
then, without cause that God condemns to death every kind of murderer, whether
he have committed the crime with a weapon (of iron,) or by throwing a stone, or
with a dub; since it is sufficient for his condemnation that he had conceived
the intention to do the evil act. It is well known
that</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by the <i>Lex</i> <i>Cornelia</i>,
whosoever had carried a weapon with the intention of killing a man was guilty;
and Martianus cites the reply of Adrian, &#8212; He who has killed a man, if he
did it not with the intention of killing him, may be absolved; and he who has
not killed a man, but has wounded him with intention to kill him, is to be
condemned as a murderer; as Paulus also teaches, that in the said <i>Lex</i>
<i>Cornelia</i>, the evil intention (<i>dolus</i>) is taken for the deed.
Another reply of Adrian is very true, That in crimes, the will and not the
result must be regarded. Whence that saying of Ulpian, That there is no
<i>difference</i> between the man who kills, and him who causes the death of
another. Here, therefore, God had no other object than to cut off from murderers

When God commanded that murderers should suffer death, He required that they
should be condemned by the judges after due trial; but it seems to savor
somewhat of barbarism, that he should now permit the relative of the dead man to
take vengeance; for it is a very bad precedent to give the power of the sword to
private individuals, and this too in their own cause. It; was indeed formerly
permitted, as we shall see in its proper place, to put to death robbers by
night, as also it was lawful for the husband, or the father, of a ravished woman
to kill the adulterer caught in the fact; but it is absurd that the law should
allow a person to avenge the death of his brother. But it is not to be supposed
that this license was ever accorded by God, that a man might neglect the public
authorities, and inflict punishment on his brothers murderer, wherever he should
meet him; for this would have been to give the reins to sudden anger, so that
blood would be added to blood. Wherefore it is probable that the danger of this
is here denounced, rather than the gate opened to private vengeance; as if it
had been said, that unless a provision were made for the innocent, the fury of
those whose kindred had been slain, could hardly be res[rained; not because it
was lawful for them to render violence for violence, but because they would not
consider it a crime, and impunity would prove a stimulus even to them, if their
just indignation should be pardoned. It must be understood, then, that when a
man had been maliciously and willfully killed, a death inflicted by his relative
in vengeance was not punished; because it was hard that a man should be
capitally condemned as a criminal, who had only slain a murderer already exposed
to capital punishment, under the impulse of that love towards his own blood,
which is naturally implanted in all. This, however, was tolerated, and not
approved of, because, as I have already said, punishments are to be inflicted by
public judgment, and not by private will. But, since this indulgence was
conceded on account of the people's hardness of heart, God here reminds them how
needful it was to provide an asylum for the innocent, because all murderers
would else have been indiscriminately attacked. In short, a comparison is made
between the guilty and the innocent, for, unless a just distinction had been
drawn, all alike would have been exposed to death. The murderer, he says, is
worthy of death, if, perchance, he is met by the kinsman of the man murdered. A
remedy is, therefore, to be provided, lest one who is not criminal should
accidentally receive the same punishment. Hence, at length it is gathered that a
distinction is made between one and the other, by a lawful trial. The mode of
procedure is also prescribed, viz., that the <i>congregation</i> should acquit
the man who has killed another unwittingly. But because there is some perplexity
in the words, it must be observed, that as soon as a person had slain another,
he immediately betook himself to the place of refuge, and there declared that he
sought shelter. After this declaration, it was open for the relatives of the
dead man to lay their accusation, and then, after both parties were heard,
judgment was pronounced. Otherwise there is a manifest contradiction in the
context, since it is presently added; they "shall restore him to the city of his
refuge, whither he was fled," whence it appears that, after the exile had
presented himself to state his case, and to clear himself, it was usual that a
day should be appointed, upon which his accusers should come forward. The sum
is, that the murderer should nowhere find refuge, except he were acquitted of
his crime. This was an excellent precaution, lest the same punishment should be
inflicted upon mischance and criminality,
whilst</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> at the same time, by the temporary
banishment it was testified how carefully bloodshed was to be avoided. God
<i>likewise</i> spared the eyes of those whose brother had been killed, lest
their grief should be kept alive by continually beholding (the person who had
killed him;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f57
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) and this we gather from verse 26, where
impunity is conceded to the relations, if they had caught and killed out of the
boundaries of his refuge the man, whose duty it was to withdraw himself; not
because the fury of their indignation was excused before God, but because it
would else have been difficult to restrain the strong desire of vengeance
proceeding from the feelings of human
nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he should have
remained in the city of his refuge</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The period
of banishment is prescribed, "until the death of the high-priest," because it
would have been anything but humane that all hopes of restoration should have
been cut off from the unhappy exile; and, when a new priest succeeded to
reconcile the people to God, this renewal of grace was to propitiate all
offenses. Wherefore it was not unreasonable that God should entirely restore
those who were only punished for
inadvertency.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whoso killeth any
person</i></font><font face="Palatino">, He now returns to willful murderers,
whom he will not have spared, but yet not given over to punishment unless
convicted by legal proofs. Literally it is, Whoso smiteth a soul, at the mouth
of witnesses he shall slay him that slayeth: and this sentence is obscure, from
its brevity, unless a noun be supplied before the second verb; and this may be
understood either of the judges or the accuser. In the substance, however, there
is no ambiguity, viz., that no one should be condemned unless he be lawfully
convicted. Moreover, He declares that one witness would be insufficient,
inasmuch as it would be most unjust that a man's life should be at the mercy of
a single tongue. I have already adduced a similar
passage,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in which Moses gave instructions that no
capital causes was to be decided except at the mouth of two or three witnesses:
and, because such declarations are of general application, I have purposely
assigned to them a separate place. Now again, in referring to the condemnation
of murderers, he takes occasion to state that two witnesses are required, since
nothing is more likely to occur than that the innocent should be overwhelmed by
calumnies and perjury, if it depended on the testimony of any single individual.
But, when two are brought forward, it may be discovered in many ways, as has
been said, whether there is any falsehood; for, if examined separately, they
will scarcely accord in all particulars. But, whilst sure proof is required, in
order to the punishment of guilt, so, when the murder is proved, God sternly
requires, and commands that it should not remain unpunished. He expressly
forbids that the right of refuge should be purchasable, since it would else have
been in danger of being a shield for many crimes. When, therefore, He forbids a
satisfaction to be taken from any one, who would betake himself to a city of
refuge, His object is, that no one should enjoy this benefit, until his
innocence was fully established; lest the mercy, whereby the innocent were
succored, should be open to bribery.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So ye shall not pollute the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this concluding sentence, He again
reminds them that, unless they should exercise severe justice against murderers,
they would be guilty of sin against God; because the land stained with human
blood is polluted, and lying under His curse, until expiation has been made.
Again, since God dwells in the land of Canaan, having chosen His abode among the
children of Israel, his sanctity is also profaned. The sum is, that, in every
respect, care should be taken lest the land, which is sacred to God, should be
contaminated by bloodshed.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Lord thy God hath
cut off the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses repeats the same
precepts which we have just been considering, that, in regard to murders, the
people should distinguish between inadvertency and crime. With this view, he
assigns six cities, wherein those who have proved their innocence before the
judges should rest in peace and concealment. In one word, however, he defines
who is to be exempt from punishment, viz., he who has killed his neighbor
<i>ignorantly</i>, as we have previously seen; and this is just, because the
will is the sole source and cause of criminality, and therefore, where there is
no malicious feeling, there is no crime. But, lest under the pretext of
inadvertency those who are actually guilty should escape, a mark of distinction
is added, i.e., that no hatred should have preceded; and of this an instance is
given, if two friends should have gone out together into a wood, and, without
any quarrel or wrangling, the head of the axe should slip out of the hand of one
of them, and strike the other. God, therefore, justly commands that the motive
of the crime should be investigated, and shows how it is to be ascertained,
viz., if there had been any previous animosity, or if any contention should have
arisen. For it is incredible that any one should be so wicked as gratuitously to
rush into so abominable a sin. It must be observed, however, that there was no
room for this conjecture, except in a doubtful matter; for if any should stab
his neighbor with a drawn sword, or should hurl a dart into his bosom, the
inquiry would be superfluous, because the guilty intention would be abundantly
manifest.</font><br></div>

is alone referred to, it is sufficiently plain, from the principle laid down,
that believers are generally exhorted to chastity; for, if the Law be a perfect
rule of holy living, it would be more than absurd to give a license for
fornication, adultery alone being excepted. Furthermore, it is incontrovertible
that God will by no means approve or excuse before this tribunal, what the
common sense of mankind declares to be obscene; for, although lewdness has
everywhere been rampant in every age, still the opinion could never be utterly
extinguished, that fornication is a scandal and a sin. Unquestionably what Paul
teaches has been prevalently received from the beginning, that a good life
consists of three parts, soberness, righteousness, and godliness,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;560212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
2:12;) and the soberness which he commands differs not from chastity. Besides,
when Christ or the Apostles are treating of a perfect life, they always refer
believers to the Law; for, as it had been said of old by Moses, "This is the
way, walk ye in it;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Christ confirms this,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If thou wilt enter into

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
19:17;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and Paul corroborates it, "He that loveth another
hath fulfilled the Law,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:8,) whilst they constantly pronounce a curse against all fornicators. It is
not worth while to quote the particular passages in which they do so. Now, if
Christ and the Apostles, who are the best interpreters of the Law, declare that
God's Law is violated no less by fornication than by theft, we assuredly infer,
that in this Commandment the whole <i>genus</i> is comprehended under a single
<i>species</i>. Wherefore, those have done nothing but betray their disgraceful
ignorance, who have sought to be praised for their acuteness on the score of
their ridiculous subtlety, when they admitted that fornication is indeed
condemned with sufficient clearness and frequency in the New Testament, but not
in the Law. For, if they had reasoned justly, inasmuch as God is declared to
have blessed marriage, it must at once be concluded, on the contrary, that the
connection of male and female, except in marriage, is accursed. This is the
argument of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he contrasts two
opposite things;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Marriage (he says) is
honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God

13:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also, when God forbids the priest to marry a
harlot,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
21:14,) the manifest impropriety of fornication is declared; and, if it was
unlawful for the daughters of Israel to be harlots,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
23:17,) the same reasoning applies necessarily to males. Nor has Hosea taken
that reproof from anywhere else but the Law? "Whoredom and wine take away the
heart."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
4:11.) Thus, when the Prophets metaphorically condemn the corruptions of their
nation, they do not always use the same; word as Moses here does,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">pn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>naaph</i>, but compare them to fornications, whereas, if fornication were
lawful in itself, this metaphor would be altogether inappropriate. Hosea was
commanded to take a harlot for a wife,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
1:2;) no mention is made of adultery, and still the shame and baseness of the
people is thus condemned. Who, then, would say that fornication is free from
sin, since God brands it with no ordinary mark of ignominy? But if any should
pertinaciously contest this, let him accuse Paul of error, who bears witness
that an example is set before us in the Law, that we should. not "commit
fornication as some of them committed, and fell in one day three-and-twenty
thousand."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
25:9;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:8.) Surely, if they had not transgressed the Law, so horrible a
vengeance would not have overwhelmed them. If any should object that the crime
of idolatry was mixed up with it., still the declaration of Paul remains
untouched, that God was the avenger of fornication in this infliction of
punishment, which would not accord, unless it were a transgression of the Law.
And in truth, where, as recorded by Luke,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:20,) the Apostles in their decree prohibit fornication amongst the Gentiles,
the reason is at the same time added, that "Moses is read in the synagogues."
Now, if it were not a vice opposed to the Law, no offense would have hence
arisen.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have already explained why, under
this word adultery, every impure lust was condemned. We know how unbridled was
the licentiousness of the Gentiles; for, although God never suffered all shame
to be extinguished together with their purity, still respect for what was right
was in a manner stifled, so that they evaded the grossness of the sin by
ribaldry and scurrilous jests. At any rate, the doctrine of Paul was by no means
understood, that those who indulge in whoredom "sin against their own body."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:18.) </font><br><font face="Palatino">Since, then, the minds of
all men were stupified by indulgence, it was needful to arouse them by declaring
the atrocity of the sin, that they might learn to beware of all pollution. Nor
are unbridled lusts only here condemned, but God instructs His people to cherish
modesty and chastity. The sum is, that those who desire to approve themselves to
God, should be pure "from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

the law, as he elsewhere
exhorts,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"that everyone should
possess his vessel in sanctification and honor; not in the lust of
concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God."

nature itself. In order that all impurity may be the more detestable, He
enumerates two species of unnatural lust, from whence it is evident that when
men indulge themselves in this respect, they are carried away by an impulse,
which is more than beastly, to defile themselves by shameful wickedness. The
beasts are satisfied with natural connection; it is therefore a gross enormity
that this distinction should be confounded by man endowed with reason; for what
is the use of our judgment and intelligent faculties if it be not that greater
self-restraint should exist in us than in the brute animals? It is plain,
therefore, that they must be blinded in a horrible manner who so shamefully
defile themselves, as Paul says.

1:28.) The madness of lust has, however, invented several monstrous vices, whose
names it would be better to bury, if God had not chosen that these shameful
monuments should exist, to inspire us with fear and horror. It has at length
advanced to such excesses, that men created in God's image, both male and

f62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> says, that good laws have sprung from
evil habits; and God reminds us that for this reason He has been induced
expressly to advert to these disgusting and wicked things; for the monstrosities
which He mentions would have been concealed in eternal silence had not necessity
compelled Him to bring them to light. But since the Canaanitish nations had
advanced to such a pitch of licentiousness, that the prodigious sins, which else
would have been better concealed, had been but too familiarly known from their
wicked habits, God warns His people to beware of their fatal examples. First,
when He says that these abominations prevailed amongst the Gentiles, He
indicates that evil habits by no means avail as an excuse; nay, that public
consent is in vain alleged in defense of vice. But the better to deter them from
imitating them, He sets before their eyes the vengeance He is about to take. It
is true, indeed, that the nations of Canaan were destroyed for other reasons,
but it is not without cause that He sets forth this amongst the rest, for
undoubtedly God was offended by such
pollutions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall therefore keep my

the abominations of the Gentiles. The exhibition of His severity, which He had
referred to, might indeed have sufficed for the instruction of His people; but
in order to influence them more strongly, He at the same time adduces the way
pointed out to them in the Law, which would not suffer them to go astray, if
only they refused not to follow God. For that the Gentiles, who were destitute
of light, should have been drawn aside in every direction was not surprising;
but whilst they thus proved their blindness, it behooved true believers, on the
contrary, to testify that they were not children of darkness, but of light. And
to this Paul seems to allude, when he exhorts believers not to walk, like the
Gentiles, "in the vanity of their mind."

but also His ordinances (<i>custodias</i>,) because He had omitted nothing in
the Law which would be useful for the direction of men's lives. The sum is, that
unless they order themselves constantly by the doctrine which enlightens them,
the same destruction awaited them also which was about to overwhelm the

Supplement, whereby it appears how greatly God abominates adultery, since He
denounces capital punishment against it. And assuredly, since marriage is a
covenant consecrated by God, its profanation is in no wise tolerable; and
conjugal faith should be held too sacred to be violated with impunity, whilst it
is an act of horrible perfidiousness to snatch from a man's bosom the wife who
is as his very life, or at any rate half of himself. Wherefore, also, the
Prophet ignominiously compares adulterers to neighing horses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
5:8;) for where such lasciviousness prevails, men degenerate, as it were, into
beasts. Another reason is, however, here referred to; for, if a man had broken
faith with his wife by having connection with a harlot, it was not a capital
offense; but if any man, though a bachelor, had committed adultery with the wife
of another, (he was to
die,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f68

injured, and the dishonor descends to the offspring, and all adulterine race is
substituted in place of the legitimate one, whilst the inheritance is
transferred to strangers, and thus bastards unlawfully possess themselves of the
family name. This cause impelled the Gentiles, even before the Law, to punish
adultery with severity, as clearly appears from the history of Judah and Tamar.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
38:14.) Nay, by the universal law of the Gentiles, the punishment of death was
always awarded to adultery; wherefore it is all the baser and more shameful in
Christians not to imitate at least the heathen. Adultery is punished no less
severely by the Julian
law</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> than by that of God; whilst those who
boast themselves of the Christian name are so tender and remiss, that they visit
this execrable offense with a very light reproof. And lest they should abrogate

the woman taken in adultery, whereas she ought to have been stoned; just as He
withdrew Himself into a mountain that He might not be made a king by the
multitude.

now extended further, and a betrothed woman is counted as a wife; and this for a
very good reason, because she has plighted her troth, and it is a token of
abandoned incontinency for the mind of a woman to be so alienated from the man
to whom she is betrothed, as to prostitute her virginity to another's embraces.
But since one who has been ravished is not criminal, a woman is absolved if she
be forced in a field, because it is probable that she yielded unwillingly,
inasmuch as she was far from assistance. Although, however, the terms are
accommodated to the comprehension of a rude people, it was the intention of God
to distinguish force from consent. Thus if a girl had been forced in a retired
part of a building, from whence her cries could not be heard, God would
undoubtedly have her acquitted, provided she could prove her innocence by

only provision is here made that the poor girls should not suffer infamy and
injury from their repudiation. But, although God is gracious in remitting the
punishment, still He shows that chastity is pleasing to Him, as far as the
people's hardness of heart permitted. First of all, He does not allow a master
to seduce his purchased maid-servant, but if he wishes to enjoy her embraces, a
marriage must take place; for although He does not set this out in express
terms, still we may infer from what He condemns, that the contrary is what He
approves. From whence, too, their notion is refuted who suppose that fornication
was lawful under the Law. But the words must be more closely examined on account
of their ambiguity. First, the sex is treated with consideration, that the
condition of a female may be somewhat more favorable than that of a male; since,
otherwise, their weakness would render young women subject to injury and shame.

his bond-maid, whom he has loved and destined to be his wife, he must give her
her liberty; for although literally it is, "he shall cause her to be redeemed,"
yet; the context shows that the obligation of setting her free is laid upon him;
nor is this contradicted by the fact that he is only deprived of the power of
selling her to a strange people; since I do not understand this as applying to
foreigners only, but to others of his own nation, since sometimes those of
another tribe or family are called strangers. For, even though there were no
marriage-compact, it was not otherwise lawful to sell slaves of the holy and
elect people to foreigners. Besides, amongst the Israelites, slavery was only
temporary. But, to pass by everything else, let it suffice to observe the
absurdity that a master should hold his wife as a slave to be sold at pleasure,
if their opinion is received who suppose that the words refer to repudiation
after betrothal.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I myself rather approve of the other
opinion, that, although the master shall not have aspired to matrimony with her,
if her appearance displeases him so that he would be unwilling to have her as
his wife, at least he must provide for her redemption; because her chastity
would be in jeopardy if she remained with him unmarried; unless perhaps Moses
may signify that, after she had been seduced, her master did not honor her with
marriage. But the other view which I have just expressed is more simple; and a
caution is given lest masters should seduce their maid-servants at their
pleasure. Thus the word
<i>despise</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> does not refer to repudiation, but is
opposed to beauty, or conjugal love.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The next
case is, that if he should betroth her to his son, (he must give her a
dowry,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f77
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) in which, also, her modesty and honor is
consulted, lest she should be oppressed by the right of ownership, and become a
harlot. In the third place, it is provided that, if she should be repudiated,
her condition should not be disadvantageous. If, therefore, he would make her
his daughter-in-law, and betroth her to his son, he is commanded to deal
liberally with her; for "after the manner of daughters" is equivalent to giving
her a dowry, or, at any rate, to treating her as if she were free. Finally, he
adds that, if he should choose another wife for his son, he should not reject
the former one, nor defraud her of her food and raiment, or of some third thing,
concerning which translators are not well agreed. Some render it <i>time</i>,
but I do not see what is the meaning of <i>diminishing</i> <i>her</i>
<i>time</i>; others, <i>duty</i> <i>of</i> <i>marriage</i>, but this is too free
a translation; others, more correctly, <i>affliction</i>, since the girl would
be humiliated by her repudiation; still, to diminish affliction, is too harsh an
expression for to compensate an injury. Let my readers, then, consider whether
the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">htn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnonathah</i>, is not used for <i>compact</i> or <i>agreement</i>; for thus
the context will run very well: If his son have married another wife, that the
girl who has suffered ignominious rejection should obtain her rights as to food,
and raiment, and her appointed dowry; otherwise, God commands that she should be
set free gratuitously, in order that her liberty may compensate for the wrong
she has received.</font><br></div>

become prostitutes; and thus the land should be defiled by whoredom. The remedy
is, that lie who has corrupted girl should be compelled to marry her, and also
to give tie a dowry from his own property, lest, if he should afterwards cast
her off, she should go away from her bed penniless. But, if the marriage should
not please her father, the penalty imposed on her seducer is, that he should

immunity here given has for its object the awakening of that mutual love which
may preserve the conjugal fidelity of husband and wife; for there is danger
lest, if a husband departs from his wife immediately after marriage, the bride,
before she has become thoroughly accustomed to him, should be too prone to fall
in love with some one else. A similar danger affects the husband; for in war,
and other expeditions, many things occur which tempt men to sin. God, therefore,
would have the love of husband and wife fostered by their association for a
whole year, that thus mutual confidence may be established between them, and
they may afterwards continually beware of all
incontinency.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But that God should permit a bride
to enjoy herself with her husband, affords no trifling proof of His indulgence.
Assuredly, it cannot be but that the lust of the flesh must affect the
connection of husband and wife with some amount of sin; yet God not only pardons
it, but covers it with the veil of holy matrimony, lest that which is sinful in
itself should be so imputed; nay, He spontaneously allows them to enjoy
themselves. With this injunction corresponds what Paul
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Let the husband render unto
his wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. Defraud
ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spoke unto
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although this ceremony appears to be
part of the legal services, still I have thought fit to postpone it to this
place, because it relates to the observance of the Seventh Commandment. The
object of it is, lest women, trusting that they would escape punishment, should
abandon themselves to unchastity, or lest jealousy should lead to dissension,
and, by alienating the mind of the husband from the wife, should loosen the ties
of pure affection, since thus the door would be open to many iniquities. By this
rite, therefore, God proclaims Himself the guardian and avenger of conjugal
fidelity; and hence it appears how acceptable a sacrifice in His sight is the
chastity of married women, of which He condescends to profess Himself the
guardian. It is, therefore, no trifling consolation to husbands, that God
undertakes the cognizance of the secret wrong, if, perchance, their wives have
dealt treacherously with them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it will be
better to examine the details in order. When at the outset he says, &#8212; If a
man's wife go aside, and her offense be concealed, an absurdity appears to be
implied; as if He would thus bring to judgment none but those who should be
convicted, whereas, if the fact were established, there would be no use in the
application of the test. But the condition, "if she commit a trespass against
him," does not signify that the woman's adultery should be discovered, but
refers to the opinion of her husband; and thus the words must be paraphrased in
this way: If any one should think that his wife has had connection with another
man, and he cannot otherwise be relieved from the anxiety which oppresses him,
let him appeal to God for that judgment, which is beyond the reach of man. Still
God</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f78
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">seems designedly to have expressed the crime,
lest husbands should heedlessly involve their innocent wives in disgrace. We
know that many are causelessly suspicious; and when jealousy has once taken
possession of the mind, there is no room for moderation or
equity.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Wherefore it would be inhuman to permit
morose and unreasonable husbands to drag their wives to this horrible judgment
of God on account of certain trifling suspicions. For, if the husband were cruel
and ungodly, it would be like putting a sword into the hands of a madman, to
give him such a power without any distinction. God, therefore, implies that the
priest should carefully consider, so as not too easily to <i>receive</i> every
complaint; although He afterwards more clearly expresses Himself in another part
of the conditions, "if a man be jealous of his wife, and she be not
defiled."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall the man bring his
wife to the priest</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This offering is different
from the rest, which have been heretofore mentioned, because it is a kind of
<i>adjuration</i>, whereby the woman exposes herself to be accursed. Pure meal
without frankincense or oil is therefore offered, since the
rite</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of expiation would not be in accordance
with the curse. That the woman may be more afraid of perjuring herself, she is
presented before God, with her head uncovered too, as if the priest would drag
her from her lurking-place; for it seems incongruous that, as some suppose, the
veil was removed from her head in token of her infamy, since thus she would have
been condemned before her case was heard. She is, then, brought before God's
face with her head bare, that she may be seriously alarmed; and then follows the
mode of absolution or condemnation. The priest is commanded to take holy water
in an earthen vessel, to throw in some dust from the floor, and then a book or
scroll, on which were written the words of the curse, so that the blots should
remain in the water, and so to give the cup to the woman. Some interpret the
holy water to be that which was kept ill the brazen laver, to be always ready
for the ablution of those engaged in duly offering sacrifices. Let my readers,
however, consider whether he does not rather mean the water in which the ashes
of the red heifer were sprinkled, and whereby solemn purifications were made,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
19:1,) as we have already seen. For thus the woman was admonished that, if she
perjured herself, no further means of expiation remained. The dust collected
from the floor was also a sign of detestation: in short, the whole proceedings
were calculated to humble her, so that she might not double her offense by
perjury. Besides, the priest is commanded to repeat the words of the curse, lest
she should seek to escape by some subterfuge or other. The question, however,
arises, why she should be compelled to imprecate evil upon herself rather than
others were who were suspected of murder or other atrocious crimes? and I think
it was for this reason, because no other offense can be so easily concealed.
Lest, therefore, women should grow hardened from their cunning and evil arts, a
remedy is provided against their various deceptions; and thus God shows that the
marriage-bed is under His protection and safeguard. We must remember, too, that
this was not a mere empty bugbear, inasmuch as God undoubtedly appeared as the
open avenger of unfaithfulness, according to His declaration. Nor is the threat
added in vain, that if the woman be a deceiver, she should be a curse among the
people, because her belly should swell and her thigh dissolve; whilst, on the
other hand, He does not promise in vain, that if she be innocent, she should not
only be free, but prolific also; so that God's blessing would be the seal of her
absolution. For this is the meaning of the expression, "she shall be sown with
seed;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as, on the contrary, it was said that her
thigh</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should dissolve when she wasted away with
barrenness. We infer, from the opposite effects of the same water, that by the
outward symbol God wrought with His <i>secret</i> power as the occasion
demanded.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man take a
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This passage also tends to the exaltation
of chastity. God provides against both cases, lest a husband should unjustly
bring reproach upon a chaste and innocent young woman, and lest a young woman,
having been defiled, should escape punishment, if she pretended to be a virgin.
A third object is also to be remarked, viz., that parents were thus admonished
to be more careful in watching over their children. This is, indeed, an act of
gross brutality, that a husband, wittingly and willingly, should seek a false
pretext for divorcing his wife by bringing reproach and infamy upon her; but,
since it does not infrequently happen that the libidinous become disgusted with
their vices, and then endeavor to rid themselves of them in every way, it was
needful to correct this evil, and to prescribe a method whereby the integrity of
the woman should be safe from the calumnies of an ungodly and cruel husband;
whilst it was also just to give relief to an honest man, lest he should be
compelled to cherish in his bosom a harlot, by whom he had been deceived; for it
is a very bitter thing to ingenuous minds silently to endure so great an
ignominy. An admirable precaution is here laid down, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that if
a woman were accused by her husband, it was in the power of her parents to
produce the tokens of chastity which should acquit her; but if they did not,
that the husband should not be obliged against his will to keep her in his
house, after she had been defiled by another. It is plain from this passage,
that the tokens of virginity were taken on a cloth, on the first night of
marriage, as future proofs of chastity. It is also probable that the cloth was
laid up before witnesses as a pledge, to be a sure defense for pure and modest
young women; for it would have been giving too much scope to the parents if it
had been believed simply on their evidence; but Moses speaks briefly as of a

received a threefold punishment; first, that he, who had invented the false
accusation, should be beaten with stripes; secondly, that he should pay an
hundred pieces of silver to the father of the girl; thirdly, that he should
never be allowed to put her away; and tie reason is given, "because he hath
brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel." God here shows Himself to be
the protector of virgins, that young women may be the more encouraged to
cultivate chastity. If any should object that it was a bad provision for the
unhappy woman that she should be subjected for ever to tyrannical rule, I reply,
that this was done because there was no means for her release; for although, as
we shall presently see, men were permitted to obtain a divorce from their wives,
still it was neither just nor right to overthrow God's earliest institution.
Besides, it was necessary to obviate the trick of the husband who would have
gloried in her divorce, as having gained what he
desired.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.

to be somewhat too severe, let him reflect that no kind of fraud is more
intolerable. A false sale of a field or a house shall be accounted a crime, as
also the utterance of false money; and, therefore, she who abuses the sacred
name of marriage for deception, and offers an unchaste body instead of a chaste
one, much less deserves to be pardoned. The cause of severity, however, which is
expressly mentioned, is much more extensive, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., because she

<div><font face="Palatino">Although what relates to divorce was granted in
indulgence to the Jews, yet Christ pronounces that it was never in accordance
with the Law, because it is directly repugnant to the first institution of God,
from whence a perpetual and inviolable rule is to be sought. It is proverbially
said that the laws of nature are indissoluble; and God has declared once for
all, that the bond of union between husband and wife is closer than that of
parent and child; wherefore, if a son cannot shake off the paternal yoke, no
cause can permit the dissolution of the connection which a man has with his
wife. Hence it appears how great was the perverseness of that nation, which
could not be restrained from dissolving a most sacred and inviolable tie.
Meanwhile the Jews improperly concluded from their impunity that that was
lawful, which God did not punish because of the hardness of their hearts;
whereas they ought rather to have <i>considered</i>, agreeably to the answer of
Christ, that man is not at liberty to separate those whom God hath joined
together.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:6.) Still, God chose to make a provision for women who were cruelly
oppressed, and for whom it was better that they should at once be set free, than
that they should groan beneath a cruel tyranny during their whole lives. Thus,
in Malachi, divorce is preferred to polygamy, since it would be a more tolerable
condition to be divorced than to bear with a harlot and a rival.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:14.) And undoubtedly the bill or scroll of divorce, whilst it cleared the
woman from all disgrace, cast some reproach on the husband; for he who confesses
that he puts away his wife, because she does not please him, brings himself
under the accusation both of moroseness and inconstancy. For what gross levity
and disgraceful inconstancy it shows, that a husband should be so offended with
some imperfection or disease in his wife, as to east away from him half of
himself! We see, then, that husbands were indirectly condemned by the writing of
divorce, since they thus committed an injury against their wives who were
chaste, and in other respects what they should be. On these grounds, God in
Isaiah, in order that He might take away from the Jews all subject of complaint,
bids them produce the bill of divorce, if He had given any to their mother,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:1;) as much as to say, that His cause for rejecting them was just, because
they had treacherously revolted to
ungodliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some interpreters do not read these
three verses continuously, but suppose the sense to be complete at the end of
the first, wherein the husband testifies that he divorces his wife for no
offense, but because her beauty does not satisfy his lust. If, however, we give
more close attention, we shall see that it is only one provision of the Law,
viz., that when a man has divorced his wife, it is not lawful for him to marry
her again if she have married another. The reason of the law is, that, by
prostituting his wife, he would be, as far as in him lay, acting like a
procurer. In this view, it is said that she was defiled, because he had
contaminated her body, for the liberty which he gave her could not abolish the
first institution of God, but rather, as Christ teaches, gave cause for
adultery.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400531&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

to so disgraceful an act, it is plain that there are no remains of modesty in
them. God, therefore, does not only regard the offense itself, but the brutal
impulse of lust, whereby men are so carried away as to degenerate from the very
feelings of nature. For what wickedness would he abstain from who yields to such
impurity, that he breaks through an obstacle in his fury which restrains the

also danger of contagion; but God rather chooses here to be an instructor in
decency to His people, than to perform the office of a physician. It must be
remembered, therefore, that men are warned against all indelicacy, which is
abhorrent to the natural sense; and, by <i>synecdoche</i>, married persons are
exhorted to restrain themselves from all immodest lasciviousness, and that the

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spoke unto
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have not introduced this declaration
amongst other similar ones, which had for their object the preparation of their
minds for the reverent reception of the Law, because, whatever conformity there
may be in the words themselves, in their substance there is a great difference;
for they were general, whereas this is specially confined to a single point. For
it was not God's intention here merely to exhort the people to the study of the
Law, but the address respecting the keeping of His statutes is directed to the
present cause, since He does not refer indifferently to all the statutes of
Himself and of the Gentiles, but restricts Himself to the subject-matter, as it
is called; and thus, by the statutes of the Gentiles, He means those corruptions
whereby they had perverted His pure institution as to holy matrimony. First,
however, tie forbids them from following the customs of the Egyptians, and then
includes all the Canaanitish nations. For, since all the Orientals are
libidinous, they never had any scruple in polluting themselves by incestuous
marriages; whilst it is abundantly proved by history, how great were the
excesses of the
Egyptians</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in this respect. A brother had no
abhorrence against marrying his uterine sister, nor a paternal or maternal uncle
his niece; in a word, they were so dead to. shame that they were carried away by
their lusts to trample upon all the laws of nature. This is the reason why God
here enumerates the kinds of incest of which the mention would else have been
superfluous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall therefore keep my
statutes and my judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because it is no
less difficult to correct vices, to which men have been long accustomed, than to
cure diseases of long standing, especially because people in general so
pertinaciously cleave to bad examples, God adduces His statutes, in order to
recall the people from the errors of their evil habits into the right way. For
nothing is more absurd than for us to fix our minds on the actions of men, and
not on God's word, in which is to be found the rule of a holy life. It is,
therefore, just as if God would overthrow whatever had been received from long
custom, and abolish the universal consent of the world by the authority of His
doctrine. With this object He commands His Law to be regarded not once only, as
we have already seen, lest the Israelites should abandon themselves to filthy
lusts; but He diligently inculcates upon them, that they should turn away from
all abuses, and keep themselves within the bounds and ordinances of His Law. And
to this refers the expression, "I am the Lord your God;" containing a comparison
between Himself and the heathen nations, between whom and His people He had
interposed, as it were, a wall of
partition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>None of you shall approach to
any that is near</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This name does not include
all female relations; for cousin-ger-mans of the father's or mother's side are
permitted to intermarry; but it must be restricted to the degrees, which He
proceeds to enumerate, and is merely a brief preface, declaring that there are
certain degrees of relationship which render marriages incestuous. We may,
therefore, define these female relations of blood to be those which are spoken
of immediately afterwards, viz., that a son should not marry his mother, nor a
son-in-law his mother-in-law; nor a paternal or maternal uncle his niece, nor a
grandfather his granddaughter, nor a brother his sister, nor a nephew his
paternal or maternal aunt, or his uncle's wife, nor a father-in-law his
daughter-in-law, nor a brother-in-law his brother's wife, nor a step-father his
stepdaughter. The Roman laws accord with the rule prescribed by God, as if their
authors had learnt from Moses what was decorous and agreeable to nature. The
phrase which God uses frequently "to uncover the turpitude," is intended to
awaken abhorrence, in order that the Israelites may beware more diligently of
all incest. The Hebrew word, indeed,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnervah</i>, signifies <i>nakedness</i>, therefore some translate it
actively, "the nakedness of thy father," <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., the womb which thy
father hath uncovered; but this meaning would not be suitable to the nakedness
of thy daughter, or thy daughter-in-law, or thy sister. Consequently, there is
no doubt but that Moses means to denote that it is a filthy and shameful
thing.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must remember, what I have already
hinted, that not only are incestuous connections out of wedlock condemned, but
that the degrees are pointed out, within which marriages are unlawful. It is
true, indeed, that this was a part of the political constitution which God
established for His ancient people; still, it must be borne in mind, that
whatever is prescribed here is deduced from the source of rectitude itself, and
from the natural feelings implanted in us by Him. Absurd is the cleverness which
some persons but little versed in Scripture pretend
to,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who assert that the Law being abrogated,
the obligations under which Moses laid his countrymen are now dissolved; for it
is to be inferred from the preface above expounded, that. the instruction here
given is not, nor ought to be accounted, merely political. For, since their
lusts had led astray all the neighboring nations into incest, God, in order to
inculcate chastity amongst his people, says; "I am the Lord your God, ye shall
therefore keep my statutes; walk not after the doings of the land of Egypt and
of Canaan;" and then He adds what are the degrees of consanguinity and affinity
within which the marriage of men and women is forbidden. If any again object
that what has been disobeyed in many countries is not to be accounted the law of
the Gentiles, the reply is easy, viz., that the barbarism, which prevailed in
the East, does not nullify that chastity which is opposed to the abominations of
the Gentiles; since what is natural cannot be abrogated by any consent or
custom. In short, the prohibition of incests here set forth, is by no means of
the number of those laws which are commonly abrogated according to the
circumstances of time and place, since it flows from the fountain of nature
itself, and is founded on the general principle of all laws, which is perpetual
and inviolable. Certainly God declares that the custom which had prevailed
amongst the heathen was displeasing to Him; and why is this, but because nature
itself repudiates and abhors filthiness, although approved of by the consent
(<i>suffragiis</i>) of men? Wherefore, when God would by this distinction
separate His chosen people from heathen nations, we may assuredly conclude that
the incests which He commands them to avoid are absolute pollutions. Paul, on a
very trifling point, sets before our <i>eyes</i> the law of nature; for, when he
teaches that it is shameful and indecorous for women to appear in public without
veils, he desires them to consider, whether it would be decent for them to
present themselves publicly with their heads shorn; and finally adds, that
nature itself does not permit it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:14.) Wherefore, I do not see, that, under the pretext of its
being a political Law,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the purity of nature is to be abolished,
from whence arises the distinction between the statutes of God, and the abuses
of the Gentiles. If this discipline were founded on the utility of a single
people, or on the custom of a particular time, or on present necessity, or on
any other circumstances, the laws deduced from it might be abrogated for new
reasons, or their observance might be dispensed with in regard to particular
persons, by special privilege; but since, in their enactment, the perpetual
decency of nature was alone regarded, not even a dispensation of them would be
permissible. It may indeed be decreed that it should be lawful and unpunished,
since it is in the power of princes to remit penalties; yet no legislator can
effect that a thing, which nature pronounces to be vicious, should not be
vicious; and, if tyrannical arrogance dares to attempt it, the light of nature
will presently shine forth and prevail. When, formerly, the Emperor Claudius had
married his niece
Agrippina,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the purpose of averting the shame, he
procured a <i>Senatusconsultum</i>, which licensed such marriages; yet no one
was found to imitate his example, except one freedman. Hence, just and
reasonable men will acknowledge that, even amongst heathen nations, this Law was
accounted indissoluble, as if implanted and engraved on the hearts of men. On
this ground Paul, more severely to reprove the incest of a step-son with his
father's wife, says, that such an occurrence "is not so much as named among the
Gentiles."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:1.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be objected that such
marriages are not prohibited to us in the New Testament, I reply, that the
marriage of a father with his daughter is not forbidden; nor is a mother
prohibited from marrying her son; and shall it therefore be lawful for those,
who are near of kin, to form promiscuous
connections?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although Paul expressly mentions only one
kind of incest, yet he establishes its disgrace by adducing the example of the
Gentiles, that at least we should be ashamed if more delicacy and chastity is
seen amongst them. And:. in fact, another admonition of the same Paul is enough
for me, who thus writes to the
Philippians:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Whatsoever things are
true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good

<div><font face="Palatino">In the collateral line, the uncles on both sides
represent the father, and the aunts the mother; and, consequently, connection
with them is forbidden, inasmuch as it would be of somewhat similar impropriety.
The same rule affects affinity; for the step-mother, or mother-in-law, is held
to stand in the relation of mother; and the step-daughter, or daughter-in-law,
in that of daughter; as also the wife of the paternal or maternal uncle is to be
regarded in the relation of mother. And, although express mention may not be
made of it here, we must form our judgment by analogy as to what is prohibited;
&#8212; the uncle on the father's or mother's side is not here forbidden to
marry his niece; but, since the nephew is interdicted from marrying his paternal
or maternal aunt, the mutual relation of the inferior to the superior degree
must prevail. But if any should contend that there is a difference, the reason
added by Moses refutes his objection, for it is said, "She is thy father's or
thy mother's near kinswoman." Hence it follows, that a niece is guilty of incest
if she marries her uncle on either side. As to brothers and sisters, God
pronounces that marriage with a sister, although she be not uterine, is
unlawful; for He forbids the uncovering of the turpitude of a sister, who is
either the daughter of thy father or thy
mother.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.

f92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> interpreters who raise a controversy on
this passage, and expound it, that a brother's wife must not be taken from his
bed, or, if she be divorced, that manage with her would be unlawful whilst her
husband was still alive; for it is incongruous to twist into different senses
declarations which are made in the same place, and in the same words. God
forbids the uncovering of the turpitude of the wife of a father, an uncle, and a
son; and when He lays down the same rule respecting a brother's wife in the very
same words, it is absurd to invent a different meaning for them. If, therefore,
it be not lawful to marry the wife of a father, a son, an uncle, or a nephew, we
must. hold precisely the same opinion with respect to a brother's wife,
concerning whom an exactly similar law is enacted in the same passage and
context. I am not, however, ignorant of the source from whence those, who think
otherwise, have derived their mistake; for, whereas God gives a command in
another place, that if a man shall have died without issue, his surviving
brother shall take his widow to wife, in order that he may raise up of her seed
to the departed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
25:5,) they have incorrectly and ignorantly restricted this to own-brothers,
although God rather designates other degrees of relationship. It is a well-known
Hebrew idiom, to embrace under the name of brother all near kinsmen in general;
and the Latins also formerly so denominated
cousins-german.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The law, then, now before us, respecting
marriage with a deceased brother's wife, is only addressed to those relations
who are not otherwise prohibited from such a marriage, since it was not God's
purpose to prevent the loss of a deceased person's name by permitting those
incestuous marriages, which tie had elsewhere condemned. Wherefore these two
points agree perfectly well, that an own-brother was prohibited from marrying
his brother's widow, whilst the next of kin were obliged to raise up seed for
the dead, by the right of their relationship, wherever their marriage was
otherwise permissible by the enactment's of the law. On this ground Boaz married
Ruth, who had previously been married to his near kinsman; and it is abundantly
clear from the history, that the law applied to all the near kinsmen. But if any
still contend that own-brothers were included in the number of these, on the
same grounds the daughter-in-law must be married by her father-in-law, and the
nephew's wife by the uncle, and even the mother-in-law by the son-in-law, which
it is an abomination to speak of. If any object that Er, Onan, and Shelah, the
sons of Judah, were own-brothers, and still that Tamar married two of them, the
difficulty is easily solved, viz., that Judah, following the common and received
practice of the Gentiles, acted improperly in permitting it. It is plain enough,
from the histories of all ages, that there were disgusting and shameless
mixtures in the marriages of Oriental nations. By evil communications, then, as
is ever the case, Judah was led into giving the same wife to his second son as
had before been married to the eldest. And, in fact, God expressly says that
this offense was rife among the Gentiles, where tie condemns incestuous
connections. This, therefore, I still hold to be unquestionable, that, by the
law of Moses, marriage with the widow of an own-brother is
forbidden.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither shalt thou take a
wife to her sister</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this passage certain
froward persons pretend that it is permitted, if a man has lost his wife, to
marry her own sister, because the restriction is added, not to take the one in
the lifetime of the other. From whence they infer, that it is not forbidden that
she should succeed in the place of the deceased. But they ought to have
considered the intention of the legislator from his own express words, for
mention is made not only of incest and filthiness, but of the jealousy and
quarrels, which arise from hence. If it had merely been said, "Thou shalt not
uncover her turpitude," there would have been some color to their pretext, that
the husband being a widower, he would be free to marry his wife's sister; but,
when a different object for the law is expressly stated, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,
lest she, who was legally married, should be troubled by quarrels and
contentions, it is plain that the license for polygamy is restricted by this
exception, in order that the Israelites should be contented with one evil, and,
at least, should not expose two sisters to hostile contention with each other.
The condition of the first wife was already painful enough, when she was
compelled to put up with a rival and a concubine; but it was more intolerable to
be constantly quarrelling with her near relative. The name of sister is not,
therefore, restricted, I think, to actual sisters, but other relations are
included in it, whose marriages would not otherwise have been incestuous. In a
word, it is not incest which is condemned, so much as the cruelty of a husband,
if he chose to contract a further marriage with the near kinswoman of his wife.
Nor can we come to any other conclusion from the words of Moses; for if the
turpitude of a brother is uncovered when his brother marries his widow, no less
is the turpitude of a sister uncovered when her sister marries her husband after
her decease. But hence we plainly see the diabolical arrogance of the Pope, who,
by inventing new degrees of kindred, would be wiser than God; whilst he also
betrays his cunning, because from this kind of sport he made himself a fat
game-bag.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since from long custom it is
established that cousins-german should not marry, we must beware of giving
scandal lest too unbridled a liberty should expose the Gospel to much reproach;
and we must bear in mind Paul's admonition, to abstain even from things lawful
when they are not expedient.

which he adds, "nor discover his father's skirt," is as much as to say, that the

<div><font face="Palatino">Nothing new occurs here, for the object of Moses was,
by the enactment of penalties, to sanction the instruction lately given. By
previously condemning incestuous marriages, he would cite the Israelites before
God, in order that their consciences might abhor the crime, although he gave
them nothing to fear from earthly judges; whereas now he alarms them by the
dread of punishment, in case any should indulge themselves with too great
security. He does not chastise the incestuous with rods, as if they were only
guilty of a light offense; but he pronounces it to be a capital crime, if any
had sinned against the law of nature; and first he condemns the step-mother and
step-son to death, if they should have had connection with each other; he then
makes the same decree with reference to the father-in-law and daughter-in-law;
and, thirdly, the step-father and step-daughter. But when, if a man cohabits at
the same time with a mother and her daughter, he extends the punishment to the
mother also, it must be understood, provided she also consents to the abominable
medley; for, if a man, against the mother's will, seduces her daughter, and the
mother is unable to resist it if she would, she is free from guilt. The same
punishment is awarded to brother and sister, and nephew and aunt, and it is
extended also to affinity; if any should cohabit with the wife of his uncle or
his brother. We have elsewhere explained the meaning of the expression, "their
blood shall be upon them;" <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that the cause of their death is
to be imputed to none but the gross criminals themselves, lest their judges,
under the cloak of humanity, should shrink from being severe, since it often
happens that those who do not sufficiently weigh the atrocity of the evil, are
led away by an empty show of
clemency.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Moreover, Moses indirectly hints that if
the guilty be pardoned, vengeance will be thus provoked against the whole
people, since iniquity is fostered by impunity, until it bursts out like a
deluge. The penalty of childlessness corresponds with the crime, for it is just
that those should be exterminated in barrenness from the world, who have
endeavored to corrupt the holy race of Abraham with their adulterous
seed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall therefore keep all

Israelites, for the third time, not to imitate the Gentiles, and exhorts them to
keep themselves within the limits of the Law. I have already pointed out that
this was not done without reason, since otherwise they might have easily fallen
away into the approval of their evil habits. Moreover, lest they should shake
off God's yoke, after He has said that the nations of Canaan were destroyed on
account of similar abominations, He adds, that they were made the inheritors of
the land on condition that they should separate themselves from heathen
nations.</font><br></div>

crime thus heavily punished, for a woman to take hold of the private parts of a
man who was not her husband, much less would God have her lasciviousness
pardoned, if a woman were impelled by lust to do anything of the sort. Neither
can we doubt but that the judges, in punishing obscenity, were bound to argue
from the less to the greater. A threat is also added, lest the severity of the
punishment should influence their minds to be tender and remiss ill inflicting
it. It was indeed inexcusable effrontery, willfully to assail that part of the

abused this, if it had been allowed, as an incentive to licentiousness; for we
see that many rush into such excesses of lasciviousness, as to glory in their
shame. God, therefore, would have the flaps of their gowns thus drawn together
by ties or latchets, that not even by chance could those parts be uncovered,
which cannot be decently or modestly looked upon. But if divine provisions were
made even with respect to their garments, so that the elect people should
cultivate decency, and diligently guard against everything immodest, it is
abundantly clear that not only were adulteries condemned, but whatever is

importance; but as it is disgraceful for men to become effeminate, and also for
women to affect manliness in their dress and gestures, propriety and modesty are
prescribed, not only for decency's sake, but lest one kind of liberty should at

charity is the end of the Law, we must seek the definition of theft from thence.
This, then, is the rule of charity, that every one's rights should be safely
preserved, and that none should do to another what he would not have done to
himself. It follows, therefore, that not only are those thieves who secretly
steal the property of others, but those also who seek for gain from the loss of
others, accumulate wealth by unlawful practices, and are more devoted to their
private advantage than to equity. Thus, rapine is comprehended under the head of
theft, since there is no difference between a man's robbing his neighbor by
fraud or force. But, in order that God may the better withhold His people from
all fraudulent injustice, He uses the word theft, which all naturally abhor as
disgraceful. For we know under how many coverings men bury their misdeeds; and
not only so, but also how they convert them into praise by false pretexts. Craft
and low cunning is called prudence; and he is spoken of as provident and
circumspect who cleverly overreaches others, who takes in the simple, and
insidiously oppresses the poor. Since, therefore, the world boasts of vices as
if they were virtues, and thus all freely excuse themselves in sin, God wipes
away all this gloss, when tie pronounces all unjust means of gain to be so many
thefts. Nor let us be surprised that this decision should be given by the divine
tribunal, when the philosophers deliver nearly the same
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must bear in mind also, that an
affirmative precept, as it is called, is connected with the prohibition;
because, even if we abstain from all wrong-doing, we do not therefore satisfy
God, who has laid mankind under mutual obligation to each other, that they may
seek to benefit, care for, and succor their neighbors. Wherefore He undoubtedly
inculcates liberality and kindness, and the other duties, whereby human society
is maintained; and hence, in order that we may not be condemned as thieves by
God, we must endeavor, as far as possible, that every one should safely keep
what he possesses, and that our neighbor's advantage should be promoted no less
than our own.</font><br></div>

go without food. Consequently, if a rich man keeps a poor and wretched
individual, whose labor he has abused, in suspense, he deprives him as it were
of life, in depriving him of his daily food. The sum is, that humanity is so to
be cultivated that none should be oppressed, or suffer loss from default of
payment.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not oppress an
hired servant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This precept is akin to the
foregoing. Moses pronounces that he who has hired a poor person for wages
oppresses him unless he gives him immediate recompense for his labor; since the
two admonitions, "thou shalt; not; oppress," and "<i>thou</i> shalt give him his
hire," are to be read in connection with each other. Hence it follows, that if a
hireling suffers from want because we do not pay him what he has earned, we are
by our <i>very</i> delay alone convicted of unrighteousness. The reason is now
more clearly expressed, viz., because he sustains his life by his daily
labors.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f101
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Although, however, this provision only refers
to the poor, lest they should suffer hunger from the negligence or pride of the
rich, still humanity in general is enforced, lest, whilst the poor labor for our
profit, we should arrogantly abuse them as if they were our slaves, or should be
too illiberal and stingy towards them, since nothing can be more disgraceful
than that, when they are in our service, they should not at least have enough to
live upon frugally. Finally, Moses admonishes us that this tyranny on the part
of the rich shall not be unpunished, if they do not supply their workmen with
the means of subsistence, even although no account shall be rendered of it
before the tribunals of men. Hence we infer that this law is not political, but
altogether spiritual, and binding on our consciences before the judgment-seat of
God; for although the poor man may not sue us at law, Moses teaches us that it
is sufficient for him to appeal to the faithfulness of God. Wherefore, although
the earthly judge may absolve us a hundred times over, let us not therefore
think that we have escaped; since God will always require of us from heaven,
whatever may have been unjustly excused us on earth. The question, however, here
arises, whether, if he who has been oppressed should not cry out, the
criminality will cease in consequence of his silence; for the words of Moses
seem to imply this, when he says, that the rich will be guilty, <i>if</i> the
poor cry unto God and make complaint of their wrongs. The reply' is easy, that
Moses had no other intention than to over-. throw the vain confidence of the
despisers, whereby they arc, stimulated to greater audacity in sin, and are
hardened in iniquity. He says, therefore, that although, as far as men are
concerned, they may allow us to pillage and rob, still a more awful judgment is
to be dreaded; for God hears the complaints of the poor, who find no protector
or avenger on earth. And surely, the more patiently he who is despoiled shall
bear his wrong, the more ready will God be to undertake his cause; nor is there
any louder cry to Him than patient endurance. If, however, any should object
that the cry here spoken of is at variance with Christ's command, that we should
pray for our enemies, we answer at once, that God does not always approve of the
prayers which He nevertheless answers. The imprecation of Jotham, the son of
Gideon, took effect upon the Shechemites,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;070920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
9:20,) although it was plainly the offspring of immoderate anger. Besides, it
sometimes happens that the miserable, although they endure their injuries with
pious meekness, still cease not to lay their sorrows and their groans in the
bosom of God. Nor is this a slight consolation for the poor, that if no one on
earth relieves them because their condition is low and abject, still God will
hereafter take cognizance of their cause.</font><br></div>

the Supplements of the Commandment, but, since it is a confirmation of the
foregoing decree, it seemed fit to connect them; especially because its faithful
expositor, Paul, declares, that God had no other design in delivering it than
that the laborer should not be defrauded of his just hire,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

the ministers of the Gospel, he adduces it. in proof of his case. And, lest any
should object that there is a difference between oxen and men, he adds, that God
does not care for oxen, but that it was said for the sake of those that labor.
Meanwhile, we must bear in mind, that men are so instructed in equity, that they
are bound to exercise it even towards the brute animals; for well does Solomon
magnify the injustice, whereby our neighbor is injured, by the comparison; "A
righteous man regardeth the life of his beast."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs

that every one should be strict with himself as to the performance of his duty;
for, if we are bound to supply subsistence to brute animals, much less must we
wait for men to be importunate with us, in order that they may obtain their
due.</font><br></div>

sojourn with thee in your land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before I pass
on to the other iniquities, I have thought fit to introduce this precept,
wherein the people are commanded to cultivate equity towards all without
exception. Fob if no mention had been made of strangers, the Israelites would
have thought that, provided they had not injured any one of their own nation,
they had fully discharged their duty; but, when God recommends guests and
sojourners to them, just as if they had been their own kindred, they thence
understand that equity is to be cultivated constantly and towards all men. Nor
is it without cause that God interposes Himself and His protection, lest injury
should be done to strangers; for since they have no one who would submit to
ill-will in their defense, they are more exposed to the violence and various
oppressions of the ungodly, than as if they were under the shelter of domestic
securities. The same rule is to be observed towards widows and orphans; a woman,
on account of the weakness of her sex, is exposed to many evils, unless she
dwells under the shadow of a husband; and many plot against orphans, as if they
were their prey, because they have none to advise them. Since, then, they are
thus destitute of human aid, God interposes to assist them; and, if they are
unjustly oppressed, He declares that He will be their avenger. In the first
passage He includes widows and orphans together with strangers; in the latter He
enumerates strangers only; yet the substance is the same, viz., that all those
who are destitute and deprived of earthly succor, are under the guardianship and
protection of God, and preserved by His hand; and thus the audacity of those is
restrained, who trust that they may commit any wickedness with impunity,
provided no earthly being resists them. No iniquity, indeed, will be left
unavenged by God, but there is a special reason why He declares that strangers,
widows, and orphans are taken under His care; inasmuch as the more flagrant the
evil is, the greater need there is of an effectual remedy. He recommends
strangers to them on this ground, that the people, who had themselves been
sojourners in Egypt, being mindful of their ancient condition, ought to deal
more kindly to strangers; for although they were at last oppressed by cruel
tyranny, still they were bound to consider their entrance there, viz., that
poverty and hunger had driven their forefathers thither, and that <i>they</i>
had been received hospitably, when they were in need of aid from others. When He
threatens, that if the afflicted widows and orphans <i>cry</i> unto Him, their
cry shall be heard, He does not mean that He will not interfere, if they endure
their wrongs in silence; but He speaks in <i>accordance</i> with the ordinary
practice, that those who find no consolation elsewhere, are wont to appeal to
Him. Meanwhile, let us be sure that although those who are injured abstain from
complaining, yet God does not by any means forget His office, so as to overlook
their wrongs. Nay, there is nothing which incites Him more to inflict punishment
on the ungodly, than the endurance of His
servants.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The nature of the punishment is also
expressed; those who have afflicted widows and orphans shall perish by the
sword, so that their own widows and orphans may be exposed to the audacity,
violence, and knavery of the ungodly. Moreover, it must be observed that, in the
second passage, they are commanded to love strangers and foreigners as
themselves. Hence it appears that the name of neighbor is not confined to our
kindred, or such other persons with whom we are nearly connected, but extends to
the whole human race; as Christ shows in the person of the Samaritan, who had
compassion on an unknown man, and performed towards him the duties of humanity
neglected by a Jew, and even a Levite.

inasmuch as He has no regard to persons. By the word person is meant either
splendor, or obscurity, and outward appearance, as it is commonly called, as we

carried away by outward appearance, to hold the rich in honor, and the poor in
contempt; to favor the beautiful or the eloquent, and to despise the unseemly.

strict sense, this will be a special precept, that judges should faithfully do
justice to all, and not subvert just causes from favor or ill-will. But since
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mishpat</i>, often means rectitude, it will not be unsuitable to suppose that
all iniquities contrary to integrity are generally condemned; and that he
afterwards proceeds to particular cases, which he adverts to elsewhere, where he
enumerates the most injurious thefts of all, and such as involve the grossest
violation of public justice. For the corruption which tends to the subversion of
judgments, or, by undermining rectitude, vitiates all contracts, leaves nothing
in security; whilst deception in weights and measures destroys and sweeps away
all legitimate modes of dealing. Now, if the laws of buying and selling are
corrupted, human society is in a manner dissolved; so that he who cheats by
false weights and measures, differs little from him who utters false coin: and
consequently one, who, whether as a buyer or seller, has falsified the standard
measures of wine or corn, or anything else, is accounted
criminal.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

be severely punished, still God, even if legal punishments be not inflicted,
summons men's consciences before His tribunal, and this he does both by promises
and threats. A just weight (He says) and a just measure shall prolong a man's
life; but he who has been guilty of deception in them, is an abomination before
me. Length of life, indeed, has only a figurative connection with just weights
and measures: but, because the avaricious, in their pursuit of dishonest gain,
are too devoted to this transitory life, God, in order to withhold His people
from this blind and impetuous covetousness, promises them long life, if they
keep themselves from fraud and all knavish dealings. We perceive from the
conclusion, that, not in this respect only, but in all our affairs, those
trickeries are condemned, by which our neighbors are defrauded. For, after God
has said that He abominates "all that do such things," He adds immediately by
way of explanation, "all that do unrighteously." We see, then, that He sets

another iniquity in reclaiming a pledge, viz., that the creditor should ransack
the house and furniture of his brother, in order to pick out the pledge at his
pleasure. For, if this option were given to the avaricious rich, they would be
satisfied with no moderation, but would seize upon all that was best, as if
making an assault on the very entrails of the poor: in a word, they would
ransack men's houses, or at any rate, whilst they contemptuously refused this or
that, they would fill the wretched with rebuke and shame. God, therefore, will
have no pledge reclaimed, except what the debtor of his own accord, and at his
own convenience, shall bring out of his house, lie even proceeds further, that
the creditor shall not take back any pledge which he knows to be necessary for
the poor: for example, if he should pledge the bed on which he sleeps, or his
counterpane, or cloak, or mantle. For it is not just that lie should be
stripped, so as to suffer from cold, or to be deprived of other aids, the use of
which he could not forego without loss or inconvenience. A promise, therefore,
is added, that this act of humanity will be pleasing to God, when the poor shall
sleep in the garment which is restored to him. He speaks even more distinctly,
and says: The poor will bless thee, and it shall be accounted to thee for
righteousness. For God indicates that He hears the prayers of the poor and
needy, lest the rich man should think the bounty thrown away which lie confers
upon a lowly individual. We must, indeed, be more than iron-hearted, unless we
are disposed to such liberality as this, when we understand that, although the
poor have not the means of repaying us in this world, still they have the power
of recompensing us before God, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., by obtaining grace for us
through their prayers. An implied threat is also conveyed, that if the poor man
should sleep inconveniently, or catch cold through our fault, God. will hear his
groans, so that our cruelty will not <i>be</i> unpunished. But if the poor man,
upon whom we have had compassion, should be ungrateful, yet, even though he is
silent, our kindness will cry out to God; whilst, on the other hand, our
tyrannical harshness will <i>suffice</i> to provoke God's vengeance, although he
who has been treated unkindly should patiently swallow his wrong.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be unto
righteousness</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"><i>
</i>f108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is equivalent to being approved by
God, or being an acceptable act; for since the keeping of the Law is true
righteousness, this praise is extended to particular acts of obedience. Although
it must be observed that this righteousness fails and vanishes, unless we
universally fulfill whatever God enjoins. It is, indeed, a part of righteousness
to restore a poor man's pledge; but if a mall be only beneficent in this
respect., whilst in other matters he robs his brethren; or if, whilst free from
avarice, he exercises violence, is given to lust or gluttony, the particular
righteousness, although pleasing in itself to God, will not come into account.
In fact, we must hold fast the axiom, that no work is accounted righteous before
God, unless il, proceeds from a man of purity and integrity; whereas there is
none such to be found. Consequently, no works are imputed unto righteousness,
except because God deigns to bestow His gratuitous favor on believers. In
itself, indeed, it would be true, that whatever act of obedience to God we
perform, it is accounted for righteousness, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., if the whole
course of our life corresponded to it, whereas no work proceeds from us which is
not corrupted by some defect. Thus, we must fly to God's mercy, in order that,
being reconciled to us, He may also accept our
work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What he had previously prescribed
respecting the poor, lie afterwards applies to widows alone, yet so as to
recommend all poor persons to us under their name; and this we gather both from
the beginning of the verse (17,) in which lie instructs them to deal fairly and
justly with strangers and orphans, and also from the reason which is added,
viz., that they should reflect that they were bondmen in the land of Egypt; for
their condition there did not suffer them proudly to insult the miserable; and
it is natural that he should be the more affected with the ills of others who
has experienced the same. Since, then, this reason is a general one, it is
evident also that the precept is general, that we should be humane towards all
that are in want.</font><br></div>

is not enough to refrain from taking the goods of another, unless we also
constantly exercise humanity and mercy in the relief of the poor. Heathen
authors also saw this, although not with sufficient clearness, (when they
declared</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f109
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) that, since all men are born for the sake
of each other, human society is not properly maintained, except by an
interchange of good offices. Wherefore, that we may not defraud our neighbors,
and so be accounted thieves in God's sight, let us learn, according to our
several means, to be kind to those who need our help; for liberality is a part
of righteousness, so that he must be deservedly held to be unrighteous who does
not relieve the necessities of his brethren when he can. This is the tendency of
Solomon's exhortation, that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"we

why "the rich and the poor meet together; and the Lord is the maker of them

greatly regarded in the matter of loans, especially when a person, being reduced
to extremities, implores a rich man's compassion; for this is, in. point of
fact, the genuine trial of our charity, when, in accordance with Christ's
precept, we lend to those of whom we expect no return.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420635&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
6:35.) The question here is not as to usury, as some have falsely
thought,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if he commanded us to lend
gratuitously, and without any hope of gain; but, since in lending, private
advantage is most generally sought, and therefore we neglect the poor; and only
lend our money to the rich, from whom we expect some compensation, Christ
reminds us that, if we seek to acquire the favor of the rich, we afford in this
way no proof of our charity or mercy; and hence lie proposes another sort of
liberality, which is plainly gratuitous, in giving assistance to the poor, not
only because our loan is a perilous one, but because they cannot make a return
in kind.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Before descending to speak of loans,
God here adverts to poverty and distress,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032535&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
25:35,) whereby men's minds may be disposed to compassion. If any one be
afflicted with poverty, he commands us to relieve his necessity. He makes use,
however, of a
metaphor,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he who is tottering should be
strengthened, as if by catching hold of his hand. What follows about the
stranger and sojourner extends and amplifies, in my opinion, the previous
sentence; as if it were said that, since humanity is not to be denied even to
strangers, much more is assistance to be given to their brethren. For, when it
pleased God that strangers should be permitted to inhabit the land, they were to
be kindly treated</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> according to the rights of hospitality;
for to allow them to <i>live</i> is to make their condition just and tolerable.
And thus God indirectly implies, that such unhappy persons are expelled and
driven away, so as not to <i>live</i>, if they are oppressed by unjust burdens.
This, then, is the sum of the first sentence, that the rich, who has the
ability, should uplift the poor man who is failing, by his assistance, or should
strengthen the tottering.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A precept is added as
to lending without interest, which, although it is a political law, still
depends on the rule of charity; inasmuch as it can scarcely happen but that the
poor should be entirely drained by the exaction of interest, and that their
blood should be almost sucked away. Nor had God any other object in view, except
that mutual and brotherly affection should prevail amongst the Israelites. It is
plain that this was a part of the Jewish polity, because it was lawful to lend
at interest to the Gentiles, which distinction the spiritual law does not admit.
The judicial law, however, which God prescribed to His ancient people, is only
so far abrogated as that what charity dictates should remain,
<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that our brethren, who need our assistance, are not to be
treated harshly. Moreover, since the wall of partition, which formerly separated
Jew and Gentile, is now broken down, our condition is now different; and
consequently we must spare all without exception, both as regards taking
interest, and any other mode of extortion; and equity is to be observed even
towards strangers. "The household of faith." indeed, holds the first rank, since
Paul commands us specially to do good to them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:10;) still the common society of the human race demands that we should not
seek to grow rich by the loss of others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As
touching the political law, no wonder that God should have permitted His people
to receive interest, from the Gentiles, since otherwise a just reciprocity would
not have been preserved, without which one party must needs be injured. God
commands His people not to practice usury, and still lays the Jews alone, and
not foreign nations, under the obligation of this law. In order, therefore, that
equality (<i>ratio</i> <i>analogica</i>) might be preserved, He
accords</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the same liberty to His people which the
Gentiles would assume for themselves; for this is the only intercourse that can
be endured, when the condition of both parties is similar and equal. For when
Plato</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> asserts that usurers are not to be
tolerated[in a well-ordered republic, lie does not go further than to enjoin,
that its citizens should abstain from that base and. dishonest traffic between
each other.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question now is, whether usury
is evil in itself; and surely that which heathens even have detested appears to
be by no means lawful to the children of God. We know that the name of usurer
has everywhere and always been infamous and detested. Thus
Cato,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> desiring to commend agriculture, says
that thieves were formerly condemned to a fine of double, and usurers quadruple;
from which he infers, that the latter were deemed the worst. And when asked what
he thought of usury, he replied, "What do I think of killing a man?" whereby he
wished to show, that it was as improper to make money by usury as to commit
murder. This was the swing of one private individual, yet it is derived from the
opinions of almost all nations and persons. And assuredly from this cause great
tumults often arose at Rome, and fatal contentions were awakened between the
common people and the rich; since it can hardly be but that usurers suck men's
blood like leeches. But if we come to an accurate decision as to the thing
itself, our determination must be derived from nowhere else than the universal
rule of justice, and especially from the declaration of Christ, on which hang
the law and the prophets, &#8212; Do not unto others what ye would not have done
to thyself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:12.) For crafty men are for ever inventing some little subterfuge or other to
deceive God. Thus, when all men detested the word <i>foenus</i>, another was
substituted, which might avoid unpopularity under an honest pretext; for they
called it <i>usury</i>, as being a compensation for the loss a man had incurred
by losing the <i>use</i> of his money.
But</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there is no description of <i>foenus</i>
to which this specious name may not be extended; for whosoever has any ready
money, and is about to lend it, he will allege that it would be profitable to
himself if he were to
purchase</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> something with it, and that at every
moment opportunities of gain are presenting themselves. Thus there will be
always ground for his seeking compensation, since no creditor could ever lend
money without loss to himself. Thus
usury,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since the word is equivalent to
<i>foenus</i>, is but a covering for an odious practice, as if such glosses
would deliver us in God's judgment, where nothing but absolute integrity can
avail for our <i>defense</i>. There was almost a similar mode of subterfuge
among the Israelites. The name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">5&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>neschec</i>, which is derived from <i>biting</i>, sounded badly; since then
no one chose to be likened to a hungry dog, who fed himself by biting others,
some escape from the reproach was sought; and they called whatever gain they
received beyond the capital,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tybrt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>therbith</i>, as being an increase. But God, in order to prevent such
deception, unites the two words,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032536&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
25:36,) and condemns the increase as well as the biting. For, where He complains
of their unjust modes of spoiling and thieving in
Ezekiel,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and uses both words as He does here by
Moses, there is no doubt but that He designedly cuts off their empty excuses.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
18:13.) Lest any, therefore, should reply, that although he derived advantage
from his money, he was not on that account guilty of usury, God at once removes
this pretense, and condemns in general any addition to the principal. Assuredly
both passages clearly show that those who invent new words in excuse of evil, do
nothing but vainly trifle. I have, then, admonished men that the fact itself is
simply to be considered, that all unjust gains are ever displeasing to God,
whatever color we endeavor to give to it. But if we would form an equitable
judgment, reason does not suffer us to admit that all usury is to be condemned
without exception. If the debtor have protracted the time by false pretences to
the loss and inconvenience of his creditor, will it be consistent that he should
reap advantage from his bad faith and broken promises? Certainly no one, I
think, will deny that usury ought to be paid to the creditor in addition to the
principal, to compensate his
loss.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f121</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If any rich and monied man, wishing to
buy a piece of land, should borrow some part of the sum required of another, may
not he who lends the money receive some part of the revenues of the farm until
the principal shall be repaid? Many such cases daily occur in which, as far as
equity is concerned, usury is no worse than purchase. Nor will that subtle
argument</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of Aristotle avail, that usury is
unnatural, <i>because</i> money is barren and does not beget money; for such a
cheat as I have spoken of, might make much profit by trading with another man's
money, and the purchaser of the farm might in the meantime reap and gather his
vintage. But those who think differently, may object, that we must abide by
God's judgment, when He generally prohibits all usury to His people. I reply,
that the question is only as to the poor, and consequently, if we have to do
with the rich, that usury is freely permitted; because the Lawgiver, in alluding
to one thing, seems not to condemn another, concerning which He is silent. If
again they object that usurers are absolutely condemned by David and Ezekiel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
15:5;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
18:13,) I think that their declarations ought to be judged of by the rule of
charity; and therefore that only those unjust exactions are condemned whereby
the creditor, losing' sight of equity, burdens and oppresses his debtor. I
should, indeed, be unwilling to take usury under my patronage, and I wish the
name itself were banished from the world; but I do not dare to pronounce upon so
important a point more than God's words convey. It is abundantly clear that the
ancient people were prohibited from usury, but we must needs confess that this
was a part of their political constitution. Hence it follows, that usury is not
now unlawful, except in so far as it contravenes equity and brotherly union. Let
each one, then, place himself before God's judgment-seat, and not do to his
neighbor what he would not have done to himself, from whence a sure and
infallible decision may be come to. To exercise the trade of usury, since
heathen writers accounted it amongst disgraceful and base modes of gain, is much
less tolerable among the children of God; but in what cases, and how far it may
be lawful to receive usury upon loans, the law of equity will better prescribe
than any lengthened discussions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us now
examine the words. In the first place, where we have translated the words, "Thou
shalt not be to him as a
usurer,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f123</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there is some ambiguity in the Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">5&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nashac</i>, for it is sometimes used generally for to <i>lend</i>, without
any ill meaning; but here it is undoubtedly applied to a usurer, who bites the
poor; as also in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
109:11, "Let the usurer catch all that he
hath."</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The sum is, that the poor are to be
liberally aided, and not to be oppressed by harsh exactions: and therefore
immediately afterwards it is added, "neither shalt thou lay upon him usury."
When again He repeats, "And if thy brother be waxen poor," etc., we see that
reference is everywhere made to the poor; because, although sometimes those who
possess large properties are ruined by usury, (as Cicero says that certain
luxurious and prodigal persons ill his days contended against usury with the
fruits of their farms, because their creditors swallowed up the whole
produce;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f125
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) still the poor alone, who had been
compelled to borrow by want, and not by luxury, were worthy of
compassion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The third passage, however,
admirably explains the meaning of God, since it extends usury to corn and wine,
and all other articles. For many contracts were invented by artful men, whereby
they pillaged the needy without ignominy or disgrace: and now-a-days no rapacity
is more cruel than that which imposes a payment upon debtors, without any
mention of usury; for instance, if a poor man should ask the loan of six
measures of wheat, the creditor will require seven to be repaid; or if the same
thing should happen as regards wine. This profit will not be called usury,
because no money will pass; but God, indirectly casting ridicule upon their
craftiness, shows that this plague of
usury</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f126
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">extends itself to various things, and to
almost all sorts of traffic; whence it clearly appears that nothing else is
prescribed to the Israelites, but that they should humanely assist each other.
But, since cupidity blinds men, and carries them, aside to dishonest dealings,
God sets His blessing in opposition to all such iniquitous arts, whereby they
hawk, as it were, for gain; and commands them to look for riches rather to Him
the author of all good things, than to hunt for them by rapine and
fraud.</font><br></div>

clear that he who abstains from evil doing, is not therefore guiltless before
God, unless he also studies to do good. For our brethren's advantage ought to be
so far our care, that we should be disposed mutually to aid each other as far as
our means and opportunities permit. This instruction is greatly needed; because,
whilst everybody is more attentive to his own advantage than he ought to be, he
is willing to hold back from the assistance of others. But God brings him in
guilty of theft who has injured his neighbors by his negligence; and justly,
because it depended only upon him that the thing should be safe, which he
knowingly and willfully suffered to perish. This duty, too, is extended even to
enemies; wherefore our inhumanity is the more inexcusable, if we have not helped
our friends. The sum therefore is, that believers should be
kind,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

Father; and should not only bestow their labor upon the good, who are worthy of
it, but should treat the unworthy also with kindness: and since many might
invent means of subterfuge, God anticipates them, and commands that the beast of
a person unknown should be kept until reclaimed by its owner; and lays down the
same rule as to all things that may be lost.</font><br></div>

Although at the outset He seems to include all trespasses, yet we gather from
the context that the precept only refers to things stolen or fraudulently
withheld, that he, who is conscious of his guilt, should make reparation. It
must be observed, however, that the law relates to more secret thefts, which are
not usually brought to justice: and on this account it is said, "If they have
committed any sin after the manner of men, they must not seek for subterfuge
from ordinary use and custom." Although, therefore, they may have many
companions, God declares that this will not avail for their excuse; and
consequently commands them voluntarily to restore what they have fraudulently or
wrongfully appropriated. He will treat hereafter of the punishment of theft; He
now only prescribes that, although no one shall bring the guilty parties to
justice, and their crime may not be discovered, still they should diligently
examine their consciences, and themselves ingenuously declare the secret
transgression; and also make compensation for the loss conferred, since, without
restitution, their confession would be but illusory. I now pass over what Moses
adds, that, if no heir exists to whom the stolen goods may be restored, they
should offer it to the priest, because I have already expounded it: except that
we gather frost thence, that a contamination is contracted by fraud and rapine,
which is never purged unless the house is well cleared of the ill-gotten gain.
But this offering was treated of amongst the laws of the
priests:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> now, with respect to the restitution, we
must consider that the fifth part was superadded, not so much in order that he,
who had suffered the loss, should be enriched, as that all should diligently
beware of every offense, which they hear not only to be useless to themselves,
but also to be productive of loss. Besides, when a man has been robbed, it is
often of more consequence than this additional fifth part, that he should have
been deprived of the use of his property.</font><br></div>

when judges are corrupted either by bribes, or by affection, and thus ruin the
fortunes which they ought to protect: for, since their tribunal is as it were
sacred asylum, to which those who are unjustly oppressed may fly, nothing can be
more unseemly than that they should there fall amongst
robbers.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Judges are appointed to repress all
wrongs and offenses; if therefore they show favor to the wicked, they are
harborers of thieves; than which there is no more deadly pest. And besides,
since their authority excludes every other remedy, they are themselves like
rob-hers with arms in their hands. The greater, therefore, their power of injury
is, and the greater the damage committed by their unjust sentences, the more
diligently are they to be warned to beware of iniquity; and thus it was
necessary to keep them in the path of duty by special instructions, lest they
should conceal and encourage thievery by their patronage. Now, as avarice is the
root of all evils, when it thus lays hold of the minds of judges, no integrity
can continue to exist. But, since all utterly condemn this vice, even though
they may be entirely under its influence, God speaks of it the more plainly and
popularly, enjoining that judges should withhold their hands from every gift:
for there is no more fatal poison for the extinction of all uprightness, than
when a judge suffers himself to be cajoled by gifts. Let those who accept gifts
allege as much as they please that they still maintain their integrity, the fact
itself clearly shows that they are venal, and seek their own pecuniary advantage
when they are thus attracted by gain. Formerly it was enough to render judges
infamous that they were called <i>nummarii</i>,
(moneyers.)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it is superfluous to treat any
further of this matter, since God cuts off all handles for subterfuge in a
single sentence: "for gifts (He says) blind the eyes of him that seeth, and
pervert the judgment of the righteous." If, then, we acquiesce in His decision,
there is no light of intelligence so bright but that gifts extinguish it, nor
any probity so great but that they undermine it; in fact, gifts infect a sound
mind before they soil the hand; I mean those which a person receives in
reference to the judgment of a cause; for there is no question here as to those
gifts of mutual kindness which men reciprocate with each other. Thus, in the
passage from Deuteronomy 16, before God speaks of gifts, He forbids that justice
should be wrested., or men's persons respected: whence we gather, that only
those snares are condemned which are set to curry favor. It must be observed on
the passage from Leviticus, that to <i>judge</i> <i>in</i> <i>righteousness</i>
is contrasted with <i>respecting</i> <i>the</i> <i>person</i>: and consequently,
as soon as the judge turns away his eyes ever so little from the cause itself,
he forgets equity. Moreover, to wrest judgment is equivalent to doing iniquity
in judgment; but since injustice is not always openly manifested, but rather
disguised by various artifices, after God in Leviticus has condemned corrupt and
unjust judgments, He uses this word to wrest (<i>inclinandi</i>), in
Deuteronomy, in order to dissipate all vain pretexts.</font><br></div>

that judges should study equity with inflexible constancy; nor is this done
without cause, for nothing is more likely to happen than that men's minds should
be clouded by favor or hatred. Besides there are so many quibbles whereby
justice is perverted, that, unless judges are very cautious in watching against
deception, they will often find themselves ensnared.</font><br></div>

repress the vices which are of frequent occurrence, no wonder that God should
put forward the case of the poor, to whom it often happens that they fail though
their causes are good, both because they are without interest and are exposed to
injury through the contempt in which they are held, and also because they cannot
contend with the rich in incurring expense. Justly, then, is provision made for
their inferiority, lest the iniquity of judges should rob them of the little
they possess. But the other point here referred to might appear superfluous,
viz., that judges should not favor the poor, which very rarely takes place. It
would also be incongruous that what God elsewhere prescribes and praises should
here be reprehended. I reply, that rectitude is so greatly pleasing to God, that
the judge would in no wise be excusable, under whatever pretext he might decline
from it ever so little, and that this is the intention of this precept. For,
although the poor is for the most part tyrannically oppressed, still ambition
will sometimes impel a judge to misplaced compassion, so that he is liberal at
another's expense. And this temptation is all the more dangerous, because
injustice is done under the cloak of virtue. For, if a judge only directs his
attention to the poverty of the litigant, a foolish fear will at the same time
insinuate itself lest his sentence should ruin the man whom he would wish to
save; thus he will award to the one what belongs to the other. Sometimes the
temerity, audacity, and obstinacy of the poor in commencing and prosecuting
suits is greater than that of the rich; and when they despair of their cause,
they are sure to have recourse to tears and lamentations, by which they deceive
incautious judges, who, forgetful of the cause itself, only consider how their
misery and want is to be relieved. Besides, too, whilst they think little of the
rich man's loss, because he can easily bear it, they make no scruple of
declining from equity in favor of the poor. But hence it better appears how
greatly God is offended by the oppression of the poor, when He will not have
even <i>them</i> befriended to the injury of the rich.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Thus far God has proclaimed Himself the avenger of
iniquities, and, citing thieves before His tribunal, has threatened them with
eternal death. Now follow the civil laws, the principle of which is not so exact
and perfect; since in their enactment God has relaxed His just severity in
consideration of the people's hardness of
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What God formerly delivered to His people
the heathen legislators afterwards borrowed. Draco, indeed, was more severe, but
his extreme rigor became obsolete by the silent consent of the people of Athens;
and the Decemvirs borrowed from Solon part of their law, which they published in
the ten tables, although there were some variations in the distinction of the
double or quadruple restitution, and in process of time other alterations were
afterwards made. But if all things be duly considered, it will be found that
both Solon and the Decemvirs have made a change for the worse, wherever they
have varied from the law of God. First of all, no
distinction</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is here made, such as the Roman laws
decree, between manifest thieves and those that are not manifest; for by them
the thief not manifest is condemned to a double amend, and the manifest to
quadruple; and he is called a manifest thief who is caught before he has carried
what he has stolen to the place of its destination. I suppose that the awarders
of the punishment had this point in view, that the wickedness of that person was
the more egregious who was so greedily and anxiously set on his prey as not to
be afraid of disgrace; and undoubtedly he who has no fear of shame is more
audacious ill sin. But, on the contrary, God condemns to a double amend those
upon whom the stolen goods were found; and to quadruple, those who had killed or
sold it; and deservedly so, because greater obstinacy in crime betrays itself
where the theft is turned to profit, nor is there any hope of repentance; and
thus by this further process the crime of dishonesty is doubled. It might be
that, immediately after the offense, the thief should be alarmed; but he who had
dared to kill the stolen animal or to sell it, is altogether hardened in his
sin. Besides, the more difficult its investigation is, the greater is the
punishment which a misdemeanor deserves. Meanwhile, it is to be remembered, that
the pecuniary fine imposed upon thieves did not free them from guilt; for, as
Marcellus says,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not even the president of a province can
bring it to pass, that infamy should not pursue a man condemned of theft; and
there was no need of establishing by law that in which all by nature are agreed.
Thus, when God punished thieves by a fine, He left them still marked by infamy.
I know not whether
they</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> assign the true cause why he who had
stolen an ox is fined to a larger amount than he who had stolen a goat, or
sheep, or other cattle, who say that the loss of the owner is taken into account
to whom the labor of the ox is especially useful in agriculture; for what is
said as to an ox I extend to cows and the whole herd. Those seem to come nearer
to the truth who say the audacity of the thief is punished who, when he stole
the larger animal, did not fear being observed by witnesses; yet it seems to me
more likely that the different sentence depended on the price of the article;
for assuredly it is more reasonable that he who has done the most harm should be
exposed to the greater punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a thief be found breaking
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This clause is to be taken separately, and
is inserted by way of parenthesis; for, after having decreed the punishment, God
adds in connection, "he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then
he should be sold for his theft;" and this exception as to the thief in the
night is introduced parenthetically. But although the details are not expressed
with sufficient distinctness, still the intention of God is by no means
ambiguous, viz., that if a thief should be killed in the dark, his slayer should
be unpunished; for he can then hardly be distinguished from a robber, especially
when he proceeds with violence; because he cannot enter another man's house by
night without either digging through a wall or breaking down a door. The Twelve
Tables</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> differ slightly from this; for they
permit the killing of a thief by night, and also by day if he should defend
himself with a weapon. But, since God had sufficiently repressed by other laws
murders and violent assaults, He is silent here respecting robbers who use the
sword in their attempts at plunder. He therefore justly condemns to death those
who have avenged by murder a theft in open
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He should make full
restitution</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These words, as I have said, are
connected with the first verse, since here the execution of the punishment is
only enjoined; as if God forbade thieves to be spared, but that they should pay
either twofold or quadruple, or even quintuple, according to the measure of
their crime. But, if they were unable to pay, He commands them to be sold as
slaves, which also was the custom at Rome. Whence the saying of
Cato,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "that private thieves lived in bonds and
fetters, but public ones in gold and purple." And since this condition was a
harsh one, a caution is expressly given, that they were not to be absolved on
the score of their poverty. If any one should ask whether it was lawful for the
owner of the thing stolen to recover double or quadruple its value, I answer,
that what God awards, a man has the best of rights to; meanwhile, in equity men
were bound to take care that they did not grow rich at the expense of others,
but rather were they to apply whatever they gained to pious and holy
uses.</font><br></div>

permitted, but with a fine attached if any should rashly accuse his neighbor;
for else it might be doubted when or for what reasons the restitution of double
or quadruple was to be required. He therefore permits that if any one suspects
another of theft, he should summon that person to plead his cause; and if he
should prove his case, that he should recover double the thing lost; but if the
judges should pronounce that he had brought his action groundlessly, that he, on
the contrary, should pay the penalty of his false accusation. For such an action
as this is not altogether a civil one, but carries with it the stain of infamy,
and thus it would be unjust that a man should be injured by false suspicions
whom the judges acquit of crime. The word used here for judges is

justly ranked among thefts; viz., if any man shall have put in his beast to feed

servant to steal by him, he himself is deemed guilty of the offense, even
although he may have touched nothing with his own hand; nor does he less do
wrong who has given occasion of injury by means of a brute. Still, God restricts
the punishment to a compensation of double the amount, because it cannot be
certainly established that the master of the animal desired to effect the damage
fraudulently and designedly; yet He requires the loss to be made up at the
highest estimate of its

from the foregoing, for he who kindles the fire is commanded to make good the
damage done by him, although there may have been no willful intention to do
harm. For the incendiary who had maliciously destroyed either a cornfield or a
vineyard was to be far more severely punished; here, however, mere carelessness
is punished. Although no mention is made either of house or barn, still the law
includes all similar cases requiring compensation from him who had kindled a
fire even in an open field. But it seems that such a person would be blameless,
because he could not. foresee that the fire would ignite the thorns; yet, in
order that every one should take as much care of the property of another as of
his own, God commands him to suffer the penalty of his heedless or stupid
negligence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a man shall deliver unto
his neighbor money</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is here determined under
what circumstances an action for theft would lie in case of a deposit, viz., if
an inanimate thing, as a garment or furniture, be given ill charge, and the
person with whom it is deposited should allege that it is stolen, God commands
that, if the thief be discovered, he should pay double; but, if not, that an
oath should be required of the man who declares that the thing has been stolen
from him. But, if it be an animal that was given in charge, a somewhat different
provision is made, viz., that if it have been violently carried away, or torn by
beasts, the person with whom it was deposited should be free; but if it had
<i>been</i> stolen, that he should make restitution. In order to understand the
principle of this law, we must observe that depositaries are not to be compelled
to do more than faith. fully preserve the thing entrusted to them; just as a
prudent and careful father of a family is attentive to the preservation of his
property. When they have acquitted themselves diligently in this respect, it
would be unjust to require more, of them; otherwise, when they undertake the
burden of this gratuitous office, their generosity would be an injury to
themselves. But, since it is not so easy to steal an animal from the stall, or
from the hands of the shepherd, the negligence of the shepherd betrays itself in
the loss of the beast,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f139</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> supposing no violence to have been used.
Justice, then, is done in both cases, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that the depository
shall not make good a vessel, or money, or a garment, because this would be in a
manner to put him in the place of the thief; but that if the animal be stolen he
shall pay its price, unless he can cleat' himself of carelessness. If any should
think that too great indulgence is shown to the depositary, when God would have
the dispute terminated by his oath; the reply is easy, that we do not entrust
anything to be kept by another, unless we are persuaded of his honesty. Whoever,
then, has chosen a guardian for his property, has borne witness to his own
prejudice that he is a good and trustworthy man; and consequently, it would be
absurd that he should soon afterwards be involved in all accusation of theft
without proof. Wherefore it was reasonable that God would have the owner of the
lost goods acquiesce in the oath of him. whom he has considered to be his
faithful friend. Besides, a man is altogether acquitted who clears himself by
calling God to witness his innocence, unless any sinister suspicion is alleged
against him, and provided he excuses himself on probable
evidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a man deliver unto his
neighbor an ass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since in the passage from
whence I have taken these four verses, mention is made of a deposit, and Moses
is professedly providing against frauds, and robberies, and thefts, I have
thought it well to place them under this head. It has indeed some relation to
the Third Commandment, because it shows the lawful use of an oath, viz., that in
matters of concealment men should have recourse to the witness of God, and that,
by the interposition of His sacred name, an end should be put to their strife.
But, while the authority attributed to oaths depends on the reverence due to
God, at the same time faith and piety are enforced in
them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f140</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that all things should correspond. I
have, however, considered the main point, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., how controversies
as to things concealed should be brought to an end for the advancement of peace
and equity. He would therefore have the depositary acquitted, if he swears that
the animal entrusted to him is lost (either by death or
violence,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f141
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) although lie should produce no witness of
the matter, since it would be unjust that he should bear the blame, unless
fraud, or some more palpable offense, have been committed by him. At the
conclusion, then, it is said, "the owner of it shall accept" the oath, which is
equivalent to saying, that lie shall be compelled to acquiesce, and shall give
no more trouble about it. The expression, "an oath of the Lord shall be between
them both," is a remarkable one, whereby the obligation and sanctity of an oath
are enforced, whilst Moses reminds us that God is the author of this sacred mode
of attestation, and presides over it as its judge and
avenger.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses now lays down the law as to a
borrowed animal, if it die, or be mutilated, or injured. There is, however, a
wide distinction between a thing borrowed and a thing deposited, for he who
lends confers a favor; and therefore, when a man borrows a thing, he binds
himself to restore it in safety, as far as in him lies. A distinction, however,
is made, if the owner himself of the animal be an eye-witness of the death or
fracture, he shall bear the loss; but if the animal should die or be injured in
his absence, its value is awarded to him. His presence is tantamount to this, as
if it were said, if he shall have seen with his own eyes that the injury did not
occur by the fault of him to whom he lent it, then he shall give him no trouble
about it. For instance, if you have lent me a horse, and take the journey with
me, although anything untoward should happen &#8212; supposing you are assured
that it did not occur by my temerity, or negligence, or bad management, I am
free, and exempt from loss.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What is here laid
down as to a borrowed animal must be applied also to all other things
borrowed.</font><br></div>

has inflicted a loss upon another shall make satisfaction for it, although he
may not have turned it to his own profit; for in respect to a theft, its profit
is not to be considered, but the intention to injure, or other cause of guilt;
for it might happen that he who has killed another's ox should not deliberately
desire to do him an injury, but in a fit of passion, or from unpremeditated
impulse, should nevertheless have inflicted loss upon him. In whatever way,
therefore, a man should have committed an offense, whereby another is made
poorer, he is commanded to make good the loss. Whence it is clear, that
whosoever do not so restrain themselves as to care for a neighbor's advantage as
much as for their own, are accounted guilty of theft before God. The object,
however, of the law is, that no one should suffer loss by us, which will be the
case if we have regard to the good of our brethren.</font><br></div>

its value; and justly, since his carelessness approaches to actual guilt. Here,
again, we see how God would have all men to be anxious for their neighbor's
advantage; yet, inasmuch as there was no fraud or malice in the case, he is
permitted, after paying its price, to appropriate the carcass to himself. But,
if one man's ox should be killed by another's, a most just appointment is made,
viz., that, if it happened unexpectedly, and by sudden accident, they should
divide the dead ox between them, and, having sold the other, each should take
half the price; but if the ox was a savage one, that its owner should undergo a
greater penalty by paying its full price; because he ought to have anticipated
the mischief, and thus was scarcely so kind as he should have been, giving

ears of corn and grapes with their hands for food alone, and not to carry away.
I have no doubt, however, that it refers to all persons, and that no greater
license is given than humanity demands. For we must not strain the words too
precisely, but look to the intention of the Lawgiver. God forbids men to
introduce a sickle into the harvest of another; now, if a man should pluck with
his hands as many ears of corn as he could carry on his shoulders, or lay upon a
horse, could he excuse himself by the puerile explanation that he had not used a
sickle? But, if common sense itself repudiates such gross impudence, it is plain
that the Law has another object, viz., that no one should touch even an ear of
another man's harvest, except for present use, which occurred to Christ's
disciples, when they were compelled by hunger to rub the ears of corn in their
hands, lest they should faint by the way.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

permits hungry travelers to refresh themselves by eating grapes, when they have
not enough of other food. But although the liberty of eating to their fill is
granted, still it was not. allowable oil this pretext to gorge themselves.
Besides, vineyards were enclosed with hedges and guarded; whence it appears that
the grapes were not exposed to every glutton. This, then, is the sum, that it is
not accounted a theft, if a traveler, in order to relieve his hunger, should

land, when their fruits are gathered: for, when His bounty is exercised before
our eyes, it invites us to imitate Him; and it is a sign of ingratitude,
unkindly and maliciously, to withhold what we derive from His blessing. God does
not indeed require that those who have abundance should so profusely give away

may seize it as their own; but that some small portion may flow gratuitously to
them from the munificence of the rich. He mentions indeed by name the orphans,

who have no fields of their own to sow or reap; for it will sometimes occur that

</i></b><i>At the end of every seven years</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A
special act of humanity towards each other is here prescribed to the Jews, that
every seven years, brother should remit to brother whatever was owed him. But,
although we are not bound by this law at present, and it would not be even
expedient that it should be in use, still the object to which it tended ought
still to be maintained, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that we should not be too rigid in
exacting our debts, especially if we have to do with the needy, who are bowed
down by the burden of poverty. The condition of the ancient people, as I have
said, was different. They derived their origin from a single race; the land of
Canaan was their common inheritance; fraternal association was to be mutually
sustained among them, just as if they were one family: and, inasmuch as God had
once enfranchised them, the best plan for preserving' their liberty for ever was
to maintain a condition of mediocrity, lest a few persons of immense wealth
should oppress the general body. Since, therefore, the rich, if they had been
permitted constantly to increase in wealth, would have tyrannized over the rest,
God put by this law a restraint on immoderate power. Moreover, when rest was
given to the land, and men reposed from its cultivation, it was just that the
whole people, for whose sake the Sabbath was instituted, should enjoy some
relaxation. Still the remission here spoken of was, in my opinion, merely
temporary. Some, indeed, suppose that all debts were then entirely
cancelled;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if the Sabbatical year destroyed all
debtor and creditor accounts; but this is refuted by the context, for when the
Sabbatical year is at hand, God commands them to lend freely, whereas the
contract would have been ridiculous, unless it had been lawful to seek repayment
in due time. Surely, if no payment had ever followed, it would have been
required simply to give: for what would the empty form of lending have availed
if the money advanced was never to be returned to its owner? But God required
all suits to cease for that year, so that no one should trouble his debtor: and,
<i>because</i> in that year of freedom and immunity there was no hope of
receiving back the money, God provides against the objection, and forbids them
to be niggardly, although the delay might produce some <i>inconvenience</i>.
First of all, therefore, He commands them to make a remission in the seventh
year, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., to abstain from exacting their debts, and to concede
to the poor, as well as to the land, a truce, or vacation. On which ground
Isaiah reproves the Jews for observing the Sabbath amiss, when they
exact</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f145</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> their debts, and "fast for strife and
debate."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:3, 4.) The form of remission is added, That no one should vex his neighbor in

proclaimed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
An exception follows, that it should be lawful to sue foreigners, and to compel
them to pay; and this for a very good reason, because it was by no means just
that despisers of the Law should enjoy the Sabbatical benefit, especially when
God had conferred the privilege on His elect people alone. What follows in the
next verse, "Unless because there shall be no beggar," interpreters twist into
various senses. Some translate it, Nevertheless (<i>veruntamen,</i>) let there
be no beggar among thee; as if it were a prohibition, that they should not
suffer their poor brethren to be overwhelmed with poverty, without assisting
them; and, lest they should object that, if they should be so liberal in giving,
they would soon exhaust themselves, God anticipates them, and bids them rely
upon his blessing. Others, however, understand it as a promise, and connect it
thus, That there should be no beggar among them, if only they keep the Law,
since then God would bless them. Nor would this meaning be very unsuitable. What
they mean who expound it, Insomuch that there should be no beggar with thee, I
know not. Let my readers, however, consider
whether</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

"unless because," (<i>nisi</i> <i>quod</i>:) and then this clause would be read
parenthetically, as if it were said, Whenever there shall be any poor among your
brethren, an opportunity of doing them good is presented to you. Therefore the
poverty of your brethren is to be relieved by you, in order that God may bless
you. But, that the sentence may be clearer, I take the two words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk
spa</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ephes</i> <i>ci</i>, exclusively, as if it
were, On no account let there be a beggar: or, howsoever it. may be, suffer not
that by your fault there should be any beggar amongst you; for He would put an
end to all vain excuses, and, as necessity arose, would have them disposed to
give assistance, lest the poor should sink under the pressure of want and
distress, tie does not, therefore, mean generally all poor persons, but only
those in extreme indigence; such as the Prophet Amos complains are "sold for a
pair of shoes."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
2:6.) In order, then, that they may more cheerfully assist their distresses, He
promises that His blessing shall be productive of greater abundance. And from
hence Paul seems to have derived his exhortation to the
Corinthians:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He which soweth
bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. God is able to make all grace abound
toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
every good work.: Now he that ministereth seed to the sower, <i>shall</i> both
minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the
fruits of your righteousness, <i>that</i>, being enriched in every thing,
<i>you</i> <i>may</i> <i>abound</i> unto all bountifulness."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 9:6-11.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">In short, God would have
them without carefulness, since He will abundantly recompense them with His
blessing, if they have diminished their own stores by liberality to the
poor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For the Lord thy God blesseth thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He confirms the foregoing declaration, but ascends from the particular to the
general; for, after having taught that they might expect from God's blessing
much more than they have bestowed on the poor, he now recalls their attention to
the Covenant itself, as much as to say, that whatever they have is derived from
that original fountain of God's grace, when He made them inheritors of the land
of Canaan. God reminds them also that He then promised them abundant produce;
and thus indicates that, if they were mean and niggardly, they would cause the
land to be barren. When He says that they should lend to all nations, he speaks
by way of amplification; and also in the next clause, that they should reign
over the Gentiles; whence it follows, that if there were any in want among them,
it would arise from the wickedness and depravity, of the people
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.

contradiction when He commands them to relieve beggars, whom He had before
forbidden to exist among His people; for the object of the prohibition was, that
if any were reduced to beggary, they should not be cast out and forsaken. Now,
however, He explains the mode of preventing this, viz., that the hands of the
rich should be open to assist them. In order to incline them to compassion, he
again reminds them of their common brotherhood, and sets before them, as its
token and pledge, the land in which by God's goodness they dwell together.
Again, that they may be willing and prompt in their humanity, He forbids them to
harden their heart, thereby signifying that avarice is always cruel. Finally, He
applies this instruction to the year of release, viz., that they should
straightway relieve their poor brethren towards the beginning of that year, just
as if they would receive back in a few days the money which the poor man would
retain to its
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

there would be always poor men among them, because they would not keep the law,
and consequently the land would be barren on account of their unrighteousness. I
admit that this is true; but God does not here ascribe it to their sins that
there would always be some beggars among them, but only reminds them that there
would never be wanting matter for their generosity, because He would prove what
was in their hearts by setting the poor before them. For, (as I have observed
above,) this is why the rich and poor meet together, and the Lord is maker of
them all; because otherwise the duties of charity would not be observed unless
they put them into exercise by assisting each other. Wherefore God, to stir up
the inactivity of the rich, declares that lie prescribes nothing but what
continual necessity will require.</font><br></div>

</i></b><i>Now these are the judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Both
passages contain the same appointment, viz., that as to the Hebrews slavery must
end at the seventh year; for God would have the children of Abraham, although
obliged to sell themselves, to differ from heathen and ordinary slaves. Their
enfranchisement is, therefore, enjoined, but with an exception, which Moses
expresses in the first passage but omits in the latter, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that
if the slave had married a bond-woman, and had begotten children, they should
remain with the master, and that he should alone be free. Whence it appears how
hard was the condition of slaves, since it could not be mitigated without an
unnatural exception (<i>sine</i> <i>prodigio</i>;) for nothing could be more
opposed to nature than that a husband, forsaking his wife and children, should
remove himself elsewhere. But the tie of slavery could only be loosed by
divorce, that is to say, by this impious violation of marriage. There was then
gross barbarity in this severance, whereby a man was disunited from half of
himself and his own bowels. Yet there was no remedy for it; for if the wife and
children had been set free, it would have been a spoliation of their lawful
master to take them with him, not only because the woman was his slave, but
because he had incurred expense in the bringing up of the young children. The
sanctity of marriage therefore gave way in this case to private right; and this
defect is to be reckoned amongst the others which God tolerated on account of
the people's hardness of heart, because it could hardly be remedied; yet, if any
one were withheld by chaste affection, and unwilling to abandon his wife and
offspring, an alternative is presented, viz., that he should give himself up
also to perpetual slavery. The form of this is more clearly pointed out in
Exodus than in Deuteronomy; for, in the latter, it is only said that the master,
in order to assert his perpetual right to the slave, should bore his ear;
whereas in Exodus the circumstance is added, that a public process should first
take place; for, if each private individual had been his own judge in this
matter, the rich men's houses would have been like slaughterhouses to put their
wretched slaves to the torment
in.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We read in Jeremiah, (34:11,) that this
law fell into contempt, and that the Jews, contrary to all law and justice,
retained perpetual dominion over their slaves; nay, that when they were severely
reprimanded under King Zedekiah, and liberty was anew proclaimed, the wretched
men were immediately dragged back to their yoke of tyranny, as if they had been
set free in mockery. Care was therefore to be taken lest, by secret tortures,
they should compel the unwilling to continue as their slaves; and the provision
against this evil was an open confession of their desire before the judges;
whilst the boring of the ear was a kind of stigma upon them. For the Orientals
were accustomed to brand slaves, or fugitives, or criminals, or those who were
in any wise suspected; and although God did not choose to have this mark of
ignominy imprinted on the foreheads of his people, yet, if any one voluntarily
consented to endure perpetual slavery, He willed that he should bear this token
of his servitude upon his ear. Still we must remember that even this slavery,
although it is said to endure for ever, was brought to a close at the jubilee,
because then the condition of the land and people was altogether
renewed.</font><br></div>

were brethren, God would not allow them to be placed in a worse condition than

provision should be assigned to them, but He justly lays a constraint on the
rich, whose varied abundance supplied them with the means of liberality; as if
He would show them from whence they received their gratuitous gifts, which were
at the same time a just compensation for the labors of their

And, indeed, He first urges them to obey on the score of justice, and then from
the hope of remuneration. For He reminds them that for six years the slave had
earned double the wages of a hireling, either because his life was more
laborious, inasmuch as heavier tasks are required from slaves than from
free-men, who are paid for their work; or because he had completed twice as long

</i></b><i>And if thy brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now proceeds
further, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that one who has bought his brother should treat
him with humanity, and not otherwise than a hired servant. We have seen, indeed,
just above, that the labor of a slave is estimated at twice as much, because the
humanity of his master will never go so far as to indulge or spare his slave as
if he were a hireling. It is not, therefore, without reason that God puts a
restraint upon that rule, which experience shows to have been often tyrannical.
Still He prescribes no more than heathen philosophers
did,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> viz., that masters should treat their
slaves like hired servants. And this principle of justice ought to prevail
towards all without exception; but since it was difficult to prescribe the same
rule respecting strangers as respecting their brethren, a special law is
enacted, that at least <i>they</i> should observe moderation towards their
brethren, with whom they had a common inheritance and condition. First:.
therefore, it is provided as to Hebrew slaves that they should not be treated
harshly and contemptuously like captives (<i>mancipia</i>;) and then that their
slavery should come to an end in the year of jubilee. But here the question
arises, since their liberty was before accorded to them in the, seventh year,
why it is now postponed to the fiftieth? Some get over the difficulty by
supposing that</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f151</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if the jubilee occurred during the six
years, they must then be set free, although they had not completed the whole
term; but this is too forced a conjecture. The view that most approves itself to
me is, that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lby</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yobel</i>, is extended to mean every seventh year, or, at any rate, that
moderation towards those slaves is specially prescribed who were most exposed to
violence and other injurious treatment. For they would not have dared to oppress
at pleasure their slaves, who were soon afterwards to be free; but those who, by
having their ears bored, had subjected themselves to the longer period of
slavery, would have been more outrageously harassed, unless God had interposed.
And this opinion I freely adopt, that although their slavery lasted to the
jubilee, yet flint their masters were to treat them with moderation and
humanity. This too is confirmed by what immediately follows, where it is
enjoined that the children should be set free with their fathers, which did not
take place in the seventh year.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they are my servants.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God here declares that His own right is invaded
when those, whom He claims as His property, are taken into subjection by
another; for He says that He acquired the people as His own when He redeemed
them from Egypt. Whence He infers that His right is violated if any should usurp
perpetual dominion over a Hebrew. If any object that this is of equal force,
when they only serve for a time, I reply, that though God might have justly
asserted His sole ownership, yet He was satisfied with this symbol of it; and
therefore that He suffered by indulgence that they should be enslaved for a
fixed period, provided some trace of His deliverance of them should remain. In a
word, He simply chose to apply this preventative lest slavery should altogether
extinguish the recollection of His grace, although He allowed it to be thus
smothered as it were. Lest, therefore, cruel masters should trust that their
tyranny would be exercised with impunity, Moses reminds them that they had to do
with God, who will at length appear as its avenger. Although the political laws
of Moses are not now in operation, still the analogy is to be preserved, lest
the condition of those who have been redeemed by Christ's blood should be worse
amongst us, than that of old of tits ancient people. To whom Paul's exhortation

strangers was everywhere customary among the Gentiles, viz., that their power
over their slaves should exist not only until their death, but should continue
in perpetual succession to their children; for this is the force of the
expression, "ye shall possess them for your children," that the right of
ownership should pass to their heir's also; nor is there a distinction made only
as to perpetuity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

rigor;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whence it appears that a restraint was
imposed upon them lest they should imperiously rule the children of Abraham, and
not leave them half their liberty in comparison with the Gentiles. Not that a
tyrannical or cruel exercise of power oyer strangers was allowed, but that God
would have the race of Abraham, whose liberator lie was, exempted by certain
privileges from the common
lot.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>47.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And if a sojourner or a stranger</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A
caution is here introduced as to the Israelites who had enslaved themselves to
strangers. But by strangers understand only those who inhabited the land of
Canaan; for, if any one ]lad been carried away into other countries, God would
have enacted this law as to their redemption in vain. A power, therefore, of
redeeming the slave is granted to his relatives, or, if he had himself obtained
sufficient to pay his price, the same permission is accorded to himself. The
mode and the form of this are then expressed: that a calculation of the time
which remained before the jubilee should be made, and the period which had
already elapsed should be subtracted from the sum, viz., if he had been sold for
fifty shekels he should only pay ten shekels in the fortieth year, because only
a fifth part of the time remained. But if none of his family aided him, and the
unhappy man's hope of redemption was frustrated, He commands that he should be
set free in the jubilee year, in which a general enfranchisement took place as
regarded the children of Abraham. The object of the law was, that none of those
whom God had adopted, should be alienated from their race, and thus should
depart from the true worship of God Himself. The whole of this is comprehended
in the last verse, where God declares that the children of Abraham were His
property, inasmuch as He had led them forth from the land of Egypt, and, on the
other hand, that He is their peculiar God. For, whilst it was just that they
should enjoy His blessing, so also it behooved that they should be kept sound in
His pure and undivided worship; whereas, if they had been the slaves of
Gentiles, not only would the elect people have been diminished in numbers, but
circumcision would have been corrupted and a door opened to impious perversions.
Yet God so mitigates His law as to lay no unjust burden upon sojourners, since
He concedes more to them, with respect to Hebrew slaves, than to the natives of
the land; for if they had sold themselves to their brethren, they went forth
free in the seventh year, whilst their slavery under sojourners was extended to
the fiftieth year. This exception only was introduced that the stranger who had
bought slaves should enfranchise them on the payment of their value. Since God
had previously promised to His people a large and manifold abundance of all good
things, the poverty here adverted to could only occur from the curse of
God;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we see, therefore, that of His
incomparable loving-kindness He stretches forth His hand to the transgressors of
His law; and, whilst He chastises them with poverty, still looks upon them,
unworthy as they are, and provides a remedy for the ills which their own guilt
had brought upon them.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The land shall not be sold
for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since the reason for this law was
peculiar to the children of Abraham, its provisions can hardly be applied to
other nations; for so equal a partition of the land was made under Joshua, that
the inheritance was distributed amongst the several tribes and families; nay, in
order that each man's possession should be more sacred, the land had been
divided by lot, as if God by His own hand located them in their separate
stations. In fact, that allotment was, as it were, an inviolable <i>decree</i>
of God Himself, whereby the memory of the covenant should be maintained, by
which the inheritance of the land had been promised to Abraham and his
posterity; and thus the land of Canaan was an earnest, or symbol, or mirror, of
the adoption on which their salvation was founded. Wherefore it is not to be
wondered at that God was unwilling that this inestimable benefit should ever be
lost; and, lest this should be the case, like a provident father of a family, He
laid a restraint on His children, to prevent them from being too prodigal; for,
when a man has any suspicions of his heir, he forbids him to alienate the
patrimony he leaves him. Such, therefore, was the condition of the ancient
people; yet it cannot be indiscriminately transferred to other nations who have
had no common inheritance given them. Some vestige of it appears in the right of
redemption;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f156</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but, because that depends on the consent
of the parties, and is also a special mode of contract, it has nothing to do
with the law of Moses, which entirely restored both men and lands, (in the year
of jubilee,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f157
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) That God should call the land of Canaan
<i>His</i>, is, as it were, to assert His direct
Lordship</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f158</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (<i>dominium</i>,) as they call it, over
it; as He immediately afterwards more clearly expresses His meaning, where He
says that the children of Israel sojourn in it as His
guests.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f159</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For although their condition was the
best in which just and perpetual owners can be placed, still, as respected God,
they were but His tenants (<i>coloni</i>,) only living there at His will. In
fine, God claims the freehold (<i>fundum</i>) for Himself, lest the recollection
of tits having granted it to them should ever escape
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in all the land of your
possession</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before the jubilee came, He permits
not only the relations to redeem land sold by a poor man, but the seller also,
if no other redeemer interposed. The same power was also given to relations
amongst other nations, though with a different object, viz., the preservation of
the family name; still, the seller was never allowed to redeem, unless a special
clause to that effect was contained in the contract. But God desired that the
lands should be retained by their legal possessor, in order that the people
might deviate as little as possible from the division made by Joshua. Meanwhile,
He had in view the private advantage of individuals; but in the perpetual
succession to the land He considered Himself rather than men, in order that the
recollection of His kindness should never be lost. Finally, He orders all lands
to return in the year of jubilee to their original owners; and all sales to be
cancelled, as if, in the fiftieth year, he renewed the lot for the division of
the land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if a man sell a
dwelling-house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He here distinguishes houses
from lands, providing that the power of redemption should not extend beyond a
year; and also, that the purchase should hold good even in the jubilee. A second
distinction, however, is also added between different kinds of houses, viz.,
that houses in towns might be altogether alienated, whilst the condition of
those in the country should be the same as that of the lands themselves, as
being annexed so as to form part of them. As regarded houses fix towns, because
they were sometimes burdensome to their owners, it was an advantage that they
might pass into the hands of the rich who were competent to bear the expenses of
building. Besides, a house does not supply daily food like a field, and it is
more tolerable to be without a house than a field, in which you may work, and
from the cultivation of which you may support yourself and family. But it was
necessary to except houses in the country, because they were appendages to the
land; for what use would there be in harvesting the fruits, if you had no place
to store them in? Nay, what would it profit to possess a farm which you could
not cultivate? for how could oxen plough without any stalls in its vicinity?
Since, then, lands without farm-buildings or cottages are almost useless, and
they cannot be conveniently separated, justly did God appoint that, in the year
of Jubilee, every rural possession should revert to its former
owner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Notwithstanding the cities of
the Levites</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Another exception, that the
Levites should recover the houses they had sold, either by the right of
redemption, or gratuitously in the year of jubilee. And this is not only
appointed out of favor to them, but because it concerned the whole people, that
they should be posted like sentries in the place which God had assigned to them.
As to the suburbs, or the lands destined for the support of their cattle, God
forbids their alienation, because thus they would have forsaken their proper
station and removed elsewhere; whereas it was of importance to the whole people
that such a dispersion should not occur.</font><br></div>

employ them in the siege:	<b>19.</b> Si obsederis urbem, diebus multis pugnando

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou shalt besiege a

this precept to the Eighth Commandment, for when God lays a restraint on the
liberty of inflicting injuries in the very heat of war, with respect to felling
trees, much more did He desire His people to abstain from all mischievous acts
in time of peace. The sum is, that although the laws of war opened the gate to
plunder and rapine, still they were to beware, as much as possible, lest the
land being desolated, it should be barren for the future; in short, that the
booty was so to be taken from the enemy, as that the advantage of the human race
should still be considered, and that posterity might still be nourished by the
trees which do not quickly arrive at the age of fruit-bearing. He commands them
to spare fruit-trees, first of all, for this reason, because they supply food to
all men; and thus the blessing of God is manifested in them. He then adds, as a
second reason, that trees are exposed to everybody, whereby He signifies that
war should not be waged with them as with men. This passage is indeed variously
explained, but the sense which I have chosen accords very well and appears to be
the right one. For,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino"> is

yet, in my opinion, the sentence is to be taken interrogatively. But
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>matzor</i>, signifies rather a bulwark than a siege. God, therefore,
indirectly reproves the stupidity and madness of men, who, when in arms, exert
their strength against a tree which does not move from its place, but waits to
meet them. Thus the open field is contrasted with the bulwark. Meanwhile, God
permits ramparts and palisadoes, and other machines used in sieges, to be made
of trees which do not bear fruit, and only provides that the tempest of war,
which ought to be momentary, should not strip the land of its ornaments for many
years. Still, there is no such strict rule laid down as that a fruit-tree may
not be cut down if necessity demands it; but God restrains the Israelites from
giving way to destruction and devastation under the impulse of anger and hatred,
and in forgetfulness of the calls of humanity.</font><br></div>

separate this sentence from the foregoing context which I have explained
elsewhere;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for Moses there gave instructions how a
captive woman was to be taken to wife if her beauty attracted a Jewish husband.
That law then had reference to chastity and conjugal fidelity, and especially to
the purity of God's worship; but now Moses prescribes that, if a man have
dishonored a captive woman, he should not sell her, but let her go free, and by
this satisfaction wipe out, or at any rate diminish, the injury. Hence we infer
that this rule of justice depends on the Eighth Commandment, Let none defraud
another. This condition was at least tolerable for the captive; for, although
chastity is a special treasure, yet liberty, which is justly called an
inestimable blessing, was no trifling consolation to her. The penalty, then, of
lust, was that the conqueror should lose his
booty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a man have two
wives</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Inasmuch as it is here provided that a
father should not unjustly transfer what belongs to one son to another, it is a
part and supplement of the Eighth Commandment, the substance of which is, that
every one's rights should be preserved to him. For, if the father substituted
another son in the place of his first-born, it was unquestionably a kind of
theft. But, since it rarely happens that a father unnaturally degrades his
first-born from his precedence, if all are born of the same mother, God reminds
us that He did not enact this law without cause; for, where polygamy was
allowed, the mind of the husband was generally most inclined to the second wife;
because, if he had loved the first with true affection, he would have been
contented with her as the companion of his life and bed, and would not have
thought of a second. When, therefore, the husband grew tired of his first wife,
and desired a second, he might be coaxed by her blandishments to leave away from
the children of his first marriage what naturally belonged to them. Hence,
therefore, the necessity of the remedy whereby the father's power of altering
the right of primogeniture is barred; for, although they might allege that they
only gave what was their own, yet it was an act of ungodly arrogance to reject
him whom God had deigned to honor. For he who arrogates such power to himself,
or who assigns the birth-right to whom he will, almost arrogates to himself the
ability to create. This right, as is stated in verse 17, was a double portion of
the paternal inheritance. The reason which is added, is equivalent to saying,
that the first-born is the principal honor and ornament of the father. Still, if
there was a just cause for disinheriting the first-born, another successor might
be substituted in his stead, as Jacob shewed in his case when he disinherited
Reuben.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:4.) When it is said, "<i>before</i> the son of the hated," some expound it to
mean "during his lifetime;" others retain the Hebrew phrase, "before his face."
Their opinion, however, is probable, who take this particle comparatively, for
"instead of her son." The wife is called hated, not that her husband is
positively her enemy, but because he loves her least; for contempt is considered
as hatred, and he is called an enemy who does not render conjugal
benevolence.</font><br></div>

"<i>quum</i> <i>bellandum</i> <i>erit</i>," (when there shall be war,) that my
readers may know what is the subject here discussed; for although the
instruction given may seem somewhat remote from the prohibition of theft, still
it accords well, and is closely connected with it. For by this indulgence God
shews how just it is, that every one should enjoy peaceably what he possesses;
because, if it be hard that men on account of war should be deprived of the use
of their new house, or of the produce of their vineyard, how much more harsh and
intolerable it will be to deprive men of their fortunes, or to drive them from
the lands which they justly call their own! Since, therefore, it is expedient
for the state that vineyards should be sown or planted, and that houses should
be built, whilst men would not address themselves to these duties with
sufficient alacrity, unless encouraged by the hope of enjoying them, God gives
them the privilege of exemption from fighting, if they be owners of new houses
which they have not yet inhabited. He makes also the same appointment as to
possessors of vineyards, if they have not yet tasted of the fruit of their
labor, and will not have men torn from their affianced wives until they have
enjoyed their embraces. A different principle applies to a fourth class, because
the faint-hearted and lazy are not deserving that God should have consideration
for their cowardice, when they shun dangers to be incurred for the public
welfare; but because it concerns the whole people that soldiers should go forth
readily to war, God will not have more required from any one than he is disposed
to bear. We now understand the substance of this passage, viz., that, when every
man's right is asserted to enjoy what he possesses, it extends so far as that a
man who has built a house should not be dragged unwillingly to war, until by
dwelling in it he shall have received some advantage from the expenses incurred.
To make a vineyard
common,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or to profane it, is equivalent to
applying the vintage to the common uses of life; for it was not lawful, as we
saw under the First
Commandment,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to gather its first-fruits, as if it
were as yet uncircumcised; therefore the recompence for their industry and
diligence is made when those who have planted vines are thus set free, until
they have enjoyed some of their produce. As regards the betrothed, although it
seems to have been an indulgence granted in honor of marriage, that they should
return to the wives whom they had not yet enjoyed, yet it is probable that they
were not torn away from the dearest of all possessions, in order that every
man's property should be maintained. Besides, if the hope of progeny were taken
away, the inheritance would be thus transferred to others, which would have been
tantamount to diverting it from its rightful owner. We have said that the lazy
and timid were sent home, that the Israelites might learn that none were to be
pressed beyond their ability; and this also depends upon that rule of
equity</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If brethren dwell together,
and one of them die</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This law has some
similarity with that which permits a betrothed person to return to the wife,
whom he has not yet taken; since the object of both is to preserve to every man
what he possesses, so that he may not be obliged to leave it to strangers, but
that he may have heirs begotten of his own body: for, when a son succeeds to the
father, whom he represents, there seems to be hardly any change made. Hence,
too, it is manifest how greatly pleasing to God it is that no one should be
deprived of his property, since He makes a provision even for the dying, that
what they could not resign to others without regret and annoyance, should be
preserved to their offspring. Unless, therefore, his kinsman should obviate the
dead man's childlessness, this inhumanity is accounted a kind of theft. For,
since to be childless was a curse of God, it was a consolation in this condition
to hope for a borrowed offspring, that the name might not be altogether
extinct.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since we now understand the intention
of the law, we must also observe that the word <i>brethren</i> does not mean
actual brothers, but cousins, and other kinsmen, whose marriage with the widows
of their relative would not have been incestuous; otherwise God would contradict
Himself. But these two things are quite compatible, that no one should uncover
the nakedness of his brother, and yet that a widow should not marry out of her
husband's family, until she had raised up seed to him from some relation. In
fact, Boaz did not marry Ruth because he was the brother of her deceased
husband, but only his near kinsman. If any should object that it is not probable
that other kinsmen should dwell together, I reply that this passage is
improperly supposed to refer to actual living together, as if they dwelt in the
same house, but that the precept is merely addressed to relations, whose near
residence rendered it convenient to take the widows to their own homes; for, if
any lived far away, liberty was accorded to both to seek the fulfillment of the
provision elsewhere. Surely it is not probable that God would have authorized an
incestuous marriage, which He had before expressed His abomination of. Nor can
it be doubted, as I have above stated, but that the like necessity was imposed
upon the woman of offering herself to the kinsman of her former husband; and
although there was harshness in this, still she seemed to owe this much to his
memory, that she should willingly raise up seed to the deceased; yet, if any one
think differently, I will not contend the point with him. If, however, she were
not obliged to do so, it was absurd that she should voluntarily obtrude herself:
nor was there any other reason why she should bring to trial the kinsman, from
whom she had suffered a repulse, except that she might acquire the liberty of
marrying into another family. Yet it is not probable that he was to be condemned
to an ignominious punishment, without being admitted to make his defense,
because sometimes just reasons for refusal might be alleged. This disgrace,
therefore, was only a penalty for inhumanity or avarice. By giving up his shoe,
he renounced his right of relationship, and gave it up to another: for, by
behaving so unkindly towards the dead, he became unworthy of reaping any of the
advantages of his relationship.</font><br></div>

down by calumnies and false accusations. The same <i>synecdoche</i> exists here,
which I have pointed out in the previous Commandments, for God comprises many
things under a single head. With reference to the words, inasmuch as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gned</i>, properly means a witness, it may be literally translated, "Thou
shalt not answer a false witness against thy neighbor," but then the particle
<i>as</i> must be supplied. The Hebrews poorly translate it in the vocative
case, Thou shalt not speak, O false witness,
etc.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although God seems only to prescribe that no one, for the purpose of injuring
the innocent, should go into court, and publicly testify against him, yet it is
plain that the faithful are prohibited from all false accusations, and not only
such as are circulated in the streets, but those which are stirred in private
houses and secret corners. For it would be absurd, when God has already shewn
that men's fortunes are cared for by Him, that He should neglect their
reputation, which is much more precious. In whatever way, therefore, we injure
our neighbors by unjustly defaming them, we are accounted false witnesses before
God. We must now pass on from the prohibitive to the affirmative precept: for it
will not be enough for us to restrain our tongues from speaking evil, unless we
are also kind and equitable towards our neighbors, and candid interpreters of
their acts and words, and do not suffer them, as far as in us lies, to be
burdened with false reproaches. Besides, God does not only forbid us to invent
accusations against the innocent, but also to give currency to reproaches and
sinister reports in malevolence or hatred. Such a person may perhaps deserve his
ill-name, and we may truly lay such or such an accusation to his charge; but if
the reproach be the ebullition of our anger, or the accusation proceed from
ill-will, it will be vain for us to allege in excuse that we have advanced
nothing but, what is true. For when Solomon says that "love covereth many sins;"
whereas "hatred brings reproaches to
light,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f166</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:12;) he signifies, as a faithful expositor of this precept, that we are only
free from falsehood when the reputation of our neighbors suffers no damage from
us; for, if the indulgence of evil-speaking violates charity, it is opposed to
the Law of God. In short, we must conclude that by these words a restraint is
laid on all virulence of language which tends to bring disgrace on our brethren;
and on all petulance also, whereby their good name suffers injury; and on all
detractions, which flow from malice, or envy, and rivalry, or any other improper
feeling. We must also go further, and not be suspicious or too curious in
observing the defects of others; for such eager inquisitiveness betrays
malevolence, or at any rate an evil disposition. For, if love is not suspicious,
he who condemns his neighbor either falsely, or upon trifling surmises, or who
holds him in light esteem, is undoubtedly a transgressor of this Commandment.
Consequently, we must close our ears against false and evil speaking; since he
is just as injurious to his brother who eagerly listens to sinister reports
respecting him, as he who exercises his tongue in maligning him. The necessity
of this instruction let each man estimate by his own disposition; for scarcely
one in a hundred will be found who will be as kind in sparing the character of
others, as he himself desires to be pardoned for manifest vices; nay, slander is
often praised under the pretext of zeal and conscientiousness. Hence it happens
that this vice insinuates itself even among the saints, creeping in under the
name of virtue. Moreover, the volubility of the tongue causes us to think it a
light transgression to inflict a deadly and disgraceful wound on our brother, to
whom, nevertheless, his good name is of more importance than his life. The sum
is, that we should manifest our charity no less by candor, and by abstaining
from slander, than by the performance of other duties.</font><br></div>

not <i>raise</i>, or <i>stir</i> <i>up</i>: and, if this be preferred, God
forbids us to invent calumnies; but, if we read, Thou shalt not receive, He will
go further, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that none should cherish, or confirm the lie of
another by his support of it. For it has been stated that sin may thus be
committed in two ways: either when the wicked invent false accusations, or when
other over-credulous persons eagerly associate themselves with them; and thus
either sense would be very applicable, that the original authors are condemned,
who raise a false report, or those who help on their wickedness, and give it, as
it were, their endorsement. But, since it immediately follows, "put not thine
hand with" them, I willingly embrace the version, "Thou shalt not receive," in
order that the two clauses may combine the better. Indeed Moses uses this word
with great propriety, for a lie would soon come to nothing from its own
emptiness, and fall to the ground, if it were not taken up and supported by the
unrighteous consent of others. God, therefore, recalls His people from this
wicked conspiracy,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> lest by their assistance they should
spread abroad false accusations; and calls those false witnesses who traduce
their neighbors by lending their hand to the ungodly: because there is but
little difference between raising a calumny and keeping it
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be thought preferable to restrict the
second verse to judges, it would be a Supplement to the Sixth Commandment as
well as the Eighth, viz., that none should willingly give way to the unjust
opinions of others, which might affect either the means or the life of an
innocent person. But, inasmuch as the error of those who are too credulous is
reproved by it, whence it arises that falsehood prevails, and calumniators throw
what is clear into obscurity, it finds a fit place
here.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep thee far from a false

which brings about the death of the innocent, some might perhaps prefer that
this passage should be annexed to the Sixth Commandment; but this is easily
solved; for Moses is expressly condemning false-witness, and at the same time
instances one case of it, whereby it may appear how detestable a crime it is,
viz., the slaying of a brother by calumny, because the false witness rather
kills him with his tongue than the executioner with his sword. Although,
therefore, it is a gross act of inhumanity to lie in general against one's
brother, yet is its atrocity increased if he be put to death by perjury; because
murder is thus combined with perfidy. A threat follows, whereby God summons
false-witnesses before His tribunal, where they who have brought the good into
peril by their falsehoods shall not escape with impunity.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not go up and

same as that of the foregoing verse, for it is added to a general precept,
whereby detraction is condemned: and much more ought we to be deterred from it,
whilst we acknowledge that our tongue is thus armed cruelly to shed innocent
blood. Some suppose that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lykr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>racil</i>, is metaphorically taken from merchants, because the tale-bearer or
whisperer</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f169</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is no less busy in hunting for false
reports, which he may afterwards circulate, than the merchant is diligently bent

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">g</font><font face="Palatino">
into
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">;
and that thus the word is derived from the <i>feet</i>; because calumniators are
always wandering about to hunt for grounds of detraction; and therefore is
always joined with a verb which signifies to walk. I do not think, however, that
it is always used in the same sense; for when Ezekiel reproves the Israelites,
because there were always men called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lykr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>racil</i>, among them, to shed
blood,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
22:9.) Some also translate it spies. Meanwhile, I doubt not, but that Moses, in
this passage, designates those vagabonds, who too eagerly run about hither and
thither, and in their malignant inquisitiveness penetrate into everybody's
secrets, to bring quiet people into trouble. In short, we are taught that they
are <i>accounted</i> false witnesses before God, whosoever by the virulence of
their tongue bring their brethren into danger and
inconvenience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke
thy neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because many, under the pretext
of conscientiousness, are not only rigid censors of others, but also burst out
in the open proclamation of their defects, Moses seeks to prevent this
preposterous zeal, shewing how they may best restrain it, not by encouraging sin
through their connivance or silence, whilst they are still far from
evil-speaking. For those who labor under this disease of carping and
vituperating, are wont to object that sins are nourished by silence, unless all
are eager in reproving them; and hence their ardor in exclaiming against them
and deriding them. But Moses points out a more useful remedy, that they should
bring back wanderers into the way by private rebukes, and not by publishing
their offenses. For whosoever triumphs in the infamy of his brother,
precipitates his ruin as far as in him lies; whereas a well-regulated zeal
consults the welfare of one who is ruining himself. Therefore we are commanded
to rebuke the wandering, and not to regard our brethren as enemies. A similar
course is prescribed by Christ, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go
and tell him his fault between thee and him alone."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

arrogant and cruel. The word

of slander, God here appoints the punishment to be inflicted for perjury: for
political laws are enacted against the ungodly and disobedient, in order that
those who despise God's judgment should be brought before the tribunal of men.
Although perjury is not here ordained to be tried before the judges, unless
there should be an accuser, who should complain that he had been unjustly
injured by false-witness, still reason dictates, that if any man have been
condemned to death by false-witnesses, the judges should not hesitate to make an
official inquiry into the matter. Yet, inasmuch as men are generally disposed to
assert their own innocence, God has deemed it sufficient to put the case, that
if any complaint should be lodged, the judges should diligently investigate it,
and if the crime be proved, should inflict the punishment of retaliation
(<i>talionis</i>.) Whence it appears that false-witnesses and murderers stand in
the same light before God. By commanding that the inquiry should be made not
only by the judges, but also by the priests, as if God Himself were present, He
shews that He requires unusual diligence to be used; because a secret crime is

sufficiently forbidden us to set our hearts on the property of others, to

ungodly desires either of fornication or theft. The question, however, occurs,
&#8212; since it has been said before that, agreeably to the nature of the
Lawgiver, the inward purity of the heart is everywhere required, and therefore,
that under the head of adultery, not only are all filthy acts prohibited, but
secret unchastity also; and under the head of theft, all unlawful appetite for
gain, &#8212; why does God now forbid in His people the lust for theft and
fornication? For it seems to be a superfluous repetition which would be very
absurd in ten short precepts, wherein God has embraced the whole rule of life,
so that their very brevity might render it, easy, and the better attract their
readers to learn them. Still, on the other hand, it must be remembered that,
although it was God's design, by the whole Law, to arouse men's feelings to
sincere obedience of it, yet such is their hypocrisy and indifference, that it
was necessary to stimulate them more sharply, and to press them more closely,
lest they should seek for subterfuges under pretense of the obscurity of the
doctrine. For if they had only heard, Thou shalt not kill, nor commit
fornication, nor steal, they might have supposed that their duty would have been
fully performed by mere outward observance. It was not then in vain that God,
after having treated of piety and justice, should give a separate admonition,
that they were not only to abstain from evil doing, but also, that what He had
previously commanded should be performed with the sincere affection of the
heart. Hence Paul gathers from this Commandment, that the whole "Law is
spiritual,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:7 and 14,) because God, by His condemnation of lust, sufficiently shewed that
He not only imposed obedience on our hands and feet, but also put restraint upon
our minds, lest they should desire to do what is unlawful. Paul confesses, too,
that whereas he before slept in easy self-deceit, he was awakened by this single
word; for since he was blameless in the eyes of men, he was persuaded that he
was righteous before God: He says that he was once alive, as if the Law were
absent or dead, because, being puffed up with confidence in his righteousness,
he expected salvation by his works; but, when he perceived what the Commandment,
Thou shalt not covet, meant, the dead Law was raised as it were to life, and he
died, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., he was convinced he was a transgressor, and saw the
sure curse overhanging him. Nor did he perceive himself to be guilty of one or
two sins, but then, at length, he was shaken out of his torpor, when he
recognized that all the evil desires, of which he was conscious, must be
accounted for before God, whereas he had before been satisfied with the mere
outward appearance of virtue. We now perceive, therefore, that there is nothing
inappropriate in the general condemnation of concupiscence by a distinct
commandment; for after God has broadly and popularly laid down rules for moral
integrity, at length He ascends to the fountain itself, and at the same time
points out with His finger, as it were, the root from which all evil and corrupt
fruits spring forth. It must here be added that something more is expressed by
the words coveting and wishing for, or desiring, than a <i>desiderium</i>
<i>formatum</i>, as it is commonly called; for the flesh often tempts us to wish
for this or that, so that the evil concupiscence betrays itself, although
consent may not yet be added. Since, therefore, the
sin</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the will had been already condemned,
God now proceeds further, and puts a restraint upon evil desires before they
prevail.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> James points out these progressive
steps, where he says that lust conceives before it begets sin; and then "sin,
when it is finished, bringeth forth death,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:15,) for the begetting of which he speaks, is not only in the external act but
in the will itself, before it has assented to the temptation. I admit, indeed,
that the corrupt thoughts which arise spontaneously, and so also vanish before
they affect the mind, do not come into account before God; yet, although we do
not actually acquiesce in the evil desire, still, if it affects us pleasantly,
it is sufficient to render us guilty. In order that this may be understood
better, all temptations are, as it were, so many fans; if they hurry us on into
consent, the fire is lighted; but, if they only awaken the heart to corrupt
desires, concupiscence betrays itself in these sparks, although it neither
acquires its full warmth nor breaks forth into a flame. Concupiscence,
therefore, is never without desire (<i>affectu</i>,) although the will may not
altogether yield. Hence it appears what entire perfection of righteousness we
must bring in order to satisfy the Law, since not only are we commanded not to
will anything, except what is right and pleasing to God, but also that no impure
desire should affect our hearts. Nor would Paul have laid such great stress upon
this precept if the Law condemned no concupiscence except that which takes such
hold on the mind of man as to exercise dominion over it; for the sin of the will
must ever be condemned even by heathen philosophers, nay, and by earthly
legislators also; but he says that the Law, by resisting concupiscence, makes
sin to "become exceeding sinful."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:13.) Now, it is not credible that, at the time in which he confesses that he
knew not what concupiscence was, he was so senseless and stupid as to think no
harm of wishing to kill a man, or of being inclined through lust to commit
adultery with his brother's wife; but, if he was not unaware that the will to
sin was vicious, it follows that the concupiscence in which he saw no harm was
some more hidden disease. Hence, too, it is manifest under what delusion Satan
must have held all the Popish
schools</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> through which echoes this axiom, that
concupiscence is no sin in the baptized, because it is a stimulus to the
exercise of virtue; as if Paul did not openly condemn c<i>oncupiscence</i>,
which entraps us in its snares, although we do not altogether assent to
it.</font><br></div>

he says, had "turned aside unto vain jangling," when they swerved from that

heads, that we should love God with all our heart, and our neighbor as
ourselves; for, although he does not unite the two in one passage, yet Christ,
by whose Spirit he spoke, ought to suffice to explain to us his intention,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

replied that the first indeed was, that God should be loved, and the second like
unto it, regarding the love of our neighbor; as if He had said, that the whole
perfection of righteousness, which is set before us in the Law, consists of two
parts, that we should serve God with true piety, and conduct ourselves
innocently towards men according to the rule of charity. The same is the sense
of Paul's words, for the faith, which is there called the source and origin of
charity, comprehends in it the love of God. At any rate, the declaration of
Christ stands sure, that nothing is required of us by the Law, but that we
should love God, together with our neighbors. From hence a short and clear
definition may be laid down, that nothing is required unto a good life except
piety and justice.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

of envy and malice, breathe out threatenings and cruelty, and are abandoned to

Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy

with all thy heart and all thy soul?" For, although he further eulogizes the
Law, because it prescribes nothing which nature does not itself dictate to be
most certain and most just, and which experience itself does not shew us to be
more profitable, or more desirable than anything else, still, at the same time,
he reminds us what is the means by which it is to be
kept.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Therefore he sets before us at the same
time the fear and the love of God; for, inasmuch as God is the Lord, He justly
desires to be feared in right of His dominion; and, inasmuch as He is our
Father, He requires to be loved, as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi

that we must begin with the fear of God, which is hence called the "beginning of
wisdom."

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;200910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
9:10.) But, since God has no pleasure in extorted and forced obedience, love is
immediately added. And this deserves to be well weighed, that whereas there is
nothing pleasanter than to love God, still it always occupies the first place in
all His service. Surely he must be more than iron-hearted who is not attracted
by such kindness; since, for no other cause, does He invite and exhort us to
love Him, than because He loveth us; nay, He has already prevented us with His
love, as is said in

this voluntary and hearty inclination to obey, such as we see in good and
ingenuous children, who take delight in subjection to their parents, ought to be
extended to all the actions of our lives. And assuredly the reverence which is
paid to God flows from no other source than the tasting of His paternal love
towards us, whereby we are drawn to love Him in return; as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

we may willingly and with becoming cheerfulness acquiesce in what He
commands.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The perfection which is here required
shews with sufficient clearness how far we are from a thorough obedience to the
Law. We are commanded to love God with all our heart, and soul, and strength.
However much we strive, our efforts are weak and imperfect, unless the love of
God has possession of all our senses, and all our desires and thoughts are
altogether devoted to Him, whilst all our endeavors are also directed to Him
alone. But every one is abundantly convinced by his own experience, in how many
ways our minds are carried away to vanity; how many corrupt affections creep
over us; how difficult it is for us to restrain and overcome the evil motions of
our flesh. Surely the very best wrestler, with all his strivings, is hardly able
to make advances in this spiritual warfare; and if it be a great attainment not
to faint altogether, certainly none will dare to boast that he comes near the
mark which is set before us in the Law. In short, whenever worldly snares and
foolish appetites insinuate themselves upon us, we must so often feel that some
part of our soul is empty of the love of God, since otherwise nothing repugnant
to it would penetrate there. The word <i>heart</i>
here,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

but because this signification was not commonly in use among the Greeks, they
have not hesitated to add a word of their own in explanation. Those, however,
who are well acquainted with the teaching of Moses, are not ignorant that the
word <i>heart</i> is equivalent to <i>mind</i>; for he elsewhere says, "The Lord

purpose to stir up the fire which already burns too fiercely. Naturally, as I
have said, we are blinded by our immoderate self-love; and God, in order to turn
us away from this, has substituted our neighbors, whom we are to love no less

Law</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Inasmuch as in the Law the difference between good
and evil is set forth, it is given for the regulation of the life of men, so
that it may be justly called the rule of living well and righteously. This
object of the Law is known to almost all men, because all confess without
controversy that God here prescribes what is right, lest we should wander all
our lifetime in uncertainty; for since His will is the perfect law of
righteousness, it can alone direct us to the mark. The knowledge of good and
evil is indeed imprinted by nature on men, whereby they are rendered
inexcusable; nor has any amount of barbarism ever so extinguished this light as
that no form of law should exist. But, since the main principle of righteousness
is to obey God, it was by special privilege that He deposited with His elect
people the rule of living aright as a pledge of His adoption. Hence the
declarations which so often occur in the writings of Moses: I command thee to
keep and to do, etc. But, since we are "carnal, sold under sin,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:14,) we are so far from being able to fulfill the Law, which is spiritual,
that all our imaginations are at enmity with its righteousness, as Paul teaches
elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:7.) Those, therefore,
who</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f188</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> content themselves with using it for
instruction, do wrong in confining themselves to this one point, since no
advantage can hence be derived from it, as long as we shall remain in our
corrupt nature. Nay, as soon as the Law presents itself before us, the curse of
God falls upon our heads, as if He smote us with a thunder-bolt from heaven. I
will not heap together all the testimonies to this effect; let one peculiarly
striking passage suffice:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The law
(says Paul) is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good: but sin, that
it might appear sin, worketh death in me by that which is good."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
7:12, 13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">What he elsewhere says, that "the law
worketh wrath,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:15,) and that "it was added because of transgressions,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:19,) seems harsh indeed to profane persons, who only judge as philosophers;
yet this is the theological use of the Law, for, by discovering our
unrighteousness, it can bring nothing but death. Here,
however,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f189</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> rebellious questions arise, what use
there could be in prescribing what we are unable to perform: why God should mock
miserable men by imposing a burden whereby they are totally overwhelmed: how it
is consistent that a law should be given for us to keep, and yet that we should
be devoid of strength to do so: if we have not liberty to choose good or evil,
why it should be brought in accusation against us that we yield to the sin to
which we are naturally addicted? The enemies of God are very ingenious in
amassing such calumnies, and eloquent in exaggerating them; but when they have
disgorged all that their rabid dishonesty has dictated, their own conscience
will always abundantly refute them; for they will be compelled to acknowledge
that the Law is just, and that, when they transgress it by voluntary impulse,
they are deservedly condemned. Let them, then, rave against God as they like,
that He unjustly imposes upon them a heavier burden than they are able to bear,
their natural reason will retain them under the conviction, that whatever God
commands to be done for Him is His due. We must now see where the blame lies,
that they are unable to satisfy Him. Surely their efforts to relieve themselves
from it will be vain, because conscience will again make itself felt on the
opposite side, and will hold them fast in the bond of condemnation, from which
there is no escape. But the whole of Scripture teaches that it arises from the
corruption of our nature that all our affections are repugnant to the Law, and
also that, on the other hand, the Law is against us; for Adam, being alienated
from God the fountain of all righteousness, ruined himself and us; and hence it
comes that not only our strength is insufficient to perform the service we owe
to God, but that we are impelled by a blind and headlong impetus to shake off
His yoke. From this Paul infers that we are "under the curse," because the Law
pronounces all transgressors to be accursed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:10.) For ridiculous will be the objection that it is in the power of every
one's free-will not to transgress, because there is nothing to be found in us
which is not corrupt; and, in fact, the stupidity of those is most shameless who
suppose that nothing impossible is commanded, whereas in every trifle, not
merely our weakness, but our
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajdunami&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(powerlessness) betrays itself. But, although Paul says that the
Law</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is deadly to us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6,) yet he vindicates it from all objection, when he shews that
this evil is accidental, and therefore must be imputed to ourselves. Let it
therefore be established, that the Law was given not only for instruction, so
that men might follow what they had learnt from it to be right, but also to
convict them of their iniquity, that they might acknowledge themselves to be
lost; as if they saw in a mirror their destruction through the just vengeance of
God. Now this knowledge would by itself overwhelm all with horrible despair if
they did not emerge from the deep abyss; for, since they are puffed up with vain
confidence, and arrogate to themselves the merit of living righteously, it is
necessary that they should be humbled; first of all, that, being condemned, they
may learn to fly for refuge to God's mercy; and secondly, that being convinced
of their infirmity, they may implore the aid of the Holy Spirit, which in their
security they had before neglected. Hence it appears that it is expedient for
them to be slain by the Law, and that the death which it inflicts is
life-giving. And this occurs in two ways; for, first, being stripped of the
false opinion of their righteousness, wherein they prided themselves, they begin
to seek in Christ what they mistakenly supposed might be found in themselves, so
as to please God by gratuitous reconciliation, whereas they had previously
sought to propitiate Him by the merit of their works; secondly, they learn that
they are not sufficient to perform a single tittle of the Law, unless, being
regenerated by God's Spirit, they who were the slaves of sin live unto
righteousness. And hence, in fine, the utility and fruit of the teaching of the
Law proceeds; for, until we are renewed and God has given us hearts of flesh
instead of hearts of stone, in vain are precepts dinned in our ears, since in
our natural depravity we cordially reject them; but when He has engraved His law
within our hearts, its outward instruction also profits us; for He so governs
His children by the Spirit of reconciliation, as at the same time to will that
they should be attentive and obedient to His voice. Still, because they are
always far from attaining to perfect observance of it, they not only learn from
it what is right, but also that they have need of His gratuitous mercy, that
they may please Him through indulgence and grace, although they are still
conscious of much infirmity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Further, because
Paul seems to abrogate the Law, as if now-a-days it did not concern believers,
we must now see how far this is the case. And, first, indeed, it is easy to
perceive that he does not treat of the Law in the abstract, but sets it forth
invested with those of its qualities, wherein it is opposed to the Gospel; for,
inasmuch as his controversy was with those who interpreted it amiss, he could
not help contrasting the Law with the Gospel, as if they were in opposition to
each other: not that they were really so, if their respective doctrine be
dexterously applied to its proper object, but because such a conflict arose from
the absurd mixture, which the false apostles introduced. They asserted that men
are justified by the works of the Law, and, if this were admitted, the
righteousness of faith was destroyed, and the Gospel fell to the ground. They,
moreover, restored the yoke imposed on the ancient people, as if no liberty had
been obtained by the blood of Christ. In this discussion it was necessary for
Paul to advert only to that which is peculiar to Moses, and distinct from
Christ; for although Christ and Moses perfectly accord in the substance of their
doctrine, still, when they are compared with each other, it is fitting to
distinguish what is peculiar to each. In this respect Paul calls the Law "the
letter,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f191</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because Moses had no other charge than
to speak in the name of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6;) and this in itself is not only useless, but also deadly; for
when the word resounds in the ears only, it produces nothing but condemnation.
Besides, he considers the Law as connected with promises and threatenings.
Whence it follows, that salvation can only be procured by it if its precepts be
exactly fulfilled. Life is indeed promised in it, but only if whatever it
commands be complied with; whilst, on the other hand, it denounces death against
its transgressors, so that to have offended in the slightest point is enough to
condemn and destroy a person; and thus it overwhelms all men with despair.
Lastly, because the ceremonies by which God prepared His ancient people as by
puerile and elementary instruction for the faith of the
Gospel,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f192</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were annexed to the Law, Paul embraces
those also in his comparison between the Law and the Gospel. Hence it follows
that, in so far as Moses is distinguished from Christ, his ministration has
ceased, although his embassy was identical with that which Christ afterwards
discharged. As regards the ceremonies, we must consider that an end was put upon
them by Christ's coming, in such a way as to establish their truth more firmly
than as if they still remained in use: for we acknowledge that in them, as in a
mirror, was formerly shewn to the Fathers, what is now displayed to us in its
reality. Whence it appears that they are greatly mistaken who altogether reject
as useless that instruction which we read in the writings of Moses; and that the
squeamishness of those who despise it is also
intolerable.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f193</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let my readers seek in the Second Book
of my Institutes, Chapter 7., what further tends to the explanation of this
subject.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Sanctions of the
Law</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">contained in the
Promises and Threats</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now come to the conclusion of the Exposition of
the Law, wherein we are to treat of the sanctions of it contained both in the
promises and threats. For, although God might in His own right simply require
what He pleased, yet such is His kindness to men, that He chose to entice them
by promises to obey Him freely. Since, therefore, we are naturally attracted by
the hope of reward, we are slow and lazy, until some fruit appears. Consequently
God voluntarily promises, in order to arouse them from their sloth, that if men
obey His Law, He will repay them. Nor is this an ordinary act of liberality that
He prefers to agree with us for the payment of a recompense, rather than simply
to command by His sovereignty. For we must bear in mind the declaration of
Christ, that when we have fulfilled the whole Law, we still deserve nothing;
since God claims for Himself our entire services.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
17:10.) However we may strive, therefore, even beyond our strength, and devote
ourselves entirely to keep the Law, still God lies under no obligation to us,
except in so far as He has Himself voluntarily agreed, and made Himself our
spontaneous debtor. And this has been pointed out even by the common
theologians, that the reward of good works does not depend upon their dignity or
merit, but upon His
covenant.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Still, as we shall soon see, such
promises would not avail us the least if God rewarded every one according to his
works; but, because this defect is adventitious, God's great mercy nevertheless
shines forth in the fact that he has deigned to encourage us to obedience by
setting before us the hope of eternal life. And hence He reproves the
ingratitude of the Israelites by
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:21; because they had despised His good commandments, of which it was said
that "if a man do them, he should live in
them."</font><br><font face="Palatino">We now perceive how the authority of the
Law was confirmed by the promises; but because we are not only indolent but also
refractory, He added on the other side threats which might inspire terror, both
to subdue the obstinacy of the flesh and to correct the security in which we are
too apt to indulge. It will be expedient now to treat of both.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Leviticus

<div><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Leviticus

rivet in ipsis.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall therefore keep my
statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Moses introduces this
passage, where he exhorts the Israelites to cultivate chastity in respect to
marriage, and not to fall into the incestuous pollutions of the Gentiles, yet,
as it is a remarkable one, and contains general instruction, from whence Paul
derives his definition of the righteousness of the Law,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:5,) it seems to me to come in very appropriately here, inasmuch as it
sanctions and confirms the Law by the promise of reward. The hope of eternal
life is, therefore, given to all who keep the Law; for those who expound the
passage as referring to this earthly and transitory life are
mistaken.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The cause of this error was, because
they feared that thus the righteousness of faith might be subverted, and
salvation grounded on the merit of works. But Scripture does not therefore deny
that men are justified by works, because the Law itself is imperfect, or does
not give instructions for perfect righteousness; but because the promise is made
of none effect by our corruption and sin. Paul, therefore, as I have just said,
when he teaches that righteousness is to be sought for in the grace of Christ by
faith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:4,) proves his statement by this argument, that none is justified who has not
fulfilled what the Law commands. Elsewhere also he reasons by contrast, where he
contends that the Law does not accord with faith as regards the cause of
justification, because the Law requires works for the attainment of salvation,
whilst faith directs us to Christ, that we may be delivered from the curse of
the Law. Foolishly, then, do some reject as an absurdity the statement, that if
a man fulfills the Law he attains to righteousness; for the defect does not
arise from the doctrine of the Law, but from the infirmity of men, as is plain
from another testimony given by Paul.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:3.) We must observe, however, that salvation is not to be expected from the
Law unless its precepts be in every respect complied with; for life is not
promised to one who shall have done this thing, or that thing, but, by the
plural word, full obedience is required of us. The pratings of the Popish
theologians about partial righteousness are frivolous and silly, since God
embraces at once all the commandments; and who is there that can boast of having
thoroughly fulfilled them? If, then, none was ever clear of transgression, or
ever will be, although God by no means deceives us, yet the promise becomes
ineffectual, because we do not perform our part of the
agreement.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses charged the people
the same day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In order that both the promises
and threats might have more efficacy in affecting the minds of all, God enjoined
not only that they should be proclaimed in a solemn rite, but also that they
should be approved by the people in a loud voice, and sealed, as it were, by
their consent. It is elsewhere recorded that this was faithfully performed by
Joshua.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;060833&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
8:33.) Let it suffice to say at present that they were all summoned, and
conducted before God to subscribe to them, so that henceforth all subterfuge
might be put an end to. The tribes of Israel were divided into two parties, that
they might stand opposite to each other, and that the blessings might sound
forth from one side, and the curses from the
other,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> like
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;strofoi</font><font face="Palatino">.
I confess I do not know why the descendants of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar,
Joseph, and Benjamin, were chosen by God to proclaim the blessings, rather than
the others;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f197</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for there is no force in the opinion of
the Hebrew writers that those who descended from free mothers were placed in the
post of highest dignity: since the tribe of the first-born, Reuben, was united
with some who sprang from the bond-maids; unless, perhaps, we may say that the
descendants of Reuben were degraded into the second class as a mark of ignominy;
but, since both the blessings and curses were offered in the name of the whole
people, it is not a point of much importance. For, if this
division</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was made to bear witness to their common
consent, it was equivalent to their all alike confessing that the transgressors
of the Law were accursed, and those who kept it blessed; and consequently I am
not very curious to know why, in their common office, God preferred some to the
others. Moses will elsewhere relate that the tribes, which are here separated,
were then united together. It would perhaps be a probable conjecture that God,
who well knew what would hereafter be the inheritance of every tribe, placed
them severally in that station which would correspond to their future
allotment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order that the sanction might have
more solemnity, God chose that the Levites should dictate the words as if He
Himself spoke from heaven; for, since they were appointed to be the expounders
of the Law, as it behooved them faithfully to repeat what God had dictated out
of His own mouth, so they were heard with greater attention and
reverence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed be the man that maketh
any graven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence it appears that Moses is
silent as to the half (of what he had spoken of
before;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f199
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) for no mention is made of the
blessings</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which occupied before the first place.
Perhaps the Spirit would indirectly rebuke the wickedness of the people, from
whence it arose that He was not at liberty to proclaim the praises conveyed in
the blessings; for, when they ought to have embraced cheerfully the reward
promised to them, their ungodliness deprived them of this honor; and nothing
remained but that they should submit themselves to the just punishment of their
iniquities. Meanwhile, it cannot be doubted but that they were taught by the
forms of cursing which we here read what course was to be observed in blessing.
For, when God pronounces His condemnation of transgressors, we may hence infer
that the hope of blessedness is laid up for His true servants, if any fulfill
His law. Besides, in the list of curses here recorded, a <i>synecdoche</i> is to
be observed, since no special curse is separately denounced against blasphemers,
perjurers, Sabbath-breakers, slanderers, and adulterers. It is plain, therefore,
that some kinds of crime which were worthy of the greatest abomination, were
selected, in order that the people might learn from hence that transgression
against any particular of the Law would not be unpunished; for, by speaking of
graven images, God undoubtedly defends His worship from all pollutions; and thus
this curse extends to every breach of the First Table. Moreover, when He
threatens to punish secret sins, we may readily infer that, although offenders
might be hidden from earthly judges, and escape from their hands a hundred
times, still God would be the avenger of His polluted worship. If any had put an
idol in a secret place, or had smitten his neighbor secretly, he will not suffer
the punishment which cannot be inflicted unless his crime be detected, and he is
convicted of the offense; but, lest impunity should encourage any one to become
obdurate in sin, the people are summoned before the heavenly tribunal of God,
that they may be retained in the path of duty, not only by the fear of
punishment, but for conscience-sake. Whence, again, it is clear that God did not
only deliver a political Law, which should merely direct their outward morals,
but one which would require true sincerity of
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed be he that setteth

to our father and mother. Then He mentions such thefts as generally escape the
knowledge of men; as also, He only adverts to those acts of fornication which
are anxiously concealed on account of their filthiness. To have connection with
a beast, with one's mother-in-law, or step-mother, or sister, is so unnatural
and detestable a crime, that it is generally concealed more carefully. But God
admonishes us that, whatever modes of concealment the sinner shall adopt, they
will profit him nothing, but that, when He shall at length <i>ascend</i> His
judgment-seat, their shame shall be discovered. For the same reason he does not
curse all murderers, but only such as have shed innocent blood for hire, which
nefarious compact cannot easily be discovered so as to be punished by
laws.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

the consciences of all men before Him, and, in order that they might not only
fear human judgments, He designedly threatened them with the punishment of
secret sins, yet the conclusion, which is now added, extends the same judgment
to all iniquities of whatever kind. Nay, He briefly declares, that whosoever

striven ever so diligently to keep the Law, he will have at least offended in
some point or other; since the declaration of James must be borne in mind,
"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty
of all;" for he that forbade murder and adultery, forbade theft also.

viz., that they would be blessed if they earnestly apply themselves to the
keeping of the Law, and cursed, if they shake off its yoke and revel in their
lusts. But, when he says that he here sets before them a blessing and a curse,
it is as much as to declare, that he does not merely tell them what is right,
but that the reward is prepared if they obey; and if not, that the punishment is
also at hand. Thus we see, that the doctrine which he had hitherto delivered is
sealed by hope and fear, since they would not lose their labor if they obeyed
it, nor be unpunished if they rejected it. But, that they may learn surely to
embrace the promises and to fear the threatenings, he repeats what we have met
with before,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f203</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that God, who is both a faithful

magnifies his own
ministry,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since it behooved them to depend upon
God, and to acquiesce in His commandments, in such a manner as still to submit
themselves to His Prophet. For such is men's pride, that they desire to fly
above the clouds to listen to God; whilst He would be heard in His servants, by
whose mouth He speaks. Moses, therefore, would again enforce upon them this
humility, when he states that he enjoins what God has commanded, as if to call
himself the organ of the Holy Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.

similar passage, which, although it is subsequent in the order observed by
Moses, yet, inasmuch as it sets out the matter more clearly, I have not
hesitated for perspicuity's sake to put first. I said that God's intention was,
whilst appointing the Israelites to proclaim their own condemnation, to lay them
under more solemn obligation to keep the Law. If He had Himself declared His
will through the Levites only, they ought indeed to have been seriously
affected, and to have listened with reverence both to the blessings and the
curses; but when each of them testifies with his own mouth what the Levites
dictated by God's command, the introduction of this assent, as a solemn
ratification,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f205</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was more efficacious in awakening their
zeal and attention. A more fitting season, however, for this protest was after
they had entered the promised land than as if it had been made in the plain of
Moab; for the sight of the land tended to its confirmation, as if they had been
brought into court to make a covenant with
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f206</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> two mountains are situated opposite to

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are they not on the other

interrogation is common in Hebrew, yet in this place Moses affirms more
vehemently than as if he had only stated directly that these mountains were in
the land of Canaan; for he wishes to encourage them in the confidence of
entering the promised inheritance; just as he adds immediately afterwards, "Ye
shall pass over Jordan." For, although they had already experienced the
miraculous power of God in the conquest of the Amorites, and in heir occupation
of the land of Bashan, yet such was their incredulity, that it was necessary
constantly to dissipate their fears, so that they might lay aside all
hesitation, and boldly prepare to advance. Finally, he founds an exhortation
upon this great goodness of God; for the actual enjoyment of the land ought to
have stimulated them the more in the service of God, because they were made to
inherit it for the purpose of keeping the Law.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye walk in my
statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have now to deal with two
remarkable passages, in which he professedly treats of the rewards which the
servants of God may expect, and of the punishments which await the
transgressors. I have indeed already observed, that whatever God promises us on
the condition of our walking in His commandments would be ineffectual if He
should be extreme in examining our works. Hence it arises that we must renounce
all the compacts of the Law, if we desire to obtain favor with God. But since,
however defective the works of believers may be, they are nevertheless pleasing
to God through the intervention of pardon, hence also the efficacy of the
promises depends, viz., when the strict condition of the law is moderated.
Whilst, therefore, they reach forward and strive, reward is given to their
efforts although imperfect, exactly as if they had fully discharged their duty;
for, since their deficiencies are put out of sight by faith, God honors with the
title of reward what He gratuitously bestows upon them. Consequently, "to walk
in the commandments of God," is not precisely equivalent to performing whatever
the Law demands; but in this expression is included the indulgence with which
God regards His children and pardons their faults. The promise, therefore, is
not without fruit as respects believers, whilst they endeavor to consecrate
themselves to God, although they are still far from perfection; according to the
teaching of the Prophet, "I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that
serveth him,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
3:17;) as much as to say, that their obedience would not be acceptable to Him
because it was deserving, but because He visits it with His paternal favor.
Whence it appears how foolish is the pride of those who imagine that they make
God their debtor, as if according to His
agreement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The restriction of the recompense,
which is here mentioned, to this earthly and transitory life, is a part of the
elementary instruction of the Law; for, just as the spiritual grace of God was
represented to the ancient people by shadows and images, so also the same
principle applied also both to rewards and punishments. Reconciliation with God
was represented to them by the blood of cattle; there were various forms of
expiation, but all outward and visible, because their substance had not yet
appeared in Christ. For the same reason, therefore, because so clear and
familiar an acquaintance with eternal life, and the final resurrection, had not
yet been attained by the Fathers, as now shines forth in the Gospel, God for the
most part shewed forth by external proofs that He was favorably disposed to His
people or offended with them. Because now-a-days God does not openly take
vengeance on sins as of old, fanatics infer that He has almost changed His
nature; nay, on this pretense, the
Manicheans</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> imagined that the God of Israel was
different from ours. But this error springs from gross and disgraceful
ignorance; for, by not distinguishing His different modes of dealing, they do
not hesitate impiously to cut God Himself in two. The earth does not now cleave
asunder to swallow up the
rebellious:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f208</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God does not now thunder from heaven as
against Sodom: He does not now send fire upon wicked cities as He did in the
Israelitish camp: fiery serpents are not sent forth to inflict deadly bites: in
a word, such manifest instances of punishment are not daily presented before our
eyes to make God terrible to us; and for this reason, because the voice of the
Gospel sounds much more clearly in our ears, like the sound of a trumpet,
whereby we are summoned to the heavenly tribunal of Christ. Let us then learn to
tremble at that sentence, which banishes all the wicked from the kingdom of God.
So, on the other hand, God does not appear, as of old, as the rewarder of His
people by earthly blessings; and this because we "are dead, and our life is hid
with Christ in God;" because it becomes us to be conformed to our Head, and
through many tribulations to enter the kingdom of heaven. Thus, the greater are
the adversities that oppress us, the more cheerfully it behooves us to lift up
our heads, until Christ shall gather us into the fellowship of His glory, and to
pursue the course of our calling for the hope which is set before us in heaven;
in a word,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,
looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and
our Savior Jesus Christ."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;560212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Titus
2:12, 13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">I admit, indeed, the truth of what

is, as well as of that which is to come,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8;) and assuredly believers already taste on earth of that blessedness
which they shall hereafter enjoy in its fullness. God also inflicts His
judgments on the ungodly in order to remind us of the last judgment; but still
the distinction to which I have adverted is obvious, that since God has opened
to us the heavenly life in the Gospel, He now calls us directly to it, whereas
He led the Fathers to it as it were by steps. For this reason Paul elsewhere
teaches, that believers are afflicted in this world
as</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"a manifest token of the
righteous judgment of God, that they may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God
for which they also suffer, seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompense," etc.

wonder that the Israelites were only attracted and alarmed by temporal rewards
and punishments, than that the land of Canaan was to them a symbol of their
eternal inheritance, in which, nevertheless, they confessed themselves strangers
and pilgrims; from whence the Apostle correctly concludes, that they desired a
better country.

Fathers were contented with perishable felicity, as if God merely gorged them in
a tavern.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f209</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Still the distinction which I have noted
remains, that God manifested Himself more fully as a Father and Judge by
temporal blessings and punishments than since the promulgation of the
Gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then I will give you rain in
due season</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He might in one word have promised
great abundance of food, but, that His grace may be more illustrious, the
instruments are mentioned which He employs for its supply. He might give us
bread as He formerly rained down manna from heaven; but in order that the signs
of His paternal solicitude may be constantly before us, after the seed is sown,
the earth requires rain from heaven; and thus the order of the seasons is so
regulated that every day may renew the memory of God's bounty. For this reason
rain is mentioned, and the increase of the fruits of the earth; and the
continued succession of thrashing, the vintage, and sowing-time, indicates a
very abundant supply of corn and wine. For, if the harvest be small, there will
not be much work to occupy the husbandman; and, if the vintage be light, hence
also will arise an unsatisfactory period of leisure. But when God declares that
from harvest to sowing-time they shall have constant employment, He bids them
expect a fruitful year, as immediately follows, "ye shall eat your bread to the
full." And since no prosperity can be gratifying without peace, He says that
they shall be quiet and free from all disturbance. And this must be carefully
observed that, so unpalatable are all God's blessings without the seasoning of
tranquillity, nothing is more wretched than inquietude. The sum is, that for the
true servants of God not only is there food laid up with Him, but also its
peaceful and pleasant enjoyment, since it is in His power and will to drive far
from them all annoyances. Still these two things do not seem altogether
consistent with each other, that there shall be none to make them afraid, and
that they shall subdue their enemies, so
that</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f210</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> ten shall suffice to chase a hundred;
for of what use would their military strength be if there were no enemies to
trouble them? But if we may take the latter sentence disjunctively, there will
be no absurdity, viz., if it should happen that war be brought against them,
they should fight successfully. Still the easiest solution of this difficulty
is, that it soon afterwards was necessary for them to contend with a great
multitude of enemies, in order to obtain possession of the land. We gather from
the accommodation by the Prophets of this peculiar blessing of a secure and
tranquil life to the kingdom of Christ, that the promises, which from the nature
of the Law were of none effect, are still useful for believers; for, when God
has reconciled them to Himself, He also liberally bestows upon them what they
have not deserved; and yet their obedience, such as it is,<b> </b>is also
rewarded.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.

you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f211</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God is said to "turn Himself" to the
people, whom He undertakes to cherish and preserve; just as also when He
forsakes those who have alienated themselves from Him, He is said to be turned
away from them. Hence the common exhortation in the Prophets, "Be ye turned to
me, and I will be turned to you;" whereby God reminds us that He has not
promised in vain what we here read. Therefore the eyes of the Lord are over the
righteous, to confirm His covenant towards them by watching for their safety.
Hence, too, we are also taught, that when we depart from God, His covenant is
made void by our own fault; wherewith Jeremiah reproaches the Israelites.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:32.) In order, therefore, that God's covenant should remain firm and
effectual, it is not only necessary that the Law should be engraven on our
hearts, but also that He should add another grace, and not remember our
iniquities. When He says, "Ye shall eat old store," He again magnifies their
abundance; for, whereas scarcity compels us to make immediate use of the new
fruits, so it is a great sign of abundance to bring forth old wheat from the
granary, and old wine from the cellar. The continuance of His bounty is
represented in the end of the verse, where He says that there shall be no place
for the new fruits, unless they empty their store-houses;
because</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f212</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it might happen that, after a year of
scarcity, all their storehouses should be empty, and there would be no new corn
to succeed in place of the old.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will set my tabernacle
among you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He alludes, indeed, to the visible
sanctuary in which He was worshipped; still He would shew them that it should be
effectually manifested, that He had not chosen His home amongst them in vain,
inasmuch as He would exert His power by sure proofs to aid and preserve them. In
a word, He signifies that the sanctuary would not be an empty sign of His
presence, but that the reality should correspond with the sign; and this He
further confirms in the next verse, where He says that He would "walk among"
them. For as yet they had not arrived at their place of rest, and therefore had
need of Him as their Leader, in order that their journey might be prosperous.
Although He does not say in express terms that they should be spiritually
blessed, still there is no doubt but that He lifts their thoughts above the
world when He promises that He would be their God; for this expression, "I will
be your God," contains, as Christ interprets it, the hope of eternal
immortality; because He is the fountain of life, and "not the God of the dead."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

not stop short with them;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"God's

thou shalt hearken</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He teaches the same thing
as before in different words; but the diversity of expression, as well as the
repetition, tends to its confirmation. First, God says that He would deal with
them so bountifully that they should excel all other nations; for this is the
meaning of the words, that they should be illustrious above all the rest of the
world on account of the special blessings of God. He afterwards enumerates the
blessings which shall never depart from them, if they persevere in the service
of God; and here it must be observed that they are reminded, not only in how
many ways God is bountiful towards His servants, but also to how many
necessities they are exposed, which require His direct and constant aid; for if
we are blessed in the city and in the field, we can no more move a foot than
stand still, except by His blessing. Such also is the tendency of the whole
list, that a scarcity of all things impends over us at every moment, unless God
should continually succor us by remedies sent down from heaven, and that every
good thing can only come from that one
source.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall establish thee
a holy people unto himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This refers indeed
to earthly blessings, as if Moses said, that by them would be manifested God's
love towards His chosen people; still it rises higher, so that the Israelites,
led on by degrees, should learn to embrace God alone, and to trust in Him
according to the covenant which He had made with Abraham, "I am thy exceeding
great reward."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:1.) For the children of Abraham were set apart and chosen to be a holy
people, not only in order that, being well fed, and with a full belly, they
should aspire to nothing but earthly things, but that they might be confidently
assured that they would be blessed in death as well as life. Although their
adoption was gratuitous, still, inasmuch as they were called unto purity, it is
not without reason that God promises that what He had spoken should be sure, if
by keeping the Law the Israelites themselves should continue in the covenant; as
much as to say, that their
sanctification</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f215</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should be firm and perpetual if they
walked in the commandments of the Law. When He adds that it should be manifest
"to</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f216</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> all people of the earth that the name of
God was called upon them," it is equivalent to saying, that it should be known
that they were under God's defense and patronage, and that thus they should
always be safe and secure in His
protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall open to thee
his good treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again repeats, that the
goodness of God shines forth in many ways in the life of men, since He not only
supplies the bread that they eat, but that the rain which descends from heaven
waters the earth; and that thus He produces whatever is required for food from
His plenteous store-house or treasure. Let us learn, therefore, both above and
beneath, as well in the temperature of the atmosphere, in the quickening heat of
the sun, in the rain, and in other means, as in the fertility of the earth, to
contemplate the manifold riches which God brings forth from His treasures. And
when He declares that He will bless the work of our hands, hence, too, let us
learn that we can attain nothing by our industry and hardest labors, except in
so far as God vouchsafes us good success; and that all our efforts without His
secret blessing are mere useless fatigue. For the figure which Paul uses in
reference to the spiritual culture of the Church, is taken from nature
itself:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Neither is he that
planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 3:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God would not, indeed,
have</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f217</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> us lie idle, and therefore He requires
the labor of our hands, but He would have the fruit of our labors attributed to
Himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the whole Law,
and forbidden that they should turn aside to the right or the left, He adverts
to the principal point, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that they should not revolt to
strange gods. Wherefore, the sum comes to this, that, in order that God may
continue to shew us the favor which He has begun towards us, we ought on our
sides to be altogether submissive to His rule. This indeed He demands of us by
His word, and enables us to perform it by the power of His Spirit; not, it is
true, fully to do our duty, but to strive to reach the goal; and, whereas we are
far from attaining perfection, His indulgence supplies what is wanting in
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a difficult question arises,
&#8212; If all prosperity proceeds from the peculiar blessing which God
vouchsafes to His servants, whence is it that many of His despisers have
children, easy and happy circumstances, abundance of the fruits of fire earth,
enjoyment and luxury, honors and power? I answer, that the happy condition of
life, which He assigns to His servants, does not prevent Him from diffusing His
bounty promiscuously over the whole human race. He is truly called in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
36:6, the preserver of "man and beast." It is said
elsewhere,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f218</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that His mercy is extended over all His
creatures,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
145:17;) and justly does Christ exalt His unbounded goodness, in that "He maketh
his sun to rise on the evil and on the good."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400545&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:45.) But equally true is the exclamation of the Prophet;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Oh, how great is thy
goodness, which thou hast laid
up</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for them that fear thee!"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
31:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For since all without exception enjoy all the
supports of life, God's goodness, which thus contends with the wickedness of
men, shines forth universally even towards the ungodly, so that He does not
cease to cherish and preserve those whom He has created, although they be
unworthy. He therefore does good to the ungodly, because He is their Creator;
besides, in order to keep the minds of believers in suspense in expectation of
the final judgment, He now suffers many things to be confusedly mixed together,
and hides His judgment in the darkness of night, as it were, or at least under
clouds; whilst He also so tempers His patience towards the reprobate, as that,
in this confusion of which I have spoken, some signs of His anger and favor are
manifested. Thus, although the government of the world is not yet reduced to a
perfect rule, still God shews by it that He is both the avenger of sins and the
rewarder of righteousness, and some sparks are seen through the darkness; whilst
the faithful, although they do not attain to the full enjoyment of the blessing
promised them, nevertheless taste of it as far as is expedient. But to the
ungodly, although they abound with all sorts of good things, not a single drop
of God's goodness is dispensed; for unless a sense of God's paternal favor is
awakened by His blessing, the blessing itself ceases to exist; nay, the more
they gorge themselves, they attain to a deadly fatness; and God purposely lifts
them up, that He may cast them down more heavily from their high estate. In a
word, they are fed, as the Prophet
says,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f219</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "unto the day of
slaughter."</font><br><font face="Palatino">It must be concluded, therefore,
that the blessings which God here promises to His servants are seasoned by Him
with spiritual salt, lest they should be tasteless; whilst the reprobate, who
are destitute of a sense of His grace, are also deprived altogether of all His
blessings. There still, however, remains a difficulty, because the felicity here
spoken of does not always, nor equally fall to the lot of God's servants; nay,
even under the Law they were sharply tried by many troubles and adversities. I
answer, that since none, not even the most holy, was ever a perfect keeper of
the Law, since none was ever free from all transgression, it is no cause of
surprise that they only partially enjoyed the promised blessings; inasmuch as
they were not fit recipients (<i>capaces</i>) of their fullness; and, if it
sometimes happens that they are chastised more severely than the ungodly,
neither in this is there any absurdity, since God usually begins His judgment at
His own house.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:12;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:17.) Still, even in this confusion we see what the Prophet teaches, that
the righteous are never forsaken,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193725&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:25,) and that they are like green and fruitful olive-trees in the courts of

of Lebanon, yet are plucked up in a moment by the roots, so that no trace of
them remains.</font><br></div>

verb</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f220</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> might have been as properly translated
in the future tense; and, if this be preferred, an experimental knowledge, as it
is called, is referred to, as if he had said that God would practically manifest
how faithful a rewarder He is of His servants. But if the other reading is
rather approved, Moses exhorts the people to be assured that God sits in heaven
as the Judge of men, so that they may be both alarmed by the fear of His
vengeance, and also attracted by the hope of reward. This declaration,
however,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f221</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was appended to the Second Commandment,
and there expounded; for since it is comprehended in the Decalogue, it was not
right to separate it from thence; but since it is now repeated in confirmation
of the whole Law, it is fitly inserted in this place. It will not be amiss,
nevertheless, slightly to advert to what I there more fully explained. The
promise stands first, because God chooses rather to invite His people by
kindness than to compel them to obedience from terror. The word <i>mercy</i> is
coupled with the <i>covenant</i>, that we may know that the reward which
believers must expect, does not depend on the merit of their works, since they
have need of God's mercy. We may, however, thus resolve the phrase &#8212;
keeping the covenant of mercy <i>&#8212;</i> or the covenant founded on
<i>mercy</i> <i>&#8212;</i> or the mercy which He
covenanted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When it is required of believers
that they should love God before they keep His Commandments, we are thus taught
that the source and cause of obedience is the love wherewith we embrace God as
our Father. With respect to the "thousand generations," it is better that we
should refer to the Second Commandment, because it is a point which cannot be
hurried over in a few words.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And repayeth them that hate
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no mention here made of the
vengeance "unto the third and fourth
generation?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f222</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Those who expound the passage that
God confers kindnesses on the wicked, whilst they are living in this
world,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that He may at length destroy them in
final perdition, wrest the words too violently. Nor is the opinion of others
probable, that God repays the wicked with the reward of hatred, in His
<i>face</i>, or anger. I therefore interpret it to mean the face of those to
whose disobedience God opposes Himself when He humbles their arrogance; for He
alludes to their pride and audacity, because they do not hesitate to provoke
God, as if He were without the courage or the power to contend with them. He
declares, then, that their impudence and brazen front shall avail them nothing,
but that He will cast down the impertinence of their countenance, and the
insolence of their forehead; and signifies that they shall as certainly feel the
judgment which they despise, as if He presented it before their eyes. He adds,
moreover, that He will not deal towards the wicked with the clemency which he
uses towards His children; for He so chastises them that His correction is
always profitable for their salvation, whilst He denounces deadly punishment
against the former; for although He seems to deal alike with both, when He
inflicts temporal punishment, still, that which is but a medicine for believers,
is to the reprobate a foretaste of their eternal destruction. What He says,
however, as to taking vengeance without delay, does not seem to accord with
other passages of Scripture, in which He declares Himself to be slow to anger,
kind, and long-suffering. Besides, it seems also to be contradicted by
experience, since He does not immediately hasten to inflict punishment, but
proceeds slowly, so as to compensate by His severity for the slowness with which
He acts. But we must remember what He says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:4, that a thousand years in His sight are but as a single day; and
consequently, when we think that He delays, He is, in His infinite wisdom,
hastening as much as is necessary. He seems, indeed, to take no notice for a
time, that He may thus invite men to repent; but still He declares that He will
not delay, but that He will come suddenly, like a whirlwind, to hasten His
judgments, lest the ungodly should grow drowsy from their security. Let us,
therefore, learn quietly and patiently to wait for the fit season of His
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore it shall come to
pass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God appears so to act according to
agreement, as to leave (His people) no hope of His favor, unless they perform
their part of it; and undoubtedly this is the usual form of expression in the
Law, in which the condition is inserted, that God will do good to His people if
they have deserved it by their obedience. Still we must remember what we have
elsewhere seen, that, after God has so covenanted with them, He Himself, in
order that His promise may not be made of none effect, descends to the
gratuitous promise of pardon, whereby He reconciles the unworthy to Himself.
Thus the original covenant only avails to man's condemnation. But when salvation
is offered to them gratuitously, their works at the same time become pleasing to
God. Inasmuch, however, as the cause of reward is unconnected with men and their
works, all calculation of merit is out of the question: still it is profitable
to believers that a reward should be promised them if they walk in the
commandments of God; since, in His inestimable liberality, He deals with them as
if they did something to deserve it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In
conclusion, Moses enumerates some of the proofs of God's favor, such as
fecundity, and an abundance of the fruits of the earth. It is questionable
whether by what is added at the end respecting the diseases of Egypt, he means
the boils which were generated by the scattered ashes,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

and the itch:" it is, therefore, probable that the Egyptians were subject to
various maladies, from which Moses declares that the people should be free by
special privilege, if only they obeyed God's Law.</font><br></div>

of the people by the promise of reward; not that the hope of reward at all
avails in itself to arouse men, but because He would thus keep all under the
conviction of their just condemnation: for how will it help them to answer that
they are not sufficient to perform what God requires, when it appears that they
are thus wretched through their own fault? But, as has been said before, it is
profitable by indulgence to believers that the reward of obedience should be
promised them when they have kept the Law, since their innumerable defects are
not imputed to them. Still this doctrine remains sure, that if men devote
themselves to the keeping of the Law, God, although He owes them nothing, will

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye will not hearken
unto me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Thus far a kind invitation has been
set before the people in the shape of promises, in order that the observance of
the Law might be rendered pleasant and agreeable; since, as we have already
seen, our obedience is then only approved by God when we obey willingly. But,
inasmuch as the sluggishness of our flesh has need of spurring, threatenings are
also added to inspire terror, and at any rate to extort what ought to have been
spontaneously performed. It may seem indeed that it may thus be inferred that
threats are absurdly misplaced when applied to produce obedience to the Law,
which ought to be voluntary; for he who is compelled by fear will never love
God; and this is the main point in the Law. But what I have already shewn, will
in some measure avail to solve this difficulty, viz., that the Law is deadly to
transgressors, because it holds them tight under that condemnation from which
they would wish to be released by vain presumptions; whilst threats are also
useful to the children of God for a different purpose, both that they may be
prepared to fear God heartily before they are regenerate, and also that, after
their regeneration, their corrupt affections may be daily subdued. For although
they sincerely desire to devote themselves altogether to God, still they have to
contend continually with the remainders of their flesh. Thus, then, although the
direct object of threats is to alarm the reprobate, still they likewise apply to
believers, for the purpose of stimulating their sluggishness, inasmuch as they
are not yet thoroughly regenerate, but still burdened with the remainders of
sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if ye shall despise my
statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This seems only to apply to ungodly
and depraved apostates, who deliberately revolt from the service and worship of
God: for if a person falls through infirmity, and offends from levity and
inconsideration, he will not be said to have despised God's Law, or to have made
void His covenant. And certainly it is probable that God designedly spoke of
gross rebellion, which could not be extenuated under the pretense of error.
Still it must be borne in mind that all transgressors, whether they have
violated the Law in whole or in part, are brought under the curse. But God would
remind His people betimes to what lengths those at last proceed who assume the
liberty of sinning; and also from what source all transgressions arise. For,
although every one who turns out of the right path into sin does not altogether
repudiate or abominate the Law, yet all sins betray contempt of the Law, and
tend to break the covenant of God. He justly, therefore, denounces them as
covenant-breakers, and proud despisers, unless they obey His commandments: and,
first, He threatens that He will destroy them with "terror, consumption," and
other diseases; and then adds external calamities, such as scarcity of corn,
violent invasions of enemies, and the plunder of their goods; of which it will
be more convenient to speak more fully in expounding the passage in
Deuteronomy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if ye will not yet for
all this hearken</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The gradation of punishments,
which is here mentioned, shews that they are so tempered by God's kindness, that
He only lightly chastises those whose stupidity or hardness of heart he has not
yet proved; but when obstinacy in sin is superadded, the severity of the
punishments is likewise increased; and justly so, because those who, being
admonished, care not to repent, wage open war with God. Hence the more
moderately He deals with us, the more attentive we ought to be to His
corrections, in order that even the gentle strokes, which He in His kindness
softens and tempers, may be enough. Paul says that hypocrites heap up to
themselves a treasure of greater vengeance, if they take occasion from His
forbearance to continue unmoved,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:4, 5;) for those who do not repent, when admonished by light chastisements,
are the less excusable. Wherefore let us give heed to that exhortation of David,
that we "be not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding, whose
mouth must be held in with bit and bridle;" because "many sorrows shall be to
the wicked."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
32:9, 10.) In sum, as soon as God has begun to put forth His hand to smite us,
there is one remedy whereby He may be appeased, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,
teachableness. It would be more prudent of us to anticipate Him, and to return
to Him of our own accord, though He should withhold punishment; but when we are
smitten without profit, it is a sin of obstinate wickedness. He threatens,
therefore, that unless they repent when smitten with the ferule, He will use the
rod to correct them. When He says, "I will punish you seven times more," He does
not mean to define the number, but, according to the common phrase of Scripture,
uses the number seven, by way of amplification. In the next verse He shews that
there is a just cause for His becoming more severe, because they cannot be
subdued except by violent means; for although the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wag</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f225</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>geon</i>, is not always used in a bad
sense, still, in this passage, it signifies that they are disobedient, being
puffed up to be proud by their power; for, as Moses says elsewhere, Israel
"waxed fat, and kicked" against God, just as horses grow restive by being
overfed. He therefore calls their obstinacy, wherein they became more hardened,
although God spared them, "the pride of their power;" for prosperity begets
security, in which stubborn men try their strength against the scourges of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if ye
walk</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Translators give various renderings of
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrq</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f226</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>keri</i>. The Chaldee takes it to
mean <i>with</i> <i>hardness</i>, as if it were their purpose to contend against
God. Jerome renders it <i>ex</i> <i>adverso</i> <i>mihi</i>, (in opposition to
me;) but, since the word signifies an accidental occurrence, or contingency,
this sense has seemed to me much the most appropriate. To "walk at adventures"
(<i>fortuito</i>) with God, therefore, is equivalent to passing by His judgments
with their eyes shut; and even so to stupify themselves as to ascribe their
adversities to fortune, and thus not to be humbled beneath His mighty hand; for
hence arises unconquerable obstinacy, when the sinner imagines that whatever he
suffers happens by chance. Therefore Jeremiah inveighs against the Jews in a
severe reproof, because they supposed that evil and good did not proceed from
the ordinance and decree of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250338&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
3:38;) for hence is engendered brutal madness, so that wretched men rush with
all their might to their own destruction. It will accord very well, then, that
if men do not take heed to God's judgments, but rush onwards like furious
beasts, His meeting with them will be, as it were, fortuitous, when He shall
smite them indiscriminately, from right to left, high and low, as we say in
French <i>aller</i> <i>a</i> <i>tors</i> <i>et</i> <i>travers</i>. This,
therefore, the sinner at length obtains by his stupid obstinacy, that,
overwhelmed by his manifold punishments, he sees no end to his troubles.
Meanwhile there is no doubt but that Moses rebukes the iron obstinacy of the
people, as David declares, that with the gentle God will be gentle, but that He
will be stubborn, as it were, with the perverse.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:25, 26.) He finally points out the source of obstinacy, when the sinner is
intoxicated by his stupidity into contempt for God, whilst he turns away from
himself, as much as possible, the sense of His wrath. Let us learn, then, to
withdraw our thoughts from vague speculations to the consideration of God's hand
in all the punishments which He inflicts; because hence will arise
acknowledgment of our guilt, which may lead to repentance. Else that will occur
which Isaiah seems to have taken from this passage, that God's <i>anger</i> will
never be <i>turned</i> <i>away</i>; but that, when we think that we are
acquitted, <i>His</i> <i>hand</i> will be <i>stretched</i> <i>out</i>
<i>still</i>.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will bring a sword upon
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no doubt but that He means the
hostile swords of all the nations, whereby the Israelites were sorely afflicted;
and teaches that whosoever should bring trouble and perplexity upon them were
the just executioners of His vengeance; just as He constantly declares by the
prophets that He was the Leader of the people's enemies, and that the Assyrians
and Chaldeans both fought under Him. He calls the Assyrian His axe, and the rod
of His anger which He wields in His hand,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:15, and 5;) and Nebuchadnezzar His <i>hired</i> soldier. He says that He will
call the Egyptians with a <i>hiss</i>, and will arouse the Chaldeans by the
sound of his trumpet.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:20, 18, <i>and</i> <i>elsewhere</i>.) But since this point is sufficiently
well known, there will be no occasion of further proofs. The sum is, that all
wars are stirred by His command, and that the soldiers are armed at His will,
and are strong in His strength. Hence it follows that He has innumerable forces
by whose hand He may execute His vengeance whensoever He pleases. Afterwards,
therefore, when the Israelites were harassed, and even cruelly oppressed by
their enemies, God's truth was manifested in all those continual defeats;
whilst, from His great severity, we may gather how gross was the perversity of
their conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when I have broken the
staff of your bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words God
implies, that although He should not punish them by the sterility of the land,
still He was prepared with other means for destroying them by famine. We shall
indeed see hereafter that, when God was wroth, the earth in a manner shut up her
bowels so as to produce no food; and that the heaven also grew hard so as not to
fertilize it with dew or rain. In a word, all unseasonableness of weather and
infertility of soil is a sign of the curse of God; but now He goes further,
viz., that although there should be no scarcity of food, still they should
suffer from hunger, when He had taken away its nourishing qualities from their
bread. This curse confirms the instruction which we have seen elsewhere, that
man does not live by bread, but
by</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f227</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the command of God, just as if the
efficacy contained in the bread proceeded out of His mouth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
8:3.) And assuredly an inanimate thing could not give rigor to our senses except
by the secret ordinance of God. He employs a very appropriate comparison,
calling the support of bread, whereby man's strength is refreshed, "the staff;"
as we see the old and weak leaning on their sticks as they walk, when otherwise
they would totter and fall. God says, then, that it is in His power to break
this staff, so that their bread should only fill their stomachs without
refreshing their strength. Ezekiel has borrowed from Moses this figure, which he
makes use of in several places,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;260416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
4:16; 5:16; and 14:13,) although he there adverts to two sorts of punishment,
like another Prophet, when He says, "Ye have sown much and bring in little; ye
eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that; earneth wages, earneth wages to
put it into a bag with holes;" and again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ye looked for much, and,

1:6, 9;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for he points out scarcity of food as one of God's
scourges, and the inability to profit by their abundance, as another; and with
this Micah also accords, for after he has said, "Thou shalt eat, but not be
satisfied," he adds,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou shalt
sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not
anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Micah
6:14, 15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But Moses, in order that the curse
may be more apparent, says that there shall be abundance of bread; and also that
there shall be no deception practiced in kneading and baking it; for that

f228</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> women shall come to one oven together,
who may mutually observe whether weight is duly given. He implies, therefore,
that there shall be abundance in their hands, and yet, when they are filled,
they shall not be satisfied.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.

and terrible (than the
others;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f229
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) yet we know that the Israelites were
smitten with it more than once. This savage act would be incredible; but we
gather from it how terrible it is to fall into the hands of God, when men, by
adding crime to crime, cease not to provoke His wrath.
Jeremiah</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f230</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> mentions this monstrous case among
others: "The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children," and

f231</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the last siege of Jerusalem, which in
the fullness of their crimes was, as it were, the final act of God's vengeance,
reduced the wretched people who were then alive to such straits, that they
commonly partook of this unholy food.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When He
again declares that He "will cast their carcases upon those of their idols," He
shews by the very nature of the punishment that their impiety would be manifest;
for apostates take marvelous delight in their superstitions, until God openly
appears as the avenger of His service. But that their idols should be cast into
a common heap with the bones of the dead, was as if the finger of God pointed
out His abomination of their false worship. And then, because their last
resource was in sacrifices, He declares that they should be of no avail for
atonement; for, in the expression, "savour of
peace,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f232</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He embraces all the expiatory rites, by
their confidence in which they were the more obstinate. Afterwards He threatens
banishment as well as the desolation of the land; by which punishment He made it
apparent that they were utterly renounced, as we shall again see a little
further on.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall the land enjoy her
Sabbaths</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In order that the observance of the
Sabbath should be the more honored, God in a manner associated the land in it
together with man; for whereas the land had rest every seventh year from sowing,
and harvest, and all cultivation, He thus desired to stir up men more
effectually to a greater reverence for the Sabbath. God now bitterly reproves
the Israelites because they not only profane the Sabbath themselves, but do not
even allow the land to enjoy its prescribed rest; for this repose of the seventh
year did not hinder the land from continually groaning under a heavy burden as
long as it nourished such ungodly inhabitants. He says, therefore, that the land
was disturbed by ceaseless inquietude, and thus was deprived of its lawful
Sabbaths, since it bore on its shoulders, as it were, and not without great
distress, such impious despisers of God. Moreover, because the whole worship of
God is sometimes included by <i>synecdoche</i> in the word Sabbath,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:21;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:12,) He indirectly administers a sharp reproof to His people, because not
only is He defrauded of His right by their impiety, but He cannot be duly
honored in the Holy Land unless He expels them all from hence; as if He had
said, that this was the only means that remained for the assertion of the honor
due to His name, viz., that the land should be cleared of its inhabitants, and
reduced to desolation; inasmuch as this extorted rest should be substituted in
the room of the voluntary Sabbath.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they that are left of
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is another form of vengeance, that,
although they may survive for a time, still they shall gradually pine away; and
this may be referred both to those who go into captivity, and to those who shall
remain in the land. He had before threatened that they should be destroyed
either by famine or sword; but now lest they should boast that they had escaped,
if they had not perished by a violent death, He pronounces that they also should
die a lingering death; and He also declares the manner of it, viz., that He will
fill their hearts with trembling, so that they should fly when none pursued
them, (as Solomon also says,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
28:1,) and fear at the sound of a falling leaf. Thus He signifies that the
ungodly shall be no better off, although free from external troubles, because
they are afflicted internally by hidden torments; for although their audacity
may proceed even to madness, still it cannot be but that their evil conscience
should smite them continually. Their forgetfulness of God may sometimes stupify
them; nay, they may seek to shake off all feeling; but, after God has suffered
them thus to become brutalized, He presently interrupts their lethargy, and
hurries them on so that they are their own executioners. This passage shews us
that, the more strait-hearted the wicked are in their contempt of God, the
weaker they become, so as to tremble at their own shadow; and this condition is
far more wretched than to be cut off at a single
blow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they shall confess their
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Moses has been discoursing
of very severe and cruel punishments, still he declares that even in the midst
of this awful severity God is to be appeased if only the people should repent,
notwithstanding that they may have stripped themselves of all hope of pardon by
their long-continued sins. For he does not address sinners in general, but those
who by their obstinacy and brutal impetuosity have come nearer and nearer to the
vengeance of God; and even these he encourages to a good hope, if only they be
converted from their hearts. Let us be assured, then, that God's mercy is
offered to the worst of men, who have been plunged by their guilt in the depths
of despair, as though it reached even to hell itself. Whence, too, it follows,
that all punishments are like spurs to rouse the inert and hesitating to
repentance, whilst the sorer plagues are intended to break their hard hearts.
Yet at the same time it must be observed that this favor is vouchsafed by
special privilege to the Church of God; for Moses soon afterwards expressly
assigns its cause, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that God will remember His covenant.
Whence it is plain that God, out of regard to His gratuitous adoption, will be
gracious to the unworthy whom He has elected; and whence also it comes to pass,
that, provided we do not close the gate of hope against ourselves, God will
still voluntarily come forward to reconcile us to Himself, if only we lay hold
of the covenant from which we have fallen by our own guilt, like ship-wrecked
sailors seizing a plank to carry them safe into port. But it will be well for us
earnestly to examine the fruits of repentance which Moses here enumerates. In
the first place stands confession, not such as is exacted under the Papacy, that
wretched men should unburden themselves in the ear of a priest
(<i>sacrifici</i>,) as if secretly disgorging their sins, but whereby they
acknowledge themselves to be guilty before God. This confession stands
contrasted both with the noisy complaints, and the subterfuges and evasions of
the wicked. A memorable instance of it occurs in the case of David, who, when
overwhelmed by the reproof of the Prophet Nathan, ingenuously confesses that he
has sinned against God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;101213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 12:13.) By the word "fathers" He magnifies the greatness of their sins,
because for a long space of time they had not ceased to add sin to sin, as if
the fathers had conspired with their children, and the children with their own
descendants; and, since God is a just avenger even to the third and fourth
generation, it is not without reason that posterity is commanded humbly to pray
that God would pardon the guilt contracted long ago. Hence also it is plainly
seen how little the imitation of their fathers will avail to extenuate the
faults of the children, since we perceive that it renders them less excusable,
so far is God from admitting this silly plea. It is further added, that their
confession should correspond with the greatness of their transgressions, and
that it should not be trifling and perfunctory; for although hypocrites, when
convicted, do not deny that they have sinned, still in confessing they extenuate
their guilt, as if they were only guilty of venial offenses. God, therefore,
would have the circumstances of their sins taken into account, and this also He
prescribes with respect to their obstinacy, lest they should pretend that their
punishments were not deservedly redoubled, because they had
walked</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f233</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> at adventures with
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Finally, in order to prove the reality of
their conversion, all dissembling is excluded by the <i>humbling</i> of their
<i>hearts</i>; for it is as if God would reject their prayers, until in sincere
and heart-felt humility they should seek for pardon. This humiliation is
contrasted with security as well as with contumacy and pride; and it is also
compared with circumcision, where the heart is called <i>uncircumcised</i>
before it is subdued and reduced to obedience. For, whereas circumcision was a
mark of distinction between the people of God and heathen nations, it must needs
have been also a sign of
regeneration.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f234</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But since the Jews neglected the truth,
and foolishly and improperly gloried only in the outward symbol, Moses, by
reproving the uncircumcision of their hearts, refutes that empty boast. Thus, as
Paul testifies, unless the Law be obeyed, literal circumcision is useless, and
is made into uncircumcision.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:25.) So Moses accuses the Israelites of unfaithfulness, because they profess
to be God's holy people, whilst they cherish filthiness and uncleanness in their
heart. The Prophets also often reproach them with being uncircumcised in heart,
or in ears; and in this Stephen followed them.

from the words</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f235</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which we have translated, "let them
atone (<i>propitient</i>) for their iniquity." The noun used is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnevon</i>, which means both iniquity and punishment; and the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ratzah</i>, which is to expiate, or to esteem grateful, or to appease. Some,
therefore, explain it, they shall bear their punishment patiently, or esteem it
pleasant; but it appears to me that Moses connects with repentance the desire of
appeasing God, without which men are never really dissatisfied with themselves,
or renounce their sins; and his allusion is to the sacrifices and legal
ablutions, whereby they reconciled themselves to God. The sum is, that when they
shall seriously endeavor to return to God's favor, He will be propitiated
towards them on account of His covenant.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The land also shall be left
of them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again refers to the punishment of
banishment, which is equivalent to their being disinherited; and at the same
time repeats that the worship of God could not be restored in the Holy Land,
until it should be purified from their defilements; yet immediately afterwards
He moderates this severity, inasmuch as, when He seemed to deal with them most
rigorously, He still will not utterly cast them off. The verbs He
uses</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f236</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are in the past tense, though they have
reference to the future; as much as to say, even then "they shall feel that they
are not rejected." He therefore stretches out His hand to them, as it were, in
their miserable estate, to uplift them to confidence, and commands them,
although afflicted with the extremity of trouble, nevertheless to put their
trust in His Covenant. Herein His marvelous and inestimable goodness is
displayed, in still retaining as His own those who are alienated from Him: thus,
it is said in Hosea, (2:23,) "I will say to <i>them</i> <i>that</i> <i>are</i>
not my people, Thou <i>art</i> my people."</font><br><font face="Palatino">When
He promises that He will remember His covenant "for their sakes," He does not
mean for their merit, or because they have acquired such a favor for themselves;
but for their profit or salvation, in that the recollection of the Covenant
shall extend even to them. Their deliverance (from Egypt) is also added in
confirmation of the Covenant, as though He had said that He would be the more
disposed to forgive them, not only because He always perseveres in His
faithfulness to His promises, but because He would maintain His goodness towards
them, and carry it on even to the end. Thus we see He refers the cause of His
mercy only to Himself.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But it shall come to pass, if
thou wilt not hearken</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This list of curses is
longer than the previous one which was proclaimed from Mount Sinai, undoubtedly
because the Spirit of God foresaw that the sluggishness of the people had need
of sharper stimulants. If they had been only moderately teachable, what they had
already heard would have been even more than sufficient to alarm them; but now
God redoubles His threatenings against them in their inertness and
forgetfulness, that they might not only be compelled to fear, but also aroused
by constant reminding. For this reason, He declares that they should be "cursed
in the city and in the field," <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., at home and abroad, in the
house or out of the house; and again, that their food should be cursed in the
seed and in the meal. Afterwards, He enumerates three kinds of fruit in which
they should be cursed, viz., their own offspring, the produce of the soil, and
the young of their animals; for all these Scripture embraces in the word
<i>fruit</i>, as sufficiently appears from this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed shalt thou be when
thou comest in</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God here pronounces that all
their undertakings should meet with ill success; for going out and coming in
signifies their various actions, and the whole course of their life; and this is
more clearly expressed in the next verse, where He denounces against them
misfortune in all their affairs, in that God would confound and mar whatever
they should undertake. The
words</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f237</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmwhm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mehumah</i>, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tr[gm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>migegnereth</i>, are indeed variously explained. Still the sum comes to this,
that God would be against them, so as to discomfit and overthrow all their
counsels and labors. Hence we are taught that all men's endeavors are useless
and vain, unless they seek for success from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall make the
pestilence cleave unto thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now proceeds to
diseases which are as it were the lictors of God; and finally, His executioners,
if men pertinaciously continue in their ungodliness. He does not, therefore,
merely declare that He will send the pestilence, but that He will cause it to
cleave to them, and when it shall have once laid hold of them, that it shall be
impossible to remove it. It might also be translated, The Lord shall cause that
the pestilence should seize thee; but with the same meaning, viz., that the
pestilence should be fixed, or glued (<i>agglutinatam</i>) upon them, until it
should consume them in the Holy Land itself. He adds <i>phthisis</i>, or
consumption, which disease emaciates the body, and gradually exhausts its
juices. It is superfluous to speak particularly of the other diseases, only let
us learn that, whilst the multitude of diseases is almost innumerable, they are
all so many ministers (<i>satellites</i>) prepared to execute God's vengeance.
It is true, indeed, that diseases are contracted in various ways, and especially
by intemperance; still, this does not prevent God from smiting the transgressors
of the Law with them, although no natural cause may be apparent. He adds war,
which He designates by the name of "the sword," but of this curse He will soon
speak more fully.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He then unfolds in more
distinct detail what He had before adverted to with respect to the curse on the
produce of the land. And, first, He names two blights of the corn, which destroy
it just as it is ripening, and snatch the bread, as it were, out of men's
mouths; for
<i>dryness</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f238</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is not here used for all want of
moisture in the soil, but for that emptying of the ears, which is caused by the
east wind. <i>Mildew</i> occurs from the sudden heat of the sun, if it strikes
upon the corn when moistened with cold dew. Now, although these evils arise from
natural causes, still God, the Author of nature, in His supreme power, so
controls the atmosphere, that its unwholesomeness is His undoubted
scourge.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f239</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy heaven that is over
thy head</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He enumerates other causes of
barrenness, and especially drought. Often does God by the Prophets, desirous of
giving a token of His favor towards the people, promise them the rain of autumn
and of spring: the one immediately following the sowing, the other giving growth
to the fruits before they begin to ripen; whilst in many passages He also
threatens that it should be withheld. To this refers what He now says, that the
heavens shall be of brass, and the earth of iron, because neither shall the
moisture descend from heaven to fertilize the earth, whilst the earth, bound up
and hardened, shall have no juice or dampness in order to production. Whence we
gather, that not even a drop of rain falls to the earth except distilled by God,
and that whenever it rains, the earth is irrigated as if by His hand. It must,
however, be observed, as we have seen before, that the land of Canaan was not
like Egypt, which was watered by the care and industry of man, but fertilized by
the bounty of heaven. Thus God, by the Prophet, marks the degrees which are
worthy of observation, viz., that when He is reconciled to His people, He will
"hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the
corn, and the wine, and the oil;" so that, finally, all these things shall hear
starving men.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f240</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:21, 22.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not superfluous that He should
expressly speak of the "heaven over our head," and the earth that is "under our
feet," for He thus indicates that His weapons are prepared both above and below
to execute His vengeance, so as to assail the people on all sides. Another
Prophet confirms this, although only in a brief
allusion:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Therefore the heaven
over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit; and I
called for a drought," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;370110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Haggai
1:10, 11.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Another mode of expression is then
used to make the same thing more sure, viz., that the rain should be turned into
"powder and dust;" still this clause may be explained in two ways, either that
the rain shall no more fertilize the ground than as if it were ashes; or that,
instead of rain, dust should fall, as though God would dry up the rich soil by
scattering ashes on it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall cause thee to
be smitten before thine enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What He had
briefly threatened in His mention of "the sword," He now more fully pursues,
that they should be given up to the will of their enemies, so as to be
indiscriminately slaughtered. We have previously seen that those who execute
punishment on the transgressors of the Law, are stirred up and armed by the just
judgment of God; Moses does not now touch on that point, but merely declares
that the enemies of the people should be their conquerors, should cruelly
entreat them and pursue them in their flight. Moreover, in order that God's
judgment might be more conspicuous, He says, that when they have gone out to
battle by one way, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., with their army in regular order, they
should return by seven ways, because, in the confusion of their flight, they
should be dispersed in all directions. Hence we gather that the bravery of men
is in God's power, so that He can make cowards of the boldest whenever He so
pleases. And we must bear in mind what we shall see elsewhere, "How should one
chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except <i>God</i> had sold
them and had shut them up" under their hand?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:30.) And for this reason God calls Himself the God of hosts, in order that
believers may live securely under His guardianship; whilst the wicked, and the
despisers of the Law, should dread the slightest motion when He is wroth with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, that they should be
"for</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f241</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a removing in all the kingdoms of the
earth," some take to mean that they should be a laughing-stock; because we
usually shake or move our heads by way of insult; but others explain it, that
they should be wanderers and vagabonds in unknown places of exile. The first
exposition is the one I prefer. In
Ezekiel</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f242</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (23:46,) it is used for a tumultuous
rout; nor am I indisposed to understand it in this way, that whatever nations
shall assail them, they should be shaken by their slightest
attacks.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy carcase shall be
meat</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The punishment is here doubled by the
disgrace which is added to death; for it is ignominious to be deprived of
burial, and justly reckoned amongst the curses of God; whilst it is a sign of
His paternal favor that we should be distinguished from the brutes, inasmuch as
the rites of burial arouse us to the hope of resurrection and everlasting life.
Wherefore, on the contrary, God deprives of burial those whom He curses. But as
we have said that punishments affecting the body are common to the pious and the
reprobate, so also we must think of being deprived of sepulture, since it
sometimes happens that the reprobate are honorably buried, as Christ relates of
the luxurious Dives,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:22,) whilst the bodies of the pious are ignominiously cast a prey for birds
and beasts; as the Prophet complains in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
79:2. Still such an interchange does not prevent God from avenging the contempt
of His Law by this mode of punishment, as by pestilence, famine, or
sword.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will smite thee with
the botch of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whether you understand this
passage of the extraordinary plagues which God inflicted on the Egyptians at the
time of His people's deliverance, or of the ordinary diseases which had before
prevailed among them, though the latter is more probable, still Moses signifies,
that whilst the Egyptians were smitten with these plagues, God's people escaped
them, in order that this distinction might more clearly represent His favor. For
it could not happen naturally that in the same place the diseases, from which
the Israelites were free, should afflict the Egyptians alone. God therefore
threatens, that if they should despise His Law, He would deal with them as they
had seen Him deal with heathen nations. And assuredly, since God then chose to
multiply His people miraculously, it can be by no means doubted but that He
wonderfully privileged them by the bestowment of health and rigor. It is
doubtful whether by diseases of the fundament He signifies hemorrhoids or
<i>prolapsus</i>, or some other secret disease, such as that which attacked the
Philistines when they captured the ark of the covenant.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 5:6.) He subjoins other diseases, in which there appear special marks of
God's wrath; for although they sometimes affect the children of God also, still
I have shewn elsewhere that the same punishments are so dealt out to them
respectively, that they widely differ from each other. When Job was smitten with
terrible ulcers, so as to become corrupt, he seemed for a time to present the
marks of a reprobate person; but what in that holy man was an exercise of
patience, is in the transgressors of the Law the just reward of their crimes by
the curse of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall smite thee
with madness and blindness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This punishment is
very often referred to by the Prophets, when God is said to smite the wicked
with a spirit</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of giddiness and madness, to make them
drunk with astonishment. Now, whatever God declares respecting this blindness or
fury of mind, has a wide application; for hence it arises that the wicked rush
willfully into vile lusts, shudder at no crime, are hurried headlong to
destruction, are utterly deprived of discretion, throw away the remedies which
are in their hands; and
although</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f244</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the carnal sense is not greatly
disturbed by this form of vengeance, still it is much more severe and awful than
any bodily disease. The Poets imagined that wicked men were agitated and
terrified by the furies, because experience taught them that it was not without
a secret impulse from God that they became so senseless, when, their minds being
affected, they were like beasts in the shape of men. Even heathens, then,
perceived that when the wicked are given over to a reprobate mind, God thus
manifests Himself as the just Avenger of their crimes. And so it is in all cases
of "astonishment;" for it is plain that those who are thus stupified by their
miseries, are prostrated by the hand of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt betroth a wife,
and another man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He here denounces that all
they possessed should be rifled and plundered by their enemies. He, however,
puts the most painful thing of all in the first place, viz., that they shall be
despoiled of their wives, and magnifies the enormity of the evil, by saying,
that not only shall the wife be torn from her husband's bosom, but that the
betrothed virgin shall be defiled. The same denunciation is extended to their
houses and vineyards. It is grievous indeed to see the fruit of our labors
seized on by our enemies before we have been permitted to enjoy them; since the
frustration of our hope does not slightly increase our pain. He then passes on
to their flocks and their herds: then to their children, and in their case
heightens the calamity, in that their sons and their daughters should be taken
from them in their very sight, so that their eyes should fail with grief, and
their hands, as if dead, should be unable to afford them assistance. For two
reasons He says that the robbers, who shall strip them of everything, should be
unknown to them; both because they might expect less consideration and kindness
from strangers and barbarians than from neighbors; and also that the Jews might
be alarmed by this threat, so as not to suppose that they only had to deal with
neighboring nations; inasmuch as it was in God's power to fetch nations from
afar. Finally, He adds that there shall be no end to their affliction, until the
magnitude of their
calamities</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f245</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> shall stupify
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall smite thee in
the knees</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since death is common to the whole
human race, they must needs also be all subject to disease; nor is it a matter
of surprise that the whole posterity of Adam, which is infected with the taint
of sin, should so be liable to many afflictions, which are the wages of sin.
But, since the offenses of all are not alike, God also maintains a just
proportion in the execution of His various punishments; thus, in this passage He
does not speak only of common maladies, but of those whereby He openly shews His
vengeance against the transgressors of the Law; of which sort are incurable
diseases.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall bring thee,
and thy king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The fulfillment of this prophecy
at length taught the Jews, though too late, that it was no empty threat, merely
for the purpose of frightening them; and this also applies to the other
predictions. For, on account of the great distance from them, the Jews would
never have supposed that the Assyrians and Chaldeans were God's scourges, as
they actually found them to be; because they placed no faith in the words of
Moses. Much less credible was it to them that the king, whom they had appointed,
should be dragged as a prisoner to distant countries. And surely this was a very
sad and formidable punishment, since all their safety depended on the stability
of their kingly government. Thus Jeremiah magnifies this evil above all others,
that the Christ of God, who was the breath of the Church, and under whose shadow
they hoped to be everywhere safe, should be
taken.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f246</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:20.) And this was fulfilled in the case of Jeconiah, as well as in that of
Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. Let us, therefore, learn not to measure God's judgments
by our own reason, but to tremble at them, although they are hidden from us. All
aggravation of their captivity is also added, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that they
should be oppressed by such tyranny as to be compelled to serve wood and stone.
Dull and stupid as they were, still they ought to have retained their
abomination of such gross wickedness. Hence it might be gathered that they would
not be reduced to such a necessity except by the terrible vengeance of God. For
although they had been attracted by the superstitions of the Gentiles, so as
eagerly to run after them, still, after they were deprived of the worship of
God, and had undergone the yoke of the wretched and ungodly servitude which was
imposed on them, the foulness of idolatry must have been more fully understood.
There is also an antithesis implied in these words, viz., that because they had
refused to submit themselves to the true God, and to obey His Law, they should
become the slaves of idols.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt become an
astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The climax of their miseries is
here added, that they should be so far from receiving consolation from men, that
on every side their misery should meet with taunts and insults; for nothing more
bitterly wounds the wretched than this indignity of being harassed by reproaches
and sarcasms; and thus to be a laughing-stock and byword to all nations, is a
dreadful infliction. Again, there is an implied antithesis between the ignominy
to which God condemns His ungrateful people, and the extraordinary dignity with
which He had honored them, so that they should be illustrious before the whole
world. Hence the Prophets have often imitated this mode of expression; I will
not quote the instances of it which everywhere
occur.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt carry much seed
out into the field</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again makes mention of
the scarcity of wine, of wheat, and all sorts of corn; but He assigns different
causes for it. He proclaims that the harvest shall be scanty, notwithstanding an
abundant sowing, because the locust shall consume the seed; that the vintage
shall be poor, nay, almost nothing, because the worms shall devour the bunches;
that the oil produced should be little, because the olives should wither on the
trees and fall of themselves. Thus He admonishes them that He has at hand
innumerable ministers (<i>satellites</i>) wherewith to destroy by famine the
transgressors of His Law. Thus, whenever we see beetles, and locusts, and other
insects attacking the fruits, we should remember that God, as it were, puts
forth His arm to take away the food which He had given: thus Joel reminds us,
that when the locust eats that which the palmer-worm hath left, and another
insect that which the locust hath left, the curse of God is sufficiently
conspicuous.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

generated in one year than another; but we must remember the teaching of Moses,
that they never trouble us except by God's command. For if we were submissive to
God, as we ought to be, such a prodigy would never happen as that vile and
filthy insects should devour the fruits of the earth which He Himself has
provided for the sustenance of His

Canaan by sufferance should in a manner become its masters; for we know how
those who are in debt are under the power of their creditors. In fact, what

<div><font face="Palatino">The Israelites, therefore, must have felt that God
was contrary to them, when they were suppliants to their own guests, especially
since He had promised that He would so enrich them that they should lend to
others. This revolution of affairs, then, plainly convinced them of their
iniquities. Meanwhile, it must be observed that poverty as well as wealth is in
God's hands, and that whilst the latter is a proof of God's favour the former is
reckoned amongst His curses; still, however, in such a manner that God often
chastises His own children with want, or proves and exercises their patience
without ceasing to be their Father, whilst he bestows abundance upon the
reprobate, wherewith they may gorge themselves to their own destruction. God's
blessing, however, shines forth in the elect, as far as it is expedient for
them; nor is it said in vain in the Psalm, "Wealth and riches are in the house
(of the just,") in order that he may lend and be bountiful.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
112:3.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>45.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moreover, all these curses
shall come upon thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He not only confirms what
he has already said, but takes away all hope of alleviation, since God's
scourges shall not cease until they have repented. He declares that all the
curses shall come upon them; for although they are not always congregated into a
single band, still it is true that God pays the wages of the transgressors of
His Law with this multitude of miseries which Moses has recounted. By the word
<i>pursue</i>, he takes away all hope of escape, whilst to <i>overtake</i> is
equivalent to laying hold of them tenaciously, till, as it is further said, they
<i>be</i> <i>destroyed</i>. The sum is, that the ungodly by their subterfuges
only bring it to pass that they accumulate upon themselves heavier punishments,
which will never cease to afflict them until they are destroyed by them. For
this reason, he says that they shall be "for a sign and a wonder,"
<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that they shall awaken astonishment in all men; for those
who are but little moved by the common and ordinary judgments of God, are
compelled, whether they will or no, to give attention to these prodigies. Thus,
notable punishments, and such as are worthy of special observation, are "for a
sign and a wonder."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Their ingratitude is also
reproved as well as their contempt of the Law, because they served not God "with
joyfulness and gladness of heart," when He had been so abundantly generous to
them; for it is the fault of a corrupt and malignant nature, that it should not
be possible to bring it to serve God joyfully, when He invites us by His
liberality. But Moses takes it for granted that, since God will prevent the
Israelites with His favor, before He proceeds to inflict punishments upon them,
they will be guilty of this brutal sin, not to allow themselves to be liberally
sustained by Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>49.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall bring a nation
against them from far</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He enforces the same
threatenings in different words, viz., that unknown and barbarous enemies should
come, who shall attack them with great impetuosity and violence. And still
further to aggravate their cruelty, He says that their language shall be a
strange one; for, when there can be no oral communication, there is no room for
entreaties, which sometimes awaken the most savage to mercy. But Jeremiah shews
that this was fulfilled in the case of the
Chaldeans;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Lo, I will bring a
nation upon you from far, O house of Israel; it is a mighty nation, a nation

Prophets were careful to take their form of expression from Moses, lest the Jews
should, according to their custom, proudly despise the threats which God had
interwoven with His Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Lest the distance of
their countries should lull them into security, He says that they should be like
eagles in swiftness, so as suddenly to overwhelm them, just as God often
compares the ministers of His wrath to the whirlwind and the storm. Jeremiah has
also imitated this similitude, where he declares that the slaughter which the
Jews in their false imagination had supposed to be far away from them, should
come suddenly upon them.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

old, nor shew favor to the young," whereby he signifies their extreme ferocity.
I have already expounded what follows respecting their rapine and
plunder.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>52.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall besiege thee in
thy gates</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He overthrows every ground of false
confidence. The number of their towns inspired them with courage, because they
never would have supposed that their enemies would undergo so much fatigue as
not to cease from fighting till they were all taken. He therefore includes all
their towns, in reliance upon whose multitude they despised hostile aggression.
He adds, that in vain they trust in their high and fortified walls, which will
be either overthrown by military engines, or shall voluntarily surrender from
the length of their besiegal; for the passage may be explained in both ways,
either that the enemies shall overthrow and lay prostrate all their fortresses,
or that by their perseverance they shall pass over the walls however high. It
seems to me that the length of the siege as well as their valiant fighting is
indicated. The repetition which follows magnifies the evil, viz., that they
shall be thus sorely pressed in their own land given them by God; for the very
associations of the place only increased the
indignity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>53.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt eat the fruit
of thine own body</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is one of those
portents which was mentioned a little while ago; for it is an act of ferocity
detestable and more than tragical, that fathers and mothers should eat their own
offspring, so great love of which is naturally implanted in every heart, that
parents often forget themselves in their anxiety for their children; and many
have not hesitated to die to insure their safety. Nay, when the brute animals so
carefully cherish their young, what can be more disgusting or abominable than
that men should cease to care for their own blood? But this is the most
monstrous of all atrocities, when fathers and mothers devour the offspring which
they have procreated, and yet this threat by no means failed of its fulfillment,
as we have elsewhere seen. We ought then to be the more alarmed when we see that
God thus terribly punished the sins of those whom He had deigned to choose for
His own. Still, it was not without very just cause that this wrath was so
greatly kindled against the Jews who had left no kind of iniquity undone, so
that their wickedness was altogether intolerable. Never, then, must it be
forgotten that those of the household of the Church to whom God's truth is
revealed, are on that account the less excusable, because they knowingly and
willfully provoke His wrath, whilst their continued perseverance in sin is
altogether unworthy of pardon. The monstrous brutality of the act is heightened,
when He says that men, in other respects tender and accustomed to delicacies,
should be so savage through hunger that they shall refuse to give a share of
this horrible food to their wives and surviving children; as also Jeremiah
expressly says, the pitiful women shall be so maddened by hunger as to cook
their own children.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:10.) What follows as to the after-birth is still more horrible, for thus they
call the membrane by which the foetus is covered in the womb, with all its
excrements. That they should dress for food a filthy skin, the very look of
which is disgusting, plainly demonstrates the awfulness of God's
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>58.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou wilt not observe to
do all the words of this law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Inasmuch as even
believers, although they are disposed to a willing obedience to the Law, and
earnestly apply themselves to it, are still impeded and withheld by the
infirmity of their flesh from fulfilling their duty, care and attention is here
demanded of them; for "to observe (<i>custodire</i>) to do" is equivalent to
giving sedulous and diligent heed. Now, God declares that, unless the Israelites
thoroughly devote themselves to the keeping of the Law, vengeance is prepared
for their neglect. It is indeed a harsh and severe threat whereby transgression
in any respect is without remission; for perfect obedience is required by the
words, "to do all the words that are written in the Law." But it is necessary
that we should bear in mind what I have already shewn, that Moses was thus
severe in his exactions, in order that the people, being convinced of their
condemnation, should betake themselves to the mercy of God; for no one longs
after Christ, unless he first abandons all confidence in his works, and rests
all his hope of salvation in gratuitous pardon. The curse here recorded so
awaits the transgressors of the Law, that, whilst God pardons His children, He
at the same time sometimes chastises them, and executes upon the reprobate the
vengeance they deserve. The fountain-head of obedience is indicated when it is
said, "that thou mayest fear the Lord;" for all virtues are but smoke, which do
not spring from the fear of God. Moreover, in order that their contempt may be
without excuse, God's name is called "glorious and fearful;" for it is a mark of
gross stupidity, when God's majesty and glory are openly set before us, not to
be affected with becoming reverence so as to humble ourselves before Him. He,
however, threatens something more terrible than before, when he says that the
plagues shall be <i>wonderful</i> not only on the parents but on their children
and descendants; instead of which some construe it,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f250
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">He shall increase in a wonderful manner; and
others, He shall separate; but this is too constrained and obscure. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>phela</i>, signifies to be wonderful, or secret and hidden: thus, in my
opinion, he means extraordinary and incredible modes of vengeance which shall
surpass the comprehension of the human mind. He puts plagues and sicknesses in
apposition with each other, as explaining by the latter of what nature the
plagues shall be; unless, perhaps, it may be rather thought that the
<i>species</i> is appended to the <i>genus</i>, which seems to be more probable.
Further, he calls the plagues veritable, or faithful; either because they shall
certainly occur, or because they shall continue to the end; for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tynman</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f251</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>neumanoth</i>, is explained in both
ways; and undoubtedly it sometimes signifies veracious, or what does not
deceive, sometimes firm and stable, or perpetual; and this sense appears to me
to suit it best here, so that continued duration should be added to the
greatness of the plagues.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He again mentions "the
diseases of Egypt," not those which they had themselves suffered in Egypt, but
those under which they had seen the Egyptians laboring. He says, therefore, that
the severity of God against unbelievers, of which they had been spectators,
should fall upon their own heads, if they should be followers of their
ungodliness; for it was natural that they should tremble at the judgments of
God, whereof they had been eye-witnesses; and not only so, but at which they had
trembled for fear.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>61.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Also every sickness and every
plague</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This passage confirms what I have said
about the plague and the sickness, for the sickness stands first as the
<i>species</i>, and then the plague follows, which has a wider meaning, and
comprehends all the curses in itself. Still, after he has enumerated so many
forms of punishment, he declares that God is armed with yet other weapons to
smite them; and assuredly as His blessings are endless and innumerable, so also
His power is incomprehensible for avenging the contempt of His Law. Posterity
has experienced, and we also even now partly perceive how true these
threatenings were; for, as the obstinacy of men has burst forth and exalted
itself more and more, so new and unheard of punishments have abounded from God,
like a deluge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>62.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall be left few in
number</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since it had been promised to Abraham
that his seed should be like the stars of heaven in multitude, it was a signal
token of God's wrath that his posterity should be
reduced</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f252</font></sup><font face="Palatino">to so small a number; thus the comparison
which is here made for the purpose of heightening their calamity, must not
simply be referred to the "multitude" or great band, and the "fewness in
number," but must be extended to the promise, the truth of which had been
clearly manifested; so that, on the other hand, they might perceive that their
former populousness could only have been put an end to, like waters dried up by
the excessive heat of the sun, through the wrath of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>63.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass,
that as the Lord rejoiced over you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
wonderful and inestimable love of God towards His people is here set forth, via,
that He had rejoiced in heaping blessings upon them; wherefore their depravity
was all the more base and intolerable, in that God, though voluntarily disposed
to be bountiful, was obliged by it to lay aside His affection for them. But
although it is only by a metaphor that God is said to rejoice in destroying the
wicked, yet it is not without good reason that this expression is applied to
him; that we may know that He can no more fail to be the defender of His Law,
and the Avenger of its contempt, than deny Himself. He complains, indeed, by
Isaiah, (10:24) that He is unwillingly forced to punish the Jews; but these two
things are quite consistent, that He rejoices in His just judgment, and at the
same time is mindful of His clemency and indulgence, so that He would rather
pardon, if the wickedness of men would allow Him. But this expression of Moses,
that God receives consolation from punishing the wicked, constantly occurs in
the Prophets.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>64.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord shall scatter
thee among all people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. At the end of the
preceding verse, he had threatened them with banishment, which was far more
painful to the people of Israel than to other nations. Inasmuch as affection for
our country is natural to all, it is disagreeable to be away from it; but the
condition of the Israelitish people was peculiar, for to them the inheritance of
Canaan was promised them by God, and they could not be expelled from it without
being renounced by their heavenly Father. But he now proceeds a second and third
step further; for he adds to banishment a miserable scattering, and to
scattering, trembling and wanderings full of disquietude. For, if they had been
expelled all together into any one corner of the world, their banishment would
have been more tolerarable from their very association with each other. Their
calamity is, therefore, augmented when the storm of God's wrath scatters them
hither and thither like chaff, so that they should be dispersed, and dwell in
widely different countries. Another kind of servitude, which I have elsewhere
noticed, is incidentally added, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that He would enslave them
not only to men, but to idols also. The third step is their want of rest, for
there was to be no fixed abode for them in their captivity; and this is far the
most wretched state of all, to serve tyrannical conquerors as captives, and to
have no certain master. Still it was a most just reward of the people's
ingratitude, that they should nowhere find a fixed resting-place, because they
had rejected the rest offered them by God, as we read in Isaiah (28:12.) He,
however, extends the evil, bitter as it was in itself, still further, for they
were not only to be compelled to wander in confusion, and immediately to pass
onwards, but, wheresoever they should come, inward perturbation of mind was to
follow them as their inseparable companion. Now, it is more sad to be agitated
within with secret fear, than to be oppressed by external violence; for
believers, although they too may be unsettled and tossed by many troublesome
waves, still repose with tranquil minds on God; whilst the wicked, however they
may desire to lull themselves in security, are nevertheless always without true
peace; and if, for a while, they sink into lethargy, are still soon compelled to
arouse themselves by God whether they will or not. Surely as the repose of a
well-regulated mind is a signal mark of God's favor, so a constant and
irremediable fear, such as is here referred to, is one of His terrible
punishments.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since the fear of spiritual
punishments but lightly affects ungodly men, Moses magnifies in many words what
the Israelites would else have carelessly passed over. Especially he points out
what dreadful torments of anxiety would affect the wicked, when he says that
their life should hang in suspense, as it were, before their eyes, so that they
should fear day and night. An amusing device is related of
Dionysius,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f253</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who commanded an exquisite supper,
supplied with every delicacy, to be prepared for a courtly flatterer by whom his
happiness had been lauded; he placed him in his own seat,
so</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f254</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he might feast pleasantly, but
ordered a sword to be suspended by a thread so as to overhang his head, insomuch
that he who had pronounced the tyrant to be happy, when he saw that death was so
near him every moment, did not dare to taste either of meat or drink. Dionysius,
therefore, confessed, and not without shame to himself, that he and all other
tyrants, whilst they are formidable to others, are tormented by perpetual fear.
Now, this same disquietude is common to all the despisers of God; for the more
wantonly they rage in forgetfulness of His fear, the more deservedly they dread
their own shadow. Besides, when we look around us and see by how many forms of
death our lives are beset, it cannot be but that innumerable anxieties should
naturally possess us; how, then, can the wicked help being harassed by miserable
and perplexing doubts when they perceive themselves to be shut out from the
protection of God, and exposed to so many evils? Tranquillity of mind,
therefore, can only arise from having God as our Keeper, and from resting under
His protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the words, "the sight of
thine eyes," I have no doubt but that Moses designates those
spectres</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f255</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and bug-bears whereby death is set
before the eyes of the reprobate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>68.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord shall bring thee
into Egypt again with ships</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that the
people were so driven about in the desert amidst divers perils, that they only
escaped from it in safety by extraordinary miracles. It was therefore a thing
most highly to be desired by their posterity, that they should never be carried
back into those mighty depths. He who had once rescued them from those deaths
might indeed often be their deliverer; but in order to make His blessing at that
time more memorable, He had provided that they should never return into that
wilderness. To bring them back into it again, was, then, in a manner to blot out
the grace of redemption. If any object that it was impossible that the people
should be conveyed in ships through dry places, the reply is easy, that since
mention is made of the captivity, there is no absurdity in their being carried
in ships and landed on the shore
which</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

finish their journey by wandering through the desert on

the outset he only adverts to idolatry, yet, inasmuch as he thence takes
occasion to inveigh generally against the transgressors of the Law, and
denounces punishment against them, I have thought it advisable to introduce this
passage amongst the Sanctions (of the Law.) He had already strictly forbidden
them to turn aside to idols; he now requires this instruction to be handed down
to their grand-children and their whole race; as though he had said, that they
must continue faithfully in the pure worship of God, not only lest they should
deprive themselves of entering the land of Canaan, but also lest, after having
long enjoyed quiet possession of it, they should be expelled from it. For long
possession might have hardened their minds in security and arrogance, as if they
had no change to fear. Lest, therefore, as time should pass away, they should
trust that they were firmly established, and advance to greater license, he now
reminds them that the punishment which he had already taught them to await
themselves, would also be extended to their descendants; since it was no less
easy for God to drive
their</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f257</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> distant posterity from their quiet nest,
than it would have been for Him to prevent their taking possession of it. But
although he is treating of idols, still he addresses them on the subject of the
curse, which overhangs all despisers of God. And, in order that the threat may
affect them more deeply, he calls on "heaven and earth to witness;" as though he
had said, that even things inanimate and without reason were in a manner
conscious of the vengeance of God. Their
opinion</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f258</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is a poor one who think that angels and
men are thus designated by a <i>metonomy</i>; for we shall see a little further
on that the same form of expression is repeated. And when he says in his song,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:1,) "Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth," it is to
signify by <i>hyperbole</i> that his address is worthy of being listened to by
all creatures. Thus Isaiah, the more to shame the Jews, who had become stupified
in their folly, addresses his words to the heavens and earth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he calls heaven and earth to witness
God's vengeance, it is as much as to say, that it will as clearly appear as the
heaven and earth appear before our eyes; and after he has said that they shall
perish, he also declares in what manner, viz., that God would scatter them
hither and thither, and reduce them to a small number. What follows might seem
absurd, inasmuch as it ought not to be reckoned among their punishments that
they should serve idols among strangers, whereas they had already worshipped
them of their own accord in their own land; but this difficulty is easily
solved, and in two ways, either that banishment was a just reward to them in
order that there they might indulge to their full these impure dispositions; and
thus there will be an antithesis between the nations of the heathen and the Holy
Land, as though God had said that He would not; suffer them to profane the
latter by their superstitions; or else, that then, the veil being as it were
removed, they should be ashamed when they should be compelled to serve dead
idols. Nor can it be questioned but that then they were wounded in spirit by the
same disgusting practices in which they had before taken pleasure; and I (See
<i>ante</i> on Deuteronomy 28:36, p. 254.) have stated elsewhere that I prefer
this latter sense. Meanwhile, he reproaches them for their stupidity in
adoring</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f259</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> dead images, formed of corruptible
things, and the work of men's hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if from thence thou shalt
seek the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this passage also he exhorts
and encourages them in the confidence of obtaining pardon, and thus anticipates
them, so that they might not be overwhelmed with sorrow when smitten by God's
hand; for despair awakens such rage in the wretched that they cannot submit
themselves to God. He sets before them, then, another object in their
punishments, that they may not cease to taste of God's goodness in the midst of
their afflictions, whereby He invites them to repentance. For the sinner will
never set about seeking God, unless he deems Him to be accessible to prayer.
Moreover, he warns them to return truly and sincerely to a sound mind, because
they will gain nothing by false profession. We know that nothing is more common
than to make complaint to God whenever we are oppressed with troubles, but, when
they are at all intermitted, immediately to return to our natural state. Sincere
conversion is, therefore, prescribed; for "all the heart" is precisely
equivalent to an upright heart, (<i>integrum</i>,) which is contrasted with a
double or feigned one; and this must be
noted,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f260</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> lest a sense of our infirmity should
disturb us; for, since it is not possible for men to give themselves wholly to

is approved by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.

God's stripes, he reminds them of their usefulness to them, because they would
never turn to God unless aided by this remedy. He tells them that, after they
shall have been afflicted by the curses of God, if they sought after Him, they
should find Him: and further, he gives them grounds for hope both in God's
nature and in His covenant. He assures them that God will be willing to be
appeased, because He is by nature merciful; but he adds another confirmation of
this, which is more certain and familiar, viz., because God had adopted them by
a perpetual covenant.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye stand this day all of you

God's appointed</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f261</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> representative, sanction the doctrine
proclaimed by him by a solemn adjuration. With this design he says that the
Israelites stood there not only to hear the voice of God, but to enter into
covenant with Him, in order that they might apply themselves seriously, and with
becoming reverence, to perform the promise they had given. Nor does he only
address their chiefs, but, after having begun with the officers, the elders, and
men,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f262</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he descends to the little children and
the wives, in order that they might understand that their whole race, from the
least to the greatest, were bound to keep the Law: nay, he adds all the
strangers, who had devoted themselves to the service of the God of Israel, and
states particularly that the very porters and
lacqueys</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f263</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were included in the covenant, in order
that the minds of those, who derive their origin from the holy Patriarchs,
should be more solemnly impressed. Moreover, in order that they may accept the
covenant with greater reverence, he says that it was established with an oath.
Now, if perjury between man and man is detestable, much less pardonable is it to
belie that which you have promised God by his sacred name. Finally, he requires
that the covenant should be reverenced, both on account of its advantages and
its antiquity. Nothing was more advantageous for the Israelites than that they
should be adopted by God as His people; this incomparable advantage, therefore,
ought deservedly to render the covenant gratifying; and, besides the exceeding
greatness of this blessing, God had prevented them by His grace many
ages</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f264</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> before they were
born.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It would have been, therefore, very
disgraceful not to embrace eagerly and ardently so signal a pledge of his love.
Nevertheless, the question here arises, how the little children could have
passed into covenant, when they were not yet of a proper age to learn (its
contents;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f265
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) the reply is easy, that, although they did
not receive by faith the promised salvation, nor, on the other hand, renounce
the flesh so as to dedicate themselves to God, still they were bound to God by
the same obligations under which their parents laid themselves; for, since the
grace was common to all, it was fitting that their consent to testify their
gratitude should also be universal; so that when the children had come to age,
they should more cheerfully endeavor after holiness, when they remembered that
they had been already dedicated to God. For circumcision was a sign of their
adoption from their mother's womb; and therefore, although they were not yet
possessed of faith or understanding, God had a paternal power over them, because
He had conferred upon them so great an honor. Thus, now-a-days, infants are
initiated into the service of
God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whom they do not yet know, by baptism;
because He marks them out as His own peculiar people, and claims them as His
children when He ingrafts them into the body of Christ. Moses goes further,
stating that their descendants were bound by the same covenant, as if already
enthralled to God; and surely, since slavery passes on by inheritance, it ought
not to appear absurd that the same right should be assigned to God which mortal
men claim for themselves. What he says, then, is tantamount to reminding the
Israelites that they covenanted with God in the name of their offspring, so as
to devote both themselves and those belonging to them to His
service.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye know how we have dwelt
in the land of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know how greatly men's
minds are tickled by novelty; and this might occur to the Israelites when, upon
entering the land of Canaan, they would see many forms of idolatry hitherto
unknown, which would be so many snares to entangle them. Although, therefore,
they were not as yet accustomed to such corruptions, he exhorts them to beware
by former instances; for they were not ignorant that God had held in abomination
the superstitions of Egypt, and also of other nations, which He had punished in
terrible ways. Consequently Moses reminds them that there was no reason why the
people should be carried away to imitate the rites of the Gentiles with which
they were unacquainted, since they knew by extraordinary proofs that whatever
imaginations had been invented by heathen nations were hateful to God. This
argument, then, is drawn from experience, whereby the Israelites had been
abundantly admonished, that they should hereafter beware of all delusions. But,
when he passes from individual men and women to families and tribes, he
indicates that those who are associated with others in sin, seek to excuse
themselves in vain by their numbers; since a whole nation is as much to be
condemned as a single person.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The conclusion of

should bring forth bitter fruits to God; for by the word <i>root</i> I rather
under stand the hidden principles of sins, which, unless they be prevented in
good time, spring up with collected vigor and lift themselves on high; for
indulgence in sin increases by concealment and connivance. And to this the
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews seems to allude when he exhorts believers
lest, through their negligence, "any root of bitterness, springing up, trouble
them, and thereby many be defiled."

corruption of others.

God, who neither deceives, nor is deceived, nor even allows Himself to be
thought lightly of; in order that they may tremble at His threats. Let the
majesty of God, he says, be dreaded by you; so that none who despises Him, and
wantons in his own lusts, should promise himself impunity. "To bless himself in
his heart," is to hope in his secret imaginations that all will go well; as the

said to add oil to the grate, who add more flames to a fire already
lighted,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

climax of all sins that a wretched man, who is abandoned to vice, should
extinguish the light of his own reason, and destroy the image of God within him,
so as to degenerate into a beast: and not only so, but also that he should
dethrone God, as if He were not the Judge of the world. And this is the insult

have already seen, that the punishments which He would inflict would be no
ordinary ones, or such as should fall into contempt from their common use; but
like portents, which should awaken astonishment among their posterity. For the
question which is here put is such as refers to something extraordinary, and
what is not easily comprehended. It is not, however, confined to the preceding
clause, but refers to the whole list of curses; not as if each of them by itself
had awakened such horror, but because, when heaped one upon another, they
compelled all men to wonder, both on account of their number and their severity
and duration, and thus were for a sign and a prodigy. For it everywhere occurs
that men are afflicted with diseases, and barrenness for a single season is a
common evil; but that sicknesses should cleave as it were to the marrow of a
whole people, and that the earth should be dried up as if it were burnt with
sulphur, this is an awful spectacle, in which God's vengeance, which else would
be incredible, manifestly appears; and therefore the cases of Sodom and Gomorrah
are adduced, in whose destruction it might be seen what end awaits all the
reprobate.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

their desolation before their eyes, from the time that they entered the land, in

it. It is also worthy of notice, that strangers are introduced making inquiry;
in which words Moses signifies that this vengeance would be terrible even to
heathen nations; and with this corresponds what we read in Jeremiah; "many
nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor,
Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city? Then they shall answer,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass,
when all these things are come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again
confirms what we have elsewhere seen, that God never so severely afflicts His
Church as not to be ready to return to mercy; nay, that by their punishments,
however cruel in appearance, the afflicted, who were destroying themselves as if
their hearts were bent upon it, are invited to repentance, so as to obtain
pardon. Although, therefore, cause for despair is everywhere besetting them from
the burning wrath of God, still he bids them take heart and be of good hope.
Still, we must bear in mind what I have already shewn from the words of Moses,
that reconciliation is not offered to all indiscriminately, but that this
blessing exists by peculiar privilege in the Church alone; and this we gather
also from the special promise,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f278
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">I will visit their iniquities with the rod;
nevertheless I will not take away my loving-kindness from them. Now, however, it
must also be added, that this is not common to all who profess to be members of
the Church, but only
belongs</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f279</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to the residue of the seed, and those
whom Paul calls the remnant of grace,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:5;) for it is no more profitable for the hypocrites, though they are mixed
with believers, to be smitten with the scourges of God unto salvation, than it
is for strangers. Wherefore this promise is only addressed to a certain number,
because it was always necessary that some people should remain as a residue, in
order that God's covenant should stand firm and
sure.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Still, Moses does not only enjoin the
Israelites to profit by the corrections of God, but also to reflect upon His
blessings whereby they might be led to serve Him with pleasure. For this
comparison was of no slight avail in illustration of the judgments of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f281</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If the punishments alone had occupied
their minds, their knowledge would have been but partial or more obscure;
whereas, when on the one hand they considered that they had not served God in
vain, and on the ether, that in forsaking Him they had fallen from the height of
felicity into the deepest misery, it was easy for them to infer that whatever
misfortunes they suffered were the fruit and reward of their ungodliness. Nor is
it to be doubted but that, under the Law, God so adapted Himself to a tender and
ignorant people, that the course of his blessings and curses was perfectly
manifest; so that it was plainly shewn that they neither threw away their labor
in keeping the<b> </b>Law, nor violated it with impunity. Often does He declare
by the Prophets, that, as long as His children were obedient, He on His part
would be their Father; that thence it might be more clearly perceived that the
deterioration of their circumstances arose from His just indignation. Under this
pretext, indeed, the wicked formerly endeavored to defend their superstitions;
as, for instance, when in order to refute Jeremiah, they proudly boasted that it
was well with them when they "burnt incense unto the frame of
heaven;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f282</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but such wanton depravity is admirably
reproved by the Prophet, who<b> </b>shews that God had most manifestly avenged
such pollutions by the destruction of their city and the fall of the Temple.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
44:17, 22.) The distinction, therefore, of which Moses now speaks, could not
escape them, unless they willfully shut out the light. Moreover, because it
rarely happens that men are wise in prosperity, he advises the Israelites to
return to their senses, at any rate when sorely afflicted; for He addresses the
exiles, who, disinherited by God, had no hope left; and promises them, that if,
when banished to distant lands, they at length repented, God would be
propitiated towards them. For
"to</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f283</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> bring back to their heart" is equivalent
to considering what before had been despised through contempt, or neglect, or
stupidity, and buried as it were in voluntary oblivion. Still, lest they should
presume on God's kindness, and only seek for pardon in a perfunctory manner,
serious conversion is required, the results of which should appear in their
life, since newness of life accompanies
(genuine</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f284
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) repentance. Nor does Moses speak only of
the outward correction of the life, but demands sincere desires to obey, for we
have elsewhere seen</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f285</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that "all the heart" means with
integrity of heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any of thine be driven
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since their dispersion into unknown
countries might have altogether annihilated their hope of restoration, Moses
anticipates this doubt, and teaches them that, although they might be driven out
into the utmost regions of the earth, the infinite power of God sufficed to
gather them from thence; as also it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:2,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord doth build up
Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With this intent, the adverb "from thence" is twice
repeated, lest they should imagine that the distance of place would be any
impediment to the fulfillment of what God had
promised.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have seen elsewhere that it was not
without reason that their dwelling in the land of Canaan was magnified as a
peculiar blessing, because it behooved that, until the time of Christ's coming,
the hope of an eternal inheritance should be cherished in their minds by an
earthly and visible symbol.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord thy God will
circumcise thine heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This promise far
surpasses all the others, and properly refers to the new Covenant, for thus it
is interpreted by Jeremiah, who introduces God thus speaking,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Behold, the days come that
I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and the house of Judah, not
according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,. . which covenant they
brake,. . but. . I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:31-33.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses now declares the same thing in
different words, that, lest the Israelites, according to their wonted
instability, should fall back from time to time into new rebellions, a divine
remedy was needed, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that God should renew and mould their
hearts. In short, he reminds them that this would be the chief advantage of
their reconciliation, that God should endow them with the Spirit of
regeneration. There is a metaphor in this word <i>circumcise</i>; for Moses
alludes to the legal sign of consecration, whereby they were initiated into the
service of God. The expression, therefore, is equivalent to his saying, God will
create you spiritually to be new men, so that, cleansed from the filth of the
flesh and the world, and separated from the unclean nations, you should serve
Him in purity. Meanwhile, he shews that, whatever God offers us in the
Sacraments, depends on the secret operation of His Spirit. Circumcision was then
the Sacrament of repentance and renewal, as Baptism is now to us; but "the
letter," as Paul calls it,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:27,) was useless in itself, as also now many are baptized to no profit. So
far, then, is God from resigning the grace of His Spirit to the Sacraments, that
all their efficacy and utility is lodged in the Spirit
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although Moses seems to make a division
of the matter between men and God, so as to ascribe to them the beginning of
repentance, and to make Him the author of perseverance
(only,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f286
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) nevertheless this difficulty is easily
solved; for according to the ordinary manner of Scripture, when he exhorts them
to repentance, he is not teaching them that it is a gift of the Spirit, but
simply reminding them of their duty. Meanwhile, the defenders of free-will
foolishly conclude, that more is not required of men than they are able to
perform; for in other places they are taught to ask of God whatever He enjoins.
Thus, in this passage, Moses treats of the means of propitiating God, viz., by
returning into the right way with an unfeigned heart; but, after he has
testified that God will be gracious to them, he adds, that there is need of a
better remedy, so that, being once restored by Him, they may be perpetual
recipients of His grace. Still, it is not his intention to restrict the
circumcision of the heart to the subsequent course of their lives, as if it
depended on their own will and choice to circumcise themselves before God should
work in them. And surely it is not at all more easy to rise when you have
fallen, than to stand upright after God has set you up. I confess that
perseverance is an excellent grace; but how shall the sinner, who is enthralled
to Satan, free himself from those chains, unless God shall deliver him?
Therefore, what Moses lays down as to the gift, of perseverance, applies no less
to the commencement of conversion; but he only wishes to teach us that, although
God should pardon our sins, that blessing would be but transient, unless He
should keep us in subjection to His Law. And, in fact, He regenerates by His
Spirit unto righteousness all those whose sins He
pardons.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt
return</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"><i>
</i>f287</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and obey the voice of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The <i>copula</i> which Moses here
employs is equivalent to the <i>illative</i> <i>particle</i>; for he argues from
their certainty of obtaining pardon, that they should not hesitate to return to
God, nay, rather that they should set about it with a cheerful and ready mind;
and then that they should constantly proceed in the course of obedience. But,
when he now requires of the people the perseverance which he had just before
declared to be given by God alone, we may at once infer that they deal foolishly
who estimate the powers of man by the commands of God. Meanwhile, let us bear in
mind this main point, that true conversion is proved by the constant tenor of
the life; because we are redeemed, as Zecharias testifies, to this end that we
should serve God, our Deliverer, "in holiness and righteousness all the days of
our life."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420174&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:74, 75.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, I have set before thee
this day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A solemn injunction, similar to the
foregoing ones, that the Israelites should consider how inestimable a blessing
it was that God should have condescended to deposit His Law with them; and that
if they did not receive it with reverence, the punishments for such foul
ingratitude would be by no means light. For, in order to deprive them of the
pretext of error, He separates them from the heathen nations, which through
ignorance of the right way vacillated, as in uncertainty, between life and
death. He says, therefore, that He has set before their eyes life, and that
indeed connected with true and complete happiness; and likewise death with its
consequences. Now, there is no one who, under the guidance of nature, would not
seek for life and recoil from death; and thence Moses reproaches them with being
more than senseless if they should plunge voluntarily into all miseries.
Meanwhile, he signifies that he is not addressing to them mere idle menaces, but
that his doctrine is armed with the power of God, so that whosoever should
embrace it would find salvation in it, whilst none would despise it with
impunity. The distribution of the two clauses then follows, viz., that the love
of God and the keeping of His Law is prescribed that they may live; but if they
turn away from it, their destruction is denounced. It is not, then, without
reason that I have called the promises and threats the Sanctions of the Law,
because, in order that its authority may be assured to us, it is necessary that
both the recompence of obedience, and also the punishment of transgression,
should be set before us. By the worship of other gods, he means every revolt
from God, as I have observed already. He does not speak of their being "drawn
away" to superstition as an excuse for their instability, but rather as an
aggravation of their crime, inasmuch as they are carried away by their depraved
desires,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f288</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and thus desert the truth of God when
well acquainted with it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I call heaven and earth to
record this day against you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though the verb is
in the past tense, it indicates a present act. It is in order to deal with them
with greater urgency that he calls heaven and earth to witness the vengeance of
God. In these words he does not address men and angels, as some tamely expound
it, but in amplification attributes sense to things inanimate. I pass this over
briefly, because I
have</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f289</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> treated it more fully before; as also
what soon afterwards follows about life and death. For the Law, as respects its
doctrine, contains in it life and death; for the reward of eternal life is not
promised in it in vain; but since no one is found worthy of the promised reward,
Paul justly teaches that the Law ministers death. Still this is accidental, and
proceeds not from any fault in the doctrine, but from the corruption of men.
Nevertheless, it is asked how, if the corruption of our nature causes that the
Law should engender nothing but death, Moses commands us to "choose life," which
the sinner cannot attain to by it? Thence the Papists uplift their crests, both
to extol free-will and to boast of merits; as if Moses did not also testify and
proclaim the gratuitous mercy of God, and direct his disciples to Christ in
order to seek salvation from Him. When, therefore, he speaks of keeping the
Commandments, he does not exclude the two-fold grace of Christ, that believers,
being regenerated by the
Spirit,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f290</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should aspire to the obedience of
righteousness, and at the same time should be reconciled freely to God through
the forgiveness of their sins. And assuredly, since the same covenant is common
to us and to the ancient people, it is not to be doubted but that <i>they</i>
"chose life" who of old embraced the doctrine of Moses. At the same time, in so
far as his legation was different from the Gospel, he rather insists on the
office peculiarly entrusted to him, so that the distinction between Christ and
himself might more clearly appear. This is the reason why he more sparingly
touches upon justification by faith, whilst he enlarges fully on loving and
serving God and fulfilling His Commandments.</font><br></div>

with despair; for this was no ordinary work, or one on which the most skillful
artificers might exercise their ingenuity, but a marvelous structure, the
pattern of which had been shewn on the Mount, so that it might seem incredible
that any mortals should be able by their art to compass what God had commanded.
Besides, they had been entirely engaged in servile tasks in Egypt, such as would
extinguish all intellectual vigor, and prevent them from aspiring to any liberal
arts. Hence we gather that all, who obediently follow God's voice, are never
destitute of His aid. In all our difficulties, then, let this prayer encourage
us to proceed:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f291</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "Give what Thou commandest: and command
what Thou wilt."</font><br><font face="Palatino">To "call by name," is
equivalent to rendering eminent, so that Moses signifies that Bezaleel should be
something extraordinary, as being endowed with a peculiar gift. Thus Cyrus is
said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:4, to be called by his name, because in the purpose of God he had been
destined in a remarkable manner to execute such great things. Still, although
the call of Bezaleel was special, because, as I have just said, God entrusted to
him an unusual and by no means ordinary work, we gather that no one excels even
in the most despised and humble handicraft, except in so far as God's Spirit
works in him. For, although "there are diversities of gifts," still it is the
same Spirit from whom they all flow,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:4;) and also as God has seen fit to distribute and measure them
out to every man. Nor is this only the case with respect to the spiritual gifts
which follow regeneration, but in all the branches of knowledge which come into
use in common life. It is, therefore, a false division, when ungodly men ascribe
all the means of our support partly to nature and God's blessing, and partly to
the industry of man, since man's industry itself is a blessing from God. The
poets are more correct who acknowledge that all which is suggested by nature
comes from God; that all the arts emanate from Him, and therefore ought to be
accounted divine inventions. The utility of this doctrine is two-fold; first,
that all things which have reference to the support and defense of life,
whenever we meet with them, should excite our gratitude, and that whatever seems
to be derived from man's ingenuity, should be regarded as proofs of God's
paternal solicitude for us; and, secondly, that we should honor God as the
Author of so many good things, since He sanctifies them for our use. Moses
applies many epithets to the Spirit, because he is speaking of so remarkable a
work; yet we must conclude, float whatever ability is possessed by any emanates
from one only source, and is conferred by God. This is the only difference, that
Bezaleel was endued with consummate excellence, whilst God makes distribution to
others according to His pleasure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.

contradiction at first sight appears, when it is added immediately afterwards
that God had put wisdom in the hearts of all that were wise-hearted; for, if
they already excelled in intelligence, what was the object of this new
inspiration? Hence it has been commonly supposed, that the special grace of God
was only given in aid of that ability which we naturally possess. But rather are
we taught by this passage that, when anything grows in us, and our endowments
manifest themselves more conspicuously, our progress is only derived from the
continued operation of the Spirit. God had already conferred acuteness and
intelligence on the artificers in question; yet their dexterity was only, as it
were, the seed; and He now promises that He will give them more than had
previously appeared. I know that the words may be thus explained, &#8212;
Whosoever shall be fit and proper for the work, have therefore been endowed with
intelligence, because God has inspired it by His secret influence; but the other
exposition is more simple. What follows as to the various parts of the
tabernacle has been already treated of elsewhere.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the congregation of
the children of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no reason why
any one should be surprised that the order of the narrative is changed, since it
plainly appears from many passages that the order of time is not always observed
by Moses. Thus he appears here to connect the fall of the people with the
foregoing injunctions, both with respect to the building of the tabernacle, and
the rest of the religious service of God. But I have
shewn</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f293</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> upon good grounds that the tabernacle
was built before the people fell into idolatry. Therefore Moses now supplies
what had been before omitted, though I have followed the thread of the narrative
in order to render it less difficult.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The sum of
this relation is, that whatever was necessary for the building of the tabernacle
was liberally contributed. It must be observed that they had departed from the
presence of Moses: for we gather from this circumstance that, having severally
retired to their tents, they had considered apart by themselves what they should
give. Hence their liberality is deserving of greater praise, because it was
premeditated; for it often happens that when a person has been bountiful from
sudden impulse, he afterwards repents of it. When it is added that "they came,
every one," it is a question whether he means that the minds of the whole people
were prompt and cheerful in giving, or whether he indirectly rebukes the
stinginess and sordidness of those who meanly neglected their duty. In whichever
way we choose to take it, Moses repeats what we have seen before, that the
offerings were not extorted by force or necessity, but that they proceeded from
voluntary and cordial feelings. I thus construe the words, "They came, every
one, as his heart stirred each of them up," as if he had said that they were not
compelled by any law imposed upon them, but that every one was his own lawgiver,
of his own good-will. This passage is absurdly twisted by the Papists in proof
of free-will; as if men were incited by themselves to act rightly and well; for
Moses, even while praising their spontaneous feelings, does not mean to exclude
the grace of the Spirit, whereby alone our hearts are inclined to holy
affections; but this stirring up is contrasted with the unwillingness by which
ungodly men are withheld and restrained. Those, therefore, whom the Spirit
rules, He does not drag unwillingly by a violent and extrinsic impulse, as it is
called, but He so works within them upon their will, that believers stir up
themselves, and they voluntarily follow His leadings. So that when it is added,
"whose spirit was liberal in
himself,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f294</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the commencement of well-doing is not
ascribed to men, nor is even their concurrence praised, as if they co-operated
apart from God, but only the internal impulse of their minds, and the sincerity
of their desires&#183;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they came, both men and
women</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Express mention is made of the women,
not only whose bounty, but whose labors, as it soon afterwards appears, God
designed to make use of in the work of the sanctuary. Moses magnifies the fervor
of their pious desires, because they did not spare their ornaments; of which
people, and especially women, are generally so fond, that they would rather
suffer cold, hunger, or thirst, than touch
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f295</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was, therefore, a sign of no ordinary
zeal to deprive themselves of their rings and bracelets, which many are so slow
to part with, even when they are dying of hunger. Again, the contribution of
those is praised who gave brass, iron, shittim-wood, and rams' skins; so that
the poor might not doubt but that, although their ability might not be equal to
their wishes, the offering, which they presented willingly in their poverty, was
no less acceptable to God than when the rich man of his abundance gave what was
a hundred times more valuable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, the Lord hath called by
name Bezaleel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This was a great stimulus to
encourage them, when they plainly saw that God presided over the work; a
conspicuous proof of which was that new and extraordinary power wherewith
Bezaleel and Aboliab were endued; for although they had before been noble and
excellent artificers, still there is no doubt but that they were still further
endowed with higher gifts, even to a miracle. Hence it is not without cause that
he bids the people attend to this unexpected exertion of God's power; since it
was exactly as if he had stretched forth His hand from heaven for the
advancement of the work. For which reason also the tribe of each of them is
referred to, because of the conspicuous excellency of the grace, the memory of
which it was fitting to celebrate in all generations. Now, as God conferred this
honor on the architects of the visible sanctuary, so He declares that their
names shall be glorious in heaven, who, being furnished with the illustrious
gifts of the Spirit, faithfully employ their labors in the building of His
spiritual temple.

power, that, after the Israelites had been so contemptuously and oppressively

God is said to have "filled him with the Spirit of God," <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,
with the Divine Spirit; in order that we may understand that these endowments
were not natural to the man, nor even acquired by his own industry. For although
even the gifts of nature proceed from the Spirit of God, who gives their
intellect to all men no less than their life; still the distribution of peculiar
gifts is conspicuous in a higher and different degree. Besides, God had regard
to the exquisite nature of this work, so as to endow these artificers with
wonderful and extraordinary ability. The faculty of teaching is also added,
because two persons by themselves would never have completed so arduous a work
in their whole life-time: and this capacity, too, was the gift of Divine grace;
for else they would never have overcome the fatigue of instructing the ignorant,
nor would have so speedily prepared such a great multitude of men for fashioning
the various parts of the work with incredible symmetry.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then wrought Bezaleel and
Aholiab</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Moses might have seemed to be
unnecessarily prolix in recording the injunctions which God gave respecting the
building of the tabernacle, yet he repeats the same narrative here almost in the
same words; and this he does with the best design, and for very good reasons.
For it was of much importance that it might be seen by actual comparison how
exactly the artificers had conformed everything to the pattern laid down by God:
and this, not only in commendation of their obedience, but because it behooved
that there should be nothing human in the structure; for although they might
each of them have exerted themselves strenuously in the work, still it was not
lawful for them to give the slightest scope to their own inventions; nay, this
would have been a profanation of the sacred edifice, not to follow in every part
what had been so carefully dictated to Moses. And this might avail as a
restraint upon them in future times, so that they might not violate God's
commands by any change or innovation. They did not indeed understand the reason
of everything either in reference to number or measure; but it became them to be
assured that God had commanded nothing without a purpose. Hence, also, their
minds should have been elevated to the heavenly pattern, so as reverently to
look up to the mysteries, obscure as they were, which it contained, until its
full manifestation. This verbal repetition, then, reminds us how accurately the
labor and art of men in the building corresponded with the command of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses called Bezaleel and
Aholiab</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not without reason that Moses so
often exalts the grace of God's Spirit in the ingenuity and artistic skill of
the workmen. In the first place he speaks of them as skillful architects, and
then, by way of correction, adds that they were furnished from above with such
intelligence. Thus the absurdity of the Papists is refuted, who, in order to
prove free-will, think it sufficient to drag forward the passages in which
rectitude of will is commended: whereas, even though men may will aright, it is
foolish to infer that therefore they are possessed of free-will, unless it be
proved that the will proceeds from themselves. Consequently, what follows in the
text, &#8212; that every one contributed either of his labor or his substance to
the building of the tabernacle, according as their hearts stirred them up,
&#8212; does not so make men the authors of pious affections, as to defraud God
of His praise. It is true that men understand &#8212; are willing &#8212;
encourage themselves to holy endeavors; but the question is, from whence comes
their intelligence, their will, and their zeal in well-doing? Scripture decides
that they are the gifts of God and the Spirit: the Papists improperly arrogate
them to themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they received of Moses
all the offering</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here is set forth, first of
all, the diligence and prudence both of Moses and the artificers, and secondly,
their integrity. Their prudence is shewn in the distribution of the materials
among them; their diligence in the quickness with which they commence the work,
without waiting till they have enough for its completion; whilst they testify
their extraordinary integrity when they voluntarily declare that enough has been
given, and put a stop to the offerings, lest they should be more than they
required. We know how few restrain
themselves</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when an opportunity is given of thieving
without detection; and, even if there be no disposition to deceive, yet most
people are tempted by ambition, greedily to long for more to pass through their
hands than they need. We see, then, how God directed them all to undertake the
work of the sanctuary, and impelled them to persevere in it by His Spirit. This
grace, however, manifests itself most fully in the marvelous ardor of the
people. They were not very rich, for they had had no treasures laid up for a
long period; and the wealthiest among them had no more than what they had
secretly conveyed away out of Egypt; whilst the building was sumptuous; and
still they do not cease from contributing more than was necessary, until an
edict forbade them. Such promptitude and liberality was worthy of no common
praise; and hence it is more wonderful that they should soon afterwards neglect
the true God in whose service they were thus zealous, and fall into foul
idolatry. Let us learn from hence, that the pious zeal, which existed in them
for a short time, emanated from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit; and further,
that all our best feelings vanish, unless the gift of stedfastness be
superadded.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows represents, as by a
lively image, as we have said, how faithfully they executed whatever God had

<div><font face="Palatino">If the repetition, which might appear to be
superfluous in these chapters, should be wearisome to us, let us reflect on the
intention of the Holy Spirit, who, in narrating the execution of the work, uses
almost the identical words wherein He had previously set forth the commands of
God, viz., that we may understand that Moses, and the artificers themselves, did
not vary in the smallest point from the rule prescribed to them. God had
commanded the Ark of the Covenant to be made, together with its cover; and Moses
relates how it was completed, so that the artificers did not omit even its very
minutest detail. He ordered a table to be made for the offering of bread, and
not a single syllable is neglected. As to the candlestick there was the same
scrupulous obedience, so that they did not alter it in any part. In the altar of
incense there was no kind of dissimilarity between the command and the work;
and, finally, the composition of the oil exactly corresponds with the command.
There is no question, then, but that Moses commends obedience, as it is the
foundation of true piety, and at the same time reminds us that there was no
exercise of the imagination in the whole service of the tabernacle, because
there is nothing more opposite to the purity of religion than to do anything
which is not enjoined.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he made the altar of
burnt-offering</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The purport of this chapter is
the same as that of the last, except that the order of some parts of it is
transposed, though not a word is changed. He begins with the altar of
burnt-offering, which he states to have been made of the materials and the form
prescribed by God, in order that the people might there offer with surer
confidence their sacrifices for the expiation of sin, and for thanksgiving. One
thing which had not been mentioned before, is here added respecting the laver of
brass, or cauldron (<i>concha</i>,) from whence they took the water of
sprinkling for expiation, viz., that this laver was ornamented with the mirrors
of the women. Some explain
this,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f299</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the vessel was so bright that it
might be easily discovered on every side whether there was any scandalous, or
wanton, or indelicate act committed; for we know that impure and ungodly men
sometimes conceal their iniquities under the cover of religion, even as it; is
written that the women who frequented the tabernacle for religious exercises
were defiled by the sons of Eli, the priests.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 2:22.) But there is another conjecture equally probable, that these
mirrors were dedicated by holy women for the ornament of the Temple, and for
sacred purposes; for, whereas women are only too much given to outward adornment
and finery, they have been always very fond of mirrors, both for the purpose of
painting their cheeks and arranging their hair, so that not a single hair should
be out of place. Isaiah, therefore, (3:23,) enumerates mirrors amongst the
luxuries</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f300</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the female world. Some, then, think
that women, being devoted to God's service, laid aside this vanity, and
consecrated their mirrors in testimony of their repentance. It might, however,
have been that, amongst the other gifts before spoken of, they offered mirrors
also, which were mounted as embossments in this brasen laver. Others suppose
that they were carvings, by which the portraits of females were depicted, as if
seen in mirrors. The simple notion is most approved by me, that they were votive
offerings, wherewith pious women had desired to decorate the sanctuary, and that
they had been applied to this use by the advice of the artificers; for he does
not speak generally of all the women, but of those who <i>warred</i> or
<i>assembled</i> <i>by</i> <i>troops</i> at the door of the tabernacle; for
translators</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f301</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> variously explain this word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">abx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tzaba</i>, both in this passage and that from Samuel which I have just
quoted. It is also applied to the Levites, who are
said</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f302</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "to war the warfare" of the sanctuary,
whilst performing their appointed work.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;040403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
4:3; 8:24.) Indeed this metaphor is by no means unsuitable to watchings and
long-continued prayers. The sum is, that the laver was cast of their materials,
or, as I rather suppose, embossed with these mirrors, in order that it might be
more splendid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the sum of the
tabernacle</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f303</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As much as to say that this was the
computation, or these the numbers; for he gives us to understand that not only
was the tabernacle thus at once completed, but that its several parts were
numerically distinguished, and consigned as it were to
registers,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f304</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so as to be given in charge to the
Levites, lest any part of it should be lost. For the reference here is not so
much to the fabric, or the architecture of the tabernacle, as to its perpetual
conservation, viz., that Ithamar the priest deposited its several parts with the
Levites, and this in accordance with the command of
Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Bezaleel, the son of
Uri</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again impresses upon us that the whole
work was divine, both because Moses faithfully delivered the commands of God,
and the artificers followed them with precise accuracy. At the same time, he
counts up the whole sum of gold and silver, and shews us on what it was
consumed. Hence we gather that every one honestly discharged his duty, and that
no one was corrupted or drawn aside by covetousness so as to fall from his
integrity. We are also informed from whence the amount of silver was obtained,
viz., from the <i>census</i> of the people; for a tax of a common shekel, which
was half a shekel of the sanctuary, was imposed on every head, as
we</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f305</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> have already seen. Moses now shews that
this entire sum was collected and paid without fraud, and so applied as that
none should be lost.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of the blue, and purple,
and scarlet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The description of the sacerdotal
garments, which is repeated in this chapter, is more accurate than it would have
been had he been speaking of some unimportant matter. And assuredly, since
Christ was vividly represented in the person of the high priest, this was a most
important part of the legal service. We have elsewhere set forth how far it was
from being an empty pomp, as when the Popish sacrificers now-a-days, in order to
acquire dignity, dazzle the eyes of the simple by the splendor of their
vestments, and their magnificent paraphernalia; but that rather it was for the
purpose of placing before men's eyes all that faith ought to consider in Jesus
Christ. We have especially seen how great mysteries were contained in the mitre,
which was Holiness to the Lord: and in the ephod, in which shone forth the light
of truth and integrity of life, and in which were the symbols of the ten tribes,
so that the priest bore the people itself upon his shoulders and before his
breast, in such a manner that in the person of one all might be presented
familiarly before God. For this reason he repeats seven times the clause, "as
the Lord commanded Moses;" which certainly has the effect of awakening
attention.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus was all the work of the

whereby he indicates that in no part was there the least defect, and also
declares that the children of Israel had so obeyed God's commands, that the work
itself varied in no respect from its pattern. "The children of Israel," he says,
"did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did they;" whence we
gather that no part of the building was impaired by any admixture. Afterwards it
is added, that the tabernacle with its utensils and furniture was brought before
Moses, and that all things were approved of by his judgment; for he is said to
have "blessed them," because they had duly and faithfully obeyed God's command.
This, however, was not a simple prayer, as of a private individual; but it was a
promise of reward, such as might awaken confidence in the minds of the people,
when they heard from the mouth ("D'un tel Prophete;" of such a Prophet. &#8212;

pleasing to God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come up unto the Lord, thou,
and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before Moses
erected the tabernacle and consecrated it by a solemn ceremony, it was necessary
for him to fetch the Tables of the Covenant, which were a pledge of God's favor;
otherwise, if the ark had nothing in it, the sanctuary would have been in a
manner empty. For this reason, he is commanded to go up into the mount, but not
without a splendid train of companions, in order that an appropriate preparation
might arouse their minds for a fit reception of this especial blessing. He is,
therefore, commanded to take with him Aaron his brother, and Nadab and Abihu,
together with seventy of the elders of the people. This was the number of
witnesses selected to behold the glory of God. Before, however, they ascended
the mount, a sacrifice was offered by the whole people, and the Book of the Law
was read. Finally, Moses alone was received into the top of the mount, to bring
from thence the Tables written by the hand of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, however, (See this subject further
discussed on Numbers 11:16, <i>infra</i>.) arises a question respecting the
seventy elders; for we shall see elsewhere that the seventy were not chosen till
the people had departed from Mount Sinai; whereas mention is made of them here,
before the promulgation of the Law, which seems to be by no means consistent.
But this difficulty is removed, if we allow, what we gather from this passage,
that, even before they came to Mount Sinai, each tribe had appointed its
governors (<i>praefectos</i>), who would make up this number, since there were
six of every tribe; but that when Moses afterwards desired to be relieved of his
burdens, part of the government was transferred
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f306
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">to these seventy persons, since this number
was already sanctioned by custom and use. Certainly, since it is plainly stated
that there were</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f307</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> seventy from the very first, it is
probable that this number of coadjutors was given to Moses in order to make as
little change as possible. For we know that, when a custom has obtained, men are
very unwilling to depart from it. But it might have also been that the desire
and intention of the Israelites was thus to celebrate the memory of their
origin; for seventy persons had gone down into Egypt with Jacob, and, in less
than two hundred and twenty years after they went there, their race had
increased to six hundred thousand, besides women and children. It is not,
therefore, contrary to probability that seventy persons were appointed to
preside over the whole people, in order that so marvelous a blessing of God
might continue to be testified in all ages, as if to trace the commencement of
their race up to its very source.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses alone shall come
near the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Three gradations are here
marked. A station is prescribed for the people, from whence they may "worship
afar off;" the elders and the priests are appointed to be the companions of
Moses, to come closer, and thus to be witnesses to the people of all the things
which we shall afterwards see to be shewn them; whilst, as they were separated
from the multitude, so finally Moses alone was received up into the higher
glory; for he was caught up on high in the covering of the cloud.
This</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f308</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> distinction is marked in the words,
"Moses alone shall come near...; but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the
people go up." Some translators render the verbs in the past tense; but
improperly, in my opinion; for Moses is not yet relating what was done, but only
what God had commanded, as is plain from the next verse, wherein also the
modesty and humility of the people is commended, because they received with
reverence a command which was not in itself very agreeable or likely to be
approved. For, such is the ambition of men, that it might have appeared
insulting that they should be set afar off and prohibited from approaching the
mountain, like strangers and heathens. It is, therefore, an evidence of their
pious reverence, that they should submit to be placed at a distance, and should
be contented with a position apparently less honorable. And Moses more clearly
expresses their promptitude to obey, when he reports their words, that they
would do all that he had declared to them from the mouth of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
Moses</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"><i>
</i>f309</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrote all the words of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This parenthesis is opportunely inserted;
for we shall see a little further on that the book was read before the people;
but, in order to awaken greater attention, before the reading he built an altar
and offered victims in the sight of all the people. Moreover, it must be
observed that statues</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f310</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were erected near the altar according to
the number of the tribes, that they might know that they were not kept afar off
in token of rejection, but only that, conscious of their own unworthiness, they
might humble themselves before God in fear and trembling; for, though they were
removed to a considerable distance, still they were remembered before God, and
thus He embraced them all, as it were, by means of these statues. What Moses,
however, calls by this name, were not images bearing the shape of a man, but
heaps of stones, which might be as monuments representing the twelve tribes;
that they might know that they were by no means excluded from the sanctity of
the altar.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he sent young men of the
children of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He either means that they
were the sacrificial attendants (<i>victimarios</i>,) by whose hands the victims
were killed, or that some were chosen who might be active and strong to drag the
oxen to the altar. The tribe of Levi was not yet consecrated; whereas the word
used for "offering,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f311</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is only applied to the priests, where a
distinction is marked between the Levites and the rest of the people. The first
meaning is, therefore, the most suitable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We
have stated elsewhere that
the</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f312</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> sacrifices of prosperities were designed
as acts of thanksgiving; and yet that they were not only expressions of
gratitude, but also that prayers were mixed with them in supplication of good
success. This offering, however, comprised in it a ratification of the Covenant,
as appears immediately afterwards; for, in order to increase the sanctity and
security of covenants, they have in all ages, and
even</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f313</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> amongst heathen nations, been
accompanied with sacrifices. To this end Moses, the victims being slain, pours
half the blood upon the altar, and keeps half in basins to sprinkle the people,
that by this</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f314</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> symbol the Covenant might be ratified,
whereof he was the mediator and surety. Paul, in allusion to this custom, says,
that he should rejoice, if he were "offered upon the sacrifice and service of
<i>their</i> faith" whom he had gained for Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;505017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:17;) and he uses the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">spe&gt;ndesqai</font><font face="Palatino">,
which</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f315</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is primarily applied to covenants. But
the case of this sacrifice was peculiar; for God desired the Jews to be reminded
of the one solid confirmation of the Covenant, which He made with them; as if He
had openly shown that it would then only be ratified and effectual, when it
should be sealed with blood. And this the Apostle
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:19) carefully takes into consideration, when he says, that after the Law had
been declared, Moses "sprinkled both the book and all the people" with blood;
for, although there is no express mention here made of the book, the Apostle
does not unreasonably comprise it under the word "altar." He also alludes to
another kind of sacrifice, treated of in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
19:5, and therefore mentions "the scarlet-wool and hyssop." The sum is, that the
blood was, as it were, the medium whereby the covenant was confirmed and
established, since the altar, as the sacred seat of God, was bathed with half of
it, and then the residue was sprinkled over the people. Hence we gather that the
covenant of gratuitous adoption was made with the ancient people unto eternal
salvation, since it was sealed with the blood of Christ in type and shadow. Now,
if this doctrine hold good under the Law, much more must it occupy a place with
us now; and hence, in order that God's promises may always maintain their power
and certainty, let this sealing be constantly kept before us; and let us
remember that the blood of Christ has therefore once been shed, that it might
engrave upon our hearts the covenant whereby we are called to the hope of the
kingdom of heaven. For this reason Christ in the Holy Supper commends His blood
as the seal of the New Covenant; nay, whenever we take the sacred books into our
hands, the blood of Christ, ought to occur to our minds, as if the
whole</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f316</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of its sacred instruction were written
therewith; for it is obvious that Christ compares with the figure the truth
which was manifested in Himself; to which also the admonition of the Apostle,
which I have just quoted, refers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must now
carefully observe the course of the proceeding. First, Moses states that he read
the book before the people; and then adds that the people themselves embraced
the covenant proposed to them. Finally, he relates that when the people had
professed their obedience, he sprinkled the blood, not without adding his
testimony, and that in a loud voice. The context here shews us the true and
genuine nature of the Sacraments, together with their correct and proper use;
for unless doctrine precede them to be a connecting link between God and man,
they will be empty and delusive signs, however honorable may be the encomiums
passed on them. But inasmuch as mutual consent is required in all compacts, so,
when God invites His people to receive grace, He stipulates that they should
give Him the obedience of faith, so as to answer, Amen. Thus nothing can be more
preposterous than the invention of dumb sacraments: such as those childish
charms which the Papists hawk about as sacraments, without the word of God;
whilst, at the same time, it must be added that the word, which gives life to
the Sacraments, is not an obscure whisper, like that magical incantation of the
Papists, when they blow on the bread and the cup, and which they call the
consecration; but it is a clear and distinct voice which is addressed to men,
and avails to beget faith in them. Thus Moses here speaks aloud to the people,
and reminds them that God enters into covenant with
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, although the profession here recorded
might seem to be derived from too great confidence, when the people declare that
they will do whatsoever God commands, still it contains nothing amiss or
reprehensible; inasmuch as the faithful among them promised nothing, except in
reliance on the help of God: and gratuitous reconciliation, if they should sin,
was included in it. This was not indeed the proper office of the Law, to incline
men's hearts to the obedience of righteousness; as also under the Law there was
no true and real expiation to wash away the guilt of sins; but the office of the
Law was to lead men step by step to Christ, that they might seek of Him pardon
and the Spirit of regeneration. It is, therefore, unquestionable that the elect
of God embraced by faith the substance and truth of the shadows when they
voluntarily offered themselves to keep the covenant of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then went up Moses and Aaron,
Nadab and Abihu</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Thus it is that I connect the
history: Moses, having finished reading the Law, and having sprinkled the blood,
took with him the companions pointed out to him by God, and having left the
people, went with these some way up the mountain. I have thought it well
slightly to touch upon this, because some translators render the verb improperly
in the pluperfect tense, as if he and the elders had already
before</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> been separated from the people; but this
is very absurd, for it was necessary for him to remain in the plain, in order to
address the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There the glory of God was
beheld more closely by the elders, that they might afterwards relate to the
people what they had seen, and that thus the thing, being proved by competent
witnesses, might obtain undoubted credit. For this reason he says, that "they
saw the God of Israel," not in all His reality and greatness, but in accordance
with the dispensation which He thought best, and which he accommodated to the
capacity of man. The form of God is indeed nowhere described, but the pediment
(<i>basis</i>) on which He stood was like a work of
sapphire.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<i>libnath</i>, some translate <i>stone</i>, others <i>whiteness</i>, others
<i>brick</i>. Whichever sense it is preferred to take it in, but little affects
the main point in the matter; for the color of a sapphire was presented to them,
to elevate their minds by its brightness above the world; and therefore it is
immediately added, that its appearance was as of the clear and serene sky. By
this symbol they were reminded that the glory of God is above all heavens; and
since in His very footstool there is such exquisite and surpassing beauty,
something still more sublime must be thought of Himself, and such as would
ravish all our senses with admiration. Thus the throne of God was shewn to
Ezekiel "as the appearance of a sapphire-stone."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;260126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
1:26; 10:1.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Finally, on the footstool Infinite
Majesty appeared, such as to strike the elders with astonishment, so that they
might humble themselves with greater reverence before the incomprehensible glory
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And upon the nobles of the
children of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These words, as it seems to
me, are violently distorted by
those</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f319</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who expound them, that the elders were
not made participators of the prophetic gift, or that the virtue of God did not
extend to them; for these clauses are to be taken connectedly thus: although
they saw God, His hand was not laid upon them but they ate and drank. Hence we
may gather that God's paternal favor towards them is pointed out in that He
spared them; for we must bear in mind what is said elsewhere, "There shall no
man see my face and live."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
33:20.) Thus, amongst the ancients, this was a kind of proverbial expression: We
shall die, because we have seen God. So Jacob, in commendation of God's grace,
says, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:30.) For if the mountains melt at the sight of Him, what must needs happen to
a mortal man, than whom there is nothing more frail or feeble? Herein, then,
does God's incomparable lenity betray itself, when, in manifesting Himself to
His elect, He does not altogether absorb and reduce them to nothing; especially
when some special vision is presented to them. In sum, therefore, Moses shews us
that it was a miracle that the rulers of Israel remained safe and sound,
although the terrible majesty of God had appeared to them. Now, this was the
case, because they had not rashly thrust themselves forward, but had come near
at the call of God. Hence we learn that our boldness never exceeds its due
bounds, nor can be condemned as presumption, when it is founded on the command
of God; whilst worse than any pride or self-confidence is timidity, which, under
pretense of modesty, leads us to distrust the word of God. If any one of the
people had attempted to do the same as the rulers, he would have experienced in
his destruction what it is to advance beyond bounds. But the reason why their
free and bold access turned out successfully to the elders, was because they
obeyed the command of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, as to
their eating, I interpret to mean a solemn banquet, which was a part or
appendage of a sacrifice, as we have seen on Exodus
18</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f320</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and in many other
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto Moses,
Come up to me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses himself is now taken up
higher; because it was sufficient that the elders should be admitted to that
intermediate vision, from whence they might certainly know that he would not
proceed further, except by God's command, in order that he might be received to
familiar colloquy. Although, however, Joshua began to go on with him, it is
plain that he was only his companion for six days, until Moses left him behind,
and was gathered into the cloud. When God declares that He will give him "a law
and commandment," this must not be understood of any new instruction, but of the
authentic writing (<i>consignatione</i>) of the Law: for, after having spoken of
the two tables, He immediately mentions, in apposition, the Law and Commandment,
by way of explanation; as if He had said that He would give the tables, which
were to be a divine
monument</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f321</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of His covenant; so that a summary of
doctrine should exist among the people, not written with ink, and by the hand of
man, but by the secret power of the Spirit. I am afraid the speculation of
Augustine is more subtle than correct, that the Law was written by the finger of
God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f322</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because only the Spirit of God engraves
it on our hearts; for, to pass over the fact that the hardness of the stones was
not changed, what will their breaking mean, which will be spoken of hereafter?
Surely it does not accord that, whereas the grace of regeneration endures unto
the end, the Law should be only engraven efficaciously by the Spirit upon men's
hearts for a moment. What I have advanced, however, is beyond controversy, that
the Law was inscribed upon these polished stones, that the perpetuity of the
covenant might be testified in all ages.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tarry ye here for us, until
we come again</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I do not take the words so
precisely as to suppose that he commanded them to stand still in the same place;
but since he was just about to be separated from intercourse with men, I
suppose, that our earthly dwelling-place is indicated by the
adverb,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f323</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since it immediately follows, that if
anything should occur, Aaron and Hur were to be his substitutes for ruling the
people and settling quarrels. For, since care and anxiety might beset their
minds, as being deprived of their only guide in counsel, and minister of safety,
he offers this consolation to relieve their despondency. Hence it follows that
they were sent back to occupy their charge, which could not be the case, unless
they were in communication with the people. We are not aware whether Moses was
pre-informed as to the time (of his
absence,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f324
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) although it is more probable that he was in
doubt and suspense, until he penetrated into the secret counsel of God. From the
last verse but one, we learn, that though the majesty of God was more clearly
revealed to the elders, still it was conspicuous to all, from the least to the
greatest, lest any excuse for ignorance should remain; for when the fire was
seen burning for six continuous days, as if it would consume the mountain, how
could they afterwards pretend that it was not fully understood from what Author
the Law proceeded?</font><br></div>

31:18	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b> And he gave unto Moses,
when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of
testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.	<b>18.</b> Et dedit
Deus Most, quum finem fecisset loquendi cum eo in monte Sinai, duas tabulas
Testimonii, tabulas lapideas scriptas digito
Dei.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he gave unto
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It must be observed, that, after the
voice of God had been heard from the midst of the fire, and He had delivered the
Ten Commandments, and the form of the tabernacle had been described, and the
work had been already finished by the artificers, though its dedication had not
yet taken place, Moses was again withdrawn from the sight and intercourse of
men, that he might be taught apart by himself to be a faithful interpreter of
the Law. For although God had briefly comprised in the Ten Commandments the sum
of His doctrine, which might suffice for the rule of a pious and righteous life,
still a clearer exposition was needed, such as Moses afterwards added. With this
object he was taken up into the sanctuary (<i>adytum</i>) of heaven, as it were,
in order that he might familiarly learn all things that concerned the full and
complete understanding of the Ten Commandments, since he could never have
attained their genuine meaning if God had not been his Master and Teacher. Hence
we gather that he wrote his five books not only under the guidance of the Spirit
of God, but as God Himself had suggested them, speaking to him out of His own
mouth. Wherefore he observed silence for forty days, that he might afterwards
freely speak by the authority of God. Thus ought all true pastors of the Church
to be disciples, so as to teach nothing but what they have received. But
although God might in a moment have fully perfected His servant, yet, in order
more surely to evince that he advanced nothing which did not proceed from the
school of heaven, he was separated for forty days from the human race, so that
the Israelites might henceforth look up to him as to an angel sent from heaven;
for there could be no savour of earth about him who had thus lived with God,
without meat and drink, or any other means of nourishment, and divested of all
infirmity of the flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Finally, the Ten
Commandments were written on two tables, so that they might never be lost. I
have elsewhere stated why they were divided into two tables, viz., because they
consist of two parts, the first of which is the rule of piety, whilst the second
prescribes how we must live righteously, innocently, and chastely with men. Thus
the worship of God comes first in order, and then the duties of charity follow.
The tables were of stone, inasmuch as it is usual for enduring monuments to be
engraven on brass, or stones. That they were "written with the finger of God,"
we must understand to mean that the characters were formed without the hand or
skill of men, by the secret virtue of God; nor is it a matter of wonder that a
writing should have suddenly been brought into existence at the same will
(<i>nutu</i>) of God, whereby the waste and shapeless materials of the world,
which they call chaos, were changed so as to be resplendent with astonishing
elegance and beauty. This expression, however, is metaphorical, whereby what is
only applicable to men is figuratively spoken of God; for God is not corporeal
so as to write with His finger; and for Him to act is only to command; as it is
said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He spake, and all things
were made; he commanded, and they were created."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
33:9; 148:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many approve of the allegory, that the Law was
written by the Spirit of God on stones, because the hardness of our heart does
not receive it without the grace of regeneration; but we must rather hold to the
antithesis of Paul, wherein he shews that the Gospel differs from the Law in
this respect, because it is written on fleshy hearts, subdued unto obedience,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:3;) and indeed it is by no means fitting that we should trifle in
such conceits as this, when the simple intention of God is abundantly manifest,
viz., that the Law was registered upon stones, in order that the perpetuity of
its doctrine should be maintained in all ages.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when the people saw that
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this narrative we perceive the
detestable impiety of the people, their worse than base ingratitude, and their
monstrous madness, mixed with stupidity. For their sakes Moses had been carried
up above the state of terrestrial life, that he might receive the injunctions of
his mission, and that his authority might be beyond the reach of controversy.
They perversely declare that they know not what has become of him, nay, they
speak contemptuously of him as of a person unknown to them. It is for this that
Stephen severely blames
them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440735&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:35.) They confess that he had been their deliverer, yet they cannot tolerate
his absence for a little time, nor are they affected with any reverence towards
him, unless they have him before their eyes.
Moreover,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> although God offered Himself as if
present with them by day and by night in the pillar of fire, and in the cloud,
they still despised so illustrious and lively an image of His glory and power,
and desire to have Him represented to them in the shape of a dead idol. For what
could they mean by saying, "make us gods which shall go before us?" Could they
not see the pillar of fire and the cloud? Was not God's paternal solicitude
abundantly conspicuous every day in the manna? Was he not near them in ways
innumerable</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet, accounting as nothing all these
true, and sure, and manifest tokens of God's presence, they desire to have a
figure which may satisfy their vanity. And this was the original source of
idolatry, that men supposed that they could not otherwise possess God, unless by
subjecting Him to their own imagination. Nothing, however, can be more
preposterous; for since the minds of men and all their senses sink far below the
loftiness of God, when they try to bring Him down to the measure of their own
weak capacity, they travesty Him. In a word, whatever man's reason conceives of
Him is mere falsehood; and nevertheless, this depraved longing can hardly be
repressed, so fiercely does it burst out. They are also influenced by pride and
presumption, when they do not hesitate to drag down His glory as it were from
heaven, and to subject it to earthly elements. We now understand what motive
chiefly impelled the Israelites to this madness in demanding that a figure of
God should be set before them, viz., because they measured Him by their own
senses. Wonderful indeed was their stupidity, to desire that a God should be
made by mortal men, as if he could be a god, or could deserve to be accounted
such who obtains his divinity at the caprice of men. Still, it is not probable
that they were so absurd as to desire a new god to be created for them; but they
call "gods" by metonymy those outward images, by looking at which the
superstitious imagine that God is near them. And this is evident from the fact,
that not only the noun but the verb also is in the plural number; for although
they were satisfied with one God, still they in a manner cut Him to pieces by
their various representations of Him. Nevertheless, however they may deceive
themselves under this or that pretext, they still desire to be creators of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those who suppose that <i>confusion</i> is
implied by the word "delayed," are, in my opinion, mistaken; for, although the
word

<i>boshesh</i>, with its third radical doubled, is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wb</font><font face="Palatino">,

from

so fear God as that religion vanishes from their hearts, unless there be some
task-master (<i>exactor</i>) standing by them to keep them in the path of duty.
They duly obeyed Moses and reverenced his person; but, because they were only
influenced by his presence, as soon as they were deprived of it they ceased to
fear God. Thus, whilst Joshua was alive, and the other holy Judges, they seemed
to be faithful in the exercise of piety, but when <i>they</i> were dead, they
straightway relapsed into disobedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Aaron said unto them,
Break off the golden ear-rings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I doubt not but
that Aaron, being overcome by the importunate clamor of the people, endeavored
to escape by means of a subterfuge; still, this is no valid excuse for him,
since he ought to have heartily opposed them in a direct reply, and sharply to
have inveighed against their wicked renunciation of God. By commanding them to
give him gold, he might have quieted their intemperate demands through dread of
the expense; but it was a remedy more likely to be successful, to snatch from
them those ornaments and trinkets of which women do not willingly allow
themselves to be deprived. He therefore purposely requires of them a hateful, or
at any rate a by no means pleasant thing, that he might thus impede their sinful
design; but without success, for the power of superstition to carry people away
is not less than that of lust. Perhaps also he had the tabernacle in view, lest
they should sacrilegiously proceed to lay hands on the sacred vessels; and there
was a probability that, if it remained uninjured, the sight of it might at
length recall them to a better mind. Besides, the recollection of their recent
profuse liberality might have extinguished or cooled their ardor, from the fear
of being utterly drained. He says emphatically,
"Break</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f328</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> off the ear-rings from your wives and
children," that they may desist from the purpose out of dread of giving offense,
since women are slow to part with such objects of gratification. But it is added
immediately afterwards, that they were so blinded by the fervor of their foolish
zeal, that they undervalued everything in comparison with their perverse desire,
and thus the ornaments were taken from their ears. The readiness with which this
was done was wonderful; and not by one person, or by a few, but by the whole
people, as if in rivalry of each other. Even in these days ear-rings are worn by
the</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Orientals, though it is not so common
among us. Now, if unbelievers are so prodigal in their absurdities as to throw
away thus carelessly and rashly whatever is precious to them, how shall their
tenacity be excusable who are so niggardly in providing for the service of God?
Hence let us learn to beware of foolishly squandering our possessions in
unnecessary expenditure, and to be liberal where we ought; especially to be
ready to spend ourselves, and what we have, when we know that our offerings are
pleasing and acceptable to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he received them at their
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He briefly narrates this base and
shameful deed; yet sufficiently shows, that whilst Aaron yielded to their
madness, he still desired to cure it, though, at the same time, he was weak and
frightened, so as to pretend to give his assent, because he feared the
consequences of the tumult as regarded himself. For why does he not command the
ear-rings to be thrown into some chest, lest he should pollute himself by the
contagion of the sacrilege? Since, therefore, he received them into his own
hands, it was a sign of a servile and effeminate mind; and thus he is said to
have been the founder, or sculptor of the calf, when it is nevertheless probable
that workmen were employed upon it. But the infamy of the crime is justly
brought upon him, inasmuch as he was its main author, and by his guilt betrayed
the religion and honor of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew

He is compared to brute animals? Still it had no effect towards bringing them to
repentance; and this is expressed with much force immediately afterwards, when
they said to each other, "These be thy gods, O Israel." Surely the hideousness
of the spectacle should have struck them with horror, so as to induce them
voluntarily to condemn their own madness; but, on the contrary, they mutually
exhort one another to obstinacy; for there is no doubt but that Moses indicates
that they were like fans to each other, and thus that their frenzy was
reciprocally excited. For, as Isaiah and Micah exhort believers, that each of

denied that by their new and unwonted mode of worship, they desired to detract
from the honor of their Redeemer; but rather that it was thus magnified because
they worshipped Himself under a visible image. Thus now-a-days do the Papists
boldly obtrude their fictitious rites upon God; and boast that they do more for
Him by their additions and inventions than as if they merely continued within
the bounds prescribed by Himself. But let us learn from this passage, that
whatever colouring superstition may give to its idols, and by whatever titles it
may dignify them, they remain idols still; for, however those who corrupt the
pure worship of God by their inventions, may pride themselves on their good
intentions, they still deny the true God, and substitute devils in His

their hearts. Thus from bad examples does contagion easily creep into the hearts
of those who were else untainted; nor is it without good reason that David

sports engaged in, in honor of the idols; for, as we have seen elsewhere, the
faithful feasted before God at their sacrifices, and so also heathen nations
celebrated sacred feasts, whilst they worshipped their idols in games. Of this
point Paul is the surest interpreter, who quotes this passage in condemnation of
the idolatry of the ancient people, and ably accommodates it to the purpose he
had in hand; for the Corinthians had not gone to such an excess as to bow their
knees to idols, but were boon-companions of unbelievers in their polluted
sacrifices.

temptation to shake the faith of Moses. He thought that his own and the people's
happiness was absolutely complete, when God's covenant was engraven on the
tables to secure its perpetuity; whereas now he hears that this covenant was
violated, and almost annihilated by the perfidy and rebellion of the people,
whilst its abolition involved the loss of salvation and all other blessings.
Moreover, that God might more sorely wound the mind of the holy man, He
addresses him exactly as if part of the ignominy fell upon himself; for there is
an indirect reproach implied in the words, "thy people, which thou broughtest
out of the land of Egypt." Yet Moses had only taken this charge upon him by
God's command, and, indeed, unwillingly; how, then, is this deliverance thrown
in his teeth, wherein he had only obeyed God? and why is his devotedness spoken
of in mockery, as if he had bestowed his labor amiss, when no part of the blame
attaches to him? I have already said that God sometimes thus pierces the hearts
of the godly to the quick, in order to prove their patience, as if their
well-directed zeal had been the cause of the evils which occur.
Some</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f336</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> give too subtle an exposition to this,
viz., that they are called the people of Moses, because they had ceased to be
the people of God; and suppose that there is an antithesis here, as if it were
said, &#8212; your people, and not mine; but I fear this is not well founded;
for, since they had broken the covenant, they were not more alienated from God
than from Moses the minister of the Law. I do not deny that it is an implied
renunciation of them; but we must bear in mind that design of God, to which I
have already adverted, that Moses was in a manner implicated in their crime, in
order that his patience might be tried, and also that he might be more grieved
at its enormity. Meanwhile, it is obvious that God refers to His recent grace,
because it was a monstrous and incredible thing that those who had been lately
delivered by this amazing power, and with whom He had just renewed His covenant,
should be so suddenly drawn away into rebellion. He adds also, in aggravation of
their crime, that they had immediately turned aside from the way which was
pointed out to them. Forty days had not yet elapsed since Moses left them, when
they were impelled by their depravity to such madness as this. A little time ago
they had manifested a wonderful zeal for God's service, by abundantly
contributing what was required; the glory of the tabernacle was presented to
their eyes to restrain them; and yet they burst through all these barriers, and
rush impetuously after their own lust, when scarcely six months had passed since
the promulgation of the Law. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>shicheth</i>, being in the Pihel conjugation, is active; and yet is employed
without being intensive; I have, therefore, rendered it, <i>corrupted</i>
<i>themselves</i>, though it might be appropriately taken passively, viz., that
the people had been corrupted.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have turned aside
quickly out of the way</i></font><font face="Palatino">. So speedy a
transgression, as I have said, aggravates their crime. God then states the
nature of their corruption, that they have worshipped a molten calf, that is to
say, the work of their own hands. But it is to be observed, that what they had
put forward as a colouring for their ungodliness is alleged last, as the climax
of their sin; for, when they said that these were their gods which had brought
them up, their object was to advance a legitimate excuse, as if they were not
falling away from the worship of the true God, and their Deliverer, but that
rather it was an evidence of their more fervent zeal, that they should fall down
as worshippers before the calf in honor of Him. But God retorts this upon them,
and complains of the gross indignity which was put upon Him, when the dead image
of a calf was substituted in the place of His
glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have seen this people, and
behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This was, indeed, the sharpest and
sorest trial of the faith of Moses; when God seemed to contradict Himself and to
depart from His covenant. If ever, after having been long oppressed by excessive
calamities, we are not only wearied by the delay, but also agitated with various
doubts, which at length tempt us to despair, as if God had disappointed us by
deceptive promises, the contest is severe and terrible; but when God seems at
first sight to throw discredit upon His own words, we have need of unusual
fortitude and firmness to sustain this assault. For, since faith is founded on
the Word, when that Word appears to be at issue with itself, how in such
conflicting circumstances could pious minds be sustained unless they were
supported by the incomparable power of the Spirit? Still in the mind of Abraham
there was such strength of faith, that he came forth as a conqueror from this
kind of temptation. He had heard from God's own mouth, "In Isaac shall thy seed
be called;" he is afterwards commanded to slay him, and reduce his body to
ashes; yet, because he is persuaded that God was able to raise him up seed even
from the dead, he obeys the command.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:17-19.) The same thing is here recorded of Moses, before whom God sets a kind
of contradiction in His Word, when He declares that He has the intention of
destroying that people, to which He had promised the land of Canaan.
Nevertheless, we see how successfully he strove, since, trusting in the eternal
and inviolable covenant of God, he did not cease to cherish a good hope. If any
still should ask whether it was right for him to despise or count for nothing
what was said to him in the second place as to the utter destruction of the
people, I reply, that the victory of his faith did not consist in subtle
disquisitions, but that having embraced God's covenant with both arms, as they
say, he was so fortified by his confidence that he had room for no objections;
and, in point, of fact, pious minds which rest on firm assurance, although
unable to free themselves from every perplexity which occurs, still do not
waver, but keep a tight grasp on what the Spirit of God has once sealed to them;
and, if sometimes it happens that they begin to doubt or vacillate, nevertheless
they come back to their foundation and break through every obstacle, so as never
to desist from calling upon God. Meanwhile, it is certain that, whilst God is
trying the faith of Moses, He quickens his mind to be more earnest in prayer,
even as Moses himself was led in that direction by the secret influence of the
Spirit. Nor is there any reason why slanderous tongues should here impugn God,
as if He pretended before men what He had not decreed in Himself; for it is no
proof that He is variable or deceitful if, when speaking of men's sins, and
pointing out what they deserve, He does not lay open His incomprehensible
counsel. He here presents Himself in the character of Judge; He pronounces
sentence of condemnation against the criminals; he postpones their pardon to a
fitting season. Hence we gather that his secret judgments are a great deep;
whilst, at the same time, His will is declared to us in His word as far as
suffices for our edification in faith and piety. And this is more clearly
expressed by the context; for He asks of Moses to let Him alone. Now, what does
this mean? Is it not that, unless he should obtain a truce from a human being,
He will not be able freely to execute His vengeance? &#8212; adopting, that is
to say, by this mode of expression, the character of another, He declares his
high estimation of His servant, to whose prayers He pays such deference as to
say that they are a hinderance to him. Thus it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A623&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:23, that Moses "stood in the breach, to turn away the wrath" of God. Hence
do we plainly perceive the wonderful goodness of God, who not only hears the
prayers of His people when they humbly call upon Him, but suffers them to be in
a manner intercessors with Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He assigns as
the reason why He should be implacable, that He well knew the desperate and
incurable wickedness of the people; for by "stiff-necked," indomitable obstinacy
is metaphorically expressed; and the similitude is taken from stubborn oxen who
cannot be brought to submit to the yoke. Now, where such hardness and obstinacy
exists, there is no room for pardon. It is indeed an expression which must not
be taken literally, that God had learnt by experience that they were a
stiff-necked people; but we know that God often assumes human feelings; for
unless He should thus come down to us, our minds could never attain to His
loftiness. The sum is, that the character of the people was desperate, inasmuch
as they had already manifested their inflexible perverseness by many proofs.
Still, lest Moses should grieve at the loss of his noble chieftainship, a
compensation is promised him; by which trial it appeared that he did not regard
his own private interests or advantages.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses besought the Lord
his God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It is clear that this prayer
sprang from faith, though in it he seems to fight against the very word of God;
for God had said, Get thee down to thy people; but his answer is, Nay, it is
thine. But, as I have lately stated, inasmuch as he firmly grasped the
principle, that it was impossible for God's covenant to be made ineffective, he
breaks through or surmounts all obstacles with closed eyes as it were. He proves
them to be God's people by the benefit they had so recently received; yet he
mainly relies on the covenant; nay, he mentions their deliverance as a result of
it; for he proceeds afterwards to say, "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel." We
see, therefore, that the first ground of his confidence is the promise, although
Moses refers first of all to the fact that the people had been delivered by the
hand of God. He so expressly particularizes His "mighty hand," and "great
power," to signify that the more conspicuous God's miracles had been, the more
was His glory exposed to the calumnies of the ungodly; and this he immediately
afterwards explains, "Wherefore should the Egyptians speak,"
etc.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The particle,

<i>(ad</i> <i>malum,)</i> as denoting an unprosperous and unhappy issue. The
exposition which others give, "under an unlucky star," seems to me to be too
far-fetched.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f338</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have no doubt, therefore, but that
Moses signifies that this would be a consolation to the Egyptians in their
misfortunes if the people should be destroyed, as if God had thus avenged them
against their enemies; besides, by this misapprehension, the memory of God's
grace, as well as of His judgment, would have been destroyed; for the Egyptians
would have hardened themselves, and would have been untouched by any sense of
guilt, deeming that God would shew no mercy to His elect
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows, "repent of this evil," is
spoken in accordance with common parlance, for the saints often stammer in their
prayers, and, whilst unburdening their cares into the bosom of God, address him
in their infirmity as by no means befits His nature; as, for instance, when they
ask Him, How long wilt thou sleep? or be forgetful? or shut thine eyes? or hide
thy face? But with God repentance is nothing but a change of dealing, wherein He
seems to retrace His course, as if He had conceived some fresh design. When,
therefore, it is said a little further on that "the Lord repented of the evil,"
it is tantamount to saying, that He was appeased; not because He retracts in
Himself what He has once decreed, but because He does not execute the sentence
He had pronounced. If my
readers</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

oath, whereby He had more solemnly bound Himself, so that His promise might be
more sure and authoritative. The Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, 6:13,
tells us why God swears by Himself; viz., "because he could swear by no
greater;" though sometimes to the same effect He swears by His throne in heaven,
or His sanctuary.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In fine, it is uncertain
whether there is a </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[steron
pro&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino"> or not in this prayer, for we shall
see as we proceed that when Moses returned a second time, he prayed for the
preservation of the people, and was heard. Nor was this done in a moment; but he
again occupied forty days in reconciling the people with God. To myself it seems
probable that Moses, amazed at the horrible denunciation, immediately offered
his prwer; and without receiving a reply promising pardon, came down in suspense
to apply a remedy to the evil; for it was by no means likely that, after having
heard so severe and weighty a threat, he would have interposed no supplications,
when he was so deeply anxious for the safety of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses turned, and went
down, from the mount</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses comes down
by God's command to be a spectator of this wicked revolt, that the enormity of
the act might the more arouse him both to disgust and detestation of the crime,
and to the endeavor to find a remedy for it. Although, however, God had
pronounced sentence of rejection against the people, He still leaves the tables
that testified of the covenant untouched in the hands of Moses, not that He
wished them to remain whole, as we shall soon see, but that first the sight of
them, and then the breaking of them, might inspire the apostates with greater
horror, whose madness had otherwise stupified
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Why the Law was divided into two tables
has been elsewhere seen, viz., because it first sets forth piety and the worship
of God; and, secondly, prescribes the rule of righteous living between man and
man, and instructs us in the mutual offices of charity. It was doubtless in
testimony of the perfection of their doctrine that they were written on both
sides. A fuller revelation was indeed afterwards added; but God would have it
clearly understood that He had thus embraced all in ten commandments, so that it
was not lawful to add anything;
and,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f340</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> therefore, lest men should annex
anything of their own inventions, God filled both sides, so that nothing
remained unwritten upon. Moreover, the tables are called "the work of God,"
because he had prepared them for the purpose of being written on. Thus they are
distinguished from those that came afterwards, on which, although God inscribed
His Law, yet He willed that the stones should be chiselled and fashioned by the
hand and workmanship of men. The sum is, that not only were the ten commandments
written by God on the first tables, but there was nothing human in the
fashioning of the stones; and if it be inquired how the stones were engraved and
the letters formed upon them, Moses indeed replies by a similitude, that it was
done by the finger of God, meaning thereby His secret power; for He who created
the world out of nothing by his more volition <i>(nutu,)</i> can by the same
word convert all creatures to His own use in whatever way He
pleases.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.

to inform us how intemperately the people raged in their insane worship of the
calf, since their shouting was heard from afar. It is thus that the devil
bewitches poor miserable men, so that dissolute licentiousness with them is
pious ardor. So there is nothing too disgraceful or abominable to please the
Gentiles, in order that they may prove that they omit nothing which may appease
their false gods. Nor can it be doubted but that, under the pretense of holy
zeal, superstitious men give way to the indulgences of the flesh; and Satan
baits his fictitious modes of worship with such attractions, that they are
willingly and eagerly caught hold of and obstinately retained. It arises from
Joshua's solicitude for the people that he deems it to be the cry of battle;
whilst Moses,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f341</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> having been informed by God, conjectures
that it is not the voice of men fighting, since they utter no cry to correspond

had before humbly pleaded for the safety of the people, now, when he sees the
calf, bursts forth into rage, and the hideousness of the crime awakens him to
different feelings. Now, since anger is here mentioned with praise, the stoics
must abandon their paradox, that all the passions <i>(motus</i> <i>animi)</i>
are vicious. I allow, indeed, that whilst men are led by nature, they are never
angry without vice; because they always exceed due bounds, and often also do not
aim at a proper object. But it must be observed that this occurs from the
corruption of nature; and, consequently, anger is not in itself or absolutely to
be condemned. For the principle which the Stoics assume, that all the passions
are perturbations and like diseases, is false, and has its origin in ignorance;
for either to grieve, or to fear, or to rejoice, or to hope, is by no means
repugnant to reason, nor does it interfere with tranquillity and moderation of
mind; it is only excess or intemperance which corrupts what would else be pure.
And surely grief, anger, desire, hope, fear, are affections of our
unfallen</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f342</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>(integrce)</i> nature, implanted in
us by God, and such as we may not find fault with, without insulting God
Himself. Moreover, the anger which is here ascribed to Moses is, in Deuteronomy
9, attributed to the person of God Himself. Whence we infer, that, since it
emanated from the impulse of the Spirit, it was a virtue worthy of
praise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In breaking the tables, however, he
seems to have forgotten himself; for what sort of vengeance was this, to deface

Rabbins,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f343</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to excuse him, invent one of their
customary fables, that, when the tables were brought into the polluted place,
the writing became effaced. Others think that he was carried away by his wrath,
and did not sufficiently consider what he was about, as he would have done had
his mind been composed. I have no doubt, however, but that he broke the tables
in reference to his office, as if to annul the covenant of God for a time; for
we know that God commits both charges to the ministers of His word, to be the
proclaimers of His vengeance, as well as the witnesses of His grace. Thus,
whatever they bind on earth is bound also in heaven, and they retain sins unto
condemnation, and are armed with vengeance against the unbelieving and
rebellious.

the hand of Moses, renouncing the covenant which He had recently established in
a solemn ceremony; and this severity was more useful as an example than as if He
had sent Moses back empty-handed; for else it would never have suggested itself
to the Israelites of how incomparable a treasure they had been deprived. It was
then necessary that the tables should be produced, as if God so presented
Himself to their sight and shewed His paternal countenance; but when, on the
other hand, the monstrous abomination of the calf was encountered, it behoved
that these same tables should be broken, as if God turned His back upon them and
retired. Meanwhile, it must be borne in mind, that the covenant of God was not
altogether annulled, but only as it were interrupted, until the people had
heartily repented. Still this temporary rupture, if I may so call it, did not
prevent the covenant itself from remaining inviolable. In the same manner also
afterwards God put away His people, as if He had utterly renounced. them, yet
His grace and truth never failed; so that He at least had some hidden roots from
whence the Church sprang up anew; as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he took the calf which
they had made</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It might seem to be a
cruel and inhuman punishment that Moses should in a manner infect the bowels of
the people with the corruption of the crime. They had already polluted both
their bodies and souls more than enough, without the contagion entering any
deeper. Besides, he was thus likely to drive them to despair, when they bore
within them the ground of their condemnation, as a woman nourishes her offspring
in the womb. Nevertheless, such was the remedy to be applied to their
senselessness; for, however they might have been terrified for a moment, the
recollection of their crime and their fear of punishment would have immediately
vanished had not this brand of their defilement been thoroughly impressed upon
them. This, then, was a kind of tautcry, whereby they might feel that the
disgrace of such foul idolatry not only cleaved to their skin, but was fixed
deep in their very bowels. For thus also was their shame enforced upon them when
they admitted the substance of their god into their belly, to be soon afterwards
ejected with their excrements. Therefore were they compelled to drink and to
void a part of their god, in order that their superstition might be the more
offensive to them. Besides, if the ashes had been scattered on the ground, there
was danger lest some of the more obstinate might collect the relics; and this
evil was prevented when the gold, of which the false god was molten, was mixed
with ordure. Finally, Moses is said to have made them drink of the accursed
water, not because he himself held out the cup to each of them, but because the
dust was cast into the stream of which they all drank; as is stated in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050921&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
9:21.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What did this people unto
thee? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He casts the blame on Aaron, inasmuch as
he, who is possessed of power, seems to permit the evil which he does not
prevent. We have previously seen that when Moses went up into the mount he
resigned his charge to Aaron; it was therefore his duty so to preside over them
as, in right of his power, to restrain the people, however perverse they might
be. Consequently he is deservedly reproved with this severity, as if he had been
the author of the sin which he had suffered to be committed. Hence we gather how
weighty a burden is borne by
all</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f345</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who are appointed to be governors; for
if any sin is committed through their negligence, or timidity, or indolence,
they must themselves give account for it, as if they had given the signal for
licentiousness. The reproof here is very emphatic, viz., that he was as bitter
an enemy to the public welfare as if he had desired to avenge himself on his
mortal enemies. Not that vengeance would be lawful, although he might have had
any colorable ground for it, but Moses means that if Aaron had desired to ruin
any persons, and had therefore purposely endeavored to do the worst thing he
could against them, he could not have injured them more. Hence He deserves the
greater reprehension for having taken such bad care of this poor people, the
charge of whom he had undertaken; nay, for having, as far as in him lay, brought
final destruction upon them. This, too, is worthy of observation, that when
God's service is in question, Moses no more spares his own and his only brother
than he would an utter stranger. If he had consulted flesh and blood, it would
have been easy to invent some pretext for being more lenient towards his
brother, since he had been compelled by necessity and violence to make the calf;
but, inasmuch as he knew how strenuously we should contend for God's glory, he
assails his brother as if he were entirely unconnected with him. This is a rare
virtue; but, unless we strive to attain it, we shall often betray God's cause by
our treacherous indulgence towards our
relatives.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Aaron said, Let not the
anger of my Lord wax hot</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Aaron
extenuates his crime as much as He can. The sum, however is, that the people,
whom Moses himself knew to be depraved and perverse, had tumultuously assailed
him, and compelled him against his will. Now, although the commencement of his
address has an appearance of modesty, still the excuse is frivolous. Rightly,
indeed, does Aaron, though the elder, submit himself with reverence to his
brother; since he acknowledges him as God's minister, and trembles at his
reproof; but it would have been better ingenuously to confess his guilt, than to
escape the ignominy of condemnation by subterfuge; for it was the business of
the chief to guide the whole body, and to quiet the tumult by authority and
firmness; and, if their extravagance had even advanced to madness, rather to die
ten times over than to yield such base and servile compliance. But from the
close it appears that, whilst in our anxiety for our reputation, we take pains
to conceal or excuse our faults, our hypocrisy will at length appear ridiculous.
It is obvious that when Aaron says he cast the gold into the fire, and the calf
came out, he endeavors, at any rate, to cover the fault, which he cannot
altogether efface, by this poor and flimsy tale; but by this childish trifling
he only betrays his impudence, so that such stupid confidence does but complete
his condemnation. This is the just reward of our ambition, when we take refuge
in disguises, and set our hypocrisy against God's
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Moses saw that the
people were naked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The vengeance is here
recorded which Moses employed to expiate the sin; not that this punishment was
satisfactory, as they call it, before God; but because it was useful to efface
the memory of their guilt; or at any rate was profitable, as an example. For by
the slaughter of three thousand of them, they were reminded that they all had
deserved the same. Nor can it be doubted but that he cleansed the camp of the
chief authors of the evil, in order that God might be more inclined to pardon.
First, therefore, the cause is set forth, whereby he was inflamed to such
severity, viz., because he saw the people in such a state of nakedness, as to be
even exposed as a laughing-stock to their enemies. The
exposition</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f346</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which some give of their nakedness,
<i>i.e.,</i> that they were stripped of their ornaments, is by no means
consistent; for it is immediately added, that it was "to their shame among their
enemies;" and it will be seen in the next chapter that they were still
splendidly ornamented; nay, that they wore the outward tokens of profane
rejoicing. There is no doubt, then, but that he signifies that they were
rejected of God, who was to them, as it were, their sole ornamental garment, and
under whose protection they were secure. The enormity of the evil is, therefore,
set forth in these words, because they were not only deprived of God's
assistance, who is culled "the dwelling-place" of his people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:1,) but also abandoned to ignominy, whilst they were surrounded on all sides
by enemies. Hence the holy indignation of Moses, in inflicting punishment on the
leaders of the rebellion. And again, it is to be noted, that Aaron is charged
with the chief part of the crime, because he had not resisted the people's folly
with sufficient firmness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Herein the astonishing
power of God was manifested, that when Moses had summoned the Levites, and had
commanded them openly in the gate to gird themselves with their swords, the
other tribes did not all of them mutiny; for it was probable that they were thus
to be armed, in order to execute punishment on the criminals. How, then, came it
to pass that those, who were conscious of guilt, were quiet, except because the
power of God's Spirit restrained their courage and fury?
</font><br><font face="Palatino">The form of the command is also worthy of
observation, "Whoso is the Lord's, let him betake himself to me:" from whence we
learn, that if we love religion as it deserves, we must not halt between two
sides; but that an ingenuous confession is required of us, so as to range
ourselves every one under the banner of God; for, by calling all God's servants
to him, he condemns the cowardice, nay, the treachery, of all who shall stand in
indecision.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question, however, arises,
whether the Levites were not implicated in the crime, since they step forward at
once to execute his command, like sincere upholders of God's glory. I answer,
that though they were not free from guilt, yet, inasmuch as they yielded to the
people under the influence of fear, their sin was lighter than as if they had
approved by their consent of the detestable idolatry. But here we perceive the
wonderful indulgence of God, who not only pardoned them, but deigned to assert
His glory by their instrumentality, and appointed them his ministers for the
punishment of a crime, in the toleration of which they had been guilty of base
effeminacy and cowardice. Again, it may be asked, how it occurred that of the
rest of the multitude not one stirred a foot at the command of Moses? My opinion
is, that they were kept back not by contempt or obstinacy, but only by shame;
and that they were all inspired with so much alarm, that they waited in
astonishment to see what Moseswas about, and how far he would proceed. It is,
however, probable that the Levites were called out by name, and this we gather
from the result; because they all immediately came forwards, and not one of any
other tribe.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith the Lord God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He commands the Levites to gird
themselves with their swords, to commit slaughter throughout the whole camp; and
this may at first sight seem to be cruel and inhuman, when they are forbidden to
spare their brothers, their friends, and neighbors; but it was by no means
excessive, if we reflect how much more grievous it is to profane the sacred
worship of God, than to inflict injury on man. Nor does he desire that all
should be slain promiscuously; but only bids the Levites proceed courageously;
so that, if they should chance to meet with any one worthy of death, neither
relationship, nor friendship, nor familiarity, should hinder or delay the just
course of severity. Nay, since it soon after follows that the Levites did as
they were commanded, we gather that he was content with a moderation more akin
to leniency than to rigor. If any sedition has arisen in an army, which has
proceeded to violence and slaughter, the general is wont, as an ordinary rule,
to decimate the offenders; how much milder here is the rate of punishment, when
only three thousand perish out of six hundred millions! Although he may have,
therefore, dealt harshly with a few, yet the chastisement must appear lenient
which permits so many to escape, though guilty of the same crime. It is,
however, asked, whether they made any, and what distinction? for it would have
been an act of blind and headlong impetuosity to kill every one they might
happen to meet. In order to evade this absurdity, some of the
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f347
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jews take refuge, as usual, in a silly fable,
that the bellies of those who were polluted by the sin, swelled after drinking
the water. If this is accepted, the swelling must have affected them all. But,
rejecting all such inventions, it is probable that the Levites were by no means
ignorant who were the chief leaders of the evil counsel, by whose instigation
the rest were drawn into
rebellion.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f348</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Judicially, therefore, and
discriminately they executed vengeance on three thousand; and hence it came to
pass that the severity was endurable, and that the whole people quietly
submitted, when they saw that their own welfare was consulted by the removal
from amongst them of these pestilent persons. But, although Mosesrestrains
himself, it must be remarked that he requires of the Levites inflexible
firmness, lest any regard to intimacy should soften their hearts, because there
is nothing more opposed to a sound judgment than
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proswpolhyi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(respect of persons.) Now, it is not without reason that the Levites are praised
for obeying his command; for it demanded no common magnanimity to attack the
whole twelve tribes, to whom they were not equal even by a twelfth part. We
gellerally see that when many persons are concerned in a crime, the judges are
alarmed by a fear of sedition, and in the end have not the courage to perform
their duty.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f349</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was, then, all extraordinary instance
of zeal in the Levites, that setting aside all consideration of danger, they
dared intrepidly to provoke so great a multitude against them. And this holy
indignation was the fruit of their repentance, since they did not hesitate to
attack with drawn swords those whose threatening countenances they had
previously quailed at. Surely it would have been a lighter cause of offense to
have prevented the idolatry of the people by bold rebuke, than to execute
capital punishment on the transgressors. Their piety and fear of God, therefore,
aroused their hearts to new vigor when they dreaded no peril of
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Moses had said,
consecrate yourselves today</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It is
obvious that this verse was added exegetically, to give the reason why this
unintimidated ardor impelled the Levites manfully to fulfill their charge, viz.,
because the exhortation of Moses carried them over every obstacle. The verb,
"had said," must be therefore construed in the pluperfect tense. The translation
of some,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f350</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "ye have consecrated your hands," in the
perfect tense, is very unsuitable, since the promise is immediately added as a
means of stimulating them to greater alacrity; whence it appears that the
command of Moses, which has been mentioned, is now repeated in different words.
They are, however, increased in forcibleness, since he declares that it will be
a sacrifice sweet and acceptable to God, if, in forgetfulness of flesh and
blood, they avenge the polluted worship of God. The causal
particle,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f351</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>ci,</i> is introduced, which I have
rendered <i>nempe,</i> (namely,) as being here an intensitive, as if he had
said, such submission to God must here be shewn, that they should not even
restrain their hand if necessary from their very sons and brothers. What,
therefore, was lately spoken as to their relatives generally, and here of their
sons, must be taken as if in the potential mood; for, if all the Levites had
joined themselves with Moses, what need was there of bidding them execute
punishment on their brothers or sons? So that Moses only wished to condemn that
absurd regard to humanity whereby judges are often blinded, and, to the
detriment of religion, are cruelly merciful in tolerating and encouraging
impiety. First, therefore, let us learn from this passage, that when judges
overlook crimes, their hands are defiled by their very remissness, because
impunity increases licentiousness in sin. Thus Solomon teaches
that,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He that justifieth the

this judgment of God was terrible, lest the Israelites should altogether fall
into despair, Moses addresses a consolation to them to calm their sorrow,
promising that he will make entreaty to God in their behalf. Meanwhile, in order
that they might betake themselves as humble suppliants to God's mercy, he
reminds them of the enormity of their sin. The Hebrew words literally mean,

however, no ambiguity in the sense; for he would humble them by setting the

other places, only denotes difficulty; lest, as is frequently the case, they
should think of asking pardon unconcernedly and carelessly, and not with anxious
earnestness. Thus, when Peter addresses Simon Magus, he bids him pray, "if
perhaps" his iniquity may be forgiven him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

anxiously seek after the remedy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.

the people back into favor, which was not the case until he was commanded to hew
out or polish the new tables. And we know that it was a figure of speech in

"if thou wilt forgive their sin." I have no objection to make if any should

seems to burst forth into an exclamation, "Oh, if thou wilt forgive;" though it
may be but a modest petition, "Wilt thou forgive?" for, though the prayers of
the saints flow from their confidence, still they have to struggle with doubts
and questionings within themselves, whether God is willing to listen to them.
Hence it arises that their prayers begin hesitatingly, until faith
prevails.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows may in many respects
appear to be absurd; for Moses both imperiously lays down the law to God, and in
his eager impetuosity seeks to overthrow, as far as he can, His eternal counsel,
and inconsiderately robs him of His justice. Surely all must condemn the pride
of this address, Unless thou sparest the offenders, count me not as one of thy
servants; nor can there seem to be less of folly in his attempt to bring to
nought God's eternal predestination. Besides, when he desires that he himself
should be involved in the same punishment, what is this but to destroy all
distinction, that God should rashly condemn the innocent with the transgressors?
Nor would I indeed deny that Moses was carried away by such vehemence, that he
speaks like one possessed. Still it must be observed, that when believers
unburden their cares into God's bosom, they do not always deal discreetly, nor
with well-ordered language, but sometimes stammer, sometimes pour forth "groans
which cannot be uttered," sometimes pass by everything else, and lay hold of and
press some particular petition. Assuredly there was nothing less present to the
mind of Moses than to dictate to God; nor, if he had been asked, would he have
said that what God had decreed respecting His elect before the creation of the
world could be overthrown. Again, he knew that nothing was more foreign to the
Judge of all the world than to destroy the innocent together with the reprobate.
But since his care for the people, whose welfare he knew to be consigned to him
by God, had absorbed, as it were, all his senses, nothing else occupies his mind
but that they may be saved, whilst he does not entertain a single thought which
interferes with this his great solicitude. Hence it is, that arrogating far too
much to himself, he throws himself forward as the people's surety, and forgets
that he is predestined to salvation by God's immutable counsel; and, finally,
does not sufficiently consider what would be becoming in God. Nor is Moses the
only one who has been thus carried away; but Paul has gone even further,
expressing himself thus in writing after full premeditation, "I could wish that
myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:3.) The fact is, that intent on the welfare of the elect people, they neither
of them examine critically into particulars, and therefore devote themselves in
behalf of the whole Church; inasmuch as this general principle was deeply rooted
in their minds, that if the welfare of the whole body were secured, it would be
well with the individual members.
Hence</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f358</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the question arises whether it is a
pious feeling to prefer the salvation of others to our own? Some being afraid
lest the example of Moses and Paul should be prejudicial, have said that they
were only influenced by their zeal for God's glory, when they devoted themselves
to eternal destruction; and that they did not prefer the people's salvation to
their own. Even, however, though this should be accepted, still their words
would have been hyperbolical; for, although God's glory may well be preferred to
a hundred worlds, yet He so far accommodates Himself to our ignorance, that He
will not have the eternal salvation of believers brought into opposition with
His glory; but has rather bound them inseparably together, as cause and effect.
Moreover, it is abundantly clear that Moses and Paul did devote themselves to
destruction out of regard to the general salvation. Let, therefore, that
solution which I have advanced hold good, that their petition was so confused,
that in the vehemence of their ardor they did not see the contradiction, like
men beside themselves. Nor is it matter of surprise that they should have been
in such perplexity, since they supposed that by the destruction of the elect
people God's faithfulness was abandoned, and He Himself in a manner brought to
nought, if the eternal adoption wherewith He had honored the children of Abraham
should fail.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By "the book," in which God is said
to have written His elect, must be understood, metaphorically, His decree. But
the expression which Moses uses, asking to be blotted out of the number of the
pious, is an incorrect one, since it cannot be that one who has been once
elected should be ever reprobated; and those lunatics who, on this ground,
overturn, as far as they can, that prime article of our faiith concerning God's
eternal predestination, thereby demonstrate their malice no less than their
ignorance. David uses two expressions in the same sense, "blotted out," and "not
written:"</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We cannot hence infer any change in the counsel of
God; but this phrase is merely equivalent to saying, that God will at length
make it manifest that the reprobate, who for a season are counted amongst the
number of the elect, in no respect belong to the body of the Church. Thus the
secret catalogue, in which the elect are written, is contrasted by

God adapts Himself to the comprehension of the human mind, when He says, "him
will I blot out;" for hypocrites make such false profession of His name, that
they are not accounted aliens, until God openly renounces them: and hence their
manifest rejection is called erasure. Moreover, God reproves the preposterous
request of Moses, inasmuch as it does not consist with His justice to reject the
innocent; whence it follows, that Moses had prayed inconsiderately. The sum is,
that God, whenever He punishes the ungodly and iniquitous, pays them the wages
which they have earned; whereas He never punishes the just. Yet it is to be
observed, that when God declares that he will be the avenger of sins, His mercy
is not excluded, whereby He buries the transgressions of His people, so that
they come not into mind. Thus, when Paul says, "Neither fornicators, nor
adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor murderers, nor revilers, shall
possess the kingdom of
God,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

Corinthians 6:9, 10;) it would be incorrect to conclude that they were all shut
out from the hope of salvation; since he only speaks of the reprobate, who never
repent, so that being converted they may obtain
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore now go, lead the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In these words God shews that He
is appeased, for it was a sure sign of His reconciliation that His angel is
appointed to guide them during the rest of their way. The exposition which some
give, that an angel is now promised to take care of them, such as Daniel
testifies to have been sometimes assigned even to heathen nations, and an
instance of which we shall see in the next chapter, is but a poor conjecture;
besides, God declares that though the people have departed from the faith, still
He stood firm to His agreement as to their enjoyment of the promised
inheritance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">His postponement of their
punishment is an indirect reproof of the people's wickedness, as though He had
said that they were of so perverse a nature that they would hereafter give many
fresh occasions for it. If any object that, whenever God afterwards punished
other sins, He did not then take into account this act of idolatry, I reply that
it is no new thing with God, when men contract again fresh guilt, to accumulate
their punishments, and also to call to judgment many sins together under one
general punishment. Besides, we know that God casts the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children to the third and fourth generation. Lastly, there is nothing
to prevent Him from visiting at another time with temporal punishments the
iniquity which He has once pardoned; for wherefore did He then forgive them? Was
it not lest the truth of His covenant, should perish? Those, then, whom He thus
was unwilling to destroy, He might at His own time call up again for punishment,
provided the chastisement were but moderate. Hence let us learn not to flatter
ourselves, if ever God suspends His
judgment,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

we had escaped with impunity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.

God what he had before related as to the slaughter of the three thousand, lest
any should think that he had smitten them with immoderate severity<i>.</i>
Therefore Paul bids us consider in this history, as in a mirror, how greatly
displeasing to God idolatry is; lest we should imitate those who were smitten by
His hand.

Corinthians 10:7.) The indignation of Moses is consequently connected with the
command of God. Meanwhile he commends the mercy of God in having spared Aaron,
whilst he speaks of the calf as his work, as well as of the whole of the people;
in a different way indeed, for Aaron formed the calf at their request; still the

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart, and go up hence, thou

pluperfect tense;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f361</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the reason is here given, whereby
Moses was stirred up to such vehemence in prayer, viz., because, although God
had not altogether abandoned the care of the people, still He had renounced His
covenant, and had proclaimed to them that, after He had once performed His
engagement of giving them possession of the land, He would have no more to do
with them. Wherefore, what is here related, preceded, in order of time, the
prayer of Moses; for, being astonished at the sad and almost fatal message, he
burst forth into that confused and wild request, that he might be blotted out of
the book of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us now endeavor to elicit
the true meaning of the passage. It is plain, that when God bids Moses depart
with the people, He utterly renounces the charge which He Himself had hitherto
sustained. He only promises that He will cause them to attain the promised
inheritance, and not that He will preside over them, will there preserve them in
safety, and even cherish them, as a father does his children; in fact, that he
will merely fulfill the promise He had made to their fathers. And thus He
anticipates their complaints; for they might reply, that consequently His
promise would be rendered vain and ineffectual; but by way of anticipation, He
says, that although He should renounce them, still He should maintain this
truth, because He will cast out the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, so that
their abode would be vacant for them. In sum, He repudiates them, that they may
no longer count themselves to be His peculiar people, or expect more from Him,
than as if they were strangers, He mentions His oath, lest they should accuse
Him of faithlessness; as if He had said that He should be discharged from His
engagement when they had obtained the land. And thus, whilst depriving them of
the hope of salvation, and the grace of adoption, He still asserts the stability
and stedfastness of His covenant. I, therefore, understand the word <i>angel</i>
in a different sense from that which it has just before, and in many other
passages of this book; for, when mention was before made of the angel, the
familiar presence of God was denoted by it, nay, it was used interchangeably
with the name of God itself. But here God is said to be so about to send the
angel, as to separate Himself from the people. "I will not go up (He says) in
the midst of thee;" and the reason is subjoined, viz., because it could not be
that He could endure any longer their perverse spirits. Again He uses a
similitude taken from refractory oxen, which cannot be broken to bear the yoke.
The sum is, that because they are so intractable, God cannot perform the office
of their guide without straightway destroying
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when the people heard
these evil tidings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Hence it more
clearly appears that, as I have said, it was like a thunderbolt to them when God
withdrew Himself from the people; for this divorce is more fatal than
innumerable deaths. It might indeed at first sight seem delightful to be the
masters of a rich and fertile land; but dull as the people generally were, God
smote them suddenly, so that all its delights became insipid, and its
fruitfulness like famine itself, when they perceived that they would be but
fatted unto the day of slaughter. A useful piece of instruction is to be gained
from hence, viz., that if we neglect God's favor and are captivated by the
sweetness of His blessings, we are ensnared like fishes on a hook. God promised
the Israelites what might attract them for a little season: He denied them what
they should have alone desired, that He would be their God. The evil tidings
affected them with sorrow, for they felt that men cannot be happy unless God be
propitious; nay, that nothing can be more wretched than to be alienated from
Him. "It is good for me to draw near to God,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
73:28,) says David; and elsewhere, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the
Lord,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
33:12, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
144:15;) again, "the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, my lot is fallen
in pleasant places."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:5, 6.) This, therefore, is the climax of all miseries to have God against us,
whilst we are fed by His bounty; and consequently the Israelites began to shew
some wisdom, when, awaking from their lethargy, they counted all other things as
naught, unless God should pursue them with His paternal favor. We infer from the
grossness of their stupidity, that it was brought to pass by a special gift of
God, that they were affected with such sorrow as to conduct them to a solemn
mourning. First, Moses says that they did not put on their ornaments, and then
that they were commanded by God to put them off; but this will be perfectly
consistent if we take the latter as explanatory, as if he had said that they did
not wear their ornaments because God had forbidden it, by enjoining them to
mourn.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God here assumes the character of an
angry judge, preparing to inflict vengeance in His wrath, in the words, "I will
come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee;" in order that
their alarm may humble them the more, and stir them up to earnest prayer. It was
avisible sign of mourning to He in squalidhess and uncleanness, that thus their
penitence might be openly testified; for there was no efficacy in the rite and
ceremony to propitiate God, except in so far as the inward affection of the mind
manifested itself by a true and genuine confession. For we must bear in mind
what God requires by Joel, (2:13,) that we should "rend our heart, and not our
garments;" nevertheless, whilst He cares not for the outward appearance, nay,
whilst He abominates hypocrisy, still, if the sinner has truly repented, it
cannot be but that, humbly acknowledging his guilt, he will add the outward
profession of it. For if Paul, who was guiltless of any offense, deemed that the
Corinthians were to be mourned for by him when they had not "repented of their
uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness," because God humbled him in
their sin,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:21;) how should not those mourn publicly who are conscious of
their own guilt, especially when, being convicted by the judgment of men, they
are summoned to the tribunal of God? And therefore it is not without reason that
he elsewhere teaches, that the sorrow which worketh repentance should also bring
forth these other fruits, viz., carefulness, clearing of themselves,
indignation, fear, vehement desire, zeal, revenge.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10, 11.) For the sake of example also, sinners should not only
grieve in silence before God, but willingly undergo the penalty of ignominy
before men, so as by self-condenmation to confess that God is a just Judge, to
provoke others to imitate them, and, by this warning of human frailty to prevent
them from a similar fall.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After, however, God
has inspired them with fear, He allays His anger as it were, and declares that
He will consider what He will do with them, in order that they may gather
courage to ask for pardon; for, although he does not actually pardon them, He
sufficiently arouses them to hope, by giving them some taste of His mercy; for,
by seeming to leave them in suspense, it is not with the intention that they
should approach Him hesitatingly to ask forgiveness, but that their anxiety may
urge them more and more to earnest prayer, and keep them in a state of
humility.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses took the
tabernacle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This was a sign of the
divorce between God and the Israelites, that the tabernacle should be removed
from the camp and pitched at a distance, as if God were tired of His connection
with them. He had promised as a special blessing that He would dwell in the
midst of the people; and now, by departing elsewhere, He declares them to be
polluted. In a word, the removal of the tabernacle was like the breaking of the
tables; for, just as by the breaking of the tables Moses dissolved the covenant
of God, so he thus deprived the Israelites for a time of His company and
presence. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f362
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The explanation which some give that it was
Moses' own tabernacle, is refuted by many sound arguments. First, it is not said
that he took away his own tabernacle, but the word tabernacle is used simply and
without any affix, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino"> Secondly, he did not change his own
place of habitation, but only went out thither from time to time for the purpose
of worshipping, or, at any rate, of consulting God. Thirdly, it would have been
by no means lawful to assign the sacred name which God had bestowed on His
Sanctuary to a private tabernacle. Fourthly, God, by manifesting His glory
there, testified that it was His own dwelling-place. Fifthly, it would have been
absurd that the people should have sought God in that direction, unless the
place had been sacred. Sixthly, the object (of its removal,) which I have above
adverted to, must be taken into consideration, for Moses did not withdraw
himself from the people, but rather continued, as was his custom, in the midst
of the camp, and merely wished to shew that God withdrew Himself from that
profane place lest He should be infected by the contagion; so that it was a kind
of excommunication. It is said, indeed, that he pitched it for himself, yet not
for his private use, as is plain from the context, but in accordance with the
common form of
expression,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f363</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in which
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lo,</i> is often redundant; still properly speaking, he did pitch it for
himself, for he alone, had access to it, apart from others. Those who understand
it to have been his private tabernacle, suppose that their opinion is supported
by what follows, viz., that he called it, the tabernacle,
<i>Moed;</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f364</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for they thence infer that it had not
before been distinguished by that honorable title. But this objection is easily
got over, since it is more probable that this was inserted parenthetically in
the text, and therefore may be properly rendered in the pluperfect tense. For by
this clause the reason is alleged why God had betaken Himself elsewhere, viz.,
that the place which He had appointed for covenanting with the people should
remain deserted. Nevertheless, if we should refer it to this actual time, it
will not be unsuitable that the people, at the present moment, should be
reminded of their sad separation, and that Moses, in order to inflict more
ignominy and shame upon them, should have called it the tabernacle of
convention, though it was now far distant from the camp. As to the word
<i>Moed,</i> I will not repeat what I have elsewhere said. Let my readers,
therefore, refer to it at the end of chapter
29.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f365</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i> </b><i>.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and it came to pass that every
one which sought the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some
translate it, "asked counsel;" but, in my opinion, the ordinary signification is
preferable. Whether, therefore, they desired to testify their piety by public
worship, or to pray, or to seek counsel in doubtful matters, they went out
towards that sanctuary in order that their eyes might rest upon it. Moses does
not mean that they actually came to the place, from access to which they knew
themselves to be prohibited on account of their pollution. But their thus going
out was in token of repentance; as though they acknowledged that they were
unworthy to receive an answer from God, unless they departed from that place
which they had defiled by their atrocious crime. Now, it was useful for them to
be thus humbled, in order that idolatry might be held in greater detestation.
Nor is there any contradiction in what follows, viz., that they "stood, every
man at his tent-door," whenever Moses went out; for the glory of God, which at
that time was more manifest, was such as then to inspire them with greater
reverence and terror. Whensoever, therefore, the mediator presented himself
before God, they were permitted to do no more than behold from afar the pillar
of cloud which then enveloped Moses, so as to separate him from them. Meanwhile,
it must be observed, that though God at this time departed from them, it was
only so far as to reject them from close access to Him, and not that they were
altogether alienated. For their worship was a sign of faith; they were allowed
to pray to God and implore His favor; and they knew that they were heard in the
person of Moses. Their separation, therefore, was not such as totally to cut off
the hope of pardon, but such as to quicken their anxiety, and to exercise them
to repentance. Thus God often designedly hides His face from sinners in order to
invite them to Him in true humiliation. And this we nmst carefully attend to,
lest, when He chastises us either by word or deed, terror, or a sense of our
criminality, should hinder our prayers; but rather let us seek Him from however
great a distance. The object of excommunication is nearly similar; for those
whom the Church rejects from the company of the faithful,are delivered to Satan,
but only "for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the

counted as enemies, but admonished as brethren.

Thessalonians 3:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">When it is said that "the
people rose up, and stood every man at his tent-door," some improperly, as I
conceive, refer it to mere respect to him as a civil magistrate, as if honor was
thus paid to their leader; but I rather suppose that:, when at stated hours
Moses presented himself before God in the name of all, they partook in his
service and worship. Wherefore also they followed him with their eyes, until the
cloud covered him. To the same effect this rising up is repeated immediately
afterwards, where reference is made to the cloudy pillar. Wherefore I have no
question but that both verses must be expounded as relating to spiritual
worship. But we have elsewhere shewn how they testified their piety before the
visible sign, without worshipping God therein in any gross
imagination.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto Moses

dignified by this distinction, where God would declare the difference between
him and other Prophets.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
12:8.) Familiar intercourse is therefore described in this phrase, as if it were
said that God appeared to Moses by an extraordinary mode of revelation. If any
object that there is a contradiction between this statement and what we shall
presently see, "Thou canst not see my face," the solution is easy, viz., that
although God revealed Himself to Moses in a peculiar manner, still He never
appeared in the fullness of His glory, but only so far as man's infirmity could
endure. For this expression contains an implied comparison, <i>i.e.,</i> that no
man was ever equal to Moses, or arrived at such a pitch of dignity. And this
tends to magnify the Law, that Moses its minister reported what he had
familiafly learnt, so that no ambiguity might be suspected. When it is said that
Joshua departed not from the tabernacle, we gather that the dwelling-place of
Moses was in the camp; and perhaps the fact of his being a young man is
mentioned,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f366</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in order more highly to illustrate God's
grace, in choosing that he should have the charge of the sanctuary. It is true
that Joshua at this time was of mature age; but God's special blessing was
manifested in him, in that God passed over many old men, and set him who was
younger to be the keeper of His
tabernacle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, thou, sayest unto me,
Bring up this people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses is still
diligently engaged in endeavoring to reconcile the people, for the fuller
promise was inserted by way of anticipation. Since the revolt, however, God had
promised no more than that He would give the land to the people; but although
wishing only to assure them that they should possess the land, He had added that
His angel should lead them, still this was but a temporary blessing, and one
which He is wont to confer promiscuously on other nations also. Thus Moses saw
that he and the people were deprived of a special privilege which they had
previously enjoyed; for that same angel who had gone before them was frequently
called the God of hosts, in order that they might perceive that God was present
with them in a peculiar manner. Hence Moses complains not without cause that God
had not signified whom He would send, inasmuch as, when He spoke generally of an
ordinary angel, He had withdrawn that special Deliverer, the guardian of the
people, and the perpetual maintainer of their safety. He does not, therefore,
request that Aaron should be restored to him, or that any companion should be
associated with him in his difficult and arduous task; but he desires to be
assured of the continuance of God's previous favor. As the ground of his
confidence in asking, he adduces nothing but the promises of God. He rests,
then, on no dignity of his own, nor alleges any duties performed, whereby he had
merited so great favor; but contents himself with this brief statement, Lord,
cause the event to correspond with Thy words. We have already
shewn</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f367</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> what it is to "know by name," viz., to
choose from amongst others, or to hold in peculiar honor. After, however, Moses
had made mention of what had been promised by God, he implores him by this
grace, "if (says he) I have found grace in thy sight," confirm or ratify it by
this proof, <i>i.e.,</i> by again undertaking the care of us; for by the
<i>way</i> of God he means that guidance in which He had declared that He would
go before them to shew them the way. In a word, he requests that this token of
favor should be given them, that God should continually guide His people.
Therefore, He says, thus shall I know thee, and it will appear that I am
acceptable to thee. Finally, he refers to the Covenant of God with the whole
people; as much as to say, that although God should be unwilling to grant this
to him alone individually, still there was a weightier reason, viz., because God
had adopted that people; and, consequently, it was just that he should
distinguish it from other nations by peculiar
marks.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, My presence
shall go with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We gather from this
answer what the desire of Moses was, for God, in accepting his prayer, affirms
in one word that He will go before them as He was wont, and this was a sure
pledge of His presence in no ordinary manner. For although the whole world is
governed by His providence, still His face does not therein appear so
conspicuously as in His protection of the Church's welfare. And, in fact, since
the same Angel, who had before presided over the camp, now undertakes the charge
of guiding the people, the eternal divinity of Christ is clearly proved from
hence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This clause, "My
face</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f368</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> shall go before," is equivalent to his
saying, I will so go before thee, that thou shalt truly perceive that I am with
thee, as if thou shouldst see my face set before thine eyes in a mirror. Now,
since this was fulfilled in Christ, it follows that He is the eternal God, whose
glory, power, and majesty is far above all creatures. The <i>rest</i> which He
promises has reference to the perseverance of His grace, and its final
accomplishment,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f369</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if it were said, when the people
shall have entered the land, they shall be under God's protection and
guardianship; for what was common to the whole people is ascribed to the person
of Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said unto him, If thy
presence go not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses accepts what is
accorded to him, whilst at the same time he signifies that it would be better
and more desirable for him to perish in the desert than to go any further
without the manifest token of God's presence; and this he confirms in the
following verse, and therefore I have inserted the expletive particle
<i>certe</i> (indeed,) although the copula might also be resolved into the
causal particle <i>nam</i> (for.) For he declares that the paternal favor
wherewith God had embraced the people could not be known unless He should remain
with them. They are mistaken who suppose that something different is here
indicated from what was said just before, for exactly in the same sense God is
said to go before, and to dwell in the midst of His people; but Moses refers to
the promise already given, the symbol of which was the Tabernacle of the
Covenant, which just before had been removed from its proper place to punish the
people's sin. What he adds at the end of the
verse,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f370</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "and we shall be separated," may also be
resolved, "that thus we may be separated," or, "because in this way we shall be
separated." Whence it is abundantly clear that the favor which is mentioned
refers to their election or gratuitous adoption, and is its fruit or effect. For
it was the intention of Moses to restore the Covenant which had been violated by
the people to its original force, as if the people were reinstated in that
honorable condition from whence they had fallen. And surely this is our real
happiness after all, to be separated from heathen nations as God's own property;
as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:4, "Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people: O
visit me with thy salvation."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto Moses,
I will do this thing also</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He adds
nothing new, but confirms by repetition what He had just said, in order to
remove all doubt. Still He declares that He is induced by no other reason than
by the gratuitous favor wherewith He had embraced Moses. This, therefore, is a
kind of renewal of the Covenant, when the people is consecrated to God, so as to
recover again the sacerdotal kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, I beseech thee,
shew me thy glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Thus far the desires
of Moses had been confined within the limits of moderation and sobriety, but now
he is carried beyond due bounds, and longs for more than is lawful or expedient;
for it is plain from his repulse that he had inconsiderately proceeded further
than He should. He desires that God should be revealed to him more closely, and
in a more manifest form than before. Still it is not foolish curiosity that
impels him to this, which so often tickles men's minds, so that they daringly
attempt to penetrate into the deepest secrets of heaven; for he had no other
design than to be animated to confidence, whereby he might more cheerfully go on
with his charge. But that the desire itself was improper though its object was
correct, we learn from the reply of God, wherein He shows that it would be
injurious and fatal to Moses, if he should obtain that which he seeks as great
privilege. </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f371
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">How, then, will it be with us, if the vanity
of our nature tempts us to investigate God's glory more deeply than is right?
Wherefore let this passage act as restraint upon us, to repress the speculations
which are too wild and wanton in us, when we desire to know what God would have
concealed from us. This is the rule of sound and legitimate and profitable
knowledge, to be content with the measure of revelation, and willingly to be
ignorant of what is deeper than this. We must indeed advance in the acquisition
of divine instruction, but we must so keep in the way as to follow the guidance
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, I will make all
my goodness pass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> At the outset He
declares how far He has listened to Moses; but a limitation is presently added
to prevent excess. Thus his prayer is not altogether rejected, but only so far
as he was too eagerly set on beholding the perfection of God's glory. The
<i>passing</i> <i>by</i> signifies a vision of brief duration; as if He had
said, Let it suffice thee to have seen once, as for a moment, my glory, when it
shall pass before thine eyes. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tub,</i> which I have rendered beauty, <i>(decorem,)</i> others translate
good, <i>(benum;)</i> and hence, some take it to mean goodness; but the
expression beauty <i>(pulchritudinis,</i> <i>vel</i> <i>decoris)</i> is more
suitable, in which sense we find it used more than once. Hence that which is
pleasing and delectable is said to be good to be looked
upon.</font><br><font face="Palatino">"To call in the name of the
Lord,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f372</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I understand thus, to declare in a clear
and loud voice what it is useful for us to know respecting God Himself. It had
been said before to Moses, "I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
&#8212; but by my name, &#8212; was I not known to them."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
6:3.) Whereas, then, Moses was already superior to the patriarchs, he is now
still more highly exalted, inasmuch as God makes Himself more fully known to
him, and carries His manifestation of Himself to its very utmost. First,
therefore, it must be borne in mind that God was now known to Moses more
familiarly than heretofore; still, at the same time, let it be observed, that
although a vision was exhibited to his eyes, the main point was in the voice;
because true acquaintance with God is made more by the ears than by the eyes. A
promise indeed is given that he shall behold God; but the latter blessing is
more excellent, that God will proclaim this name, so that Moses may know Him
more by His voice than by His face; for speechless visions would be cold and
altogether evanescent, did they not borrow efficacy from words. Thus, therefore,
just as logicians compare a syllogism to the body, and the reasoning, which it
includes, to the soul; so, properly speaking, the soul of a vision is the
doctrine itself, from whence faith takes its
rise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> <i>.</i> <i>.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and will be gracious to whom I
will be gracious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It will be well to
consider how this sentence is connected with the foregoing, which has been
either altogether neglected, or not sufficiently attended to. As to me, although
I think that God's mercy is magnified by the fact, that He deals so indulgently
to this guilty people, still I have no doubt but that He desired purposely to
cut off occasion from the audacity of men, lest they should exclaim against his
unwonted and as yet unheard of liberality; for, whether God executes His
judgments, or mercifully pardons sins, profane men never cease to quarrel with
Him;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f373</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> thus, out of mere disputatiousness, they
ask why He delayed the advent of His Son for so many ages; why He has deigned to
bring forth the light of the Gospel out of darkness in our own days; nay, they
take flight even to the creation of the world, inasmuch as it seems absurd to
them that God should have been idle for so many ages, and therefore they
inquire, in ridicule, why it at length entered His mind to make the world, which
has not yet reached its sixth millennium? Especially, however, does the
frowardness of many advance beyond all due bounds on this point, viz., because
the reason does not appear, why God should be merciful to one nation or one age,
and severe both to other ages and other nations. Hence the admirable counsel of
God, whereby He has chosen some, and reprobated others, has always been exposed
to the calumnies of ungodly men; for unless they see the cause of the diversity,
they do not hesitate to condemn the injustice of God in making this distinction
between the two.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f374</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God here checks this insanity, and
asserts His power, which men, or rather worms of the earth, would gladly deprive
Him of, viz., that according to His own will He exercises peculiar mercy towards
whomsoever He pleases. When the Prophet relates how the fathers obtained
possession of the land of Canaan, he assigns no other reason except that God
"had a favor unto them."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:3.) And this doctrine, which filthy dogs endlessly assail with their barking,
everywhere occurs in the Scriptures. Especially, however, do they rail when God
shews Himself to be propitious, and beneficent towards the unworthy. For this
reason Paul reminds believers of the incomprehensible counsel of God, because,
by the preaching of the Gospel, He revealed the mystery, which was kept secret
from all eternity.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:25.) Again, because by ingrafting the Gentiles into the body of the Church,
from which they had so long been aliens, He commends the depths of that mystery,
which, though hidden even from angels, He made known to all men in the fullness
of time.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:9.) With the same intent, He here expressly declares that the cause why He
manifests Himself to Moses more fully than of old to the patriarchs, is only to
be sought in His own counsel or good-pleasure. Now, although this in the first
place relates to Moses, still, inasmuch as he beheld the glory of God for the
common good of the people, this mercy, which is referred to, extends to them
all. And assuredly it was an inestimable proof of God's grace that, after this
most disgraceful fall and wicked apostasy of the people, He nevertheless
revealed Himself more clearly than before to Moses for their spiritual good.
This, indeed, is certain, that by this reply a restraint is put upon whatever
carnal feelings might allege in consideration of the novelty of the act; as if
God had declared in one word that the dispensation of His grace is in His own
sole power; and that men not only do amiss: but are carried away by impious and
blasphemous madness when they endeavor to interfere with Him; as if it were
their business to arraign that supreme Judge whose subjects they are. The mode
of expression simply tends to this, that God's will is superior to all causes,
so as to be the reason of all reasons, the law of laws, and the rule of rules.
And surely, as long as men permit themselves to inquire into the secret counsels
of God, there will be no bounds to their seditiousness. God, therefore, does not
correct this insanity by disputing with it, but by the assertion of His right to
be free in the dispensation of His grace; for in His sovereignty He says that He
will be merciful to whomsoever He will. Let us beware, then, lest, when He is
kind, our eyes should be evil.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Further, the
better to convince dissatisfied men of their pride and temerity, He sets forth
His mercy and compassion; as much as to say, that He is under obligation to
none; and hence that it is an
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f375
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">unworthy thing in them to murmur, because He
does not indiscriminately do good to them to whom He owes nothing. Hence it is
clear how appropriately Paul, when treating of gratuitous election, accommodates
this passage to the matter in hand,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:15,) viz., that God must be by no means accounted unjust, because He passes by
some and elects others; for the words loudly proclaim that God's grace is
destined to a certain number of men, so as not to appear equally in all. The
phrase itself needs no exposition, for it is common in all languages when we
wish to prevent our reasons from being investigated, to repeat the point in
question; thus, a person, wishing to rid himself of the censures of others,
would say, I will go whither I will go, or I will do what I will
do.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, Thou canst not
see my face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses had indeed seen it,
but in such a mode of revelation, as to be far inferior to its full effulgence.
Long before the birth of Moses, Jacob had said, "I have seen God face to face,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:30;) and to Moses, as I have lately shewn, a still clearer vision was
vouchsafed. Now, however, he obtains something better and more excellent; and
yet not so as perfectly to see God such as He is in Himself, but so far as the
human mind is capable of bearing. For, although the angels are said to see God's
face in a more excellent manner than men, still they do not apprehend the
immense perfection of His glory, whereby they would be absorbed. Justly,
therefore, does God declare that He cannot be seen by a mortal man; for we shall
not see him as He is, until we shall be like Him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:2.) For it must needs be that that incomprehensible brightness would
bring us to nothing. God, therefore, whilst He withholds us from a complete
knowledge of Him, nevertheless manifests Himself as far as is expedient; nay,
attempering the amount of light to our humble capacity, He assumes the face
which we are able to bear.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said, Behold,
there is a place by me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This description
may illdeed appear puerile, but it is well adapted to our imperfection; nor will
any despise it who is duly conscious of his own imbecility and ignorance. There
seems to be a contradiction between these two things, that the beauty of God
should be shewn to Moses, and still that the sight of Him should be refused.
This difficulty is here solved, for Moses was to see God only from behind. It is
a similitude taken from men, whom we only partially recognise, if their face be
turned away; for clear recognition is only obtained by seeing the face and
countenance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The fissure or hole in the rock was
like a narrow and oblique window, which so far admits the sun's rays as that
one, who is shut up in a deep and obscure place, may receive some advantage from
the light, yet never see the sun itself nor enjoy its brightness. Thus we,
imprisoned as it were in our bodies, cannot behold God's glory freely and
directly; but He illuminates us obliquely, so that at least we see Him from
behind. I do not speak of all, but of the most perfect amongst us, such as Moses
was, who, although he obtained the extraordinary privilege which is here
recorded, yet could not endure God's glory through the infirmity of his flesh;
and therefore the hand of God was interposed, so that he should only see Him in
part. By God's <i>hand</i> is meant the darkness wherewith He was covered, lest
the eyes of Moses should be stretched in curiosity to see further than was
lawful. Some</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

time, when Christ was manifested in the flesh, as if it were said, Thou shalt

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto Moses,
Hew thee two tables of stone</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Although
the renewal of the broken covenant was ratified by this pledge or visible
symbol, still, lest His readiness to pardon should produce indifference, God
would have some trace of their punishment remain, like a scar that continues
after the wound is healed. In the first tables there had been no intervention of
man's workmanship; for God had delivered them to Moses engraven by His own
secret power. A part of this great dignity is now withdrawn, when Moses is
commanded to bring tables polished by the hand of man, on which God might write
the Ten Commandments. Thus the ignominy of their crime was not altogether
effaced, whilst nothing was withheld which might be necessary or profitable for
their salvation. For nothing was wanting which might be a testimony of God's
grace, or a recommendation of the Law, so that they should receive it with
reverence; they were only humbled by this mark, that the stones to which God
entrusted His covenant were not fashioned by His hand, nor the produce of the
sacred mount. The conceit by which some expound it, &#8212; that the Jews were
instructed by this sign that the Law was of no effect, unless they should offer
their stony hearts to God for Him to inscribe it upon them, &#8212; is
frivolous; for the authority of Paul rather leads us the other way, where he
fitly and faithfully interprets this passage, and compares the Law to a dead and
deadly letter, because it was only engraven on tables of stone, whereas the
doctrine of salvation requires "the fleshy tables of the heart."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:3.) </font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And no man shall come up with
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Again men as well as beasts are
prohibited from access to the mount, as had been the case at the first
promulgation of the Law, in order that the people might obediently receive the
Law as if come down from heaven. Why God admitted no witness, is a question the
answer to which must remain with God Himself. The miracle indeed would have been
illustrious if the writing had appeared in a moment on the empty tables; but God
would leave some room for faith, when He employed the intermediate agency of
man. But still He amply provided what was sufficient to establish the dignity of
the Law, when Moses brought the Ten Commandments written upon two tables which
the people had lately seen taken up void and empty, whereas He could not have
found in the mount a chisel or graving-tool.
For</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f377</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God so administers the dispensation of
His heavenly doctrine as to prove the obedience and teachableness of believers,
whilst He leaves no room for doubting.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord descended in the
cloud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It is by no means to be doubted
but that the cloud received Moses into it in the sight of the people, so that,
after having been separated from the common life of men for forty days, he
should again come forth like a new man. Thus did this visible demonstration of
God's glory avail to awaken faith in the
commandments.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The descent of God, which is here
recorded, indicates no change of place, as if God, who fills heaven and earth,
and whose immensity is universally diffused, altered His position, but it has
reference to the perceptions of men, because under the appearance of the cloud
God testified that He met Moses. Therefore, according to the usual phrase of
Scripture, the sacred name of God is applied to the visible symbol; not that the
empty cloud was a figure of the absent Deity, but because it testified His
presence according to the comprehension of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the end of the verse, "to call in the
name of the Lord," is equivalent to proclaiming His name, or promulgating what
God would make known to His servant. This expression, indeed, frequently occurs
with reference to prayers.
Some,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f378</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> therefore, understand it of Moses, that
he called on the name of the Lord. In this opinion there is no absurdity; let us
be at liberty, then, to take it as applying either to Moses or to God Himself,
<i>i.e.,</i> either that God Himself proclaimed in a loud voice His power, and
righteousness, and goodness, or that Moses himself professed his piety before
God. But what immediately follows must necessarily be referred to God, when He
passed by, to cry out and to dignify Himself with His true titles. First of all,
the name of Jehovah is uttered twice by way of emphasis, in order that Moses
might be rendered more attentive. The name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>el</i>, is added, which, originally derived from <i>strength,</i> is often
used for God, and is one of His names. By these words, therefore, His eternity
and boundless power are expressed. Next, He proclaims His clemency and mercy;
nor is He contented with a single word, but, after having called Himself
"merciful," He claims the praise of clemency, inasmuch as He has no more
peculiar attribute than His goodness and gratuitous beneficence. The nature also
of His goodness and clemency is specified, viz., that He is not only placable,
and ready, and disposed, to pardon, but that He patiently waits for those who
have sinned, and invites them to repentance by His long-suffering. For this
reason He is called
"slow</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f379</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to anger," as if He would abstain from
severity did not man's wickedness compel Him to execute punishment on his sins.
Afterwards He proclaims the greatness of His mercy and truth, and on these two
supports the confidence of the pious is based, whilst they embrace the mercy
offered to them, and securely repose on the faithfulness and certainty of the
promises. Everywhere, therefore, in the Psalms, where mention is made of God's
goodness, His truth is connected with it as its inseparable companion. Another
reason also is because God's mercy cannot be comprehended, except upon the
testimony of His word, the certainty of which must needs be well assured lest
our salvation should be wavering and insecure. What follows, that God keeps
mercy to a thousand generations, we have expounded in chapter 20; whilst, on the
other hand, the punishments which He requires for men's sins are only extended
to the third and fourth generation, because His clemency surpasses His judgment,
as is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
30:5, "</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f380
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">There is only a moment in his anger, but life
in his favor;" and although this only relates properly to believers, yet it
flows from a general principle. To the same effect is the next clause,
"forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin;" for thus the greatness of His
clemency is set forth, inasmuch as He not only pardons light offenses, but the
very grossest sins; and again, remits not only sin in one case, but is
propitious to sinners by whom He has been a hundred times offended. Hence,
therefore, appears the extent of His goodness, since He blots out an infinite
mass of iniquities. Lest, however, this indulgence should be perverted into a
license for sin, it is afterwards added, by way of correction,
"with</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f381</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> cleansing He will not cleanse," which,
with the Chaldee interpreter and others, I understand as applying to His severe
judgment against the reprobate and obstinate; for I do not like their opinion
who say that, although God indeed pardons sins, yet He still moderately
chastises those who have sinned; since this is a poor conjecture, that
punishment is required though the guilt is remitted; and besides, it is
altogether untrue, inasmuch as it is manifest, from experience that God passes
over many sins without punishment. But what I have stated is very suitable,
that, lest impunity should beget audaciousness, after God has spoken of His
mercy, He adds an exception, viz., that the iniquity is by no means pardoned,
which is accompanied by obstinacy. And hence the Prophets seem to have quoted
from this passage, "</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f382 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Clearing should ye be cleared?"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:29; 49:l2,) when they address the reprobate, to whom pardon is denied. The
words, therefore, may be properly paraphrased thus: Although God is pitiful and
even ready to pardon, yet He does not therefore spare the despisers, but is a
severe avenger of their impiety. Nevertheless, the opposite meaning would not be
inappropriate here, "With cutting off He will not cut off;" for this is
sometimes the sense of the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nakah;</i> and it would thus be read conneetedly, that God pardons iniquities
because He does not wish entirely to cut off the human race; for who shall
escape if God should choose to call to judgment the sins even of believers? And
perhaps Jeremiah alluded to this passage,
where</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f383</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he mitigates the severity of the
vengeance of which he had been speaking by this same expression, for there it
can only be translated, "With cutting off I will not cut thee off." If this be
preferred, it will be the assignment of the reason why God pardons sins, viz.,
because He is unwilling to cut off men, which would be the case if He insisted
on the utmost rigor of the Law.
Some</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f384</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> thus explain it, That God pardons sins,
because no one is innocent in His sight; as if it were said, that all are
destitute of the glory of righteousness, and thence their only refuge is in the
mercy of God. This is true indeed, but not so nmch an exposition as a plausible
conceit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses made haste, and
bowed his head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This haste shews that
Moses was astounded when he first beheld the brightness; for thus does God, when
He reveals Himself, immediately ravish the godly into such admiration of Him,
that there is no time for
delay.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f385</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This prayer follows, that God would
journey with His people, and bear with their frowardness; for, since God had
said that He could not possibly dwell with so stiff-necked and intractable a
people, Moses proposes the remedy, viz., after he has confessed that the people
are of a hardened and stubborn spirit, he still expresses a hope of their
safety, if God will be pitiful in sparing them. What follows is worthy of
observation, "that thou mayest possess
us;"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f386</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the <i>copula</i> has the force of
the causal particle, as if he had said, That God could not enjoy the inheritance
He had chosen, unless by pardoning their sins. And surely so it is; for such is
man's frailty, that they would straightway fall from grace were they not
reconciled to God. Nor was this spoken only of this ancient people, but refers
also to us; for, in order that God should <i>possess</i> us too, it is needful
that our sins should be constantly pardoned, as this embassy, according to Paul,
daily resounds in the Church.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:20.) Consequently, not only does the origin of our salvation flow
from gratuitous adoption, but its continual progress even to the end can only be
accomplished by God's freely reconciling us to
Himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, Behold, I make a

God would make the covenant. Some
interpreters,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f387</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> therefore, supply the name of Moses, and
this they seem to do on probable grounds, especially since it is added at the
end of the verse "the
work</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f388</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that I will do with thee." But, inasmuch
as Moses stipulated in the name of all, the meaning comes to the same thing, if
we read, I will make a covenant openly with the whole people. By this promise,
then, God, as it were, entirely restored the Israelites, for He declares that He
will deal so marvellously in the discomfiture of the nations, as to prove that
He is the peculiar God of that people; and this was to distinguish them from
other nations, according to the prayer of Moses. he says that they shall all be
eye-witnesses of this, that, being thus at length convinced by their own senses,
they might sincerely and faithfully submit themselves to his
dominion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he was there with the
Lord forty days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The number of forty
days is repeated, in order that the second Tables might have no less credit than
the first; for we have stated that Moses was withdrawn from the common life of
men, that he might bring the Law, as it were, from heaven. If he had only been
kept a few days in the mount, his authority would not have been ratified by so
conspicuous a miracle; but the forty days obtained full credit for his mission,
so that the people might know that he was sent by God; inasmuch as the endurance
of a fast for so long a period exceeded the capacity of human nature. Wherefore,
in order that the majesty of the Law might be indubitable, its minister was
invested with angelic glory; and hence he expressly records that "he did neither
eat bread, nor drink watch" since it was requisite that he should be
distinguished from other mortals, in order that his official character might be
unquestionable. Now, it must be borne in mind, that this was not a mere fast of
temperance or sobriety, but of special privilege, whereby exemption from the
infirmity of the flesh was vouchsafed to Moses for a time, in order that his
condition might be different from the rest of the human race. For neither did he
feel any hunger, nor did he struggle with any longing for food, nor desire meat
and drink any more than one of the angels. Therefore this instance of abstinence
was never alleged as an example by the Prophets, nor did any one attempt to
imitate what they all knew to be by no means accorded to them. I except Elijah,
who, being sent to revive the Law, when it was almost lost, like a second Moses,
abstained also from eating and drinking for forty days. The reason for the fast
of Christ was similar,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
4:2;) for, in order to acquire full credit for tits Gospel, He desired to make
it manifest that He was by no means inferior to Moses in this particular.
Wherefore,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f389</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the less excusable is that error, which
sprang from gross ignorance, when all, without exception, endeavored to rival
the Son of God in their annual fast, as if a new promulgation of the Gospel was
entrusted to them. For neither did Christ fast forty day's more than once in His
life; nor during the whole of that time, as it is clearly specified, did he
experience hunger; and His heavenly Father separated Him from communion with
men, when He was preparing Himself to undertake the office of
teacher.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass when
Moses came down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Another remarkable
honor given to the Law is here narrated, viz., that the brightness of the
heavenly glory appeared in the face of Moses; for it is said that his face gave
forth rays, or was irradiated. The word is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;rq</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>keren,</i> a <i>horn;</i> and therefore it is probable that rays shone forth
from his face, which rendered it luminous; and this effulgence God shed upon
him, whilst He was speaking to him in the mount. It is not certain what was the
reason why Moses himself was ignorant that he was thus illumined by God, except
that it seems probable that it was concealed from him for a short time, in order
that he might approach the people with more freedom, and thus that the miracle
might be more evident from close inspection. When it is said afterwards, that
Aaron and the children of Israel were so alarmed at the brightness, that "they
were afraid to come nigh him," I do not understand it, as if they fled from him
immediately; for, since they were recalled by his voice, undoubtedly they had
not seen the rays from a distance, but when they were in the act of receiving
him, and he, on his part, delivering to them the commands of God. Therefore,
what follows soon afterwards, that, when he had done speaking, he covered his
face with a vail,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f390</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I refer to his first address, which He
was obliged to break off on account of the departure or flight of the people, so
that the meaning is, when He knew the cause of their alarm, He left off
speaking, and covered his face with a vail; for he could not have known the
reason of their flying except by inquiry. Some, in order to avoid the
difficulty, separate the second clause from the first, and transpose their
order; but this exposition appears to me to be forced. It seems, however, in my
opinion, to be perfectly consistent that Moses, after he saw them departing in
consternation, ceased from speaking, because they did not listen to him, and,
when he discovered the reason, put on the vail. Hence arises a question, viz.,
How Moses could have borne the brightness of God's glory, whilst the people
could not bear the rays which shone from his face? But this is easily answered:
that they were branded with this mark of disgrace, in order that they might
confess how far by their ingratitude they had departed from God, since they were
terrified at the sight of this servant. They were, therefore, humbled by this
difference between them, that, whilst Moses securely advanced to them from his
conference with God, although he bore upon him the indications of God's terrible
power, they, in fear and astonishment, recoiled from the sight of a mortal
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After Paul has shewn the genuine object of
this brightness, viz., that the Law should be glorious, he proceeds further, and
shews that it was a presage of the future blindness which awaited the Jews.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:13.) He begins, therefore, by saying, that although the Law was
only a dead <i>letter,</i> and <i>the</i> <i>ministration</i> <i>of</i>
<i>death,</i> yet it was graced with its own peculiar glory; and then adds what
is accidental, that there was a vail before the face of Moses, because it would
be the case that the Jews would not be able to see what is the main thing in the
Law, nor to pay attention to its true end; and so it actually is, that since the
coming of Christ, their senses have been blinded, and the vail is upon them,
until Moses shall be</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f391</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> turned by them to Christ, who is the
soul of the Law. But, since now in the Gospel God presents Himself with open
face, we must take care that the prince of this world does not darken our minds,
but rather that we may be transformed <i>from</i> <i>glory</i> <i>to</i>
<i>glory.</i></font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember, and forget not, how
thou provokedst</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In order to reprove the
ingratitude of the people, Moses here briefly refers to some of their offenses;
but he principally insists on the history of their revolt, in which their
extreme and most detestable impiety betrayed itself. He therefore narrates this
crime in almost the identical words which he had previously used in Exodus. He
begins by urging them often to reflect upon their sins, lest they should ever be
forgotten; and this constant recollection of them not only tended to humiliate
them, but also to teach them at length to lay aside their depraved nature, and
to accustom themselves to become obedient to God. Afterwards he proceeds to the
history itself, shewing that God had been provoked by their idolatry to destroy
them. If a question be here put, how it was that God was prevailed upon by Moses
to change His intention, our curiosity must be repressed, lest we should dispute
more deeply than is fitting respecting the secret and incomprehensible decree of
God. Sure it is that God did not act otherwise than He had determined; but Moses
goes no deeper than the sentence that was revealed to him; just as we must
assuredly conclude that destruction is prepared for us when we transgress; and
that God's anger is appeased when we fly to His mercy in true faith, and with
sincere affections. The rest has been already
expounded.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I took the two tables,
and cast them out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses here accuses
himself of no transgression; he does not, therefore, give us to understand that
he was urged to break the tables by the impetuosity of excessive anger; but
rather he again repeats what they had deserved, and consequently that he
discharged the office of a
herald,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f392</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so as to denounce, not by word of mouth
only, but by a solemn rite also, that God's Covenant was broken and made void by
their perfidiousness. For which reason also he cast down and broke the tables
before their eyes, in order that being alarmed by so awful a punishment, they
might more earnestly betake themselves to the expiation of their
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I fell down before the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The order of the narrative is
confused; for this fact of which he speaks did not precede his second ascent
into the mount, when he was commanded to prepare the second tables. If so, he
would have fasted three times, which we gather from other passages not to have
been the case; but we must not be surprised that the same thing should be often
repeated, as we shall see at the beginning of chapter 10, as well as shortly
afterwards. The mention of it here, however, is seasonable, because the Covenant
was to be renewed, and therefore, as if nothing had been done, he again
abstained from meat and drink for forty days. Yet we have elsewhere seen that
there were other prayers which had intervened before He ascended the mount a
second time; but He does not here distinctly record the details, nay, he mixes
up the prayers, whereby he interceded with God, with the second fast, because
this was the point most worthy of observation, that the first promulgation of
the Law had failed of its effect, and the Covenant which they had violated was
to be repeated, as it were, from its very
commencement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although he says that "because of
their sins" he had not eaten bread nor drunk water, he does not signify that
this fast was a sign of grief and mourning, like as Joel invites the people to
sackcloth and ashes, and urges them to weeping and fasting for the purpose of
testifying their repentance.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:12.) For abstinence, as I have already shewn, was no more difficult or
grievous to Moses than to the angels. But he simply reminds them that so great a
sin could not be expiated, unless he had again renounced the life of men and had
been taken up to God. Meanwhile, it must be borne in mind that previously to
this, he had already made entreaty for the people, and had also been accepted;
inasmuch as it was a token that God was reconciled and appeased, when He called
up Moses to receive the Law, and to bring it down to them a second time. To this
refers what he adds in the next verse, "For I was afraid of the anger," etc.,
for he was still in anxiety as to the welfare of the people, since God did not
cease to menace them. We see, therefore, that this fear and anxious earnestness
in prayer are separated from the fast, as different things; and assuredly he had
already propitiated God, when, by His command he hewed out the new tables
whereon the Covenant was to be renewed. Still, I do not deny that he labored
also in the mount in the cause of obtaining pardon, just as believers, by
continuing the requests which have already been granted, confirm their faith
more and more. I only warn my readers to observe the distinction of time which I
have noticed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord was very angry
with Aaron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It hence appears how vain
are the pretexts whereby men endeavor to conceal their faults, until they are
subdued by genuine fear of God to acknowledge their guilt. Although Aaron did
not boast that he was altogether innocent, still he endeavored to blot out, or
at any rate to extenuate the enormity of his crime by alleging that he was under
compulsion. But Moses declares that God was very angry with him. Whence it
follows that he was guilty of a very gross sin, which is also more certainly
declared by the greatness of its punishment; for God would never have been thus
moved even to destroy him, unless because he was worthy of this
condemnation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse, the word
<i>sin</i> is not applied to the act;
itself,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f393</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but is transferred by metonymy to the
calf, as its apposition shews. Again, by saying that he had thoroughly broken
the calf to pieces by grinding it till it was reduced to powder, he signifies
once more how abominable this idol was, especially when he adds, that the powder
was cast into the stream, lest any memorial of it should continue in
existence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus I fell down before the
Lord forty days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Again the narrative is
blended together; for it is certain that this prayer was offered before he
remained fasting in the mount during the second forty days. But inasmuch as then
also, being still in anxiety, he continued the same prayers, it is not to be
wondered at that he should include in the forty days' fast whatever had been
done before. For there is no absurdity in supposing that after having obtained
the safety of the people, for which he had petitioned, he should still be in
trepidation. Moreover, that this fast was posterior to the prayer which he
mentions at the same time, may be inferred from the beginning of the next
chapter, where he records that the second tables were given to him, but says not
a word of the fast. I have stated why he so often repeats his allusion to the
forty days, viz., because it would not have been sufficient merely to intercede,
unless this reconciliation had followed, which he obtained when he received the
new covenant. The rest I have already expounded.</font><br></div>

unto me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He had had intercourse with the
people for some time, before he returned into the mount with the second tables;
and therefore he now begins to relate more fully what he had already mentioned
in the inverted order of time, <i>i.e.,</i> that he stayed in the mount forty
days to make entreaty for them. And this also the repetition in the 10th verse
more clearly demonstrates, where he says, that he stayed in the mount
"according</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f394</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to the first days." But, although he
there says that he was hearkened to when he interceded in the mount, still he
includes the prayers which he had previously offered when he heard of the
people's revolt, and after he had broken the tables and taken away God's
tabernacle, in which he prayed apart to obtain pardon for their sin. What is
also here said respecting the ark is not in its proper place; for it was a part
of the tabernacle, as we have elsewhere seen. It is, therefore, exacting too
much to require that the things which are related together, should be referred
to the same instant of time.</font><br></div>

when</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f396</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it was brought back from its strange to
its proper place. For then it was both anointed and honored by sacred oblations,
whilst Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the performance of the priestly
office. Since, therefore, it had not yet been duly placed in the middle of the
camp, nay, rather had been removed from the people lest they should enjoy that
pledge of God's presence, its solemn dcdication is justly celebrated after the
renewal of the covenant. This passage also confirms what I have said
elsewhere,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f397</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that this was the tabernacle which Moses
pitched at a distance from the camp; for, by the addition of its title, he
speaks as of something well known, "Thou shalt set up (He says) the tabernacle,
viz., the tabernacle of convention." Now Moses himself had already stated that
this name had been given it by the mouth of God. He repeats, however, the same
injunctions, not that He distrusted the memory of His servant, but that it might
be more fully apparent that He was Himself the sole Author of the whole work,
and also that it nlight obtain more reverence, since He had so often deigned to
give initructions as concerning things of very great
importance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt take the
anointing oil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There was by no means any
virtue or efficacy for sanctification in the oil, except in so far as it was a
type of the Spirit, from whom as its only source all holiness emanates.
Assuredly the oil, as being a corruptible fluid, neither penetrates into the
soul, nor would by itself at all avail unto spiritual service. It appears,
however, from many pnssages of Scripture, that it was a symbol of all the gifts
of the Holy Spirit. This figure, therefore, clearly shews that nothing pleases
God, that nothing is pure or holy in His sight, except what has been purged, and
duly consecrated by the influence and grace of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, God
would have all the vessels of the sanctuary set apart by this sacred anointing
from common use, in order that the Israelites might distinguish between things
sacred and profane, and thus that God's service might receive its due reverence,
so that none should intrude the pollutions of the flesh into that place, the
purity of which had been signalized by that sacred symbol. A question, however,
here arises why he dignifies the altar of burnt-offering with a more exalted
title; for, after having called the tabernacle itself with its vessels simply
<i>holy,</i> He calls the altar "holy of holies," which I have rendered
<i>sacrosanctum.</i> I doubt not but that it acquired this name from the
sacrifices, which are also so called on account of the expiation made by
them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f398</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as we have seen elsewhere. The children
of Israel, therefore, were instructed that God is truly reconciled by holocausts
and burnt-offerings, since "the holiness of holinesses" resided on the altar
itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt bring Aaron
and his sons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I have already expounded
all that might seem to be profitable with respect to the garments and the mode
of anointing; only let; my readers remember that the
priest,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f399</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who had been before appointed, is now at
length inaugurated, in order that he may begin the discharge of his office. At
the same time, let them also bear in mind that this oil was consecrated by God.
Hence it appears how foolishly the Popish bishops, as it were, ape Moses, when,
in imitation of him, they sprinkle their priests and altars and other rubbish
with stinking oil, since it is abundantly clear that this ceremony of anointing,
belonging as it did to the ancient shadows of the Law, ceased at the coming of
Christ. What Augustine</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f400</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> reminds us of is also worthy of
observation, that Moses, who is commissioned to anoint the others, was never
consecrated himself by any visible symbol, in order that we may understand that
outward signs are not to be estimated by the dignity of the minister, but only
by the ordinance of God; and again, that invisible grace has profited some
without visible sacraments, whilst visible sanctification may be imparted, but
cannot profit, without invisible.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass in the
first month</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> In all the arrangements,
which are here described, it must be especially noted, that Moses obeyed God in
such a manner as not to vary in the most trifling point from the form prescribed
to him. He therefore so frequently enforces the fact, that he did as God had
commanded him; and not without reason, for there is nothing to which men are
more prone than to mix up their inventions with God's commands, as if they would
be wiser than He is. In order then that the people might know that there was
nothing of human invention in all the legal service, Moses so carefully insists
on this point, and so often testifes to his obedience. But if so great the
Prophet dared to attempt nothing of himself in trifling matters, how great is
the audacity and arrogance of those men who arbitrarily invent innumerable
figments, whereby God may be worshipped! Let us, however, learn from this
passage to embrace with reverence whatever has proceeded from God, whilst we
reject whatever men advance of
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then a cloud covered the
tent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The holiness of the tabernacle was
proved by this signal or pledge, for the people assuredly knew that it had not
been set up in vain, but that the promise given before was actually fulfilled,
and that it was chosen to be the dwelling-place of God, who would be the Leader
and Keeper of His people. For it was not a natural thing that the cloud should
settle over the sanctuary in which the Ark of the Covenant was deposited; and
much less so that by day a cloud should be seen and a fire by night, especially
when this did not occur once only, but when they succeeded each other in
perpetual alternation. It is fitly said, that when the tabernacle was covered by
the cloud, it was at, the same time filled with the glory of God; for this was a
magnificent distinction, that an earthly edifice should be rendered illustrious
by a more than heavenly ornament, as if God's majesty were visibly presented to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Whereas before Moses had been concealed
and separated from the people by the cloud, its density is now said to have
prevented even him from entering; thus, then, ought their reverence and
admiration of the place to have been increased, when the greatness of its glory
was a hinderance to their holy Prophet. It is probable that by his example not
only the rest of the multitude, but all the Levites also, were admonished that
they should not endeavor to penetrate further than they were allowed. For, after
the possession of the priesthood was transmitted to his brother, he, as well as
his descendants, was excluded from that sacred dignity.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And it came to pass on the day that
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This was the second contribution
of the people, after the completion of the Tabernacle; for although mention is
only made of the princes, it is probable that each of them presented what the
whole tribe had subscribed, since there was no private person at that time
wealthy enough to give so much gold and silver of his own. Let it be understood,
then, that they brought in the name, and at the desire of all, what they had
received from the members of their respective tribes. Before, however, I proceed
any further, it must be remarked that the sacrifices were not killed, before the
sanctuary was anointed. Moses himself is said to have anointed it, as he had his
brother Aaron; for the exposition of some, that what properly applies to Aaron
is attributed to his brother, does not appear to be sound. We have said
elsewhere that God thus freely used the visible signs, in order that He might by
no means bind the grace of the Spirit to particular persons. When Moses,
therefore, who was not anointed himself, anointed both the sanctuary and the
priest, it was manifestly shewn that the efficacy of consecration did not
emanate from himself, inasmuch as He could not give of his own that which he did
not possess. Consequently the entire virtue and utility of signs depend on the
command of God. We have elsewhere seen why it was necessary to consecrate the
tabernacle, the altar, and all the vessels by a sacred anointing. Here let us
only observe, that the connection of the two words <i>anointing</i> and
<i>sanctifying</i> is not superfluous: that we may understand that the symbol of
the oil was not vain and inefficacious, but that true spiritual sanctity was
annexed to it; for God institutes nothing in vain, but, by filling what He
typifies with the secret influence of the Spirit, He effectually proves Himself
to be true. It is said that the princes were set "over them that were numbered,"
<i>i.e.,</i> after the people were numbered, and separated into their several
divisions, these were chosen as the chiefs of the tribes. The exposition which
some give, that they assisted when the people were numbered, in my opinion, is
far-fetched.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they brought their
offering before the Lord, six covered
waggons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> These waggons were dedicated
for the conveyance of the tabernacle: for its pillars and many other parts of it
could not be carried on men's shoulders; and therefore they are said to have
been <i>covered,</i> lest the things which were deposited in them should be
exposed to the rain. For it is by no means suitable to suppose that they were
litters; </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f401</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, in fact, a pair of oxen is assigned
to every waggon. It is pretty clear, then, that the materials of the tabernacle
were placed in them when they were travelling from one place to
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This oblation is stated to have been
made "before the Lord," and then "before the tabernacle," but the meaning is
precisely the same; for God had, as it were, put on that face in which he might
be beheld by believers. What follows, "But the Lord had spoken to Moses," etc.,
I thus interpret, That God had required this tribute of the people: I have
thought it well, therefore, to render it in the pluperfect tense, whereas others
translate it, "The Lord said unto Moses," as if Moses had not been ordered to
receive it, before it was actually presented by the princes and the people.
Indeed, it is probable that the number of the waggons was not accidentally
determined, but by a just calculation of the things which they were to
carry.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the princes offered for
dedicating of the altar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here is another
kind of offering, viz., a silver dish and bowl from every tribe, besides a
golden spoon,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f402</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which properly means a censer. Their use
was as follows, &#8212; that the sacred cakes should be received in the dishes,
the wine of libation in the bowls, and the frankincense in the censers. But God
would have each tribe contribute their respective vessels, in order that the
common interest of the whole people in the sacrifices might be the better
testified. Although the word
<i>shekel</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f403</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is derived front its being
<i>weighed,</i> still it is almost everywhere used for a coined piece of money,
which, as we have seen at Exodus 30, was of the value of twenty <i>oboli.</i>
Josephus estimates it at an Attic tetradrachm. But Ezekiel, when he is
inveighing against their fraud in having diminished its weight, settles its
value at twenty oboli, and adds that it is the third part of a pound or
<i>mina.</i>
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;264512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
45:12.) But it must be borne in remembrance, as we have also seen elsewhere,
that the shekel of the sanctuary was double the ordinary one, for it was worth
four drachmas, whereas the common shekel was only worth two drachmas, or a
staler. Now, if we calculate, we shall find that the value of each dish amounted
to nearly a hundred French livres; and that of each bowl to forty-four. If we
take the shekel in the same sense with reference to the censers, or spoons, they
must have been very small, only being about seven livres in value: whereas a
gold vessel of this size would scarcely hold three grains of frankincense.
Wherefore, I doubt whether they had not also gold shekels; but I leave it
undecided as a point on which we have no
knowledge.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Lastly, follow the animals offered as
victims, a young bullock, a ram, and a lamb for a burnt-offering; a kid for a
sin-offering; two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, and five lambs for a sacrifice
of thanksgiving. It would, however, have been difficult for each prince to
present so many out of his own folds or stalls; whence it is probable that they
were aided by a general contribution. God chose that each tribe should have its
peculiar day appointed for it in order, not only that there might be no
confusion or disturbance, but; also that by this lengthened exercise the hearts
even of the careless might be stirred up to zealous
devotion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he that offered his
offering the first day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The oracular
declaration which God made by the mouth of Jacob is well known. "The scepter
shall not depart from Judah," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:10.) Non, although the time had not yet arrived when the truth of this
prophecy should be manifested by its fulfillment, still it was brought to pass
by the admirable counsel of God that certain marks of supremacy should exist in
the tribe of Judah; and, by general consent, if not dominion, at least the chief
dignity, was always lodged in it. The assignment of the first day to Nahshon
was, therefore,a presage of that future kingdom which was at length set up in
the person of David. If any should allege the absurdity that the tribe of
Reuben, who was the first-born, should be kept back till the fourth day, I reply
that the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar were ranked under the banner of Judah;
since it will appear in chapter
10.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f404</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the twelve tribes were divided into
four divisions of three. Thus it was more honorable for the tribe of Reuben to
have the fourth day, so as to have the two tribes over which it presided
attached to it. But the fathers of the two tribes, which God placed under the
banner of Judah, were the two youngest sons of Leah, who followed next after
Judah, her fourth son. We see, therefore, that the kingdom was thus obscurely
shadowed forth, from which salvation was to be hoped for by the whole people: in
order that they might be the more attentive to the promise given them; although
this indication of it had but little effect on their sluggish
minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>89.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Moses was gone into
the tabernacle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There seems at first
sight to be a kind of contradiction between this passage and the other, in which
we saw that a thick cloud stood in the door of the tabernacle, so that Moses
could not enter it. It might, indeed, be answered that this only occurred once;
but to me it appears more probable that, Moses sought the replies of God at the
mercy-seat, until Aaron began to exercise the priesthood, and then abandoned his
dignity, which was only temporary, as far as regarded the entering of the
sanctuary. For we know that by the established Law of God the priesthood was
distinct from the civil government; and therefore that he could not, except by
special privilege, be at the same time the leader and the priest.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f405
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">If this exposition be accepted, he does not
here record in its proper place that answers were given to him by God from the
mercy-seat; since it is by no means unusual that what has preceded in order of
time should be annexed at the end of a narrative. His intention, indeed, was to
declare to posterity that God had not promised in vain that the Israelites
should experience the presence of His favor; because He had chosen His
dwelling-place in the sanctuary, to sit between the cherubim. By this testimony,
therefore, of God's grace, the external anointing was ratified and confirmed,
inasmuch as God appeared to Moses upon the Ark of the Covenant.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses did as the Lord
commanded him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Although these things
relate to the priesthood, the authority and nature of which I expounded under
the Second Commandment, yet, inasmuch as they are historical, it is not without
reason that I have thought fit to defer them till this place: for, if I had
referred to them in connection with the Commandment, unpractised readers would
not have easily taken notice of their time. This distinction, however, will be
of great assistance to them, that after the doctrine which was properly
contained in the Decalogue has been set forth, they will now see how faithfully
Moses fulfilled whatever he was commanded, and will be able to compare his
obedience with the injunction, as they have done in the whole of the making and
dedication of the tabernacle. Besides, there is no question but that the
narrative must be thus connected; for it may be readily inferred from many
passages, that the priests were anointed on the same day that the tabernacle was
consecrated. I will now hastily run through the words. Moses says that he
brought near Aaron and his sons, <i>i.e.,</i> to set them before God and the
people; and then that he "washed them with water," to make it manifest that they
did not bring from their homes the purity which befitted the sanctity of their
office, and, inasmuch as they were men, that they could not be clean before God,
unless their impurity was washed off. A description of their apparel afterwards
follows, which I pass over, lest I should weary my readers by twice repeating
the same thing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses took the anointing
oil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I have stated why God commanded
that the priest himself, as well as all the vessels, should be consecrated with
oil, viz., because, without the influence of the Spirit, all the sacrifices
would be unsavory. And it is by the operation of the same Spirit that Christ was
made the peace-maker between God and men; because this dignity would not
otherwise belong to flesh and human nature. Aaron was therefore anointed,
together with his sons, before he was admitted to the priestly office; for it is
afterwards added, that "the bullock for
sin"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f406</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was brought, upon which Aaron laid his
hands. Now, although even then he began to discharge his office, yet Moses still
occupied the first place, and performed, as it were, the final act. Hence it was
that he sprinkled the horns of the altar with the blood; poured the residue at
its base for expiation; and burned the sacrifice upon the altar. Now, the
imposition of hands in the sacrifices was not only a symbol of presentation, but
also a testimony of guilt transferred to the victim. Since, however, this last
statement may be obscure on account of its brevity, I will explain it a little
more clearly. If any private person offered a victim, the imposition of hands
signified that he cast the guilt of his sin upon the victim. Hence the name of
<i>piaculum</i>; </font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f407</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because it sustained the curse of God,
and was substituted in the sinner's stead, who disburdens himself upon it of
whatever exposed him to the judgment of God. But, inasmuch as common hands were
unworthy to consecrate a victim to God, the sacerdotal office interposed. This
is the reason why Aaron and his sons put their hands on each of the sacrifices,
in order that this kind of atonement <i>(piaculi)</i> might be the beginning of
their consecration, which was completed in the second ram, with the blood of
which Moses stained their right ears, the thumbs of their right hands, and the
great toes of their right feet. A multitude of questions here arises: Why only
one side of the priests was consecrated, as if their left side remained
polluted? Why consecration was not also imparted to their eyes, and especially
to their mouth, which was to be the organ of the Holy Spirit? But this warning
must be always borne in mind, that we should be soberly wise in those points,
the certain knowledge of which cannot be elicited from Scripture; for our
curiosity is not only frivolous, but also perverse and injurious, when we desire
to know more than God has revealed. The conjecture, however, is probable, that
the whole body was consecrated in the right side. We have already seen
elsewhere,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f408</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that by the hands and feet the whole
life and actions of men are designated. In which view the cleanness of the heart
and the purity of the hands comprehend all that is internal and external in man,
as the root and the fruit. As to the feet, the metaphor of <i>walking</i> is
notorious; and the feet are said to run to evil, and to be swift to shed blood,
when the wicked and the despisers of God betake themselves to evil deeds.
Besides, since this consecration was not to the office of teaching, but to that
of intercession, the ear rather than the tongue is stained with blood; because
the chief virtue, which obtains grace in the sacrifices, is obedience. To this
the passage in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:6, refers, "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
bored:"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

correspond,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">And hence Moses commenced the consecration at the
ear, in order to devote the priest to God unto obedience. Paul shews how this
was fulfilled in Christ, where he celebrates His obedience in the sacrifice of
His death, in order to reconcile His Father to us.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass on the
eighth day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We have here related how
Aaron and his sons, after the time of their consecration was fulfilled, began to
execute their office. It was necessary that He should be his brother's disciple,
in order to follow the pattern laid down by God. And we must bear in mind that
Moses, who was not appointed priest by a solemn rite, sanctified the others, in
order that the authority and the efficacy of the outward sign should rest in God
alone. This, therefore, is contained in the earlier portion of the chapter, how,
after Aaron had been initiated in the priest's office for seven days, He
commenced the work entrusted to him by God's command: the second part shews how
the sacrifices were approved by a divine miracle, in ratification of the
priesthood which God had instituted. But, first of all, He enumerates the
ordinary kinds of sacrifice, viz., for sin, the burnt-offering; and for
thanksgiving, the sacrifice with the meat-offering <i>(minha)</i> and the
sprinkling: that in every respect Aaron might be accounted the lawful priest of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, This is the
thing which the Lord commanded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He
seems, indeed, to address himself to the whole people, to whom also the promise
belonged; but in the word "do
ye,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f414</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He specially speaks to the sons of
Aaron; and he promises what, at the end of the chapter, he will state to have
been fulfilled, that the glory of God should be manifested in approbation of the
priesthood, in order that they may set about their duties more cheerfully. For
this was no common aid to their faith and assurance, that their office should be
thus, as it were, sealed by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go
unto the altar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here is repeated what
was stated elsewhere, that the priest, as being himself a sinner, must first
make entreaty for himself, before he propitiates God towards others. Hence the
Apostle justly infers that the legal priesthood was weak and merely typical.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:1.) For none can be a true peace-maker, except he, who, in reliance on his
perfect innocence, presents himself before God to obtain pardon for others, and,
being pure from every blemish, requires no expiation for himself. All else to
the end of the chapter I pass over, because Moses only records how Aaron
sacrificed according to God's command and the legal
ritual.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Aaron lifted up his hand
toward the people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This was a kind of
application of the sacrifice, in order that the people might know that God was
reconciled to them through the priest as their mediator and surety. The form of
benediction</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f415</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> has been already expoundled; at present
let this one point suffice, that, when by the lifting up of their hands the
priests testified of God's paternal favor to the people, their commission was
ratified and efficacious. Of this the sacred history presents to us a memorable
instance, where it records,
that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the priests and Levites
blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his
holy dwelling-place, even unto heaven."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143027&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Chronicles 30:27.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The fulfilment of this type
was at length manifested in Christ, who is not only the source and cause of
blessing, but publishes it by the Gospel with effectual results; for He came to
"preach peace to them which were afar off, and to them that were nigh,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians

what He says, viz.,
that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"whatsoever His disciples
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever they shall loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew

the tabernacle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is a repetition of
the same statement, except that what had been said of Aaron only is now also
ascribed to Moses, <i>i.e.,</i> that he blessed the people, but for a different
reason, for although he was God's prophet, yet Aaron, in right of his office,
was the only mediator. What follows, "the glory of the Lord appeared," may be
read separately, viz., that the majesty of God was manifested in some
conspicuous sign; or else it is connected with the concluding verse, where it is
said, that "there came a fire out from before the Lord, etc." If we prefer the
latter, the account of the consuming of the sacrifice was added expositively, as
if it were said that God appeared when He sent forth the fire to consume the
sacrifice. By this auspice, or rather miracle, God manifested that He was the
Author of the legal priesthood, so that it should be held in reverence for ever.
The same thing sometimes occurred afterwards, when in troubled circumstances, it
had need of extraordinary confirmation: thus fire consumed the sacrifice of
Manoah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;071320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
13:20;) or, when God's service and pure religion required to be vindicated in
opposition to superstitious counterfeits; thus the sacrifice of Elijah was
utterly consumed and reduced to ashes without the application of fire.

Kings 18:38.) Or, lastly, when God would shew that He delighted in Mount Sion,
which He had chosen for His resting-place and home: for which reason, the first
sacrifice of Solomon was consumed by fire from heaven. (2 Chronicles

them.	<b>21.</b> Et purificaverunt sese Levitae, laveruntque vestimenta sua et

now inaugurated for the performance of their duties, but in their proper order,
because their condition was inferior. Here it must be noted that the sons of
Moses and their descendants were placed in this lower rank, and excluded from
all expectation of the priesthood. Hence the ingratitude of the whole people,
and especially of the tribe of Levi, was all the more base, when they
presumptuously sought the honor from which Moses had shut out his children for
ever. It was then no ordinary act of obedience in him to execute what God had
appointed respecting the Levites. Aaron is here mentioned, because he
consecrated the Levites in right of his priesthood. As regards the people, their
consent is merely commended, because they agreed to what was the pleasure of
God. But this virtue in them only increased their ignominy afterwards, when they
sought to overthrow that divine decree of which they had
approved.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.

We have already spoken of the washing, for since it was required of all private
individuals, much less would it be allowable for the Levites to handle the
sacred things, unless they were first purified. But what follows as to their
presentation by the hands of Aaron, was a shadowing forth by symbol of the
truth, which at length shone out at the coming of Christ; for it had been of old
predicted by the Prophets, that, in the renovation of the Church, those who had
hitherto been but of the multitude should become Levites. Therefore, by this
figure, God would declare that none even of His elect servants would be approved
of and accepted by Him, unless sanctified by the one
Priest.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

words Moses signifies that, in the type, nothing was omitted relative to the
ancient priesthood which pertains to the legitimate service of God, the main
point in which is obedience, and thence the purity which flows from it. The
Levites are said to have done their service before Aaron, because they humbly
submitted themselves to the yoke, and allowed themselves to be controlled by the
will of the priest, since God had so enjoined. But the progress of the history
will presently shew how prone man's nature is to rebellion. Hence it arises that
the end does not always correspond with the beginning, but that sad and unhappy
conclusions sometimes follow successful commencements.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons
of Aaron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> A memorable circumstance is
here recorded, from whence it appears how greatly God abominates all the sins
whereby the purity of religion is corrupted. Apparently it was a light
transgression to use strange fire for burning incense; and again their
thoughtlessness would seem excusable, for certainly Nadab and Abihu did not
wantonly or intentionally desire to pollute the sacred things, but, as is often
the case in matters of novelty, when they were setting about them too eagerly,
their precipitancy led them into error. The severity of the punishment,
therefore, would not please those arrogant people, who do not hesitate
superciliously to criticise God's judgments; but if we reflect how holy a thing
God's worship is, the enormity of the punishment will by no means offend us.
Besides, it was necessary that their religion should be sanctioned at its very
commencement; for if God had suffered the sons of Aaron to transgress with
impunity, they would have afterwards carelessly neglected the whole Law. This,
therefore, was the reason of such great severity, that the priests should
anxiously watch against all profanation. Their crime is specified, viz., that
they offered incense in a different way from that which God had prescribed, and
consequently, although they may have erred from ignorance, still they were
convicted by God's commandment of having negligently set about what was worthy
of greater attention. The "strange fire" is distinguished from the sacred fire
which was always burning upon the altar: not miraculously, as some pretend, but
by the constant watchfulness of the priests. Now, God had forbidden any other
fire to be used in the ordinances, in order to exclude all extraneous rites, and
to shew His detestation of whatever might be derived from elsewhere. Let us
learn, therefore, so to attend to God's command as not to corrupt His worship by
any strange inventions. But if He so severely avenged this error, how horrible a
punishment awaits the Papists, who are not ashamed obstinately to defend so many
gross corruptions!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Moses said unto Aaron,
This is it that the Lord spake</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses
restrains his brother from giving way to excessive grief; for this was a very
bitter stroke after their recent joy to see himself at once deprived of two sons
on the same day, and at the same moment, he might, too, have been disposed to
murmur against God for the cause of their death. Lest, therefore, He should give
way to such want of self-control, Moses reminds him that he must submit to the
just judgment of God. We shall, however, seek in vain for what is here referred
to,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f417</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> "I will be glorified in them that come
nigh me." He had often threatened the priests witlt death if they departed in
the least degree from the prescribed rule: He had often set before them the
sacredness of their office, lest they should defile themselves by any
sacrilegious act; in a word, He had chosen them to be His ministers in holy
things, on the condition that they should know themselves to be subject to
greater guilt and punishment than the rest of the people. By this consolation,
then, Aaron's grief is quieted, that God had not dealt cruelly with his sons,
but had shewn forth in them a just and profitable example, in order that their
successors might be more attentive in their duties; for thus should the sentence
be paraphrased: In order that I may be glorified before the whole people, I must
be sanctified by those of the highest degree and consequence; or, When I shall
have been sanctified by the priests themselves, whose dignity is the highest, my
glory will shine forth before the whole people. And, in point of fact, although
God may punish whole bodies of obscure persons, such lessons have but little
effect; but the punishment of men of more noble and illustrious condition draws
almost all eyes to the judgments of God. For God is said to be sanctified in us
in many ways, whether He shews Himself to be a pitiful or a severe Judge. This
declaration, then, is an exhortation to those whom he has dignified with
peculiar honor, to walk in fear and trembling; for, since "judgment begins at
the house of God," the greater are the gifts and the higher the pre-eminence is
with which any one is blessed, the greater is his obligation to God, and his
ingratitude worthy of severer punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b><i>.</i> <i>.</i> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Aaron

Aaron to be applauded, whereby he confessed that his sons were slain by the just
judgment of God; for Moses indicates that he yielded to his admonition, and was
thus restrained from complaining against. God. Thus Paul teaches us that
Scripture is given to teach us patience.

should carry</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f418</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> forth the corpses, Moses commanded these
others to anticipate them. It may also have been the case that all were
stupified by terror. He forbids the father and brothers to mourn their death,
not so much in accordance with the law, whereby all except the high priest were
permitted to mourn for their own brother, as to prevent this memorable lesson
from being obscured by their grief, since thus was the sanctity of their
religion magnificently asserted. Nevertheless, God allowed the dead men to be
bewailed by the people, lest the recollection of their punishment should too
soon be lost.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he forbids
(Aaron</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f419</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and his sons) to go out from the door of
the tabernacle, he does not mean so to fix them to that place as to banish them
from their own private tents, but he withholds them from all pollution which
might have compelled them to desert or interrupt their
duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses spake unto Aaron,
and unto Eleazar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Lest hereafter the
priests should transgress through ignorance, Moses admonishes them of their
duty; and perhaps he was moved by some immediate reason to give these particular
injunctions rather than any others. As yet they were but little practiced in the
observance of the rites; and what had happened to their brethren must have
rendered them anxious. Now, this consternation at the death of their brethren
might have so confounded their senses, that they could not apply themselves with
so much composure as they ought to the service of God; and thus the offering
would have been improperly made. Lest, therefore, their grief should so disturb
them as to prevent the due performance of their office, he commands them to eat
what remained of the meat-offering with the burnt-sacrifices. Whence we gather
that he endeavored to prevent them from transgressing on that day in consequence
of their minds being occupied by their recent grief. And in order to induce them
to obedience, he sets before them the authority of God, to which it was fitting
that the priesthood should be subject, as being founded upon
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses diligently sought
the goat of the sin-offering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses had
not omitted to tell them what was to be done with the goat; and the sacrifice
which he had himself performed, was a visible instruction to them. He had set
before them what they should imitate, and this would have been enough even for
children. But, as I have said, in such serious matters Moses had not spared
labor and care, whereas the sons of Aaron, as if they had neither heard nor seen
anything of the sort, pervert the whole order of them, although they had been
just before reminded that they had been appointed to keep the charge of God.
Perhaps they were impelled to this error by the trouble arising from their
grief; but we gather from hence that however exquisite may be the ability of
masters and teachers, it may be often fruitless unless they have obedient
scholars with retentive memories. And hence also we learn that when God often
inculcates the same thing, His labor is not superfluous, because we do not
understand what we seem to understand; or what has been clearly shewn to us soon
afterwards escapes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Further from the anger of
Moses, which is mentioned in his praise, we may infer that the transgression was
no light one, although it was not so severely punished as the presumption of
Nadab and Abihu. The excuse which some make for them, or allege in extenuation
of their crime, that they thought they were deprived of the right before
accorded to them, and therefore abstained through modesty, is refuted by the
answer of Aaron himself. It was, therefore, grief alone which impelled them to
this error. But the reason why God was more merciful to them than to their
brethren, is only known to Himself. Conjectures may, indeed, be advanced; but at
last we must come to this, that because God's judgments are hidden, they are not
therefore unjust; but that we must humbly adore their depth into which the minds
of men cannot penetrate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Aaron said unto Moses,
Behold, this day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Aaron replies that it
arose from pious fear that they had not feasted before God, because they would
in a manner have defiled the sanctuary by their tears and melancholy, as if he
had said, Part indeed of the sin-offering was reserved for our food, but we
could not properly partake of it except in cheerfulness and with thanksgiving.
The grief arising from his sudden bereavement did not allow of this; but it was
not a just defense; for he ought rather to have striven against the feelings of
the flesh, so that his domestic calamity should not withhold him from the
service of God. But, inasmuch as in his perplexity his fear was deserving of
pity, Moses forgives him; and it is said that he was appeased, because he finds
less of evil than he supposed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto Moses
in the wilderness of Sinai</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Although
this is the first numbering of the people, of which we have an account, still,
inasmuch as God had already imposed a tax upon every person, the amount of which
has been recorded, we infer that it was in fact the second. But the reason for
thus numbering the people a second time was, because they were very soon about
to remove their camp from the wilderness of Sinai to take posession of the
promised land. Since, however, their impiety withheld thmn from doing so, there
was a third <i>census</i> taken just before their actual entrance into the land,
and with this object, that it might be obvious, on comparison, how marvellously
the people had been preserved by the springing up of a new generation, in spite
of so many plagues and so much slaughter; for although a great proportion of
them had been cut off, almost as many persons were found as
before.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Further, it must be observed, that the
people were not numbered except at God's command, in order that He might thus
assert His supreme dominion over them; and also, that the mode of taking the
<i>census</i> was so arranged, that there should be no confusion of ranks either
through fraud or irregularity; for this was the reason why each tribe had its
superintendents, lest any one should slip into a tribe to which he did not
belong; and this is expressly mentioned by way of assurance, since otherwise
many might suspect that so great a multitude could hardly be distinguished into
classes with certainty, so that the whole sum should be calculated without
mistake.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Reuben,
Israel's eldest son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> If any disputatious
person should contend that one family could not increase in 250 years to so
great an amount, and thus should reject as nebulous what surpasses the ordinary
rule of nature, we must bear in mind what I have already stated, that, inasmuch
as this increase depended on the power of God, nothing is more absurd than to
measure it by ordinary rules. For the intention of the Spirit is to represent to
our eyes the incredible power of God in a conspicuous and signal miracle.
Meanwhile, if you compared the tribe of Reuben with some of the others, it
presents in its numbers some marks of the curse, so that we may gather that
Reuben was degraded from the honors of his primogeniture; for the tribes of
Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were more numerous, whilst from
Joseph alone, who was one of the youngest, a posterity descended which almost
doubled it in numbers. God's blessing, however, is most conspicuous in the tribe
of Judah, in correspondence with the prophecy of Jacob; for by this prerogative,
as it were, it was already called to the right of primogeniture and to
supremacy, inasmuch as it surpassed all the principal
ones.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>47.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Levites, after the
tribe of their fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We shall indeed
hereafter see that they also were numbered, but Moses means that they were not
included in the general <i>census</i> of the people, because God had chosen them
to be His own property, and thus had severed them from the rest of the people.
He writes, therefore, that they "were not numbered in the midst of the
others,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f420</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>i.e.,</i> so as promiscuously to form
a part of the multitude. Now, lest any one should object that Moses acted
ambitiously in thus bestowing on his own tribe extraordinary distinction, he
declares that he did not do this spontaneously, but that it was at God's bidding
that the Levites had a separate class assigned to them; for translators render
this passage amiss, "And God said to
Moses,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f421</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if he stated that the tribe of Levi
was then first set apart when the sum of the people was taken, since it would
have been absurd to omit a part, unless God's will had been already declared.
Moses, therefore, shews why he passed over his own tribe, via, because God had
consecrated the Levites for the keeping and service of the tabernacle. Now, if
it was not lawful for the tabernacle to be carried or set up by all persons
indiscriminately, its sanctity was enforced by this symbol; for religion would
not have been held in so much reverence, if it had been allowable for all
without distinction to meddle with the sacred things. Meanwhile, the Israelites
were reminded that all without, exception were unworthy to present themselves
before God, when they were forbidden from access to the sanctuary; whereas the
dignity which was conferred upon a single tribe was no ground for boasting,
since it depended merely on the good pleasure of God. God, then, gave the
Levites access to His tabernacle, not because they had deserved that honor by
any virtue of their own, but in order to afford a testimony of His gratuitous
favor. At the same time, under this image He represented the future priesthood
of Christ, in order that believers might be assured that the Mediator, by whom
others might have access to God, was to be of the human race; and therefore God
declares by Isaiah that He would take the Levites under the kingdom of Christ
from the general and dispersed body of the people.

not exactly observe the order of time in the chapter from which this passage is
taken, since he deemed it sufficient to collect here and there what was required
to complete his general exhortation. The object indeed of the recital of this
history was, lest any should attempt to overthrow God's invioable decree in
their pride and audacity; and therefore, in order that the dignity of the tribe
of Levi may not beget envy, he testifies that God is its author. The clause,
"unto this day," seems to refer to those instances in which God had manifested
His favor towards the Levites, lest any similar rivalry should hereafter arise.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses, and unto Aaron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This distribution
into separate bands must have served to prevent contention; for, had not God
thus assigned to each their proper position, so natural is ambition to man, that
they would have quarrelled for the place of honor. It would have been grievous
to the family of Reuben, the first-born, to resign his dignity; and, even if
they had patiently submitted to the punishment inflicted upon them, they would
have been made to take the lowest place, as being condemned to ignominy.
Disputes would also have arisen respecting the children of the concubines, for
they would not have thought it consistent that; those who sprang from Leah and
Rachel should yield them the superior place. Besides, in proportion as they
severally had the advantage in numbers, they would have thought themselves
injured unless they preceded others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus the
children of Simeon would never have suffered themselves to be ranged under the
standard of Reuben. Again, dispute would also have arisen between the children
of Ephraim and Manasseh. God, therefore, at once put a stop to all these
disturbances by so arranging their ranks that each one knew his own band.
Consequently, Judah, although the fourth son of Leah, received the first
standard as an honorable distinction, that he might thus in a manner begin to
fulfill the prophecy of Jacob by anticipation; and two tribes were united with
him which would willingly submit to his rule, Issachar and Zebuhm; because they
derived their origin from the children of
the</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f422</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> handmaid whom Leah had substituted in
her own place.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although Reuben had been deprived
of his primogeniture, still, that some consolation might remain for his
posterity, he was set over the second standard; two tribes were associated with
him, which on account of their connection would not be aggrieved at fighting
under his command, the tribe of Simeon his uterine brother, and the tribe of
Gad, which also sprang from the handmaid of
Leah.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was necessary that God should interpose
His authorify, in order that two tribes should be formed of a single head,
Joseph; otherwise the fact would have led to contention, because the inequality
was odious in itself, and that family might appear to be elevated not without
disgrace to the others. Besides, the children of Manasseh, who were superior by
the law of nature, would never have been induced to obey, unless a divine decree
had interposed. But thtat division could not have been better formed than of the
sons of Rachel, because their consanguinity was closer; for a sharp contest
might also have arisen for the leadership of the fourth band, because it was
unjust that the son of a handmaid should have been placed at its head, and thus
preferred to a legitimate son of Leah, and to the other son of Rachel,
especially when Benjamin was so singularly beloved by Jacob, the common father
of them all.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f423</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The sole will of God, indeed, was
sufficient, and more than sufficient to prevent all quarrels; but, inasmuch as
He chose rather to rule over them generously and paternally, than in a despotic
manner, He rather conformed Himself to their wishes than drove them by
compulsion. Still, however, because their contentions could not be prevented by
mere human decisions, it is again said at the end of the chapter that Moses did
nothing except by God's command. At the same time the obedience of the people is
noticed in that they peaceably obeyed Moses, since thus they ratified their
acknowledgment of Moses as a true and faithful minister of God; for this
submissiveness is the inseparable companion of sincere piety towards God, that
whatever is proposed by His approved ministers the people should reverently
accept.</font><br></div>

Kohath, Gershon, and Merari, from whom many families afterwards descended. It
must, however, be observed, that all were numbered down to the youngest infants,
whereas of the rest of the people only those who had passed their twentieth year
were taken into account; whence it appeared that this was the smallest tribe;
but by causing the infants to be reckoned, God intended to maintain a just
proportion, as we shall see; for, if He had only taken them above their
twentieth year, it would not have been known how many first-born there were, and
thus the compensation to be made for them would have been uncertain. By this
indulgence the people should have been induced to pay the tribute for the
surplus with more readiness; for since, after the computation was made, it
appeared how much their number came short of the required amount, God justly
willed that those should be redeemed for money, who would else have been
transferred to that tribe which represented the first-born, and it would have
been an act of malignity to refuse God what he demanded, when He had
spontaneously condescended to so just a compact. There was also another reason
why the Levites were included in the <i>census</i> from their earliest
childhood, rather than the others, viz., because it was not necessary that they
should be fit for war, when God enrolled from the rest of the people soldiers
for Himself who might afterwards bear
arms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these were the sons of
Levi by their names</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Hence it appears
that the tribe of Levi, like the others, had made an astonishing progress from a
small and contemptible beginning; for whereas he himself had only begotten three
sons, Gershon and Merari only two each, and Kohath four; who would have expected
such an increase, that twelve men in so short a time should have grown into so
many thousands? But thus powerfully does God work under the semblance of
weakness, that thus His glory may be the more conspicuous. But that He promoted
the family of Kohath above the others, not only in the priesthood of Aaron, but
also in their common ministry, proceeded from the same source of His gratuitous
good pleasure, as the calling of Moses. He then, who had dignified also by so
honorable an office, was, for his sake, gracious also to the family of Kohath.
Neverthless, lost he should be suspected of ambition, or lest occasion of
calumny should be given to the ungodly, God chose that the sons of Moses should
remain in the ordinary station of the
Levites.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>45.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take the Levites instead of
all the first-born</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The compensation of
which I have spoken follows; for, since the complete portion of God was not
found in the tribe of Levi, it must needs be supplied from elsewhere. Since,
then, the Levites, infants as well as men, were less by two hundred and
seventy-three than the first-born of the twelve tribes of Israel, God required
that five shekels of the sanctuary should be paid for every head. We have
elsewhere seen that the shekel of the sanctuary was double, amounting to two
ordinary<b> </b>ones.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto Moses
and unto Aaron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This <i>census</i> had a
different object from the former one, which we have just been considering, viz.,
that an equal distribution of the charges should be made in proportion to the
number of the individuals. First, as regarded age, a distinction must be
observed between this tribe and the others; for we have already seen that all
the Israelites above twenty years of age were numbered, because they were then
fit to bear arms. But it was not without reason that a more mature age was
required in the case of the Levites, so that they should not begin to discharge
their ministry before their thirtieth year. For not only is strength and rigor
of body requisite for spiritual warfare, but seriousness and gravity also. If
they had been admitted in their youth, their levity might have detracted from
the reverence due to sacred things, since the young are often led to act
intemperately by their fervor and licentiousness. Access to the sanctuary,
therefore, was not permitted them till they had grown up to be men; for by their
thirtieth year men ought to have become so staid, as that it shall be base and
inexcusable for them to give way to the wantonness of
youth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From their fiftieth year they were
released from their duties; since sloth and inactivity generally accompany old
age. The case is different as to war, because we find many who are vigorous
after their fiftieth year. Furthermore, since religion is more precious than all
earthly affairs, diligent care was to be taken lest it should fall into
disesteem on account of the idleness and somnolency of its
ministers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron and the
chief of the congregation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Another
exception is subjoined, viz., that none should be received unless they were free
from all defect and blemish; for we have seen elsewhere that those, who were
blind and lame, or defective in any part of their body, were excluded from the
tabernacle, lest their disfigurement should produce contempt; and also that they
might be admonished by this external sign, to preserve themselves more
diligently from all spiritual defilement. Therefore, those are said to enter
into the sanctuary who are fit to exercise the priesthood; and hence the
expression, "for the
service,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

added.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Inasmuch as the inequality (of their
charges) might have been the source of envy, God's authority is asserted at the

and that he distributed the offices among them according to God's
command.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass on the
twentieth day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Moses records that after
leaving Mount Sinai, the camp was first pitched in the wilderness of Paran; and
although the distance was not great, &#8212; being, as we shall soon see, a
three days' journey, &#8212; still the fatigue was sufficient to harass and
weary the people. It is mentioned in praise of their obedience that they were
expeditious in setting forth "according to the commandment of God;" but
presently, through failure of the spirit of perseverance, their levity and
inconstancy betrayed itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When it is said
that "they journeyed by their journeyings," <i>(profectos</i> <i>esse</i>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the first place went the
standard of the camp</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The actual order
of march is here described. The whole people, with the exception of the Levites,
is divided into four hosts, or parts, since four of the tribes were set over the
others, so as to have two under the command of each. And this was the mode of
proceeding, that whenever they halted anywhere, the four standards encompassed
the sanctuary and the Ark of the Covenant from the four quarters of the world;
whilst on the march, the Levites carrying the tabernacle, according to the
burdens respectively imposed upon them, were mixed with the several bands. The
Ark, borne upon the shoulders of the Levites, preceded the whole army, in order
that all might more confidently follow, God thus manifestly shewing them the
way. Nahshon, of the tribe of Judah, led the first host; Elizur, of the tribe of
Reuben, the second; Elishama, of the tribe of Ephraim, the third; and Ahiezer,
of the tribe of Dan, the fourth. It is obvious that in the precedency given to
the tribe of Judah, God in some degree afforded an anticipation of the prophecy
of Jacob; for the Reubenites, being descended from the first-born, would not
have willingly abandoned their position, unless that right had been transferred
to the tribe of Judah by God's decree, pronounced through the mouth of Jacob.
Not that the sovereignty and royal power was actually his before the time of
David, but because God would have a single spark to shine in the midst of the
thick darkness, whereby He might cherish the hope of the promised salvation in
every heart; and that thus the dignity of this tribe might at length more
readily reduce all to obedience. Herein, however, it appeared how perverse and
intractable was the spirit of that greater portion of them who strove against
the divine decree in their rejection of
David.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Reuben occupied the second place, as an
alleviation of his disgrace. Again, by the subjection of the tribe of Manasseh
to the posterity of Ephraim, in this respect, too, the prophecy of the same
patriarch was fulfilled. Nor does there seem to be any other reason why the
fourth standard should have been given to the tribe of Dan, except because Jacob
had declared, "Dan shall judge his people."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:16,) by which expression his pre-eminence was
denoted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although it may be that the four
standard-bearing tribes were chosen from their strength and the numbers of their
people, still, unless the children of Reuben and Manasseh had been thoroughly
persuaded that their degradation was in accordance with the command of God,
their jealousy would never have suffered them calmly to submit themselves to
others, whose superiors they were by the ordinary rules of nature. Their
self-restraint, therefore, was praiseworthy, in that voluntary subjection kept
them within bounds, without the application of any power of compulsion; and at
the end, Moses records that it was not once only that they thus advanced, but
that they observed the same order and regulations during the whole course of
their travel, and that their camp was always so arranged that no contention
arose to disturb them.</font><br></div>

piety, whereby it is enacted that the children should either nourish their
parents or else lie fast lettered in prison. This law many men do carelessly
neglect, which the stork alone, among all living creatures, doth keep most
precisely. For other creatures do hard, and scarcely know or look upon their
parents, if peradventure they need their aid to nourish them; whereas the stork
doth mutually nourish them, being stricken in age, and bear them on her
shoulders, when for feebleness they cannot fly." &#8212; Bullinger's Second
Decade, Serm. 5, Parker Society's edit., vol. 1. p. 272. See also Hooper's Early

"Erubescat error vester Christianis, qui ne animalium quidem sanguinem in epulis
esculentas habemus, qui propterea quoque suffocatis et morticinis abstinemus, ne
quo modo sanguine contaminemur, vel intra viscera sepulto." See Bingham, book 17
ch. 5 sec. 20 "But on the other hand, because it was the custom of the Catholic
Church, almost to the time of St. Austin, to abstain from eating of blood, in
compliance with the rule given by the Apostles to the Gentile converts;
therefore, by the most ancient laws of the Church, all clergymen were obliged to
abstain from it under pain of degradation. This is evident from the Apostolical
Canons, and those of Gangra, and the second Council of Orleans, and the Council
of Trullo. But as this was looked upon by some only as a temporary injunction,
so it appears from St. Austin that it was of no force in the African Church.

This is the earliest account we have of the <i>Lex</i> <i>Talionis</i>, or law
of <i>like</i> <i>for</i> <i>like</i>, which afterwards prevailed among the
Greeks and Romans. Among the latter it constituted a part of the Twelve Tables,
so famous in antiquity; but the punishment was afterwards changed to a pecuniary
fine, to be levied at the discretion of the Praetor. It prevails less or more in
most civilized countries, and is fully acted upon in the Canon Law in reference
to all calumniators: "Clumniator, si in accusatione defecerit, talionem
recipiat." Nothing, however, of this kind was left to private revenge; the
magistrate awarded the punishment when the fact was proved. Otherwise the
<i>Lex</i> <i>Talionis</i> would have utterly destroyed the peace of society,
and have sowed the seeds of hatred, revenge, and all uncharitableness." &#8212;

that stated by Bush: "There shall be such a scarcity of bread that one ordinary

in common circumstances one oven would serve (or rather be required) for one
family." Dr. Kitto supposes that "ten families, represented by their females,
clubbed their dough together, and the produce being no more than an ordinary
supply for <i>one</i> family, it was baked in one oven instead of each family,
as usual, making a separate baking. Afterwards the cakes thus baked were
proportioned by weight to the respective contributors, so precious was the
bread. This is implied in the words, 'shall deliver you <i>your</i> bread
<i>again</i> by weight;' which shews that the bread was previously theirs, and
had been baked for them, not that it was <i>sold</i> to them by

There appears to be some oversight here. The Latin is "littus, quod planitiem
Moah respicit;" and the <i>Fr</i>. sufficiently removes any difficulty which the
latter word would present, by simply translating it "pour les jetter en la
plaine de Moab;" <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., to put them ashore <i>on</i> the plain of
Moab. Now, the only shores of the plain of Moab would be formed by the Dead Sea,
and this would, of course, be inapplicable in the circumstances referred to. The
very impossibility of crossing the desert in ships, clearly proves that the word
<i>way</i> must not be understood as indicating the line of route. Thus Holden
paraphrases the words: "Thou shalt be taken there in ships, and not by the way
in which I appeared and spake to thee;" and Dathe's translation is, "Navibus
Jova vos deportari sinet in Aegyptum, quam terram nunquam a vobis revisendam
dixerat." The wonderful fulfillment of the prophecy is thus well summed up by
Dr. Kitto: "This was accomplished on several occasions. It is related both by
Aristeas and Josephus, that in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, there were vast
numbers of Hebrew slaves in Egypt, and that the king himself bought above
100,000 of them from their masters, and set them free. Egypt, indeed, was the
great slave-mart of ancient times; and several of the conquerors and oppressors
of the Jews sent at least a portion of their captives thither to be sold. Titus
had 90,000 captives after Jerusalem was taken. Those above seventeen years of
age were sent to different parts of the Roman empire to labor on the public
works, besides great numbers who perished in compulsory combats with wild
beasts. Those under seventeen were doomed to be sold for slaves; but in such
deep contempt and detestation was the nation held, that few were willing to buy
them; and the Jews who remained at large, were too few and poor to be able to
redeem their brethren. The market was also glutted with their numbers, so that
they were sold at a mere nominal price, &#8212; sometimes thirty for a small
piece of money. Those who remained unpurchased were sent into confinement, where
they perished by hundreds and by thousands together, from neglect and hunger.
Egypt received a large proportion of these slaves, who were probably sent
thither in <i>ships</i>, as the Romans had a fleet in the Mediterranean, and
this was a much easier and safer way of transporting them than by land across
the desert. The same things precisely took place on the final desolation of
Israel by Hadrian, who may be said to have consummated their doom by decreeing,
with the concurrence of the Roman Senate, that no Jew should ever, on pain of
death, enter the land of his fathers." &#8212; Illust. Comment. <i>in</i>

All the difficulties connected with this matter are set at rest by our increased
acquaintance with Egyptian Antiquities. <i>C</i>., and almost all the earlier
commentators, were evidently possessed with the idea that the mirrors of the
women were literally <i>looking-glasses</i>; and hence arose the various
solutions which are here given, and others which might be added. Sir G.
Wilkinson, in his "Popular Account of the Ancient Egyptians," tells us; &#8212;
"One of the principal objects of the toilet was the mirror. It was of mixed
metal, chiefly copper, most carefully wrought and highly polished; and so
admirably did the Egyptians succeed in the composition of metals, that this
substitute for our modern looking-glass was susceptible of a lustre which has
even been partially revived at the present day, in some of those discovered at
Thebes, though buried in the earth for many centuries. The same kind of
metal-mirror was used by the Israelites, who doubtless brought them from Egypt."

us, that the Rabbins, wishing to excuse their forefathers, said that there came
forth a calf, not wrought by any workmen, but produced by the magical arts,
which some of the Egyptians, mixed with the people, now employed to introduce
idolatry. &#8212; <i>W</i>. Lightfoot has a characteristic note on this:
"Expositors cannot tell what to say of their intent, for they cannot think they
were such calves, (as to turn the glory of God into a calf,) and yet what else
can we say? Jonathan saith, 'The devil got into the metal, and fashioned it into
a calf.' The devil, indeed, was too much there; but it was in their fancies more
than in the metal." Explan. of divers difficult passages of Scripture. Decad, 1.

the idol was made after an Egyptian pattern: "Israel cannot be so long without
Moses, as Moses can be without meat. The fire still burneth on the top of Mount
Sinai, out of which they had so lately received the Law; and yet so suddenly do
they break the greatest commandment of that Law to extremity; &#8212; of
Egyptian jewels they make an Egyptian idol, because, thinking Moses had been
lost, they intended to return for Egypt." &#8212; A handful of gleanings out of

comprehended than the expression of St. Paul: "There is no intimation in these
words of any secret book of the Divine decrees, or of anything involving the
question of Moses' final salvation or perdition. He simply expressed the wish
rather to die than to witness the destruction of his people. The phraseology is
in allusion, probably, to the custom of having the names of a community enrolled

See <i>Lat.,</i> "Locutus autem fuerat Jehova;" but the Lord had spoken, etc.
Prof. Bush says, "The right adjustment of the events of this chapter in the
chronological order of the narrative, is a matter attended with some difficulty.
From the rendering of our established version, it would seem that what was now
said to Moses was posterior in point of time to the incidents recorded in the
close of the preceding chapter; but from an attentive consideration and
collation of the tenor of the whole, we are persuaded, with Calvin, and other
critics of note, that the proper rendering of ver. 1 is in the pluperfect, 'The
Lord <i>had</i> said,' and that the appropriate place for the interview and
incidents here related is <i>prior</i> to the order and the promise contained in
ver. 34 of chap. 32. In that verse God declares his purpose of sending his angel
before the people, and we naturally inquire how it happens that such an
assurance was necessary? Was there any danger that an angel would not be sent?
Had any intimation been given that his guidance and protecting presence would be
withdrawn? To this the correct answer undoubtedly is, that all that is related
in chap. 33 had occurred <i>anterior</i> to the promise made in chap. 32:34. God
had threatened to send Moses and the people forward without the accompanying
presence of the angel of the Shekinah, and it was only in consequence of the
fervent intercession of Moses that He was induced to retract this dread
determination. In the foregoing chapter, therefore, the historian merely, states
in a summary way the fact of his earnest prayer, and the concession made to it;
in the present, he goes back and relates minutely the train of circumstances
which preceded and led to the declaration above mentioned. In doing this he
virtually makes known to us one main ground of the urgency of his supplications.
He was afraid that God would withdraw the tokens of his visible presence. As a
punishment for the mad attempt of the people to supply themselves with a false
symbol of his presence, he was apprehensive that God might be provoked to take
from them the <i>true,</i> and hence his impassioned entreaty that He would not
visit them with so sore a
judgment."</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft362</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

tabernacle was already built, (see vol. 2, p. 143, <i>et</i> <i>seq.,)</i> are
satisfied with his reasons why it should not be the private tent of Moses.
"Wherefore, this was some peculiar tabernacle which Moses erected specially for
the service of God, as it may appear by the name of it, (for) it hath the same

<i>V.</i> Rosenmuller translates it with <i>C.</i>and the <i>LXX.,</i> "and,

the words, 'he put a vail upon his face, and so finished to speak unto the
people;' but either we may read with <i>Junius,</i>' While he had finished to
speak unto the people, he put a vail:' or rather to read it in the

face.'"</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft391</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So <i>C.</i>translates the words in his Comment. on 2 Corinthians 3:16,"and when
he <i>(i.e.,</i> Moses,) shall have turned to the Lord," and thus defends it:
"This passage has hitherto been badly rendered, for both Greek and Latin writers
have thought that the word <i>Israel</i> was to be understoon, whereas Paul is
speaking of Moses. he had said <i>that</i> <i>a</i> <i>vial</i> <i>is</i>

<i>Lord,</i> <i>the</i> <i>vial</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> <i>taken</i>

arising from the fact that the verb

may either be the third person singular subjunctive active, or the second person

The general opinion of modern commentators is, that the shekel, throughout the

which would bring its value in silver, at a rough calculation, to 2s. 6d., and
in gold to 2 Pounds sterling: though indeed it appears impossible to ascertain
either the intrinsic or relative value of the precious metals at so early a
period with anything like accuracy. The Rabbins (see Ainsworth) consider the
estimate of the golden vessels to have been made by the shekel of
silver.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft404</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

"Pource qu'elles estoyent descendues de la chambriere de Lea;" because they were

Attersoll in his Commentary on the Book of Numbers should have adopted it,
evidently following <i>C</i>.; "He (Judah) was the fourth son of Jacob by Leah,
with whom he associateth such two tribes as were in reason most likely to submit
themselves to him, inasmuch as Zebulun and Issachar were the sons of Zilpah,
Leah's maid, whom she gave to her husband, and set in her own place." I need

compounded by the express commandment of God, who joineth to Dan, Naphtali his
