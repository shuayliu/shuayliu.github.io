PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All who take delight in the Holy Scriptures are
familiarly acquainted with the writings of The Prophet Isaiah. Every variety of
taste finds in them its appropriate gratification. Lofty conceptions,
illustrated by splendid imagery, and clothed in language usually copious and
flowing, some times abrupt, but always graceful, leave no room for hesitation to
pronounce him, with Bishop Lowth, to be "the most sublime and elegant of the
Prophets of the Old Testament." He is regarded with peculiar veneration as an
honest, fearless, and able messenger of the Most High God, boldly reproving
nobles and monarchs, denouncing the judgments of Heaven against all
transgressors, and asserting the claims of the Divine law and government above
all human authority. In his Prophecies he takes a wide range, surveys those
nations which power or wealth or learning or commerce had raised to the highest
celebrity in those remote times, and describes their rise and fall, and
wonderful revolutions, so eagerly traced lay us in the page of history, as the
execution of Jehovah's counsels, and the arrangements of unerring wisdom But
chiefly does he pour out rich instruction concerning the Messiah, whose life and
sufferings, and death and glorious reign, he delineates so faithfully, and with
such thrilling interest, that he has obtained the appellation of "The
Evangelical Prophet." To the devout reader there is added a still more powerful
attraction in his seraphic piety, which, breathing throughout all his
communications, and kindling a holy flame in the hearts of the children of God,
attests the important fact, not only that in the visions of God he reached the
noblest heights of inspiration, but &#8212; which was far more valuable &#8212;
that he enjoyed habitual and intimate fellowship with <i>The Father of
Spirits.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">The period during which he
exercised the prophetical office is declared, in the inscription of his
Prophecies, to have been during the reigns of <i>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahas, and
Hezekiah, kings of Judah</i>. Beyond this general indication nothing certain can
be obtained; for dates were only beginning to attract the notice of civilized
nations, and had not yet been examined with such carefulness, or denoted with
such precision, as their importance demands. The Translator of "The Commentaries
on the Twelve Minor Prophets" (volume 1) tells us that Isaiah flourished between
810 B.C and 698 B.C. This interval of 112 years leaves a large margin, which
chronologers have filled up with considerable diversity of
views.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Assuming 763 B.C. to be the year in which
the prophetic ministry of Isaiah is believed by some to have commenced, we are
led to observe this remarkable coincidence, that about thirteen years earlier
began the Grecian or Olympic era, which opens with the First Olympiad; and about
ten years later began the Roman Era, which opens with the founding of the city
of Rome. This reminds us to glance at the contemporary history of nations unlike
in their origin and progress, and in the effects which they produced on the
human race. Historians, to whom the name of despised Palestine was scarcely
known, have traced the brilliant career of those gigantic empires by which it
was overshadowed. While amidst a long list of warriors, and poets, and orators,
and statesmen, who were supposed to have achieved a deathless fame, those
empires hastened to decay, Isaiah and his brethren the prophets were laying the
foundations of the universal dominion and glorious reign of Him
who</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><i>hath on his vesture,
and on his thigh, a name written</i>, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;661916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Revelation
19:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">During the season of highest prosperity, when the
literature of Greece and Rome, which even now exerts a powerful influence on
modern Europe, enjoyed its most exalted renown, that undisguised heathenism
which disowned the government and denied the perfections of the Most High God,
presented a humiliating contrast to those noble and affecting views of the
Divine nature and attributes and works which prevailed in the land of Jehovah.
The difference reminds us of one of the plagues of Egypt; for there was spread
over the nations a moral darkness,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a darkness which might be
felt, but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
10:21, 23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Rome was proud of having reduced that favored land to
the rank of one of her provinces, and struck medals to represent Judea sitting
under a palm-tree bewailing her captivity; but the religion of Judea, instead of
being crushed and annihilated, assumed the more lovely aspect of the religion of
Jesus, and <i>went forth conquering and to
conquer</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Many of our Author's published
Commentaries were nothing else than reports of his public
Lectures.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
f1a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Budaeus has explained the manner in which
these reports were prepared. The language was extemporaneous, and, had we not
known his prodigious command of the Latin tongue, we might have wondered at the
elegance with which he spoke on such occasions; but his slow and distinct
utterance, as Scaliger assures us, was such as to enable an expert writer to
take down the very words which Calvin used. Two or three scribes were usually
employed, and a copy, drawn out by a comparison of their manuscripts, was
submitted to the perusal of the Lecturer, who, after making, any corrections
which appeared to be necessary, attested it as a faithful record of what had
been uttered.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This Commentary has come down to
us in a still more authentic shape. Not only does the Author assert, in his
Dedication to King Edward, which was prefixed to the First Edition, that it had
been "faithfully and skillfully compiled from his
Lectures,"</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but in his Dedication to Queen Elizabeth,
prefixed to the Second Edition, he pronounces the revision to have been so
thorough and laborious, that "it ought justly to be reckoned a new work." It is
highly gratifying to find that, in the exposition of a book so important and
extensive as the prophecies of Isaiah, Calvin gave the fruits of his mature
judgment, while he was in the full vigor of his
age.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Clement Cotton translated this Commentary
into English from the French Version, in 1609. His translation, though not
altogether suitable to modern taste, is faithful, vigorous, idiomatic, and not
inelegant. To this volume is prefixed his Title-page and "Epistle Dedicatorie,"
together with a curious "Epigram," in which a physician of that period expresses
his warm admiration of the great Reformer.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In
the concluding volume of this Commentary will be given a Literal Translation Of
Calvin Latin Version, and copious Indices similar to those which have already
appeared in the other
Commentaries.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>Auchterarder,

<div><font face="Palatino">Most gracious and renowned Princes, hauing translated
out of French into our English tongue the booke of the prophecy of
<i>Isaiah</i>, interpreted and expounded by Master <i>John Calvin</i>, of
reverend memory: I humbly eraue that it may be published under your most
Princely names and protection. The reason of this my humble petition is, that
the honor of so noble a work may not be imbased by the means of my endevours.
This Prophet, by birth, was the son of <i>Amos</i>, esteemed by many to have
been brother to <i>Azarias</i> King of Judah, and Father in law to King<i>
Manasses</i>: which being so, this Prophet was by birth of the blood Royal, and
descended of the house of <i>David</i>, which for the promise of Christ to come
of him, was the most noble house of all the Kings of the earth. Being so borne,
his education could not be but Princely, and his bringing up in all good
learning, wisdom, virtue, and hollow His spiritual graces, not attained unto by
ordinary means, but inspired into hint immediately by the Spirit of God, were
excellent. This appeareth particularly in the sixth Chapter of this Prophet,
declaring that an Angel of God saith a burning coal taken from the Lords Altar,
and laid to the mouth of the Prophet, refined his lips and his tongue, that they
became pure and precious as the finest Gold The same is manifest in all the book
of his Prophecy; wherein both the light and the heat of that heavenly fire
appeareth. For he not only declared the will of God sincerely, according to the
law and testimony delivered to <i>Moses</i>, but also foreshewed the future
events of the Kingdom of <i>Judah</i>, and of all the flourishing states and
Kingdoms of his time.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He Prophecied also of the
birth of Jesus Christ, as if he had been taught by the Angel Gabriel; who
brought the annunciation and message of it to the blessed Virgin his mother. Of
his passion and death he spake, as if with the Apostle John he had stood by when
he was crucified. His resurrection he described, as if with all the Apostles he
had stood upon Mount Olive, where the Lord took the cloud of Gloria as his
heavenly Chariot to ascend and goes up to his Father. His zeal and indignation
against sin is evident every where, in his sharp reproofs of the offenses of all
estates.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Finally, the book of his Prophecy
beareth written in the head of it the names of four Kings, in whose time he
prophesied; and before whom as a vessel of gold he bare the name of God with
great honor. All which things being royal, it seemed to me most convenient that
his book should still bear in the front of it the names of Princes. And as he
foreshewed that Kings should be Fosterfathers, and Queenes Nurces of the Church
of Christ, so my desire was that his book might be published under the names and
protection of Christian Princes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, I was
led hereunto by the example of this Interpreter, whose exposition upon
<i>Isaiahs </i>prophesie I translate; namely, of <i>M. John Calvin</i>, a man in
his time of excellent piety and learning; and one of the great lights, whereby
it hath pleased God both to chase away the errors of popery, as the darkness of
the shadow of death; and to cause his marvelous and comfortable light of the
Gospel to shine unto this present age. For he dedicated his first exposition of
this book to the young Prince, King <i>Edward</i> the sixth, of famous memory,
for the princely graces, for the zealous love of true religion, and of al
heroical virtues, wherewith in his young years he raised an admirable
expectation of future glory, if his precious life had long continued. He was
also most worthily renowned with highest glory, for that gracious reformation in
religion, which was established by his regal authority, and which our English
Church at this day with great comfort doth enjoy, under the happy government of
our Sovereign Lord the King, your most noble and renowned
Father.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, the same Author setting out
again this Commentary, amplified and enlarged, he dedicated this second edition
to our late most gracious Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, worthy of eternal memory in
this Kingdom, for the reestablishing (after a few years alteration) of the
zealous reformation of her most virtuous brother. Which example hath led me in
most humble manner to seek for the same work, the high patronage and protection
of such Princes, like those to whom he presented this his
service.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To whom I know none so like as your
selves, both in regard of your high estate, and also in like most noble descent
from the united houses of Yorke and Lancaster. Besides which resemblance, your
Highness also is of like years to the young Prince King <i>Edward</i>, and in
the eyes of all the kingdom, of like hope of excellent virtue and zealous
proceedings in the advancement of Christian
religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In like manner your Grace resembleth
the most gracious late Queen <i>Elizabeth,</i> both in her royal name, and also
in the constant expectation of all men, to express in time all the princely
virtues and graces that shined in that most renowned Princess, from this Western
part of the world, to the furthest East, and to the rising of the
Sun.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In which respects, esteeming such a
dedication, most like that which my author made of his own work, I have most
humbly craved that this my translation of it might bee vouchsafed the honor to
have your Princely names written in the beginning of it. For notwithstanding the
great difference that is between a reverend learned writer and expounded of the
holy Scriptures, and the translator of such all expositions yet this mean
service hath also his good use in the Church of God; and is of long and tedious
labor to such as take pains therein; which being graciously accepted, may
encourage others to travel in this kind, and cause many to give thanks to God
for you both, by whose most princely favors and protection, they are made
partakers of such worthy writings. And I shall always pray Almighty God, with
this new year, to multiply many more upon you, and daily replenish your hearts
with all princely and heroical graces, that may enable and adorn Princes of so
his estates, amongst this people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Your Highness,
and Graces most humbly devoted, in all loyal and dutiful
Affection,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>Clement

QUEEN OF ENGLAND ETC.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Although, in making improvements on this Commentary,
I have bestowed so much care and industry, most noble Queen, that it ought
justly to be reckoned a new work, yet, as in the first edition it was dedicated
to your brother King Edward, who, though a youth, greatly excelled the men of
his age, and whom I wish to be held in remembrance by posterity, as he deserves,
I had intended to make no change in that dedication. But since, amidst that
wretched and lamentable dispersion of the Church and oppression of pure
doctrine, which raged with prodigious violence for a short period, this book,
together with the whole doctrine of true godliness, was banished from England
for a time, but now, I trust, favored by your happy reign, will be restored to
its former privileges, I thought that there would be no impropriety if to the
name of a most excellent king I should join your own name, which is regarded by
all good men with not less esteem and satisfaction. Not only was an opportunity
offered, but necessity appeared to demand, that I should obtain your full
protection to this Commentary, the banishment of which, I am aware, was beheld
by a great number of your godly subjects with deep
sorrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it is not so much my object to be
favored with your countenance in my personal labors, as humbly to entreat, and
by the sacred name of Christ to implore, not only that, through your kindness,
all orthodox books may again be welcomed and freely circulated in England. but
that your chief care may be directed to promote religion, which has fallen into
shameful neglect. And if this is justly demanded from all kings of the earth by
the Only-begotten Son of God, by a still more sacred tie does he hold you bound,
most noble Queen, to perform this duty; for when even you, though a king's
daughters were not exempted from that dreadful storm which fell with severity on
the heads of all the godly, by the wonderful manner in which he brought you out
safe, though not unmoved by the fear of danger, he has laid you under obligation
to devote yourself and all your exertions to his service. So far are you from
having any reason to be ashamed of this deliverance that God has given you large
and abundant grounds of boasting, by confirming you to the image of his Son, on
whom the Prophet Isaiah bestows this among other commendations, <i>that from
prison and judgment</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:8) he was raised to the loftiest height of heavenly
dominion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As it is no ordinary honor to resemble
such a model, so whenever you recollect, what ought never to be forgotten by
you, from what wretched and fearful trembling God rescued you, by openly
stretching out his hand, remember also that it was done for the express purpose
that you, on the other hand, should, with invincible determination and unshaken
firmness of mind, acknowledge your obligation to your Protector and Redeemer,
and, laying aside all other kinds of business, a vast number of which I have no
doubt, will crowd upon you at the commencement of your reign, labor to have his
worship, which for a time was basely and disgracefully corrupted in that
kingdom, restored to its former splendor. And if Satan, by presenting many and
powerful obstructions, endeavor to produce fear or slothfulness, you are well
aware from whom you ought to ask boldness to go steadily forward and to vanquish
all opposition; and God, who bestows his blessing on the actions of private
individuals, will not fail to grant a happy and desirable issue to his
work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">You ought also to be stimulated, venerable
Queen, by a sacred regard to duty; for the Prophet Isaiah demands not only from
<i>Kings</i> that they be<i> nursing-fathers</i>, but also from <i>Queens</i>
that they be <i>nursing-mothers</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:2.3.) This duty you ought to discharge, not only by removing the filth of
Popery, and by cherishing the flock which I not long ago lay trembling and
concealed, but by gathering the exiles who chose rather to part with the
advantages of their native country than to remain in it so long as godliness was
banished from it. This will be the crowning proof of your gratitude to God, and
a sacrifice of most delightful savor, that the faithful worshippers of God, who,
on account of their profession of the Gospel, were constrained to wander far and
wide through distant countries, shall now, through tour kindness, be restored to
their native country. We, too, in whom that mournful spectacle awakened, as it
ought to have done, the most poignant grief, have abundant cause for rejoicing,
and for congratulating you, when, through the gracious exercise of your royal
will we see the way opened for the return of our brethren, not only to be at
liberty to worship God in your Majesty's dominions, but to render assistance to
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And now, most noble Queen, if you shall
be graciously pleased, as I trust you will, not to disdain this testimony of my
respect for you, which some would perhaps reckon to be trivial and of little
value, I shall esteem it to be no ordinary kindness, and will endeavor through
my whole life to testify my gratitude by every means in my
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino">May the Lord guide you, most illustrious
Queen, by the Spirit of wisdom, uphold you with invincible courage, protect and
enrich your Highness with every kind of

<div><font face="Palatino">Though I acknowledge that this Commentary has been
faithfully and skillfully compiled from my Lectures, yet, as it was drawn up by
another person, I was at first afraid, most illustrious King, that if it should
appear in public bearing your name on the Dedication, I might be thought not to
have acted properly towards your Majesty. But this doubt was removed chiefly by
one consideration, that as a Prophet who was of royal descent, and a most noble
ambassador of Christ, the supreme King, is highly appropriate to your rank, so
the labor which I had bestowed on the explanation of his Prophecies would be
accepted and valued by your Majesty. His experience made him acquainted with
five kings exceedingly unlike each other in their dispositions, to whom in
uninterrupted succession he officiated as a teacher; and it is unnecessary to
inform you which of these you should chiefly select for imitation, or to exhort
you to that which you show that you are already sufficiently willing to
do.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Uzziah and Jotham were favorable to him;
though they were not so courageous as they ought to have been in maintaining the
worship of God. His chief contest was with Ahaz, not indeed as an open enemy,
but as a cunning hypocrite full of fraud and dissimulation. The servants of God
cannot have a more dangerous class of enemies. His successor, Hezekiah, not only
treated the holy man with reverence, but modestly submitted to his doctrine like
one of the common people, and, what is still more, endured patiently severe
reproof when it was found necessary. Manasseh, who was the last of them, and
whom a strongly supported Jewish tradition represents as having been his
son-in-law, subjected him to a frightful kind of torture, and wickedly put him
to death. But at the very time when he received assistance from those who were
not bad kings, and even during the reign of Hezekiah himself, who was so valiant
a supporter of godliness, he never ceased to be harassed by sharp and
troublesome disputes, and to undergo severe conflicts, so hard and uncommon is
it for men to assent to sound doctrine; and not only so, but they who resolve to
discharge the prophetical office honestly and faithfully must carry on a
continual war with the world. The more earnestly ought godly kings to labor to
aid the servants of God by their countenance, that they may not be distressed
beyond measure by the insolence of the
ungodly.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But as this virtue is excellent and
truly heroic, so, if you search the history of all ages from the beginning of
the worlds it has been uncommon, and there have been very few by whom it was
cultivated. Many have indolently and carelessly, as if it had been a matter with
which they had no concern, allowed the truth of God to be crushed without making
any resistance. But the greater part have been openly hostile, and have opposed
it with violence and rage; and would that they who at the present day profess to
be Christians were as earnest in upholding the doctrine of salvation as they are
haughty in boasting of the name!</font><br><font face="Palatino">Not to mention
others, it may justly be regarded as no ordinary consolation amidst the present
distresses of the Church, that God has raised you up and endowed you with such
excellent abilities and dispositions for defending the cause of godliness, and
that you so diligently render that obedience to God in this matter which you
know that he accepts and approves. For although the affairs of the kingdom are
hitherto conducted by your counsellors, and although your Majesty's most
illustrious uncle, the Duke of Sommerset, and many others, have religion so much
at heart, that they labor diligently, as they ought to do, in establishing it;
yet in your own exceptions you go so far beyond them all as to make it very
manifest that they receive no small excitement from the zeal which they observe
in you. Not only are you celebrated for possessing a noble disposition, and some
seeds of virtues, (which at so early an age is usually thought to be
remarkable,) but for a maturity of those virtues far beyond your years, which
would be singularly admired, as well as praised, at a very advanced age. Your
piety especially is so highly applauded, that the Prophet Isaiah, I am fully
convinced, will have one that will regard him with as much reverence, now that
he is dead, as Hezekiah did when he was
alive.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the advantage which you will derive
from the work, it is better that you learn that from your own perusal, and I
have made some observations on that subject in the Preface. There is only one
point on which I have resolved to say a few words to your Majesty. After having
proclaimed God's just complaints against an ungrateful people, and threatened
against the Jews such punishment as their base apostasy and inveterate rebellion
deserved, that the time was at hand when they should be brought into a state of
frightful desolation, the Prophet next speaks of a new and amazing restoration
of the Church, and promises that henceforth God will secure that, in spite of
enemies, it shall always be in a happy and flourishing
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such gladness and prosperity was
tasted by those who, after their return from the captivity in Babylon, having
set up their altars for sacrifices, could form the expectation of higher
blessings than those which they at that time enjoyed; just as we, by beholding
the dawn, are led to expect that the rising of the sun will soon follow. But
when, in the brightness of his Gospel, Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, arose,
all that had been so eloquently described by the revelations of the Prophet was
far exceeded by the event. Within a short time the knowledge of the true God was
spread almost throughout the whole world. Pure religion, which formerly lay
despised in Judea, as in a dark corner, was circulated through all nations and
provinces, and began to be honored in such a manner, that innumerable tongues,
in harmony of faith, called on God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Having
collected churches in various places, the Son of God erected his royal throne in
a conspicuous situation, where it might be beheld from the rising to the setting
of the sun. The churches, endowed with extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, not
only obtained prodigious communications of the divine goodness, but were
themselves striking exhibitions of astonishing power, which even the blind could
perceive. And although the Son of God reigned under the Cross, yet, amidst the
arduous conflicts of persecutions, his glory shone brighter, and his triumphs
were more splendid than if the Church had enjoyed undisturbed prosperity. At
length, the haughty loftiness of the Roman empire, yielding submission to
Christ, became a distinguished ornament of the house of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the continuance of this prosperity was
prevented by the malice and ingratitude of men; and thus the Spouse of Christ,
deprived of so costly a robe, degraded from so high a rank, and stripped of such
gorgeous raiment, was afterwards reduced to an unsightly and wretched condition.
Some remains, indeed, God preserved, as it were in places of concealment; but,
as to the external beauty of the Church, nothing but desolation, confusion, and
dispersion, was to be seen for many centuries. And we see how, at this very day,
the Roman Antichrist, far and wide usurping and tyrannizing over the sanctuary
of God, tears, crushes, and tramples under his feet all that belonged to God.
For since the purity of doctrine is there corrupted by monstrous errors, since
shocking murder has come into the room of lawful government, since the
sacraments are in part debased by gross corruptions, and in part exposed to
disgraceful sale, what but melancholy ruin is left of the true and natural
beauty of the spiritual building?</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet in our
age, contrary to the expectation of all, the Lord hath again begun to raise up
that which was fallen,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
9:2,) that there might at least be left among us an outline of the true temple,
in which God should be worshipped with purity, and according to the requirements
of the Gospel. Some inconsiderable persons taken from the common people, have
been selected by him as his architects, to promote this work by pure doctrine.
It is, indeed, an arduous and extensive work, though Satan should give us no
annoyance. But now that he employs every expedient for breaking down the Church,
as soon as any portion of it has been erected, what wonder is it if we have
great and sorrowful toil, and make small and feeble
progress?</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, the haughty tyrants scorn
us, as if, in our endeavors to overthrow the tyranny of the Roman See we were
laboring to overturn Olympus. Those clever and ingenious men (as they imagine
themselves to be) indulge in ridiculing our perseverance, in laboring hard to
restore the condition of the Church, as if anything fixed or permanent could be
obtained. They imagine that they have so solid a foundation, and are so well
defended on all sides, that it would be as difficult to destroy Popery as to
mingle heaven and earth. But the opinions of those men are somewhat various. The
refractoriness of the world being too great to admit of being placed under any
restraint, they hold that we labor in vain when we seek to correct vices, and to
promote a pure and faithful administration of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The witticism of Erasmus is well known.
"Whom does Capito expect to be his tenth successor?" He could not deny that
Wolfgang Capito was a holy man, and labored with the purest motives to reform
the Church; but being convinced that it is idle for the ministers of Christ to
struggle to correct the wickedness of the world as if they were endeavoring to
cause the rivers to run in a contrary direction, Erasmus, imitating the custom
of lazy philosophers, represented all of us, in the person of one man, as
chargeable with inconsiderate zeal. But on both sides they are greatly mistaken
in not considering that, when we repair the ruins of the Church, we give our
labors to the Lord, in obedience to his laws and injunctions, and yet the
restoration of the Church is his own work. Nor is it without good reason that
this is taught in every part of Scripture, and that it is so earnestly enforced
by the Prophet Isaiah. Remembering this doctrine, therefore, and relying on the
assistance of God, let us not hesitate to undertake a work which is far beyond
our own strength and let no obstacle turn aside or discourage us, so as to
abandon our undertaking.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And here I expressly
call upon you, most excellent King, or rather, God himself addresses you by the
mouth of his servant Isaiah, charging you to proceed, to the utmost of your
ability and power, in carrying forward the restoration of the Church, which has
been so successfully begun in your kingdom. First, you daily read and hear that
this duty is enjoined on you in the kingdom over which you rule. More especially
Isaiah, as I have said, calls <i>Kings the nursing-fathers of the Church</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:2:3,) and does not permit them to withhold that assistance which her
afflicted condition demands. Nor ought your mind to be slightly affected by the
consideration, that the Prophet pronounces a. woe on all kings and nations who
refuse to give her their support. Next, your Majesty sees plainly what is
urgently demanded by the times. Though you may not have great success in your
labors, yet, knowing that this worship is acceptable to God, and is a sacrifice
of most delightful savor, you ought not to be turned aside from your purpose by
any event, however calamitous. Seeing, therefore, that God exhorts you to be
courageous, and at the same time promises success, why should you not cheerfully
obey him when he calls?</font><br><font face="Palatino">In another passage
Isaiah says, <i>Prepare the way, prepare the way for my people</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
62:10) It is well known how hopeless was the return of the captives to their
native country. Nor did this event take place at that time; but the Prophet,
beholding by the Spirit what posterity some time afterwards would actually
enjoy, lest any of the godly should be disheartened by so sad a spectacle, meets
them beforehand with the assurance that there would be no kind of obstructions
so powerful and formidable that God would not break through theta to deliver his
Church. Not less do we need at this day to be cheered by
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is of high importance, most
noble King, that you should be stimulated to activity by the consideration of
the duty enjoined on you; for Isaiah exhorts all kings and magistrates, in the
person of Cyrus, to stretch forth their hand to the Church, when in distress, to
restore her to her former condition. Yet there is this difference between your
condition and that of Cyrus, that he who was a stranger to the Lord's flock
never was expressly taught freely and willingly to come forward and undertake to
be a defender of the Church; but to you, to whom the Lord has not only given
adoption, but has likewise assigned a distinguished place among his sons, the
Prophet may be said to stretch out his hand and call you to this office. So much
the more boldly and resolutely ought you, noble King, to proceed in this
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The matter is, as I have said, full of
great difficulties; and still greater are the annoyances by which it is
attended, and the dangers in which it is involved; for Satan never ceases to
employ innumerable expedients, if in any way he may succeed in subverting or
destroying the holy temple of God; and sometimes God intends to make trial of
our steadfastness by such attacks. But if you lay it down as a settled
principle, that there is nothing which you and your most excellent Council have
hitherto undertaken, or are now performing, for restoring the condition of the
Church, which is not supported by the authority of God, you will unquestionably
feel how wonderfully he accomplishes all those things which he gives in charge
to his servants. From this happy result England will derive inestimable
advantage; and we, too, will congratulate you on your prosperity, and that of
your whole kingdom. Meanwhile, I shall aid those holy exertions by my prayers,
as it is my duty to do, since I have nothing better to offer
you.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Farewell, most illustrious King! may the
Lord prosper and preserve your Majesty for a long period, aid and guide you by
his Holy Spirit, and bless you in all things!
-Amen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Geneva, 26<i>th</i> <i>December</i>,

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">THE PREFACE TO
THE PROPHET ISAIAH</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">BY
JOHN CALVIN</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is customary to make a great number of statements
and dissertations about the office of the Prophets. But, in my opinion, the
shortest way of treating this subject is to trace the Prophets to the Law, from
which they derived their doctrine, like streams from a fountain; for they placed
it before them as their rule, so that they may be justly held and declared to be
its interpreters, who utter nothing but what is connected with the Law. Now, the
Law consists chiefly of three parts: first, the doctrine of life; secondly,
threatenings and promises; thirdly, the covenant of grace, which, being founded
on Christ, contains within itself all the special promises. As to ceremonies,
they were religious exercises which strengthened the attachment of the people to
the worship of God and to godliness, and consequently were added to the First
Table. The Prophets, therefore, enter more largely into the illustration of
doctrine, and explain more fully what is briefly stated in the Two Tables, and
lay down what the Lord chiefly requires from us. Next, the threatenings and
promises, which Moses had proclaimed in general terms, are applied by them to
their own time and minutely described. Lastly, they express more clearly what
Moses says more obscurely about Christ and his grace, and bring forward more
copious and more abundant proofs of the free
covenant.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To make this matter still more clear,
we must go a little farther back, to the Law itself, which the Lord prescribed
as a perpetual rule for the Church, to be always in the hands of men, and to be
observed by every succeeding age. Perceiving that there was danger lest an
ignorant and undisciplined nation should need something more than the doctrine
delivered by Moses, and that the nation could scarcely be restrained without the
use of a tighter rein, God forbids them to consult magicians or soothsayers,
augurs or diviners; enjoins them to be satisfied with his doctrine alone; but at
the same time he likewise adds that he will take care that there shall never be
wanting a Prophet in Israel. He does this purposely, with the view of meeting an
objection which the people might have brought forward, that their condition
would be worse than that of the infidels, all of whom had their priests of
various orders, their soothsayers, augurs, astrologers, Chaldeans, and such
like, whom they had it in their power to visit and consult, but that they would
have no one to aid them by his advice in intricate and difficult matters. In
order, therefore, to deprive them of every pretense, and to hinder them from
polluting themselves by the abominable practices of the Gentiles, God promises
that <i>he will raise up Prophets</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:15,) by whom he will make known his will, and who shall faithfully convey the
message which he has entrusted to them; so that in future there will be no
reason to complain that they are in want of anything. There is an exchange
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eJte&gt;rwsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
of the plural for the singular number, when he uses the word <i>Prophet</i>; for
although, as it is expressly interpreted by Peter,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
3:22,) that passage relates literally and chiefly to Christ, (because he is the
head of the Prophets, and all of them depend on him for their doctrine, and with
one consent point to him,) yet it relates also to the rest of the Prophets, and
includes them under a collective name.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he
promised to give them Prophets, by whom he would make known his will and
purpose, the Lord commanded the people to rely on their interpretations and
doctrine And yet it was not intended to make any addition to the Law, but to
interpret it faithfully, and to sanction its authority. Hence also, when Malachi
exhorts the people to adhere to the purity of faith and to be steadfast in the
doctrine of religion, he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Remember the law of Moses
my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb, for all Israel
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Malachi
4:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He reminds them of the Law of God alone, and enjoins
them to be satisfied with it. Does Malachi therefore mean that Prophecies should
be despised? By no means; but as the Prophecies are appendages of the Law, and
are all briefly summed up in the Law, that exhortation was sufficient; for they
who understand that summary of doctrine, and its leading points, and carefully
observe them, assuredly will not neglect the Prophecies. It would be absurd to
boast of attending to the word, were we to disregard the divine interpretations
of it; as many persons at the present day impudently boast of attending to the
word, while they cannot at all endure the godly admonitions and reproofs which
proceed from the doctrine of the word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus when
the Prophets inculcate moral duties, they bring forward nothing new, but only
explain those parts of the Law which had been misunderstood. For instance, the
people thought that they had discharged their duty admirably, when they offered
sacrifices and performed the outward services of religion; for the world
measures God by its own standard, and renders to him a carnal and counterfeited
worship. The Prophets sharply reprove this, and show that all ceremonies are of
no avail, when sincerity of heart is wanting, and that God is worshipped by
believing on him, and by actually calling on his name. This had indeed been
plainly enough declared by the Law; but it was necessary that it should be
earnestly inculcated and frequently brought to their remembrance, and likewise
that there should be an exposure of that hypocrisy with which men cloak
themselves under the guise of ceremonies. As to the Second Table, the Prophets
drew their exhortations from it, for the purpose of showing that men ought to
refrain from all injustice, violence, and deceit. All that they do, therefore,
is nothing else than keeping up the people's obedience to the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In threatenings and promises, the Prophets
have something peculiar; for what Moses had stated in general terms they
minutely describe. They have likewise visions which peculiarly belong to them,
by which the Lord revealed future events, in order to apply the promises and
threatenings to the use of the people, and to declare more fully the will of
God. Moses threatens, "God will pursue thee in battle; thou shalt be harassed by
enemies abroad and by internal quarrels at home. Thy life shall hang as it were
on a thread; thou shalt <i>tremble at the rustling of a leaf,"</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032636&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:36,) and such like. On the other hand, the Prophets say, "God will arm the
Assyrians against thee, he will call for the Egyptians by a hiss, he will raise
up the Chaldeans, Israel shall be carried into captivity, the kingdom of Israel
shall be destroyed, the enemy shall lay waste Jerusalem and burn the temple."
Similar observations might be made about the promises. Moses says, "If thou keep
the commandments, the Lord will bless thee;" and then gives a general
description of blessings. But the Prophets enter into detail. "This is the
blessing which the Lord will bestow upon thee." Again, by Moses the Lord
promises in this manner, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Though thou be scattered
and driven to the utmost parts of the world, yet will I bring thee back."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by the Prophets he says, "Though I drive thee
into Babylon, yet after seventy years will I restore
thee."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F1</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">As to the free covenant which God
established with the Patriarchs in ancient times, the Prophets are much more
distinct, and contribute more to strengthen the people's attachment to it; for
when they wish to comfort the godly, they always remind them of that covenant,
and represent to them the coming of Christ, who was both the foundation of the
covenant and the bond of the mutual relation between God and the people, and to
whom therefore the whole extent of the promises must be understood to refer.
Whoever understands this will easily learn what we ought to seek in the
Prophets, and what is the purpose of their writings; and this is all that seemed
necessary to be stated here on that
subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we may learn in what manner the
doctrine of the word should be handled, and that we ought to imitate the
Prophets, who conveyed the doctrine of the Law in such a manner as to draw from
it advises, reproofs, threatenings, and consolations, which they applied to the
present condition of the people. For although we do not daily receive a
revelation of what we are to utter as a prediction, yet it is of high importance
to us to compare the behavior of the men of our own age with the behavior of
that ancient people; and from their histories and examples we ought to make
known the judgments of God; such as, that what he formerly punished he will also
punish with equal severity in our own day, for he is always like himself. Such
wisdom let godly teachers acquire, if they would wish to handle the doctrine of
the Prophets with any good result.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So much for
the Prophets in general. To come to the Prophet Isaiah, the inscription plainly
shows who he was, and at what time he uttered those prophecies; for it mentions
the name of his father, Amoz, who is supposed to have been the brother of
Azariah, king of Judah. Hence it is evident that Isaiah was of royal descent,
and on this point all the ancients are agreed; and yet neither his birth nor his
near relationship to the king, (for the Jews assert that he was the
father-in-law of Manasseh,) could prevent him from being slain through dislike
of the word; and no greater regard was paid to him than if he had been a person
of humble rank, or had belonged to the lowest condition of
society.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The time when he prophesied is here
pointed out by mentioning the names of the kings. Some think that he began to
prophesy towards the end of the reign of King Uzziah. They found their
conjecture on the vision related in the sixth chapter, by which, Isaiah tells
us, he was confirmed in his office. But that conjecture rests on very slight
grounds, as will be shown at the proper place. From this description it plainly
appears that he prophesied during the reign of Uzziah; and on that point I
cannot entertain any doubt.</font><br><font face="Palatino">However this may be,
it is evident that, at the very least, he prophesied more than sixty-four years;
for Jotham reigned sixteen years,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121533&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:33;) Ahaz as many,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:3;) Hezekiah twenty-nine,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:2.) This amounts to sixty-one years. Add the years that he prophesied
during the reign of Uzziah, and afterwards during the reign of Manasseh, by whom
he was put to death; and there will be, at least, sixty-four years during which
Isaiah continued, without interruption, to discharge the office of a Prophet.
There is indeed a highly probable conjecture, amounting almost to certainty,
that he prophesied ten years beyond the period which has now been stated; but as
this does not clearly rest on historical proof, I shall not debate the matter
any farther.</font><br><font face="Palatino">All the servants of God ought
carefully to observe this, that they may consider how patiently they ought to
submit to their condition, how hard and difficult soever it may be, and ought
not to reckon it a disgrace that they must endure many and severe trials, while
they have before their eyes examples of such patience. It is indeed a very
severe trial when they perceive that by their manifold exertions they are doing
no good, and imagine that it would be a thousand times better to relinquish
their post than to labor so long in vain. Such examples, therefore, they ought
frequently to set before them and call to remembrance; how Isaiah, whose labors
were numerous and extensive, had little success, and how Jeremiah continued for
fifty years to cry aloud to the people, though the result was that they became
more and more rebellious, and how no difficulties could turn them aside from
their course. We, too, ought to proceed in the discharge of our duty, and
patiently to endure every kind of annoyances.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
is proper to observe also the succession of kings, who are here enumerated; for
amidst so great a diversity, it is impossible that the state of public affairs
could remain unchanged, as we know that, whenever any change takes place in a
public station, the greater part of men immediately adopt a new manner of life;
and from this source many vexations must have arisen. The unshaken firmness and
unbroken courage with which he persevered ought to excite all the sergeants of
God to imitation, that they may never bend or turn aside from the right
path.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question may arise, Was it Isaiah
himself, or some other persons that wrote this inscription to his Prophecy? Not
one of the commentators whose writings I have hitherto perused answers this
question. For my own part, though I cannot fully satisfy my mind, yet I shall
tell what I think. The Prophets, after having publicly addressed the people,
drew up a brief abstract of their discourse, and placed it on the gates of the
temple, that all might see and become more fully acquainted with the prophecy.
When it had been exposed for a sufficient number of days, it was removed by the
ministers of the temple, and placed in the Treasury, that it might remain as a
permanent record. In this way, it is probable, the books of the Prophets were
compiled; and this may be inferred from the second chapter of the book of
Habakkuk, if it be properly examined, and likewise from the eighth chapter of
this Prophecy.

8:1.) Those who have carefully and judiciously perused the Prophets will agree
with me in thinking that their discourses have not always been arranged in a
regular order, but that the roll was made up as occasion served. That these
writings have come down to us through the agency of the Priests, whose duty it
was to transmit the prophecies to posterity, (though the Priests were often the
bitterest enemies of the Prophets,) is a remarkable instance of the providence

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The vision of
Isaiah</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wzj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chazon</i>,) though it is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chazah</i>,) <i>he saw</i>, and literally is <i>a vision</i>, yet commonly
signifies <i>a prophecy</i>. For when the Scripture makes mention of special
visions which were exhibited to the prophets in a symbolical manner, when it was
the will of God that some extraordinary event should receive confirmation, in
such cases the word Tibet,
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">harm</font><font face="Palatino">,)
<i>vision</i>, is employed. Not to multiply quotations, in a passage which
relates <i>to prophecy</i> in general the writer says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of God was
precious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, because</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chazon</i>,) <i>vision, was of rare occurrence</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 3:1.) A little afterwards, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">harm</font><font face="Palatino">:
(mar-ah) is employed to denote the vision by which God revealed himself to
Samuel.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 3:13.) In distinguishing between two ordinary methods of revelation, <i>a
vision and a dream</i>, Moses speaks of <i>a vision</i>
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">harm</font><font face="Palatino">)
as the special method.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
12:6.) It is evident, however, that <i>the seer</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">harh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>haroeh</i>,) was the name formerly given to prophets,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 9:9;) but by way of excellence, because God revealed to them his counsel
in a familiar manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the
present passage, this word unquestionably denotes the certainty of the doctrine;
as if it had been said that there is nothing contained in this book which was
not made known to <i>Isaiah</i> by God himself. The derivation of the word,
therefore, deserves attention; for we learn by it that the prophets did not
speak of their own accord, or draw from their own imaginations, but that they
were enlightened by God, who opened their eyes to perceive those things which
otherwise they would not of themselves have been able to comprehend. Thus the
inscription of Isaiah recommends to us the doctrine of this book, as containing
no human reasonings, but the oracles of God, in order to convince us that it
contains nothing but what was revealed by the Spirit of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Concerning
Judah</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Were we to render it to <i>Judah</i>, it
would make little difference, for the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>al</i>) has both significations, and the meaning will still be, that
everything contained in this book belongs strictly to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah and
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For though many things are scattered
through it which relate to Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, and other cities and countries,
yet it was not necessary that those places should be expressly enumerated in the
title; for nothing more was required than to announce the principal subject, and
to explain to whom Isaiah was chiefly sent, that is, <i>to Jerusalem, and the
Jews</i>. Everything else that is contained in his prophecies may be said to
have been accidental and foreign to the
subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet it was not inconsistent with
his office to make known to other nations the calamities which should overtake
them; for in like manner Amos did not go beyond the limits of his calling, when
he did not spare the Jews, though he was not sent to them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
2:4, 5.) A still more familiar instance is found in the calling of Peter and
Paul, the former of whom was appointed to the Jews, and the latter to the
Gentiles.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:8.) And yet Peter did not rush beyond the limits of his office, by preaching
to the Gentiles; as, for example, when he went to Cornelius:
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:17:) nor did Paul, when he offered his services to the Jews, to whom he
immediately went as soon as he entered into any city.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:5; 14:l; 17:2, 10; 18:4,19.) In the same light ought we to view Isaiah; for
while he is careful to instruct the Jews, and directs his labors expressly
towards that object, he does not transgress his proper limits when he likewise
takes a passing notice of other
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah and
Jerusalem</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He takes <i>Judah</i> for the whole
nation, and <i>Jerusalem</i> for the chief city in the kingdom; for he does not
make a distinction between <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>the Jews</i>, but mentions
it, by way of eminence, (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&lt;n,</font><font face="Palatino">) as the metropolis, just as if a
prophet of the present day were to address the kingdom of France, and Paris,
which is the metropolis of the nation. And this was of great importance, that
the inhabitants of Jerusalem might not hold themselves exempted, as if they were
free from all blame, or placed above the laws on account of their high rank, and
thus might send the meaner sort of people to be instructed by homely prophets.
It is a mistake, however, to suppose that <i>Jerusalem </i>is mentioned
separately, on account of its being situated in the tribe of Benjamin; for the
half of that tribes which was subject to the posterity of David, is included
under the name of <i>Judah</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, O
heavens</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah has here imitated Moses, as all
the prophets are accustomed to do; and there cannot be a doubt that he alludes
to that illustrious Song of Moses, in which, at the very commencement, he calls
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heaven and
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to witness against the
people:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Give ear, O ye heavens,
and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
32:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is unquestionably a very severe protestation;
for it conveys this meaning, that both turn to the elements which are dumb and
devoid of feeling, because men have now no ears, or are bereft of all their
senses. The Prophet, therefore, speaks of it as an extraordinary and monstrous
thing, which ought to strike even the senseless elements with amazement. For
what could be more shocking than that the Israelites should revolt from God, who
had bestowed on them so many benefits? Those who think that by <i>heaven </i>are
meant angels, and by <i>earth</i> men, weaken too much the import of those
words, and thus destroy all their force and
majesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Almost all the commentators consider
the clause to end with the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the Lord hath
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as if the Prophet had intimated, that
as soon as the Lord opens his sacred mouth, all ought to be attentive to<i>
hear</i> his voice. And certainly this meaning has the appearance of being more
full; but the context demands that we connect the words in a different manner,
so as to make the word hear to refer, not in a general manner to any discourse
whatever, but only to the expostulation which immediately follows. The meaning
therefore is, Hear the complaint which the Lord brings forward,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have nourished and brought up
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. For he relates a prodigy, which
fills him with such horror that he is compelled to summon dead creatures as
witnesses, contrary to nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That no one may
wonder at the circumstance of his addressing dumb and lifeless objects,
experience very clearly shows that the voice of God is heard even by dumb
creatures, and that the order of nature is nothing else than the obedience which
is rendered to him by every part of the world, so that everywhere his supreme
authority shines forth; for at his bidding the elements observe the law laid
down to them, and <i>heaven and earth</i> perform their duty. The <i>earth</i>
yields her fruits; the sea flows not beyond her settled boundaries; the sun,
moon, and stars perform their Courses; the <i>heavens</i>, too, revolve at
stated periods; and all with wonderful accuracy, though they are destitute of
reason and understanding But man, endued with reason and understanding, in whose
ears and in whose heart the voice of God frequently sounds, remains unmoved,
like one bereft of his senses, and cannot bend the neck to submit to him.
Against obstinate and rebellious men shall dumb and lifeless creatures bear
testimony, so that they will one day feel that this protestation was not in
vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
nourished</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Literally it runs, <i>I have made
them great</i>;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as he is speaking about children, we
cannot obtain a better rendering than <i>I have nourished</i>, or, <i>I have
brought up</i>;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for instead of the verb, to
nourish,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the Latins employ the phrase, <i>to bring
up children</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
he afterwards mentions other benefits which he had bestowed on them in rich
abundance; as if he had said, that he not only had performed the part of a kind
father, by giving them food and the ordinary means of support, but had labored
to raise them to an honorable rank. For in every sort of kindness towards them
he had, as it were, exhausted himself, as he elsewhere reproaches
them,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">What could have been done
to my vineyard that I have not done?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
5:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A similar charge the Lord might indeed have brought
against all nations; for all of them he feeds, and on all he confers great and
multiplied benefits. But he had chosen the Israelites in a peculiar manner, had
given them a preference above others by adopting them into his family, had
treated them as his most beloved children, had tenderly cherished them in his
bosom, and, in a word, had bestowed on them every kind of
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To apply these observations to our
own times, we ought to consider whether our condition be not equal, or even
superior to that which the Jews formerly enjoyed. Their adoption into the family
of God bound them to maintain the purity of his worship. Our obligation is
twofold; for not only have we been redeemed by the blood of Christ, but he who
once redeemed us is pleased to favor us with his Gospel, and in this manner
prefers us to all those whom he still allows to remain blinded by ignorance. If
we do not acknowledge these things, how much severer punishment shall we
deserve? For the more full and abundant the grace of God which hath been poured
out on us, the higher will be the ingratitude of which it shall convict
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
revolted.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jerome translates it, <i>they have
despised</i>;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
it is plain enough, from many passages, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[&ccedil;p</font><font face="Palatino">
(pashang) means something more, namely,<i> revolt</i>. God declares, that by no
acts of kindness could they be kept in a state of obedience, that they were
utterly disaffected and estranged, like a son who leaves his father's house, and
thus makes manifest that there remains no hope of his improvement. It is indeed
a monstrous thing that children should not be obedient to their father, and to a
Father who is so kind, and who gives unceasing attention to his family. Lycurgus
refused to enact a law against ungrateful persons, because it was monstrously
unnatural not to acknowledge a benefit received. A child who is ungrateful to
his father is therefore a double monster; but a child who is ungrateful to a
kind and generous father is a threefold monster. For he employs the word
<i>children</i>, not for the purpose of treating them with respect, but in order
to exhibit that <i>revolt</i> in a more striking manner, and in more hateful
colors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The ox knoweth his
owner</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This comparison marks the more strongly
the criminality of the <i>revolt</i>; for the Lord might have compared his
people to the Gentiles; but he is still more severe when he compares them to
dumb beasts, and pronounces them to be more stupid than the beasts are. Though
beasts are destitute of reason and understanding, still they are capable of
being taught; to such an extent, at least, as to recognize those who feed them.
Since, therefore, God had not only fed this people at a stall, but had
<i>nourished</i> them with all the kindness which is wont to be exercised by a
father towards his sons, and had not only filled their bellies, but supplied
them daily with spiritual food; having perceived them to be so exceedingly
sluggish, he justly considers that they deserve to be taught in the school of
beasts, and not of men; and therefore he sends them to the oven and asses to
learn from them what is their duty. Nor ought we to wonder at this; for the
beasts frequently observe the order of nature more correctly, and display
greater kindness, than men themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Not to
multiply instances, it will be sufficient to notice that which is here mentioned
by Isaiah, that the beasts, though they are exceedingly dull and stupid, do,
notwithstanding, obey their masters and those who have the charge of them. But
if we choose to attend to other points in which they excel men, how many shall
we discover? What is the reason why scarcely any animal is cruel to its own
species, and that it recognizes in another its own likeness? What is the reason
why all animals commonly bestow so much care in rearing their young, while it
frequently happens that mothers, forgetful of the voice of nature and of
humanity, forsake their children? What is the reason why they are accustomed to
take no more meat and drink than what is sufficient for sustaining their life
and their strength, while men gorge themselves, and utterly ruin their
constitutions? In a word, What is the reason why they do not, in any respect,
transgress the laws which nature has prescribed to
them?</font><br><font face="Palatino">The papists, who are accustomed to set
aside the true meaning of the Scriptures, and to spoil all the mysteries of God
by their own fooleries, have here contrived an absurd fable; for they have
falsely alleged that the <i>oxen</i> and <i>asses </i>in the stall worshipped
Christ when he was born; by which they show themselves to be egregious asses.
(And indeed I wish that they would imitate the ass which they have invented; for
then they should be asses worshipping Christ, and not lifting up the heel
against his divine authority.) For here the Prophet does not speak of miracles,
but of the order of nature, and declares, that those who overturn that order may
be regarded as monsters. We must not contrive new miracles for the purpose of
adding to the authority of Christ; for, by mingling the false with the true,
there is danger lest both should be disbelieved; nor can there be any doubt but
that, if such a miracle had been wrought, the Evangelists would have committed
it to writing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel doth not

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which he contrasts with those beasts, is emphatic. We know how honorable it was
for the posterity of Abraham to be known by this name, which God had bestowed on
the holy patriarch, because he had vanquished the angel in wrestling.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:28.) So much the more dishonorable was it for bastard and rebellious children
to make false boasting of that honor. First, there is an implied reproof, not
only because those who do not at all resemble the holy mall do wrong in assuming
his name, but because they are ungrateful to God, from whom they had received
most valuable blessings. Secondly, there is also conveyed an indirect
comparison; for the higher their rank was in being far exalted above all other
nations, so much the greater disgrace is flow intended to be expressed by
separating them from other nations under the honorable designation of
<i>Israel</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Greek translators have added

the other hand, recognize the master by whom they are nourished, and willingly
return to the place where they have been

Though he held already reproved their crime with sufficient severity, yet, for
the purpose of exposing it still more, he adds an exclamation, by which he
expresses still more strongly his abhorrence of such base ingratitude and
wickedness. Some are of opinion that the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywh</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>hoi</i>) denotes grief; Jerome renders it <i>vae</i> (<i>Wo to</i>); but for
my part I reckon it sufficient to say that it is an exclamation, suggested
partly by astonishment, and partly by sorrow. For we burst into loud cries, when
the disgracefulness of the action is such as cannot be expressed in plain terms,
or when we want words to correspond to the depth of our grief Where we have
rendered <i>wicked nation</i>, the Greeks have translated
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aJmartwlo&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">
that is, <i>a sinner</i>; and such is likewise the rendering of the Vulgate. But
the Hebrew word denotes those who are given up to crime; and the Prophet
unquestionably charges them with abandoned
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A people laden
with iniquity</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The force of the metaphor ought
to be observed; for not only does he mean that they are sunk in their iniquity,
as in a deep mire, but he likewise brings a charge against them, that they sin,
not through mistake or thoughtlessness, as frequently happens with those who are
easily led astray, but that they follow out their rebellion with a firm purpose
of mind; as if he had said that they were the slaves of sin, or sold to act
wickedly.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a seed of
evil-doers,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means <i>a

this passage to mean, that they are declared to be unworthy of holding a place
among the children of Abraham, because they are bastards, and not related to
him; as they are elsewhere called the seed of Canaan, and are reproached with
being <i>uncircumcised</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
9:26,) as if they had been the descendants of heathens and foreigners. But it is
customary with the Hebrews to employ the phrase, "children of the good" for
"good children," a mode of expression which has been imitated by the
Greeks.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">

translators supply the word <i>themselves</i>, or, <i>their pursuits</i>. But I
reckon that degenerate is a more appropriate rendering; for the Prophet means
that they are so depraved as to be altogether unlike their parents. The four
epithets which are here bestowed by him on his nation are far from being
honorable, and are widely different from the opinion which they had formed about
themselves. For this is the manner in which we must arouse hypocrites; and the
more they flatter themselves, and the farther they are from being regulated by
the fear of God, so much the more ought we to wield against them the
thunderbolts of words. On such persons a milder form of instruction would
produce no effect, and an ordinary exhortation would not move them. It is
necessary, also, to remove that false conviction of their holiness,
righteousness, and wisdom, which they commonly employ as a disguise, and as the
ground of idle boasting.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
they have forsaken the Lord</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He assigns the
reason why he reproves them with such sharpness and severity. It is, that they
may not complain, as they are wont to do, of being treated with excessive
harshness and rigour. And first he upbraids them with that which is the source
of all evils, their revolt from God; for, as it is the highest perfection of
righteousness to <i>cleave to</i> God, agreeably to those words of Moses,
<i>Now, Israel, what doth thy God require from thee but that thou shouldst
cleave to him</i>?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so, when we have revolted from him, we
are utterly ruined. The design of the Prophet is, not to convince the Jews that
they are guilty of a single crime, but to show that they are wholly
apostates.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The following words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have provoked the Holy One
of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, whether the word be rendered
<i>provoke</i>, or <i>despise</i>, the latter of which I prefer, are undoubtedly
added in order to place their sin in a still stronger light; for it was
shamefully base to treat with contempt the favor of him who had chosen them
alone out of all the nations to be adopted into his family. This is also the
reason why he calls himself </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Holy One of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; because, by admitting them
to alliance with him, he had at the same time adorned them with his<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for wherever this name occurs it is ascribed to him on account of the effect.
What barbarous pride was there in despising so great an honor! If any one choose
rather to render the word <i>provoke</i>, the meaning will be, that they
rejected God, as if they expressly intended to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>provoke his
anger</i></font><font face="Palatino">; which shows how detestable their
apostasy is.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are gone
away backward</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning is, that when the
Lord laid down to them a fixed way and rule of living, they were hurried along
by their sinful passions; but he confirms the statement which he had just now
made, that their licentiousness was so unbridled that they utterly revolted from
God, and deliberately turned aside from that course to which their life ought to
have been directed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why should ye be stricken any
more</i>? </font><font face="Palatino">Some render it, <i>Upon what</i>? or,
<i>On what part</i>? and interpret the passage as if the Lord had said that he
had not another scourge left; because so various are the methods by which he has
attempted to bring them back to the path of duty, that no other way of
chastising them remains to be tried. But I prefer to render it <i>Why</i>?
because this corresponds to the Hebrew word, and agrees better with the context.
It is equivalent to phrases in daily use, <i>To what purpose? For what
object</i>?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
means that the Jews have proceeded to such a pitch of wickedness and crimes,
that it is impossible to believe that chastisements will do them any good; for
when desperate men have been hardened, we know that they will rather be broken
to shreds than submit to correction. He complains of their prodigious obstinacy,
like a physician who should declare that every remedy had been tried, and that
his skill was now exhausted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the same time he
charges them with extreme malice; for when ungodly men are not even humbled by
punishments, they have arrived at the very height of wickedness; as if the Lord
had said, "I see that I should do you no good if I were to chastise you;" for
although chastisements and afflictions are the remedies which God employs for
curing our vices, yet, when they are found to be of no advantage to us, we are
past hope. True, indeed, God does not on that account cease to punish us, but,
on the contrary, his wrath against us is the more enflamed; for such obstinacy
God abhors above all things else. But he justly says that his labor is lost when
he does not succeed in bringing us to repentance, and that it is useless to
apply remedies to those who cannot be cured. Thus he does not fail to double
their chastisements and afflictions, and to try the very utmost of what can be
done, and he is even compelled to take this course until he absolutely ruin and
destroy them. But in all this he does not discharge the office of a physician;
but what he laments is, that the chastisements which he inflicts will be of no
avail to his people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You will
yet grow more faithless</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> It is a confirmation
of the former statement, and therefore I separate it from the former clause,
though there are some who put them together. It is as if he had said, "Still you
will not cease to practice treachery; yea, you will add to your crimes; for I
perceive that you rush to the commission of iniquity as if you had leagued and
banded yourselves for that purpose, so that we can no longer hope that you will
slacken in your course." The design of God is to exhibit their incorrigible
disposition, that they may be left without
excuse.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The whole head is
sick.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others translate it <i>every head</i>,
and suppose that those terms denote the princes and nobles of the nation. I
rather agree with the opinion of those who render it<i> the whole</i> head; for
I consider it to be a plain comparison taken from the human body, to this
effect, that the body is so severely afflicted that there is no hope of
returning health. He points out two principal parts on which the health of the
body depends, and thus shows the extent of the disease which, he tells us, has
infected this wretched people to such a degree that they are wasting away; that
the disease exists not in a single member, or in the extremities of the body,
but that <i>the heart</i> itself has been wounded, and <i>the head</i> is
severely afflicted; in short, that the vital parts, as they are called, are so
much injured and corrupted that it is impossible to heal
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But here also commentators differ; for
some of them view this state of disease as referring to sins, and others to
punishments. Those who view it as referring to sins interpret it thus: "You are
like a rotten and stinking body, in which no part is sound or healthy. Crimes of
the worst description prevail amongst you, by the infection of which every thing
is corrupted and debased." But I choose rather to interpret it as referring to
punishments; for unquestionably God still proceeds with this complaint, that the
nation is so obstinate as to be incapable of being cured by any chastisements,
because, though it has been beaten almost to death, or at least has been maimed
and frightfully torn by repeated blows, still it is not reformed. Such too is
the import of &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the sole of the foot even
unto the head there is no soundness in it</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Here
he proceeds with the same comparison, and repeats the same statement; for
certainly those who explain the former part of the verse, as referring to
punishments, do not sufficiently consider the remaining part of the context. If
we shall admit that a nation corrupted by vices is compared to a diseased body,
what is the meaning of the words which immediately follow, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wounds have not been bound up
or mollified with ointment</i></font><font face="Palatino">? It is plain that
the Prophet speaks of afflictions by which the nation had almost wasted away,
and that he adduces this long-continued weakness as a proof of hardened
impenitence. He calls it a <i>putrifying sore</i>, from which diseased matter is
continually flowing, as if some concealed fountain were perpetually sending
forth an additional supply of venom. By this comparison he shows that the wound
is incurable, because that supply cannot be stopped. All this is prodigiously
heightened by affirming that no remedies have been applied; for the three
metaphors which he joins together &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have not been closed,
neither bound up, neither mollified with
ointment</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; have all the same meaning that
the nation, without any hope of relief, without comfort, without remedy, is
reduced to such a state of distress, that in such punishments the utmost
severity of God is openly displayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your country is
desolate</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Literally, it is <i>desolation</i>;
and thus Isaiah goes on to speak more fully and plainly of what he had already
said figuratively about chastisements, that the country has been reduced to a
frightful state of devastation: for I choose to interpret all those statements
as relating to past occurrences, because the Prophet does not threaten the
vengeance of God, but describes those heavy calamities which have already
happened. He upbraids them with indolence and stupidity in remaining unmoved by
their afflictions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Like the
destruction of strangers</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.
This is added for the sake of heightening the picture; for the opinion that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrz</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>zarim</i>) is here put for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rz</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>zerem</i>), <i>an inundation</i>, is farfetched. That word might no doubt be
applied to enemies, but it is better to take it as literally denoting
<i>foreigners</i>. The calamity is more grievous when it is brought on by men
who are unknown, and who have come from a distant country, who lay waste with
far greater recklessness and cruelty than neighboring tribes. Such men destroy
cities, burn houses, buildings, and villages, and spread desolation all around.
In short, they rush forward with barbarous ferocity, bent on murders and
conflagrations, and are more eager to inflict damage than to make gain. But
neighbors, when they have subdued a country, can retain possession of it by
having a garrison, and as soon as a revolt is attempted, or an insurrection
takes place, can send additional troops; and therefore they are not so cruel;
nor do they lay waste a country from which they hope to derive some advantage.
It is therefore no ordinary calamity, but the most shocking of all calamities,
that is here described.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought to learn
that, when God begins to punish us, if we do not repent, he does not immediately
desist, but multiplies the chastisements, and continually follows them up with
other afflictions. We ought therefore to abstain from such obstinacy, if we do
not wish to draw down upon ourselves the same punishments, or at least to
deserve the same reproach which was brought against the Jews, that though they
had received sharp warnings, and had felt the hand of God, still they could not
be corrected or reformed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, we ought not
to wonder that we are visited with so great an amount and variety of
afflictions, of which we see no end or limit, for by our obstinacy we fight with
God and with his stripes. It must therefore happen with us as with wincing and
unruly horses, which, the more obstinate and refractory they are, have the whip
and spur applied to them with greater severity. In the present day there are
many who almost accuse God of cruelty, as if he always treated us with
harshness, and as if he ought to chastise us more gently; but they do not take
into account our shocking crimes. If those crimes were duly weighed by them,
they would assuredly acknowledge that, amidst the utmost severity, the
forbearance of God is wonderful; and that we may not think that in this case the
Lord was too severe, we must take into consideration the vices which he
afterwards enumerates.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here an objection will be
started. Why does Isaiah declare that the nation endured such a variety of
afflictions, while we have already mentioned that he began to prophesy under
Uzziah,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
during whose reign the kingdom of Judah was in a prosperous condition?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 26:5-1 a.) For although, towards the end of his life, the kingdom of
Israel met with some disasters, still this did not affect the kingdom of Judah.
Accordingly, the Jews think that these words relate to the reign of Jotham,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:32,) and not of Uzziah. Their opinion appears at first sight to have
little weight; and yet, when the whole matter is examined, it is not destitute
of probability; for we know that the prophets did not always attend to
chronological arrangement in collecting their prophecies; and it is possible
that this discourse of Isaiah was placed first in order for no other reason but
because it contains a summary view of that doctrine which is afterwards to be
delivered.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others think that they can easily get
rid of the difficulty by interpreting the whole passage as a description of
vice, and not of punishments; but what is said about the burning of cities and
about the desolation of the country cannot easily be disposed of in that manner.
If it is supposed that the Prophet speaks of the future and not the present
condition of that kingdom, and that in the name of God he foretells approaching
calamities, though they did not behold them with their eyes, I do not greatly
object to that view, though it is probable that he treats of events which were
known to them. It is a real narrative, and not a prediction, though in the next
verse I acknowledge he announces the approaching
result.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

</font><font face="Palatino">He alludes to a custom which exists in France, that
the vinekeepers rear <i>a cottage</i> for themselves when the grapes begin to
ripen. His next comparison, which is closely allied to the former, is taken from

that the whole country will be wasted, with the solitary exception of the
<i>city</i>, which shall be left standing like <i>a cottage</i>, or that the
city itself will be destroyed. The former interpretation is adopted by the Jews,
and they understand this passage to relate to the siege of Senllacherib; but I
think that it has a wider signification, and embraces other calamities which
followed afterwards. This may indeed refer to the neighboring country, from the
misery and devastation of which it was impossible but that the city should
sustain much damage; but I consider the Prophet's meaning to be, that the evils
of which he speaks shall reach even to <i>the city</i> itself, until, broken and
ruined, it shall wear the aspect of a mean
<i>cottage</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The daughter

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is the name here employed rather than <i>Jerusalem</i>, on account of the
dignity of the temple; and this figure of speech, by which a part is taken for
the whole, is frequently employed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except the Lord of hosts had left
unto us</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Here he concludes what he had formerly
declared concerning God's chastisements, that the desolation which shall take
place &#8212; or rather which is present, and which they now behold &#8212; may
be compared to the destruction of <i>Sodom</i>, were it not that the Lord
snatched as it were from the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burning a very small
remnant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And this verse confirms what I
formerly said, that the Prophet's description of the calamities which had
already taken place is interwoven with those events which were immediately at
hand, as if he had said, Be not deceived by flatteries; you would be in the same
condition that Sodom and Gomorrah now are, were it not that God, in compassion
on you, has preserved <i>a remnant</i>. This agrees with the words of
Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">It is of the Lord's
mercies that we are not consumed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Lamentations
3:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought to observe two things. First, the
Prophet here describes utter destruction; and yet, because God had to deal with
his Church and his beloved people, that judgment is mitigated by special grace,
so that out of the general ruin of the whole nation God rescues his people, whom
he justly compares to <i>a very small remnant</i>. But if God punished the
crimes of the Jews by such dreadful chastisements, let us consider that we may
share the same fate if we imitate their rebellion: for God had set apart that
nation for himself, and had distinguished them from the ordinary lot of other
men. Why then should he spare us if we shall be hardened in our ungodliness and
treachery? Or rather, what is likely to be the result of that mass and sink of
crimes in which men throughout the whole world give way to their passions?
Unquestionably it will be the same with the fate of <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i>,
unless his vengeance shall be restrained by a regard to that gracious covenant
in which he promised that the Church shall be eternal; and this threatening,
which is truly awful and alarming, is applicable to all obstinate and incurable
men, whose vices no punishments can destroy or
weaken.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, we ought to observe that saying
of Jeremiah, which I have already glanced at, that it must be attributed to the
tender mercies of God that we are not altogether destroyed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
2:22.) For if We Shall Consider the vast amount Of wickedness which prevails
among all classes, we shall wonder that even a single individual is left, and
that all have not been removed from the land of the living; and in this way God
<i>withdraws his hand</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:22,) that there may be some Church preserved in the world. This is the reason
assigned by Paul, who is the best interpreter of this passage, when, by quoting
it, he represses the haughtiness of the Jews, that they may not boast of the
mere name, as if it had been enough that they were descended from the fathers;
for he reminds them that God could act towards them as he had formerly done
towards the fathers, but that through his tender mercies <i>a remnant shall be
saved</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450527&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:27.) And why? That the Church may not utterly perish; for it is through the
favor which he bears towards it that the Lord, though our obstinacy lays him
under the necessity of trying the severest judgments, still reserves some small
<i>seed</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:29.) This statement ought to yield us powerful consolation even in those
heaviest calamities in which we are apt to think that it is all over with the
Church; that, though everything should go into confusion, and the world, as we
say, be turned upside down, we may persevere with unshaken fortitude, and may
rest assured that God will always be mindful of his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A very small
remnant</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This clause may be connected either
with what goes before or with what follows, and accordingly some render it,

former clause, so as to deduce that the number which God had <i>reserved</i> out
of the destruction is <i>small</i>. Some think that:

strongly; and I have no objection to that view, though we may take it in its
natural and literal signification, as if he had said, "and that shall be a small
number." This declaration ought to be carefully observed; for if the Church does
not spread far and wide, men are wont to despise her. Hence it comes that
hypocrites are proud of their numbers; and weak men, terrified by the pompous
display of those numbers, stagger. We also learn from it that we ought not to
judge by the largeness of the number, unless we choose to prefer the chaff to
the wheat, because the quantity is greater; but we ought to be satisfied with
knowing that, though the number of the godly be small, still God acknowledges
them as his chosen people; and we ought also to call to remembrance that

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear the word of the
Lord</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what he had formerly said,
that the Lord's vengeance is not cruel; because they deserved far more severe
punishment. For although there was a difference between them and the inhabitants
of <i>Sodom</i> as to punishment, yet their guilt was the same; so that equal
punishment might have been inflicted, if the Lord had not spared them. It
amounts to this, that, if they have received milder treatment, it is not because
they have sinned less heinously than the inhabitants of <i>Sodom</i>, but it
must be ascribed to the mercy of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he
gives to the <i>rulers</i> the name of <i>Sodom</i>, and distinguishes the
<i>people</i> by the name of <i>Gomorrah</i>, this does not point out that there
is a difference, but rather that their condition is alike. But by repeating the
same thing twice, the diversity of the names lends additional elegance; as if he
had said, that there is no greater difference between the rulers and the
<i>people</i> than there is between <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i>. There is,
no doubt, an allusion to the various ranks of men, by assigning to them,
separately, as it were, two cities; but as <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i> mean
the same thing, we perceive that he throws them, as it were, into one bundle. In
short, the meaning is, "If any one shall form an opinion about the people and
the rulers, he will find that there is as close a resemblance between them as
between Sodom and Gomorrah, or between one egg and another; for no one part is
more sound than any other part."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet
begins with stripping the Jews of their disguises, and justly; for while all
hypocrites are accustomed to employ strange coverings for concealing themselves
from view, that nation was particularly addicted to this vice, and on no subject
did the prophets contend with them more keenly or fiercely. Along with their
vaunting about pretended holiness pride also reigned, and they boasted of the
grandeur and excellency of their nation as much as of ceremonies and outward
worship. So much the more were they offended at the great harshness with which
Isaiah addressed them. But it was necessary to drag their wickedness from their
lurking places, and therefore the more haughty their demeanour, the greater is
the vehemence with which the Prophet thunders against them. In the same manner
ought we to deal with all
hypocrites.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of the
Lord</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet takes the <i>word</i> and the
<i>law</i> for the same thing; and yet I fully believe that he purposely
employed the term <i>law</i>, in order to glance at their absurd opinion;
because, by imagining that the offering of sacrifices, unaccompanied by faith
and repentance, can appease God, they put an absurd interpretation on the
<i>law</i>. By these words he reminded them that, by quoting Moses to them, he
introduces nothing new and makes no addition to the law; that it is only
necessary for them to hear what the will of God is; and that on this subject he
will faithfully instruct them. Lest they should suppose that, by an unfounded
belief of their own righteousness, they can deceive God, he likewise reminds
them that the <i>law</i> gives no countenance to them in this
matter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To what purpose is he multitude
of your sacrifices to me</i>?</font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now introduces
God as speaking, for the purpose of making known his own meaning; for it belongs
to a lawgiver not only to issue commands, but likewise to give a sound
interpretation to the laws, that they may not be abused. Beyond all doubt, the
former reproof was exceedingly unpalatable and oppressive to them; for what
language expressive of stronger disapprobation or abhorrence could have been
employed? They gloried in the name of Abraham, boasted that they were his
children, and on this ground maintained a haughty demeanor. This is the reason
why the Prophet arms himself with the authority of God against them; as if he
had said, "Know that it is not with me but with God that you have to
do."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next he explains the intention and design
of God in demanding sacrifices; that he does so, not because he sets a high
value on them, but in order that they may be aids to piety; and, consequently,
that the Jews were greatly mistaken who made all their holiness to consist of
those services. For they thought that they had performed their duty admirably
well when they offered sacrifices of slain beasts; and when the prophets
demanded something beyond this, they complained that they were treated harshly.
Now the Lord says that he rejects and abhors them, which may appear to be
excessive severity, for it was by him that they were appointed. But it ought to
be observed that some of the commandments of God ought to be obeyed on their own
account, while others of them have a remoter object. For instance, the law
enjoins us to serve and worship God, and next enjoins us to do good to our
neighbors.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:5;

19:18.) These things are in themselves acceptable to God, and are demanded on
their own account. The case is different with ceremonies; for they are
performances which are not demanded on their own account, but for a different
reason. The same thing may be said of fasting<i>;</i></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For the kingdom of God
does not consist in meat and drink;

<div><font face="Palatino">and therefore fasting is directed to another
object.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It follows, therefore, that ceremonies
were not appointed in such a manner as if they were a satisfaction by which he
should be appeased, but in order that by means of them the nation might be
trained to godliness, and might make greater and greater progress in faith and
in the pure worship of God. But hypocrites observe them with the most scrupulous
care, as if the whole of religion turned on this point, and think that they are
the most devout of all men, when they have long and anxiously wearied themselves
in observing them. And that they may be thought more devout, they likewise add
something of their own, and daily contrive new inventions, and most wickedly
abuse the holy ordinances of God, by not keeping in view their true object. All
their ceremonies, therefore, are nothing else than corruptions of the worship of
God. For when their whole attention is given to the outward and naked
performance, in what respect do their sacrifices differ from the sacrifices of
the Gentiles, which, we know, were full of sacrilege, because they had no regard
to a lawful end?</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Lord
rejects those ceremonies, though they had been appointed by his authority,
because the nation did not consider the object and purpose for which they were
enjoined. The unceasing contest between the prophets and the nation was to tear
off these masks, and to show that the Lord is not satisfied with merely outward
worship, and cannot be appeased by ceremonies. In all places godly ministers
have experience of the same kind of conflicts; for men always form their
estimate of God from themselves, and think that he is satisfied with outward
display, but cannot without the greatest difficulty be brought to offer to him
the integrity of their heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino">All the perplexity
of this passage will be easily removed by Jeremiah, who says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">When I redeemed your
fathers out of Egypt, I did not order them to offer sacrifices to me; I only
enjoined them to hear me and to keep my commandments.

7:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For he shows that the observance of ceremonies
depends wholly on the word, and that it is as idle and unprofitable to separate
there from the word as it would be for the soul to be parted from the body. To
this also belongs the argument in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195013&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
50:13, 14, &#8212;</font><br></div>

to the Most High.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And in another passage the same Jeremiah
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Trust not in words of
falsehood, saying, The temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of
the LORD are we.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">But rather excel

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
7:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet Micah likewise says, "Doth the LORD take
pleasure in thousands of rams, or in ten thousand rivers of oil?" Immediately
afterwards he adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will show thee, O man,
what is good, and what the LORD requireth from thee, namely, to do justly, to
love mercy,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and to walk humbly with
thy God."<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Micah
6:7, 8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From these passages it is evident that the reason why
ceremonies are condemned is, that they are separated from the word as from their
soul. Hence we see how great is the blindness of men, who cannot be convinced
that all the pains they take to worship God are of no advantage unless they flow
from integrity of heart. Nor is this vice confined to the common people, but is
found in almost all men; and in those who in their opinion excel all others.
Hence springs the notion of the efficacy which belongs to the mere performance
of the outward act &#8212; or, as they call it, <i>the opus operatum</i> &#8212;
which Popish doctors have contrived, and which at the present day keeps a firm
hold of the minds of many. Now here it is not man but God himself who speaks,
and who pronounces, by an unchangeable decree, that all that men do is in vain
offered for his acceptance, is empty and unprofitable, unless they call upon him
with true faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath required this at your
hand</i>?</font><font face="Palatino"> What an admirable confutation of false
worship, when God declares that they will not come before him according to the
appointed manner, and makes a general declaration, that in vain do they offer to
him anything which he does not require; for he does not choose to be worshipped
in any other way than that which has been enjoined! For how comes it that men
are so highly delighted with those inventions, but because they do not consider
that all their services are neither profitable to themselves nor acceptable to
God? Otherwise they would immediately recollect that obedience is all that
remains for them to do;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22;) and they would not so insolently vaunt of their exertions, which
the Lord looks upon with scorn, not only because he derives no advantage from
it, but because he does not wish that men should attribute to him what they have
rashly undertaken without his authority, or suffer the caprice of men to pass
for a law: Yet in order to express still stronger contempt, he immediately adds,
that they improperly give the name of <i>obedience</i> to that which he
considers to be labor thrown away; namely, that their close attendance at the
temple amounts to nothing more than treading its pavements; as if, in reference
to their hypocritical prayers, he had said, "Truly they lay me under deep
obligations by stunning my ears."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring no more vain
oblations</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This is a useful admonition for
restraining the irregular desires of those who do not cease to follow
inveterately unmeaning and hypocritical worship, that, warned by God, they may
at length repent, if they would listen to any advice. But hence we learn how
hard it is to shake the false confidence of hypocrites, when they have once been
hardened, since they cannot even endure to hear God plainly warning them not to
go on in losing their pains, and in the practice of such
madness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Incense is an
abomination to one</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> To press them more closely,
he proceeds farther, and declares that such worship is not only unprofitable,
but even that he detests and abhors it; and justly, because the profanation of
the worship of God, in which his name is falsely employed, is not free from
sacrilege. For as nothing is more dear to God than his own glory, so there is
nothing which he more strongly detests than to have it infringed by any kind of
corruptions: and this is done, when any sort of unmeaning service is put in the
room of true worship. The meaning of this passage has been mistaken by some, who
have thought that the Prophet speaks of the repeal of the law; for that is not
his object, but he recalls the people of his time to the right manner of
observing ceremonies, and shows with what design and for what purpose they were
instituted. For since the beginning of the world the worship of God was
spiritual, and the diversity of our worship from that which prevailed under the
Old Testament had a reference to men, but not to God. In God there is no change,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:17,) but he accommodates himself to the weakness of men. That kind of
government therefore was suitable to the Jews, just as a preparatory
training</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is needed for children. For what purpose
they were instituted, and what is the right manner of observing ceremonies, he
now describes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
new-moons</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet adds nothing new to his
former doctrine; but with respect to all ceremonies, in which there is no
spiritual truth, but only the glare of a false pretense, he declares generally
that they are not merely useless but wicked. Hence we ought to observe that we
labor to no purpose, if we do not worship God in the right manner, and as God
himself enjoins. In all things God delights in truth, but especially in the
worship due to his majesty. Besides, not only do we lose our labor, but the
worship of God (as we have already said) is perverted; and nothing can be more
wicked than this. Now all superstitions are so many corruptions of the worship
of God; it follows, therefore, that they are wicked and
unlawful.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Superstition may be viewed, either in
itself, or in the disposition of the mind. <i>In itself</i> when men have the
audacity to contrive what God has not commanded. Such are those actions which
spring from <i>will-worship</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejqeloqrhskei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:23,) Which is commonly called devotion. One man shall set up an idol, another
shall build a chapels another shall appoint annual festivals, and innumerable
things of the same nature. When men venture to take such liberties as to invent
new modes of worship, that is superstition.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the disposition of the
mind</i></font><font face="Palatino">, when men imitate those services which are
lawful and of which God approves, but keep their whole attention fixed on the
outward form, and do not attend to their object or truth. In this manner the
Jews earnestly adhered to the ceremonies which Moses had enjoined, but left out
what was of the greatest importance; for they paid no regard to a pure
conscience, never mentioned faith and repentance, had no knowledge of their
guilt, and &#8212; what was still worse &#8212; separated Christ from them, and
left no room for the truth. This plainly shows, as I have already stated, that
it was a spurious and deceitful mask; so that their sacrifices did not at all
differ from the sacrifices of the Gentiles. It is therefore not wonderful that
the Lord calls them <i>abomination</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I shall
not stay to notice the phrases here used, which are various; and yet they ought
not to be lightly passed over. For the Lord perceives how great is the
wantonness of men in contriving modes of worship; and therefore he heaps up a
variety of expressions, that he may more powerfully restrain that wantonness,
and again declares that those actions are hateful to him. Moreover, because men
flatter themselves, and foolishly entertain the belief that the Lord will hold
in some estimation the idle contrivances which they have framed, he declares, on
the contrary, that he regards them with detestation and
abhorrence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye spread forth your
hands</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The ancient custom of <i>spreading forth
the hands</i> in prayer did not arise from superstition; nor did that practice,
like many others, obtain currency through foolish and idle ambition; but because
nature herself prompts men to declare, even by outward signs, that they betake
themselves to God. Accordingly, since they cannot fly to him, they raise
themselves by this sign. No injunction, certainly, respecting this sign, was
given to the fathers; but they used it as men divinely inspired; and by this
very sign all idolaters are convicted of gross blindness; for, while they
declare by an outward attitude that they betake themselves to God, in reality
they betake themselves to idols. In order to convict them more strongly, the
Lord permitted the uninterrupted use of this custom to continue among them. The
Prophet, therefore, does not condemn the <i>spreading forth of the hands</i>,
but their hypocrisy; because they assumed the appearance of men who called on
God, while in their heart they were wholly averse to him, as he elsewhere
declares more fully that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"this people draw near me

<div><font face="Palatino">Where hypocrisy is, there can be no true calling on

shall spread forth their hands, I will
hear."</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
in that passage the Lord speaks of that <i>calling</i> which proceeds from
confidence in him. Faith is the mother of calling on God; and if that be absent,
nothing is left but empty
mockery.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, when ye make
many prayers</i>. </font><font face="Palatino">He amplifies the former statement
by threatening that he will be deaf to their cries, to whatever extent they may
multiply prayers; as if he had said, "Though you be constant in prayer, that
diligence will be of no avail to you." For this also is a fault which belongs to
hypocrites, that the more their prayers abound in words, they think that they
are more holy, and will more easily obtain what they wish. Thus their idle
talkativeness is indirectly
rebuked.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your hands are full
of blood</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Here he begins to explain more fully
the reason why he disapproves, and even disdainfully rejects, both their prayers
and their sacrifices. It is because they are cruel and bloody, and stained with
crimes of every sort, though they come into his presence with hypocritical
display. Though he will afterwards add other kinds of crime, yet as he had
mentioned the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spreading forth of
the hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">, so he speaks of the <i>hands</i>,
and says that in them they carry and hold out a testimony of their crimes, so
that they need not wonder that he thrusts them back so harshly. For, on the
other hand, the phrase, <i>to lift up clean hands</i>, was employed not only by
prophets and apostles,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:8,) but even by profane authors, who were driven by mere instinct to
reprove the stupidity of men; if it were not that God perhaps forced them to
make this confession, in order that true religion might never be without some
kind of attestation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet the Prophet does
not mean that they were robbers or murderers, but reproves the tricks and deceit
by which they obtained possession of the property of others. God judges in a
different manner from men; for the hidden tricks and wicked arts, by which
wicked men are accustomed to deceive and take advantage of the more simple, are
not taken into account by men; or if they are taken into account, they are at
least extenuated, and are not estimated according to their just weight. But God,
dragging forth to light those very men of dazzling reputation, who under
specious pretenses had been in the habit of concealing their unjust practices,
plainly declares that they are murderers. For in whatever way you kill a man,
whether you cut his throat or take away his food and the necessaries of life,
you are a murderer. Consequently, God does not speak of men who are openly
wicked, or whose crimes have made them openly infamous, but of those who wished
to be thought good men, and who kept up some kind of
reputation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This circumstance ought to be
carefully observed; for on the same grounds must we now deal with wicked men,
who oppress the poor and feeble by fraud and violence, or some kind of
injustice, and yet cloak their wickedness by plausible disguise. But with
whatever impudence they may exclaim that they do not resemble thieves or
assassins we must reprove them with the same severity which the Prophet employed
towards persons of the same stamp; for when we speak in the name of God, we must
not judge according to the views and opinions of men, but must boldly declare
the judgment which the Lord hath
pronounced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wash you, make you
clean</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He exhorts the Jews to repentance, and
points out the true way of it, provided that they wish to have their obedience
approved by God. Hence we conclude that nothing can please God, unless it
proceed from a pure conscience; for God does not, like men, judge of our works
according to their outward appearance. It frequently happens that some
particular action, though performed by a very wicked man, obtains applause among
men; but in the Sight of God, who beholds the heart, a depraved conscience
pollutes every virtue. And this is what is taught by Haggai, holding out an
illustration drawn from the ancient ceremonies, that <i>everything which an
unclean person has touched is polluted</i>; from which he concludes that nothing
clean proceeds from the wicked. Our Prophet has already declared, that in vain
do they offer sacrifices to God, in vain do they pray, in vain do they call on
his name, if integrity of heart do not sanctify the outward worship. For this
reason, in order that the Jews may no longer labor to no purpose, he demands
that <i>cleanness</i>; and he begins with a general reformation, lest, after
having discharged one part of their duty, they should imagine that this would be
a veil to conceal them from the eyes of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such is the manner in which we ought always
to deal with men who are estranged from God. We must not confine our attention
to one or a few sores of a diseased body but if we aim at a true and thorough
cure, we must call on them to begin anew, and must thoroughly remove the
contagion, that they who were formerly hateful and abominable in the sight of
God may begin to please God. By the metaphor <i>washing</i>, he unquestionably
exhorts to remove inward pollution, but shortly afterwards he will also add the
fruits of actions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he bids them
<i>wash</i>, he does not mean that men repent by their own exercise of
free-will; but he shows that there is no other remedy but this, that they shall
appear pure in the sight of God. Now, we know that the sacred writers attribute
to men what is wrought in them by the Spirit of God, whom Ezekiel calls <i>clean
water</i>, because to him belongs the work of repentance.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;263625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
36:25.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put away the evil of
your doings</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now comes to describe
the fruits of repentance; for not only does he explain without a metaphor what
it is to wash and to be cleansed, but he enjoins them to exhibit in their whole
life, and in every action, the evidence of their being renewed. Yet he confirms
the former statement, that the pollution of the people is <i>before the eyes
</i>of God, that it stains and debases all their actions, and thus makes it
impossible that they shall be pleasing in his sight. And he particularly
mentions <i>the eyes of God</i>, lest, when they employed a veil to hinder
themselves from seeing, they should vainly imagine that God shared with them in
their blindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cease to do
evil</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He still proceeds to reprove their manner
of life. This passage is commonly interpreted as if by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doing
ill</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the Prophet meant loving ill; but it ought
strictly to be understood as denoting those crimes by which a neighbor is
injured; so that in the exhortation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Learn to do
well,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which occurs in the next verse, the
expression <i>to your neighbor</i> ought to be supplied; for he speaks of the
injuries and kind offices which Eve perform to our neighbors. Now since
repentance has its seal in the heart of man, he describes it by those outward
appearances by means of which it is, in some measure, brought before the eyes of
men. There is no man who does not wish to be reckoned a good man; but the true
character of every man is manifested by his actions. He therefore calls them to
the performance of those outward actions by which they may give evidence of
their repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He comprehends under two heads
the fruits of repentance, <i>ceasing to do evil</i>, and <i>doing well.</i>
First, we must cease to commit every act of injustice; for we must not imitate
those spendthrifts who wish to be thought bountiful, and fraudulently take from
one person what they bestow on another. Again, we must not resemble those idle
people who think that they have done enough, if they have kept themselves from
doing harm, and from invading the property of their neighbors, but are not
careful to perform acts of kindness. He intended, therefore, to include both;
for under those two heads the keeping of the second table of the law is
comprehended.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Learn to do
well</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> As he had just now, ill enjoining them to
<i>cease to do evil</i>, charged them with the continual practice of iniquity as
if he had said that their whole life was a constant habit of sinning; so now he
enjoins them to become skilled in acts of kindness, and in entreating them to
<i>learn </i>this, he addresses them as scholars who had not yet learned their
earliest lessons. And first he bids them <i>seek judgment</i>. Others render it,
inquire respecting <i>judgment</i>, of which I do not approve; for by the word
<i>seek</i> the Prophet meant more than this, he meant what we call the actual
practice of it. By the word<i> judgment</i> he denotes what is good and right;
as if he had said, "Aim at
uprightness."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Relieve the
oppressed</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, after his wonted
manner, adds to the general description the mention of particular classes; and
although he has already given a special exhortation to kindness and justice, yet
wishing to press them more closely, he enters into a more careful enumeration of
certain classes, so as to present a more complete view of the subject. For
otherwise men always wish to be reckoned good and righteous, and can scarcely be
moved by general instruction; but when we come to particular cases, they are
forced, as it were, to deal with the matter in hand, and are compelled to yield,
or at least become more tractable, of which we have daily
experience.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet
here selects two classes, by means of which the wickedness of men is more fully
exposed; for it seldom happens that the causes of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fatherless and
widows</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are defended, because men do not expect
from them any rewards. To such an extent are they exposed to every kind of
injustice, that no man comes forward in defense of them, because there is no man
who follows justice on its own account; and not only so, but there is a very
great number of persons who are ready to plunder the poor and needy. This proves
that there is no one who cares about exercising judgment; for we need not at all
wonder that men of wealth and influence have friends to assist them, who are
excited and allured by the expectation of reward. But the Lord declares that he
takes charge of <i>the fatherless and widows</i>, and will avenge them if they
shall sustain any injury.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ye shall
not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. If thou afflict then in any wise,
and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry: and my wrath shall
wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and
your children fatherless."

together</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">an</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>na</i>) is commonly translated <i>I pray</i>, or<i> therefore</i>; but I
think that it denotes the confidence of a good cause, and thus is an
exhortation, <i>Come</i>. For the Lord declares that the Jews will have nothing,
to reply, and that, even though they obtain an opportunity of clearing
themselves, they will still be speechless. And certainly this is the way in
which hypocrites ought to be treated; for they boldly enter into disputes with
God, and there is no end of their reasonings. Accordingly, he tells them that,
if they choose to debate, he will be equally prepared on the other
side.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question will perhaps be put, Why does
the Prophet speak chiefly about the second table of the law, and not rather
about the worship of God? For we know that there were good reasons why God
assigned the foremost place to the first table, when he divided the law; and
there can be no doubt that, as it comes first in order, so it is likewise of
greater importance. I reply, when the Prophets reprove the hypocrisy of men,
they employ various modes of address. Sometimes they complain that the Sabbath
has been profaned; sometimes they say that men do not call on God; but for the
most part they censure idolatry, and raise their voice against superstitions.
But here Isaiah complains that their duties towards their neighbors have not
been performed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Still in all these cases the
object is the same, to show that our actions are of no value in the sight of
God, when they do not proceed from a good conscience, and when we are destitute
of the fear of God. This fear they sometimes denote by "calling on the name of
God," sometimes by "keeping the Sabbath," and sometimes by other actions; but as
the distinction between true worship and hypocrisy is most clearly and
manifestly pointed out by means of the duties of brotherly kindness, there are
good reasons why the mention of those duties is brought forward by Isaiah. For
hypocrites are careful to perform outward worship and ceremonies; but inwardly
they are full of envy, they swell with pride and contempt of the brethren, they
burn with covetousness and ambition; and while they conceal themselves under
those masks, they cannot easily be detected. They must, therefore, be tried by
this rule, as by a touchstone, and thus it must be ascertained whether or not
they fear God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We might, indeed, be deceived,
were it from the second table only that we formed our judgment about the
godliness of a man; but if any one discharge the duties of the first table,
which are evidences of godliness and of the worship of God, he must then be
brought to this standard, Does he act inoffensively towards other men? Does he
abstain from every act of injustice? Does he speak truth? Does he live in the
exercise of kindness to his brethren? This is the reason why Christ
pronounces</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">mercy, judgment, and
faith, to be the weighty matters of the law,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
23:23,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and censures the Pharisees because, in their
eagerness about tithes and offerings, they attended only to smaller matters, and
neglected true righteousness. By <i>faith</i> he means fidelity, or what we
commonly call <i>loyalty</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
<i>judgment</i> he means every kind of uprightness, when we render to every man
what belongs to him, and do not allow others to be injured, but assist them, as
far as lies in our power.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But if these are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the weighty matters of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in what order ought we to place the
commandments of the second table? I answer, they retain their due importance and
order; but by means of those duties which Christ so rigidly demands, and on
which he dwells so largely, hypocrisy is more fully detected, and we are better
enabled to judge whether a man sincerely fears God or not. In the same sense
ought we to understand that passage, <i>I will have mercy and not sacrifice</i>;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
6:6;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:13;) for mercy is an evidence and proof of true godliness. Again, it is
pleasing to God, because it is a true demonstration of the love which we owe to
our fellow-men; but sacrifices are pleasing to him for a different reason. It is
now, I think, sufficiently plain why the Prophet Isaiah mentions kindness rather
than faith or calling upon God; and why the prophets employ such variety in
their modes of address, when they endeavor to bring back hypocrites to the true
worship of God, and when they bid them show it by its
fruits.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though your sins be as
scarlet</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> It is as if he had said, that he does
not accuse innocent persons, and has no wish to enter into controversy; so that
the charges which he makes against them are not brought forward or maintained
without strong necessity. For hypocrites are wont to find fault with God, as if
he were too severe, and could not be at all appeased. They go still farther, and
discover this excuse for their obstinacy, that it is in vain for them to attempt
to return to a state of favor with God. If every other expedient fail, still
they fly to this, that it is not proper to make such rigid demands on them, and
that even the very best of men have something that needs to be forgiven. The
Prophet anticipates the objection, by introducing the Lord speaking ill this
manner &#8212; "For my part, if it be necessary, I do not refuse to dispute with
you; for the result will be to show that it is your own obstinacy which prevents
a reconciliation from taking place between us. Only bring cleanness of heart,
and all controversy between us will be at an end. I would no longer contend with
you, if you would bring me an upright
heart."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we obtain a declaration in the
highest degree consolatory, that God does not contend with us as if he wished to
pursue our offenses to the utmost. For if we sincerely turn to him, he will
immediately return to favor with us, and will blot out all remembrance of our
sins, and will not demand an account of them. For he is not like men who, even
for a slight and inconsiderable offense, often refuse to be reconciled. Nay, so
far is he from giving us reason to complain of his excessive severity, that he
is ready to cleanse us, and to make us as white as snow. He is satisfied With
cleanness of heart, and if, notwithstanding of this cleanness of heart, there be
any offense, he forgives it, and acquits those who have provoked
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
If ye be willing and obedient</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah continues
to plead the cause of God against the people, and states in a few words, that
not only must the people bear the blame of all the calamities which they
endured, but that it lies in their own power to regain immediately prosperity
and happiness; because God is always ready to forgive them, provided that they
do not harden their hearts. But because happiness appears here to be placed in
the power of men, and at their disposal, the papists openly maintain that men,
by the exercise of their own will, are free to choose either good or evil. When
God charges men with obstinacy, we must not on that account believe that he
describes the nature or extent of their
ability.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it would be useless to say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if ye be
willing</i></font><font face="Palatino">, unless it were in the power of men to
will. I answer, though the choice be not so free as they pretend that it is, yet
sinners are justly chargeable with being the voluntary agents of their
calamities, because it is of their own accord, and not by compulsion, that they
provoke God to anger. It is therefore true, that it is a special gift of God
when a man aims at what is good; but it is equally true that it is their own
wickedness that hinders the reprobate from applying their mind to it, and,
consequently, that the whole blame of their obstinacy rests with themselves. On
this depends the reproach brought against the people, that they would have led a
prosperous and happy life, if they had been submissive and obedient to God. For
since God is by nature disposed to acts of kindness, nothing but our ingratitude
and enmity hinders us from receiving that goodness which he freely offers to
all. On the other hand, he adds a sharp and heavy threatening, that it is in his
power to take vengeance; lest they should imagine that they who despise God will
escape without punishment. It ought also to be observed, that the only rule of
living well is to yield obedience to God and his word; for to <i>will</i> and to
<i>hear</i> mean nothing else than to comply with the will of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A change of the construction of the words
(<i>hypallage</i>) has been admitted into this sentence; for the meaning fully
brought out would stand thus: "if your mind be ready, and your will be disposed,
to obey;" or, which amounts to the same thing, "if you render obedience to me,
and lend an ear to my word." since, therefore, God places the happiness of men
in obedience, it follows that our life is properly conducted, when we hear God
speaking, and obey him in all things. How great, therefore, is the wickedness of
men, when they refuse to listen to God who is continually speaking to them, and
reject the happiness which he has provided and offered! It was proper that their
wayward dispositions should be subdued, lest those wretched men should draw down
on themselves the wrath of God, and willingly throw themselves, like wild
beasts, on the edge of the sword. We must likewise observe, that he at length
threatens them with final destruction, if they shall obstinately refuse to
submit themselves to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye
shall eat the good of the land</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He means the
fruits which the earth yields for supplying the necessaries of life; for in some
sense the earth may be said to be unkind when it does not produce its fruits,
and keeps them, as it were, in its bosom. Yet I have no doubt he alludes to the
promises of the law, in which God declares, that to those who fear him he will
bless the earth and will cause it to produce a great abundance of all good
things.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The Lord shall make thee

<div><font face="Palatino">And yet, when he offers to us the conveniences of the
earthly life, it is not because he wishes that our attention should be confined
to our present happiness, which alone hypocrites value, and which entirely
occupies their minds; but in order that, by the contemplation of it, we may rise
to the heavenly life, and that, by tasting so much goodness, he may prepare us
for the enjoyment of eternal happiness. More especially was God accustomed to
act in this manner towards the ancient people, that, by tasting present
benefits, as by a shadow, they might be called to the heavenly inheritance. This
distinction ought to be carefully observed, that we may apply this instruction
to ourselves, according to the degree of prosperity to which God has exalted us.
The Prophet intended to show that true happiness, with its accompaniments,
consists in obedience to God; and that the wicked, by their obstinacy, bring
upon themselves every kind of calamities, and therefore that all our distresses
ought to be ascribed to the sins and crimes which we have
committed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye refuse and
rebel</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The wicked always think that the
severity of the punishment is greater than their guilt, even though the Lord
chastise them very gently; and although they do not venture to justify
themselves entirely, yet they never cease, as I formerly said, to accuse God of
excessive severity. But the Prophet threatens that there will be no end of their
calamities till they be destroyed; and lest they should imagine that they had
nothing more to fear than those slight and inconsiderable punishments which they
had hitherto suffered, he declares that far heavier judgments of God are still
awaiting them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The papists torture this passage
to support the doctrine of freewill, and argue in the following manner: &#8212;
"If men be happy whenever they are willing to obey God, it follows that this is
placed in our own power." The argument certainly is very childish; for the Lord
does not inform us by the Prophet what is the nature or extent of our capacity
for good or evil; but he reminds us that it is our own fault if we do not enjoy
good things, and that the calamities with which we are afflicted are the
punishments of our disobedience. The question, whether a man can make his bad
will good, is altogether different from the question, whether, by the bad will,
which is natural to him, he brings upon himself all the evils which he endures.
Unjustly and falsely, therefore, do those skillful and ingenious doctors employ
this passage to support their doctrine about a free choice of good and
evil.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the mouth of the

Since men who are blinded by their lusts are little moved by threatenings, the
Prophet, in order to arouse them from deep slothfulness, reminds them that this

purpose.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">

forcible, and the crime of the people more shocking, in having thus departed
from God and from all uprightness, he cries aloud as if he had seen some
monstrous thing; and certainly it was a change fitted to awaken horror, that a
nation devoted to God, and chosen to a <i>royal priesthood</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6,) had fallen from lofty piety to the lowest sink of wickedness. More
especially he speaks of the <i>city</i> of Jerusalem, which was God's sanctuary
and royal abode. He complains that the <i>city</i> which had formerly been a
guardian of justice is a den of robbers; that she who formerly was a chaste and
pure virgin hath </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>become a
harlot,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To strike the deeper shame into the
degenerate Jews, who had departed widely from their holy fathers, he assumes the
air of a person astonished, and asks himself how this could possibly have
happened.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The faithful
city</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> By the word <i>faithful</i> he alludes,
in my opinion, to the conjugal fidelity which a wife ought to preserve to her
husband. The signification is undoubtedly more extensive; but when I look at the
connection of the passage I do not hesitate to say that <i>faithful</i> means
<i>chaste</i>; for immediately afterwards he employs another term in contrast
with it, calling her <i>an harlot</i>. Whereas she once was a virtuous wife,
faithful to the marriage-contract, she has now<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>become an
harlot,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and her base conduct brings not a blush
on her countenance. The Scriptures frequently call the Church the wife of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:19, 20.) That honorable rank Jerusalem held, so long as she maintained
spiritual chastity, and continued in the pure and lawful worship of God; but as
soon as she departed from it she <i>became an
harlot.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">This astonishment of the Prophet was
undoubtedly joined with the deepest grief; for we ought to look upon it as
something monstrous when men revolt from God, and refuse that allegiance which
they have promised to render; nor is it possible that right-hearted men, when
they behold such a revolt, can fail to be affected with the most poignant grief.
We read that the angels in heaven rejoice at the conversion of one sinner;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
15:7, 10;) and therefore they cannot but mourn over the final ruin of any
sinner. How much more then will they bewail the ruin and destruction of a whole
state and Church!</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, that astonishment
conveys also a complaint; as if the Prophet had said, "O Jerusalem, from what a
flourishing condition hast thou fallen! Into what distress hast thou plunged
thyself! What shame and disgrace hast thou brought upon thee!" When the
flourishing state in which she had been, and the respect that had been paid to
her in former times, are called to her remembrance, it ought to produce a still
deeper impression on her mind; for she who was at one time the respected mother
of a family is naturally more careful about her honor and reputation than one
who has spent her whole life in base and licentious
conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It was full of
judgment</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He shows what fruits were produced by
that allegiance to God at a former period. We may take <i>judgment</i> as but
another name for uprightness; or, if it be thought preferable, we may call it
<i>justice</i> when men render to every man his own, and <i>judgment</i> when
the cause of the innocent is defended, and the poor and needy are avenged; for
such is the use of the words in Scripture when they are employed together; but
as they are not perfectly connected in this passage, I consider <i>judgment</i>
to denote uprightness; so that the same thing is twice expressed for the purpose
of explaining it more
fully.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But now
murderers</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He shows in what manner Jerusalem
<i>became an harlot</i>. It was, that the city, which had formerly been
distinguished for the love of justice and equity, was now full of
<i>murders</i>. The meaning is, as we have formerly said, not that they were
assassins or robbers, but that, by fraudulent and dishonest methods, under the
pretense of justice, they had gained the property of others. In short, he means
that they did not act fairly and justly towards their fellow-men, whatever might
be the estimation in which they were held; for sometimes, and indeed very
frequently, it happens that very wicked men are held in high
esteem.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The condition to which Jerusalem was
reduced should lead us to consider how often Satan exercises what may be called
unbounded tyranny over the Church of God; for if ever there was a Church, there
was one at that time in Jerusalem; and yet Isaiah affirms that it was a den of
robbers, or a slaughterhouse, where they cut men's throats. But if Satan could
freely riot in that Church, let us not wonder that the same thing takes place
among us; but let us labor not to suffer ourselves to be corrupted by such
wicked examples.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy silver is become dross, thy
wine mixed with water</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah speaks
metaphorically, and by two comparisons shows here, that though the outward
appearance of affairs was not openly overturned, yet their condition was changed
and corrupted, so as to be widely different from what it had formerly been: for
he says that <i>dross</i> now shines instead of <i>gold</i>, and that the
<i>wine</i>, though it retains its color, has lost its flavour. "Though thou
still make an empty show," saith the Prophet, "yet nothing <i>pure</i> will be
found in thee: that <i>wine</i> which was wont to be Stare in thee is corrupted;
and though its color deceive the eye, its taste shows that it has been
<i>mixed</i>."</font><br><font face="Palatino">All this means nothing more than
that the Jews should lay aside hypocrisy, and should begin to confess their
sins, and no longer flatter themselves after the manner of hypocrites. The
comparisons here employed are exceedingly well adapted to this end, for
<i>dross</i> bears some resemblance to <i>gold</i>; and in like manner, the
color of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wine mixed with
water</i></font><font face="Palatino"> resembles that of pure wine; and yet both
are very far from having that purity of which they make an outward show. In like
manner hypocrites, by their hypocrisy, may be said to assume a false color of
<i>silver</i>, though they are of no more value than dross, and indeed are the
more detestable on this account, that, though they are exceedingly wicked, yet,
with not less treachery than baseness, they present to God and to men those
hollow pretensions by which they cloak their
malice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy princes are

or play on words.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
does not speak of <i>princes</i> in such a manner as if the common people were
holy and needed no reproof, but he points out the source of the evil; for as no
disease is more injurious than that which spreads from the head into the whole
body, so no evil is more destructive in a commonwealth than a wicked and
depraved <i>prince</i>, who conveys his corruptions into the whole body both by
his example and by the liberty which he allows. Hence, too, comes the proverb,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJpoi~a hJ de&gt;spoina, toi~ai
kai&lt; aiJ qerapaini&gt;dev</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>like mistress,
like maids</i>. The meaning, therefore, is as if the Prophet had said that there
was no one vice more than another that reigned among the people, but that an
unbounded commission of crimes prevailed among the nobles themselves, and that
in this manner the whole body was stained with pollution. Something which gives
additional force to the statement is implied in the word <i>princes</i>; for it
is deeply to be lamented when an evil arises from that very quarter in which the
remedy for it ought to be expected. He next mentions a particular
instance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Companions of
thieves</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he means that they are
so far from restraining theft and false dealing, that, on the contrary, they
draw gain from them; and he justly calls those persons
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>companions of
thieves</i></font><font face="Palatino">, who, by receiving part of the booty,
grant permission to commit theft. And, indeed, when a judge is corrupted by a
bribe, it is impossible but that crimes shall abound and pass unpunished, with
the perpetrators of which we must consider him to be in
collusion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one loveth a
gift</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He next points out the reason why princes
have made themselves </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>companions
of thieves</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and have bound themselves by a
wicked conspiracy to lend countenance to crimes. It is avarice. When judges are
devoted to the love of money, justice is utterly destroyed; for if the
acceptance of persons be a corruption of judgment, so that no room is left for
justice, every man who is under the dominion of covetousness will assuredly
regard the person rather than the cause. The consequence is, that he will not be
able to perceive what is just and right, but, as one expresses it, will make
laws and unmake them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This reminds us how great
a virtue it is in a magistrate to disregard money; for unless he keep his mind,
his hands, and his eyes under restraint, he will never be able to judge justly.
It is absurd to say, as some men do, that they keep their heart pure and
uncorrupted, even though they receive bribes. What the Lord saith must be true,
that a gift blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the
righteous.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
23:8.) No man is so upright, no man is so clearsighted and sagacious, that his
mind shall resist the enchantment, and his eyes the blinding influence, of
gifts. Such judges, therefore, he justly declares to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>companions of
thieves</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for, hurried along by a blind desire
of money, they overturn all law both of God and man, and leave no room for
justice or modesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must likewise observe
that the Prophet, in order to convince hypocrites, brings forward their actions
which were open and universally known; for otherwise they would not submit. And
yet there can be no doubt that there were at that time many who objected, when
he thus called them thieves, as even in the present day most men impudently and
obstinately exclaim that they are not thieves on account of receiving the
rewards and gifts which are offered to them, because their do not prevent them
from passing a just judgment. But these replies being frivolous, the Prophet,
after having exposed their wicked actions, satisfies himself with the reproof
which he has given, and argues with them no longer. And, indeed, nature declares
that it is impossible to give just judgment, when judges are so eager for gain
and regard; because they cannot but absolutely expose to sale their honesty and
reputation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They judge not the
fatherless</i>. </font><font face="Palatino">As the Lord specially recommends to
us the <i>fatherless</i> and <i>widows</i>, because they have been deprived of
the protection of men, so we need not wonder if he is displeased when they are
abandoned by the judges, who ought to have been their guardians and defenders;
for since they have neither foresight, nor industry nor strength if no one comes
forward to render assistance they must be exposed without redress to every kind
of violence and injustice. Now, when no regard is paid to them, it follows that
the sway is held, not by justice, but by covetousness and
plunder.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore saith the lord, the
LORD of hosts</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He first employs the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wdah</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>haadon</i>) which literally signifies lord, and expresses the relation to a
servant. Next is added the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhy</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Jehovah</i>,) which denotes the eternal essence and majesty of God. After
having laid open some kinds of crimes, which made it manifest that in that
nation everything was corrupted, Isaiah, now wishing to threaten and to hold out
to them the judgment of God, not only represents God as invested with the power
and authority of a Judge, but at the same time reminds them that the children of
Abraham are his peculiar people, and for this reason he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mighty One of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There may also be implied in it a kind
of irony, by which he stings the Jews, as if he had said that it was foolishness
in them to boast of the name of God, seeing that they were worthless and
unprincipled servants, and that it was vain for them to rely on his strength,
which would immediately break forth against them. After this preface, he adds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ah! I will take
consolation on my adversaries</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
these words he intimates that God will not be pacified until he has satiated
himself with inflicting punishment. He employs the word consolation after the
manner of men; for as anger is nothing else than the desire of revenge, so
revenge gives relief to the mind, and he who has taken vengeance congratulates
himself and is satisfied. By this course, which may be regarded as a kind of
compensation, the Lord says that he will satisfy himself with inflicting
punishment </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on his
adversaries</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There
are various ways, indeed, of expounding this passage; and I shall not undertake
the task of examining all the interpretations and refuting those which I do not
approve: it will be enough if we ascertain the true meaning. He does not here
speak of Chaldeans or Assyrians, as some imagine, but of Jews, to whom, in the
character of a herald, he proclaims war in the name of the Lord. This
threatening sounded harshly in their ears; for they supposed that they were
joined in such a confederacy with God, that he was an adversary to their
adversaries. He declares, on the other hand, that he is their enemy because he
had so often been provoked by their crimes. In this manner we must shake off the
slothfulness of hypocrites, who are continually waging war with God, and yet do
not hesitate to allege that they enjoy his protection. We need not wonder,
therefore, if the Prophet sternly pronounces them to be <i>adversaries </i>of
God, who had broken the covenant, and had thus carried on war against
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet, in order to show that he is
unwillingly, as it were, constrained to inflict punishment on his people, God
utters his threatening with a kind of groan. For as nothing is more agreeable to
his nature than to do good, so whenever he is angry with us and treats us
harshly, it is certain that our wickedness has compelled him to do so, because
we do not allow his goodness to take its free course. More especially he is
disposed to treat his own people with gentleness, and when he sees that there is
no longer any room for his forbearance, he takes measures, as it were in sorrow,
for inflicting punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some would rather
choose perhaps to explain the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywh</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>hoi</i>) as of God made this exclamation when aroused by anger. For my own
part, I rather consider it, in this passage, to be an expression of grief;
because God, being mindful of his covenant, would willingly spare his chosen
people, were it not that pardon was entirely prevented by their
obstinacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And avenge me of
mine enemies</i>. </font><font face="Palatino">In this second clause there is a
reduplication,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnadi&gt;plwsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
a figure of speech customary with the Hebrews, who frequently express the same
thing twice in one verse. Hence also we learn that the object of the statement
is, that God cannot rest until he has taken vengeance on a wicked and
treacherous people</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will turn my hand upon
thee</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This is an alleviation of the former
threatening; for though he still proceeds with what he had begun to state about
his severity, he at the same time declares that, amidst those calamities which
were to be inflicted, the Church would be preserved. But the principal design
was to comfort believers, that they might not suppose the Church to be utterly
ruined, though God treated them more roughly than before. The Spirit of God, by
the Prophets, continually warns the children of God, who always tremble at his
word, not to be overwhelmed and lose heart on account of terrors and
threatening; for the more daringly that wicked men practice licentiousness and
scoff at all threatening the more do those who are affected by a sincere fear of
God tremble at them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turning of the hands of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes generally a token of his presence,
as if he should say, <i>I will display my hand</i>. This he is wont to do in two
ways, either by chastising the wicked, or by delivering believers from their
distresses. Since, therefore, it is evident from the context that God purposes,
by applying consolation, to mitigate the severity of punishment, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turning of the
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"> must here be viewed as referring to the
restoration of the Church; for although he declared in general terms that all
were his enemies, he now modifies or limits that statement by addressing
Jerusalem or Zion by name.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will purge away thy
dross</i></font><font face="Palatino">, though he points out the fruit of
correction, that believers may not be immoderately grieved or distressed on
account of it, yet we learn from this expression that the purification of the
Church is God's own work. For this purpose he always lifts up his hand to punish
transgressions, that he may bring back wanderers into the road; but rods would
be of no avail, if he did not make them useful by touching their hearts
inwardly. And, indeed, since he points out here a special favor which he bestows
on his elect, it follows from this that repentance is a true and peculiar work
of the Holy Spirit; for otherwise the sinner, instead of profiting in the
smallest degree, would be more and more hardened by
chastisements.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The pure <i>purging</i>, so that
no <i>dross</i> remains, must not, however, be understood as if God ever
cleansed his Church entirely in this world from every stain, but must be
regarded as spoken after the manner of men; as if he said that the condition of
his Church will be such that her holiness will shine like pure silver. These
words, therefore, indicate real purity, for the Jews had formerly been too well
satisfied with their filthiness. This is a highly appropriate comparison, by
which the Prophet declares, that though the Church was at that time polluted by
many defilements, still some remnant would be left, which, after the removal of
the pollution, would regain its brightness. In this manner he also connects both
clauses; for when he formerly spoke of their crimes, he said that their
<i>silver had become dross</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:22.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will restore thy judges
as at the first</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He now speaks without a
figure; and having said that the source and origin of the evils was in the
princes, he shows that a divine hand will purify that rank, when the Lord shall
be pleased to restore the Church to perfect health. And, indeed, when they who
rule are good and holy men, public order is maintained; for when wicked men have
power, everything goes to ruin. By <i>judges and counsellors</i> are evidently
meant any kind of magistrates; and when he promises that they will be such as
they were <i>at the beginning</i>, he brings to their remembrance the
extraordinary goodness of God, of which they had been deprived. God had
graciously raised up the throne of David, and in that government was pleased to
give a bright resemblance of his own parental love. Though the authority of the
family of David had degenerated into the grossest tyranny, yet they continued to
boast of a false title; for they still vaunted of the reign of David in the same
manner as the papists of the present day plume themselves on a false pretense of
the Church. Justly, therefore, are the people reminded of the happiness from
which they had fallen by their own fault, that they might not be displeased at a
diminution of their numbers, by means of which they would again possess that
order which God had
established</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shalt thou be
called</i>. </font><font face="Palatino">He describes the fruit of that
reformation, of which he has spoken, as extending to the whole body; for, having
said that Jerusalem, before she revolted from God, was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful city, full of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the Prophet now says, that when
she shall have been chastised the same virtues will be illustriously displayed
in her. Here, too, is expressed the sum of true repentance; for by
<i>righteousness</i> is meant uprightness, when every man obtains what belongs
to him, and men live with each other without committing injury. The word
<i>faithful</i> has a still more extensive meaning; for when a city is called
<i>faithful</i>, it means not only that justice and honesty between man and man
are observed, but that the purity of God's worship is maintained and therefore
the chastity and purity of the mind are included under that
designation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It must also be observed, however,
that from this <i>faithfulness</i> springs justice; for when we adhere to truth
in our mutual intercourse, justice easily gains the ascendency. And, indeed,
when I closely examine the whole passage, I think that the Prophet now employs
the word <i>faithfulness</i> in a more limited sense than formerly, and connects
the two virtues as leading to the same object, so that, while truth goes first
as the cause, justice is the effect of it. Isaiah promises not only that she
will be <i>righteous</i> and <i>faithful</i>, but that she will also be
distinguished by these commendations; by which he means that the knowledge or
reputation of it will be everywhere diffused. We know that hypocrites, too, are
adorned with honorable titles; but Isaiah, having introduced God as speaking,
takes for granted that the city will actually be <i>righteous</i>, as it is
foretold that she shall be. In the meantime, as I have said, he describes the
fruit of a true conversion; as if he had said," When Jerusalem shall be brought
Jack to true godliness, men will be persuaded that she is
renewed."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
<i>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He
confirms the same doctrine; and because the restoration of the Church was hard
to be believed, he shows that it does not depend on the will of men, but is
founded on the <i>justice</i> and <i>judgment</i> of God; as if he had said,
that God will by no means permit his Church to be altogether destroyed, because
he is <i>righteous</i>. The design of the Prophet, therefore, is to withdraw the
minds of the godly from earthly thoughts, that in looking for the safety of the
Church they may depend entirely on God, and not cease to entertain good hopes,
although instead of aids they should see nothing but obstructions. It is a great
mistake to consider <i>justice</i> and <i>judgment</i> to refer to the Church,
as if Isaiah were speaking about the well-ordered condition of a city; for the
plain meaning is what I have stated, that though men yield no assistance, the
justice of God is fully sufficient for redeeming his Church. And, indeed, so
long as we look at ourselves, what hope are we entitled to cherish? How many
things, on the contrary, immediately present themselves that are fitted to
weaken our faith! It is only in the justice of God that we shall find solid and
lasting ground of
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they that
return to her</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
second clause points out the manner of their deliverance; namely that the
exiles, who had been widely dispersed, will again be gathered
together.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the destruction of the
transgressors</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Lest hypocrites should imagine
that any fruit of these promises belongs to them, and should indulge in vain
boasting, he threatens that they shall perish, though God redeem his Church. For
hypocrites have always been mingled with the Church, and indeed are connected
with it in the closest manner; but they form their estimation of it from outward
show. All that God promises they at once apply confidently to themselves. The
apostle tears from them this trust, if indeed it deserve the name of trust,
which springs from pride and the arrogance of a haughty mind. Here we ought to
observe how great wisdom is needed by godly teachers, that, while they terrify
the wicked by the judgment of God, they may at the same time support good men,
and strengthen them by some consolation, that they may not be cast down and
discouraged. On the other hand, when believers are encouraged be the promise of
God, and when wicked men falsely apply it to themselves, and puff up their minds
with vain confidence, the method and course which we ought to pursue is, that we
neither give occasion to wicked men to become proud, nor depress and discourage
the minds of the godly; as Isaiah does in this passage. For while he speaks of
the redemption of the Church, he at the same time threatens that sinners, that
is, wicked men, shall be destroyed, that they may not suppose that these acts of
God's kindness belong at all to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet,
while he pronounces destruction against the wicked, by this comparison he
exhibits more fully the favor of God towards believers, which is far more
distinctly seen, when God allows the reprobate to perish, but preserves his own
in safety, as it is said,</font><br></div>

awaited the ungodly, to render

this meaning is set aside by the context; for immediately afterwards he adds the
word groves:</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Ye shall be ashamed
of the groves which you have chosen</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now, under
the image both of trees and of groves, the Prophet, by a figure of speech, in
which a part is taken for the whole, reproves every kind of false worship; for
although among the Jews there were many forms of idolatry, the custom here
mentioned, of choosing <i>groves</i> and <i>forests</i> for offering sacrifices,
was the most common of all. Whether the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twng</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gannoth</i>) in the second clause be translated <i>groves</i> or
<i>gardens</i>, there can be no doubt that it means the altars and sacred
buildings in which they performed their idolatrous worship. Although they did
not intend openly to revolt from God, they invented new kinds of worship; and,
as if one place had been more acceptable to God than another, they devoted it to
his service, as we see done by the papists. Next follows a change of the person;
for, in order to make the reproof more severe, those wicked men of whom he spoke
in the third person are now directly addressed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall be
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which
you have desired</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> By the word <i>desired</i> he
reproves the mad and burning eagerness with which wicked men follow their
superstitions. They ought to have been earnestly devoted with their whole heart
to the service of one Gods but they rush with blind violence to false worship,
as if they were driven by brutish lust. In almost every human mind there
naturally exists this disease, that they have forsaken the true God, and run mad
in following idols; and hence Scripture frequently compares this madness to the
loves of harlots, who shake off shame, as well as
reason.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the gardens that
ye have chosen</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> That the Prophet describes not
only their excessive zeal, but their presumption, in corrupting the worship of
God, is evident from this second clause, in which he says that they <i>chose
gardens</i>, for this term is contrasted with the injunction of the law.
Whatever may be the plausible appearances under which unbelievers endeavor to
cloak their superstitions, still this saying remains true, that <i>obedience is
better than all sacrifices</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22.) Accordingly, under the term willworship
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejqeloqrhskei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
Paul includes
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:23) all kinds of false worship which men contrive for themselves without the
command of God. On this account God complains that the Jews have despised his
word, and have delighted themselves with their own inventions; as if he had
said, "It was your duty to obey, but you wished to have an unfettered choice, or
rather an unbounded liberty."</font><br><font face="Palatino">This single
consideration is sufficient to condemn the inventions of men, that they have it
not in their power to choose the manner of worshipping God, because to him alone
belongs the right to command. God had at that time enjoined that sacrifices
should not be offered to him anywhere else than at Jerusalem
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:13); the Jews thought that they pleased him in other places, and that false
imagination deceived also the heathen nations. Would that it had gone no
farther! But we see how the papists are involved in the same error, and, in
short, experience shows that the disease has prevailed extensively in every
age.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be objected that there was not so
much importance in the place, that God ought to have regarded with such strong
abhorrence the worship which was everywhere offered to him, &#8212; first, we
ought to consider the reason why God chose that at that time there should be
only one altar, which was, that it might be a bond of holy unity to an
uncivilized nation, and that by means of it their religion might continue
unchanged. Besides, granting that this spiritual reason were but of temporary
force, we must hold by the principle that commandments were given in the
smallest matters, that the Jews might be better trained to obedience; for since
superstition conceals itself under the pretense of devotion, it is hardly
possible but that men will flatter themselves with their own inventions. But
since obedience is the mother of true religion, it follows that when men
exercise their own fancy, it becomes the source of all
superstitions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It must also be added, that as
Isaiah formerly complained of those crimes which were contrary to brotherly love
and to the second table of the law, so he now complains of their having
transgressed the first table. For since the whole perfection of righteousness
consists in keeping the law, when the Prophets wish to reprove men for their
sins, they speak sometimes of the first, and sometimes of the second, table of
the law. But we ought always to observe the figurative mode of expression, when
under one class they include the
whole.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>

restricted the worship of God; for, having mentioned <i>gardens</i>, he
reproaches them with the confidence which they placed in theme and threatens
drought. "You take pleasure," says he, "in your gardens and trees, but you shall
be like withered trees that have lost their foliage." God therefore mocks the
vain boasting of idolaters, who marvellously flatter themselves with their
contrivances, and think that heaven is open to them, when they are employed in
their ceremonies. Just as at the present day, when the papists have lighted
their lamps and adorned their temples, when they dazzle with gold and precious
stones, when they have played on their organs and rung their bells, they imagine
that they are the happiest of all men, as if there were now no reason to dread
that any evil should come to them from God, who had received from them a

Some think that he expresses the repentance of idolaters, by telling us that
they would acknowledge their folly, and, being covered with shame, would burn
their idols. But I consider the meaning to be different; for as a fire is made
of dry fuel such as tow, "in like manner," saith the Prophet," gather you and
your idols into one heap, as when a pile of wood is built up, that you may be
consumed together, so that the idols may be like tow, and the men like fire, and
that one conflagration may consume the
whole."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there shall be

that the Prophets, when they mention the wrath of God, describe it by outward
representations, because it cannot be perceived by the eyes or by any other
sense. Thus the wrath of God, by which the ungodly are destroyed, is compared to
fire, which consumes all things. It is now evident enough what the Prophet
means, namely, that all the ungodly shall be destroyed, whatever may be the
nature of their confidence; and not only so, but that their destruction shall be
the greater, because they have placed their confidence in false and deceitful
things, and that utter destruction will overtake them from that very quarter
from which they had vainly looked for deliverance. For the images and idols are
excitements of the wrath of God, kindling it into a flame which cannot be
quenched.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word that Isaiah the son of
Amok saw</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This prophecy is a confirmation of
that doctrine which we had a little before, concerning the restoration of the
Church. For since it is difficult to cherish the hope of safety, when we are, as
it were, in the midst of destruction, while the wrath of God burns and consumes
everything far and wide, or while his threatenings strike terror into our minds,
at such a period the bare promises are hardly sufficient to support us and to
allay our fears. For this reason the Lord determined that to the consolation
which had already been proclaimed there should be added this special vision, by
way of confirmation, in order to make it more certain and undoubted that,
whatever calamities might arise, his Church would never perish. I have no doubt,
therefore, but that this vision agrees with what is stated in the 26th and 27th
verses of the former chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn
what was the advantage and design of <i>visions</i>; for since doctrine
sometimes has not sufficient weight with us, God therefore adds <i>visions</i>,
that by means of them he may seal his doctrine to us. Since, therefore, this
vision is connected with the former promise, we learn from it this useful
doctrine, that all visions of every kind which God formerly gave to his Prophets
must be joined to the promises in such a manner as to be seals of them. And thus
we perceive more and more the astonishing goodness of God, that, not satisfied
with giving us his bare word, he places before our eyes, as it were,
representations of the events.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He has added a
confirmation, that the restoration of the Church is a matter of very great
importance, and necessary to be known. For where is the truth of the Lord, where
is faith, if there be no Church? If there be none, it follows that God is a
liar, and that everything contained in his word is false. But as God frequently
shows, by striking proofs, that he preserves the Church by unknown methods and
without the assistance of men, so he now declares by a remarkable prediction
that he will do this.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There were two purposes to
be served by this prediction. First, since Isaiah, and others who came after
him, were unceasingly to proclaim terror, on account of the obstinate wickedness
of the people, until the temple should be burnt, and the city destroyed, and the
Jews carried into captivity, it was necessary that such severity should be
mitigated towards believers by some consolation of hope. Secondly, as they were
to languish in captivity, and as their minds were shaken, even after their
return, by a succession of varied calamities, and at length were almost
overwhelmed with despair by the dreadful desolation and confusion, they might a
hundred times have fainted, if they had not been upheld. As to those who had
already fallen, they were raised up and confirmed by the promised restoration,
to such an extent, at least, that they retained among them the practice of
calling on God, which is the only and undoubted remedy for the worst of evils.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbdh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>haddabar</i>,) <i>the word</i>, is rendered by some interpreters <i>the
thing</i>, which accords with the general signification of this term; but it is
better to view it as denoting a divine purpose. Isaiah says that it was revealed
to him by a special vision.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass in the
last of the days</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he mentions the end or completion of
days, let us remember that he is speaking of the kingdom of Christ; and we ought
also to understand why he gives to the kingdom of Christ this appellation. It
was because till that time everything might be said to be in a state of
suspense, that the people might not fix their eyes on the present condition of
things, which was only a shadow, but on the Redeemer, by whom the reality would
be declared. Since Christ came, therefore, if that time be compared with ours,
we have actually arrived at <i>the end of ages</i>. It was the duty of the
fathers who lived at that time to go, as it were, with outstretched arms to
Christ; and since the restoration of all things depended on his coming, it is
with good reason that they are enjoined to extend their hope to that period. It
was indeed always useful for them to know, that under Christ the condition of
the Church would be more perfect; more especially because they were held under
figures, for the Lord was pleased to arouse them in various wavy for the express
purpose of keeping them in suspense.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But there
was a peculiar importance attached to this prediction; for, during four hundred
years or thereby, there were innumerable occasions on which they might have
fainted, had they not called to remembrance that fullness of days, in which the
Church was to be perfectly restored. During the various storms, therefore, by
which the Church was nearly overwhelmed, every believer, when shipwrecked,
seized on this word as a plank, that by means of it he might be floated into the
harbour. Yet it ought to be observed, that while the fullness of days began at
the coming of Christ, it flows on in uninterrupted progress until he appear the
second time for our salvation.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580928&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:28.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the mountain of
the Lord's house shall be established</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This
vision might be thought to wear the aspect of absurdity, not only because Zion
was a little hill of no extraordinary height, just as if one should compare a
handful of earth to huge mountains; but because he had but a little before
predicted its destruction. How, then, could it be believed that Mount Zion,
after having lost all her greatness, would again shine with such lustre as to
draw upon her the eyes </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of all the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">? And yet she is extolled as if she hail
been loftier than Olympus." Let the Gentiles," says Isaiah, "boast as much as
they please of their lofty mountains; for they shall be nothing in comparison of
that hill, though it be low and inconsiderable." According to nature, this
certainly was very improbable. What! shall Zion be hung up in the clouds? And
therefore there can be no doubt that wicked men scoffed at this prediction; for
ungodliness has always been ready to break forth against
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now the peculiarity which I have noticed
tended to weaken the belief of this prediction; for when Zion, after the
destruction of the temple, had fallen into the deepest disgrace, how could she
rise again so suddenly? And yet it was not in vain that Isaiah prophesied; for
at length this hill was actually raised above all the mountains, because from it
was heard the voice of God, and sounded through the whole world, that it might
lift us up to heaven; because from it the heavenly majesty of God shone
brightly; and lastly, because, being the sanctuary of God, it surpassed the
whole world in lofty excellence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The use of this
prophecy deserves our attention. It was, that Isaiah intended to bring
consolation, which would support the minds of the people during the captivity;
so that, although there should be no temple, and no sacrifices, and though all
should be in ruins, still this hope would be cherished in the minds of the
godly, and, amidst a condition so desolate and so shockingly ruinous, they would
still reason thus: "The mountain of the Lord is indeed forsaken, but there he
will yet have his habitation; and greater shall be the glory of this mountain
than of all others." To prevent them, therefore, from doubting that such would
be the result, the Prophet has here, as it were, sketched a picture in which
they might behold the glory of God; for although the mountain was still in
existence, yet a disgraceful solitude made it almost an object of detestation,
since it had lost its splendor in consequence of having been forsaken by God.
But it was the duty of the pious to look not at those ruins, but at this vision.
Moreover, the reason why he speaks in such lofty terms concerning the exaltation
of Mount Zion is sufficiently evident from what follows; because thence
proceeded the Gospel, in which the image of God shines. Other mountains might
excel it in height; but as the glory of God has surpassing excellence, so the
mountain in which he is manifested must also be highly distinguished. It was
not, therefore, on her own account that he extolled Mount Zion, but in respect
of her ornament, the splendor of which would be communicated to the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And many people shall go</i>.
</font><font face="Palatino">In the former verse he had slightly noticed the
reason why Mount Zion would hold so high a rank. It was because all nations
would flow to it, as if the rivers were overflowing through the great abundance
of waters. He now makes the same statement, and assigns the reason; for it might
be asked why various nations flocked to it in crowds from distant lands. He
says, therefore, that the desire of serving God was their
motive.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>rabbim</i>,) <i>many</i>, implies a contrast; for it means that there will
not be, as formerly, but one nation which devotes itself to the worship of the
true God, but that those who formerly were <i>strangers and foreigners</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:19) will come into the same agreement with them about religion; as if he had
said that the Church, which had formerly been, as it were, shut up in a corner,
would now be collected from every quarter. By the word <i>many</i> he meant
<i>various</i>; for unquestionably he did not intend to weaken the force of what
he had said a little before about <i>all nations</i>. Now, though this was never
fulfilled, that the nations of the whole world, each of them leaving their
native country, made a journey into Judea; yet, because the doctrine of the
gospel, by which God hath gathered to himself a Church indiscriminately out of
all nations, proceeded from Mount Zion, he justly says that they will come to it
who having, with one consent of faith, embraced the covenant of eternal
salvation, have been united into one Church. We must also observe the harmony
between the figures of the law and that spiritual worship which began to be
introduced at the coming of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall say,
Come</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he first declares that the
godly will be filled with such an ardent desire to spread the doctrines of
religion, that every one not satisfied with his own calling and his personal
knowledge will desire to draw others along with him. And indeed nothing could be
more inconsistent with the nature of faith than that deadness which would lead a
man to disregard his brethren, and to keep the light of knowledge choked up
within his own breast. The greater the eminence above others which any man has
received from his calling so much the more diligently ought he to labor to
enlighten others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This points out to us also the
ordinary method of collecting a Church, which is, by the outward voice of men;
for though God might bring each person to himself by a secret influence, yet he
employs the agency of men, that he may awaken in them an anxiety about the
salvation of each other. By this method he likewise strengthens their mutual
attachment, and puts to the test their willingness to receive instruction, when
every one permits himself to be taught by
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next Isaiah shows that those who take
upon them the office of teaching and exhorting should not sit down and command
others, but should join and walk along with them as companions; as we see that
some men are very severe instructors, and eager to urge others forward, who yet
do not move a step. But here believers, instead of addressing to their brethren
the command, Go up, rather lead the way by their own example. This is the true
method, therefore, of profitable teaching, when, by actually performing what we
demand, we make it evident that we speak with sincerity and
earnestness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will teach
us in his ways</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
shows, first, that God cannot be worshipped aright until we have been
enlightened by doctrine; and, secondly, that God is the only teacher of the
Church, on whose lips we ought to hang. Hence it follows that nothing is less
acceptable to God than certain foolish and erring services which men call
devotion and likewise, that though he employs the agency of men in teaching,
still he reserves this as his own right, that they must utter nothing but his
word. Had this rule been followed by those who called themselves teachers of the
Church religion would not have been so shamefully corrupted by a wide and
confused diversity of superstitions. Nor is it possible that we shall not be
carried away into various errors, where we are tossed about by the opinions of
men. Justly therefore, does Isaiah, when he claims for God alone the power and
authority to teach the Church, shut the mouths of all mortals; so that the
office of teaching is committed to pastors for no other purpose than that God
alone may be heard there. Let those who wish to be reckoned ministers of Christ
allow themselves to be regulated by this statement, that they may take nothing
away from his authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wykrdm
wnrwyw</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>veyorenu midderachaiv</i>) may be
literally rendered, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will teach
us OF his ways</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> which means, "He will
show us what his ways are," or, he will set before us his ways for a perfect
instruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next he adds obedience,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we will walk in his
paths</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"> by which he points out both the object
and the result; for the instruction which is delivered to us from the mouth of
the Lord is not mere speculation, but directs the course of our life, and leads
us to obey him. But we ought also to observe, that the commandments of God are
called ways and <i>paths</i>, in order to inform us that they go miserably
astray who turn aside from them in the smallest degree. Thus every kind of
unlawful liberty is restrained, and all men, from the least even to the
greatest, are enjoined to observe this rule of obedience, that they keep
themselves within the limits of the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For out of Zion shalt go
forth the law</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This is an explanation of the
former verse, in which he said that Mount Zion will be placed above all
mountains; that is, that she will be raised to the highest pitch of honor, when
she shall become the fountain of saving doctrine, which shall flow out over the
whole world. He calls it <i>the law</i>; but we have elsewhere spoken of the
derivation and meaning of this word; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>torah</i>) means <i>instruction</i>, and the most complete of all kinds of
instruction is contained in <i>the law</i>. He speaks, therefore, after the
manner of the prophets; for since the rule of godliness was to be obtained from
the law, they were wont, by a figure of speech, (synecdoche,) in which a part is
taken for the whole, to include under the word <i>law</i> all the instruction
which God has given; just as under the word <i>altar</i> they include the whole
worship of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, since we know that this
prediction was fulfilled, when the preaching of the gospel began at that very
place, (for Christ first taught at Jerusalem, and afterwards his doctrine was
spread throughout the whole world,) we must not take the word law in a limited
sense; for at that time, as to its figures and bondage, it was rather abolished.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420246&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:46;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:10;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;264701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
47:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422447&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:47.) Hence we conclude that the term is applied, without limitation, to the
word of God. And when the prophets say that waters will spring out of the temple
to water the whole world,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;264701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
47:1,) they express metaphorically what Isaiah lays down in plain language;
namely, that the source of saving doctrine will be from that place; for out of
it the apostles and other teachers spread the gospel through the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must observe the reason why the
Prophet made these statements. It was, that he might fortify the godly against
various changes, which otherwise, on manifold occasions, might have crushed
their minds; and therefore it was of great importance to provide against
offenses, and to fortify the minds of the godly. "Whatever may be the condition
of your affairs, and though you should be oppressed by afflictions on all sides,
still continue to cherish this assured hope, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law will go forth out of
Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for this is an infallible decree of God, which no diversity or change of events
will make void."</font><br><font face="Palatino">How much the godly needed this
consolation may be easily inferred from the course of events which immediately
followed; for when Judea had been forsaken, the temple destroyed, the worship of
Goal overturned, and the comely order of the Church utterly defaced while
tyranny became more and more oppressive, it was natural that their minds should
be discouraged, and that all hope should be thrown away. On the other hand,
after the return of the Jews from Babylon, when dreadful superstitions gradually
obtained prevalence, and the priests, instead of discharging their office in a
lawful manner, grasped at wicked tyranny, what else could have occurred to the
minds of the goodly than that religion had fallen into neglect, and that the
worship of Goal was entirely laid aside, if they had not been supported by this
promise? For there can be no doubt that this temptation, which arose out of
internal vices, was more injurious than their banishment into Babylon. So long
as they were exiles, they had at least prophets, by whose instruction they were
encouraged; but in that state of corruption the good effect of instruction had
been lost, and no regard was paid to religion or godliness. But by the aid of
this prediction alone the Lord granted to them the support which they needed.
For why had <i>the law</i>, which God appeared to have consecrated for himself
in his own habitation, been thrown down and basely trampled under foot? Who,
then, would have thought not only that it would have a place there, but that it
would also reign in all foreign places, and in the most distant regions? On the
other hand, the Prophet declares not only that <i>the law</i> will remain in its
place, but that it will travel further; by which he means that it will not be
confined within its former boundaries, for it will be proclaimed to the Gentiles
without distinction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And undoubtedly this had
very great authority and weight with the Apostles, when they knew that they were
appointed to perform those things which are here promised. Otherwise they would
never have had courage enough to venture to undertake the office, and, in short,
would not have been able to endure the burden, especially when the whole world
furiously opposed them. But they knew that he by whom this had been promised,
and from whom they had received authority to deliver this message, would easily
remove every obstacle. It ought also to be observed that we obtain from it a
strong confirmation of our faith, when we learn that the doctrine of the gospel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came forth out of
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">; because we thence conclude that it is not
new, or lately sprung up, but that it is the eternal truth of God, of which a
testimony had been given in all ages before it was brought to
light.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We also infer that it was necessary that
all the ancient ceremonies should be abolished, and that a new form of teaching
should be introduced, though the substance of the doctrine continue to be the
same; for <i>the law</i> formerly proceeded out of Mount Sinai,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:20,) but now it proceeded </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out
of Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and therefore it assumed a new form.
Two things, therefore, must be observed; first, that the doctrine of God is the
same, and always agrees with itself; that no one may charge God with
changeableness, as if he were inconsistent; and though the law of the Lord be
now the same that it ever was, yet it came

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall judge among the

(<i>shaphat</i>,) <i>to judge</i>, means <i>to govern</i> or<i> to reign</i>.
since, therefore, God had not taken more than one nation to be subject to his
reign, the Prophet here shows that the boundaries of his kingdom will be
enlarged, that he may rule over various nations. He likewise notices indirectly
the difference between the kingdom of David, which was but a shadow, and this
other kingdom, which would be far more excellent. At that time God ruled over
his chosen people by the hand of David, but after the coming of Christ he began
to reign by himself, that is, in the person of his only-begotten Son, who was
truly <i>God manifested in the flesh</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:16.) The prophets sometimes employ the name of <i>David</i> when they
are speaking about the kingdom of Christ, and they do so with propriety, that
is, with respect to his human nature; for the Redeemer had been promised to
spring from that family.

evident how much more excellent is the condition of the new Church than that of
the ancient Church, since God hath revealed himself as King in his Son. And
again he confirms the calling of the Gentiles, because Christ is not sent to the
Jews only, that he may reign over them, but that he may hold his sway over the
whole world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall rebuke
many nations</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The word

(<i>yakach</i>) sometimes means to <i>expostulate</i>, sometimes <i>to
correct</i>, and likewise <i>to prepare</i>; but the ordinary interpretation is
most suitable to this passage, in which the Prophet speaks of the reformation of
the Church. For we need correction, that we may learn to submit ourselves to
God; because, in consequence of the obstinacy which belongs to our nature, we
shall never make progress in the word of God, till we have been subdued by
violence. Accordingly, Christ makes the beginning of preaching the gospel to be,
<i>that the world be reproved concerning sin</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:8.) That the doctrine may not be without profit, Isaiah shows that the
stubbornness of our flesh must be subdued; and therefore he attributes to God
the office of a <i>reproving judge</i>, that he may try our life, and, by
condemning our vices, may effect a reformation of our morals. And, indeed, we
see how little effect is produced by the gospel unless where that power of the
Spirit is exercised which leads men to
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall
beat their swords into ploughshares</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He next
mentions the beneficial result which will follow, when Christ shall have brought
the Gentiles and the nations under his dominion. Nothing is more desirable than
peace; but while all imagine that they desire it, every one disturbs it by the
madness of his lusts; for pride, and covetousness, and ambition, lead men to
rise up in cruelty against each other. Since, therefore, men are naturally led
away by their evil passions to disturb society, Isaiah here promises the
correction of this evil; for, as the gospel is the <i>doctrine of
reconciliation</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:18,) which removes the enmity between us and God, so it brings men
into peace and harmony with each other. The meaning amounts to this, that
Christ's people will be meek, and, laying aside fierceness, will be devoted to
the pursuit of peace.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This has been improperly
limited by some commentators to the time when Christ was born; because at that
time, after the battle of Actium, the temple of
Janus</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was
closed, as appears from the histories. I readily admit that the universal peace
which existed throughout the Roman empire, at the birth of Christ, was a token
of that eternal peace which we enjoy in Christ. But the Prophet's meaning was
different. He meant that Christ makes such a reconciliation between God and men,
that a comfortable state of peace exists among themselves, by putting an end to
destructive wars. For if Christ be taken away, not only are we estranged from
God, but we incessantly carry on open war with him, which is justly thrown back
on our own heads; and the consequence is, that everything in the world is in
disorder.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, Isaiah promises that, when
the gospel shall be published, it will be an excellent remedy for putting an end
to quarrels; and not only so, but that, when resentments have been laid aside,
men will be disposed to assist each other. For he does not merely say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swords shall be broken in pieces,
but they shall be turned into mattocks</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by
which he shows that there will be so great a change that, instead of annoying
one another, and committing various acts of injustice, as they had formerly
done, they will henceforth cultivate peace and friendship, and will employ their
exertions for the common advantage of all; for <i>mattocks</i> and
<i>pruning-hooks</i> are instruments adapted to agriculture, and are profitable
and necessary for the life of man. He therefore shows that, when Christ shall
reign, those who formerly were hurried along by the love of doing mischief, will
afterwards contend with each other, in every possible way, by acts of
kindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither shall they
practice war any more</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dml</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lamad</i>) signifies either <i>to be accustomed to</i>, or <i>to learn</i>.
But the meaning of the Prophet is plain enough, that they will not train
themselves in destructive arts, and will not strive with each other in acts of
cruelty and injustice, as they were formerly accustomed to do. Hence we infer
that they have made little proficiency in the gospel, whose hearts have not been
formed to meekness, and among whom there does not yet reign that brotherly love
which leads men to perform kind offices to each other. But this cannot be done
before the consciences have been brought into a state of peace with God; for we
must begin there, in order that we may also be at peace with
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some madmen torture this passage to promote
anarchy,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnarci&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
as if it took away from the Church entirely the right to use the sword, and
bring it forward for condemning with great severity every kind of wars. For
example, if a prince defend the people entrusted to him, and protect them
against injustice, those people say, "It is unlawful for Christians to use the
sword." But it is easy to reply to this; for the Prophet speaks metaphorically
about the kingdom of Christ, which leads men, through mutual kindness, to become
reconciled to each other. The Scriptures frequently employ a metaphor, in which
the thing signified is denoted by a sign; as in that passage,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He who hath not a sword,
let him buy one.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422236&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
22:36.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ certainly did not intend to induce his
followers to fight, but intimated that the time of war was at hand. 0n the other
hand, we are told that swords shall cease to exist, or shall be beaten down to
serve a different purpose, when hatred and fighting shall be at an end, and when
they who formerly were at enmity shall be reconciled to each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be objected that, in a state of
harmony and peace, the sword will no longer be needed. I reply, that peace
exists among us just as far as the kingly power of Christ is acknowledged, and
that these two things have a mutual relation. Would that Christ reigned entirely
in us! for then would peace also have its perfect influence. But since we are
still widely distant from the perfection of that peaceful reign, we must always
think of making progress; and it is excessive folly not to consider that the
kingdom of Christ here is only beginning. Besides, God did not gather a Church
&#8212; by which is meant an assembly of godly men &#8212; so as to be separate
from others; but the good are always mixed with the bad; and not only so, but
the good have not yet reached the goal, and are widely distant from that
perfection which is required from them. The fulfillment of this prophecy,
therefore, in its full extent, must not be looked for on earth. It is enough, if
we experience the beginning, and if, being reconciled to God through Christ, we
cultivate mutual friendship, and abstain from doing harm to any
one.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O house of
Jacob</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He sharply rebukes the Jews by holding
out the example of the Gentiles; for since, in consequence of the spread of his
kingdom, God would give law to all nations from Mount Zion, so as to ingraft
them into the body of his chosen people, nothing could be more strange than that
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"> should revolt from him, and that, when
strangers were drawing near, the members of the household, who ought to have
been foremost, should withdraw. This is, therefore, not only an exceedingly
vehement exhortation, but also a heavy and sharp complaint. Accordingly, he
addresses them by an honorable name, saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O house of
Jacob,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> come; that he may express more strongly
their ingratitude, which appeared in twist that though they were in the Church
God's first-born, they utterly renounced that right of inheritance which they
held in common with others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is, therefore,
an implied comparison, as if he had said, "Lo, the Gentiles flow together to
Mount Zion, and every one exhorts and urges on his neighbor; they submit to
receive instruction from God, and to be reproved by him and why do you, O
Israelites, you who are the inheritance of God, why do you draw back? Shall the
Gentiles submit to God, and shall you refuse to acknowledge his authority? Has
so great a light been kindled in every part of the world, and shall you not be
enlightened by it? Shall so many waters flow, and will you not drink? What
madness is this, that when the Gentiles run so eagerly, you sit still in
idleness?"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we will walk in
the light of the Lord</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> When he adds <i>we will
walk</i>, he means that <i>the light</i> is placed before their feet, but that
they disregard it by shutting their eyes, and even extinguish it as far as lies
in their power; and yet its brightness draws to it distant
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely thou hast forsaken thy
people</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> In these words he now plainly charges
the people with having a perverse disposition; and he does this not in direct
terms, but, as it were, bursting into astonishment, he suddenly breaks off his
discourse, and, turning to God, exclaims, "Why should I waste words on a nation
grown desperate, which thou, O Lord, hast justly rejected, because, giving
itself up to idolatrous practices, it has treacherously departed from thy
word?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may also be a prediction of punishment
still future which he foresaw by the Spirit; as if he had said, That it was not
wonderful if ruin and desolation were about to overtake Mount Zion on account of
the great crimes of the nation. His design may have been, that so mournful a
spectacle might not be the occasion of despair, and that those who were capable
of being cured might be moved by repentance, and turn to God ere this calamity
arrived. For while the prophets are heralds of God's judgments, and threaten
vengeance against the ungodly, they usually endeavor, at the same time, to bring
as many as they can to some kind of repentance. The servants of God ought never
to lay aside this disposition, which would lead them to endeavor to do good even
to the reprobate, if that were possible.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:25.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to yield
abundant consolation to godly teachers; for when we think that we are speaking
to the deaf, we become faint, and are tempted to give up all exertion, and to
say, "What am I about? I am beating the air." Yet the Prophet does not cease to
exhort those in whom he perceived no ground of comfortable hope; and while he
stands like one astonished at this destruction of the people, he nevertheless
addresses those whom he sees going to ruin. At the same time we must observe
that, however obstinate the ungodly may be, we must pronounce vengeance against
them; and though they refuse and gnaw the bridle, yet, that they may be left
without excuse, we must always summon them to the judgment-seat of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I consider the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>) to mean <i>surely</i>;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
this signification is more suitable, because he breaks off the exhortation which
he had begun, and addresses God. And when he again calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of Jacob,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">this is added for the purpose of imparting
greater vehemence, as is usually done in a moving discourse; as if he had said,
"This holy nation, which God had chosen, is now
forsaken."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they are
replenished from the East</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;dq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kadem</i>) sometimes denotes <i>the east</i>, and sometimes
<i>antiquity</i>, it may be interpreted to mean that they were <i>filled with
ancient manners</i>; because they had again brought into use those superstitions
by which the land of Canaan was formerly infected. For we know that the prophets
often reproach the nation of Israel with resembling the Canaanites more than
they resembled Abraham and the rest of the holy fathers. And, indeed, because
they had been brought into the possession of this land, when the ancient
inhabitants had been driven out, in order that it might be cleansed from its
pollution, and afterwards devoted to holiness, the refusal to change their
wicked customs involved a twofold ingratitude. But as the other meaning &#8212;
<i>from the East</i> &#8212; has been more generally adopted, I have chosen to
retain it; though even in this view the commentators differ, for some consider
the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mem</i>) to denote comparison, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;dqm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mikkedem</i>) to denote <i>more than the inhabitants of thee East</i>, while
others adopt the simpler, and, as I think, the more correct view, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>filled with the
east</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, with the vices which they had
contracted from that quarter; for wicked imitation is amazingly contagious, and
nothing is more natural than that corruptions should glide from one place into
another more distant.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with
divinations, like the Philistines</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This clause
explains the former more fully; for under <i>divinations</i> he includes, by
synecdoche, the impostures of Satan to which heathen nations were addicted. The
Prophet therefore means that they now differ in no respect from <i>the
Philistines</i>, though God had separated them from that people by the privilege
of his adoption; and this was sufficient to bring upon them the severest
condemnation, that they had forgotten their calling, and polluted themselves
with the corrupted and ungodly customs of the Gentiles. Hence it appears that to
sin by the example of another contributes nothing to alleviate the
guilt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And have delighted in
the children of strangers</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The last part of the
verse is interpreted in various ways; because the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the children of
strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is viewed by some metaphorically, as
denoting laws and customs; while others regard them as referring to marriages;
because, by marrying indiscriminately women of foreign extraction, they had
mingled their seed, so that there were many illegitimate children. Jerome gives
a harsher exposition, that they polluted themselves by wicked lusts contrary to
nature. For my own part, I have no doubt that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the children of
strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are meant foreign nations, and not
figuratively the laws themselves. The crime charged against them by the Prophet
therefore is, that, by endeavoring to please the Gentiles, they entangled
themselves in their vices, and thus preferred not only mortal men, but wicked
men, to God. He says that they <i>delighted</i>, because the desire or delight
of wicked imitation effaced from their hearts the love of God and of sound
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their land is filled with silver
and gold</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> We must attend to the order which the
Prophet here observes; for he now enumerates the reasons why the Lord rejected
his people. In the former verse he began with <i>divinations</i> and the customs
of <i>strangers</i>; he now comes down to <i>silver and gold</i>; and afterwards
he will speak of <i>horses and chariots</i>. There can be no doubt that, having
first condemned idolatry, he reproves them, secondly, for covetousness, and,
thirdly, for sinful trust, when men depart from God, and contrive for themselves
vain grounds of confidence. It was not a thing in itself to be condemned, that
this nation had abundance of gold and silver; but because they burned with
insatiable covetousness, and trusted to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>horses and
chariots</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he justly reproves
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) is here viewed by some as denoting a contrast, supposing the
meaning to be, and yet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their land
is filled with silver and gold</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This would show
the ingratitude of the people to be the greater, because, though they enjoyed an
abundance of all good things, they betook themselves, as if their case had been
desperate, to magical arts and to idols, which is much less excusable than if
they had fled to them during their adversity; because, though they were fed to
the full with an abundance of good things, yet they shook off the yoke of God.
In this way he would aggravate the criminality of a nation that fled to idols
freely and of their own accord, even though they were luxuriating in their
abundance. But I do not receive this interpretation, for I think it too
far-fetched. On the contrary, he includes in one continued enumeration the vices
with which that nation was chargeable, <i>covetousness, sinful confidence, and
idolatry</i>. Accordingly, though the opinion of those who explain it as a
contrast be a true opinion, it does not harmonize with this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there is no end
of their treasures</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah proceeds to
illustrate more clearly and forcibly what he has formerly said; for, though it
be not in itself sinful or blamable that a person should possess gold or silver,
provided that he make a proper use of it, he properly launches out against that
wicked desire and mad eagerness to accumulate money, which is most detestable.
He says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is no
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because their eagerness is insatiable, and
goes beyond the bounds of nature. The same opinion must be formed about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>horses and
chariots</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for false confidence is here
reproved. To prevent this evil, the Lord had forbidden kings to gather together
a great multitude of horses or chariots, lest, trusting to them, they should
<i>cause the people to return to Egypt</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:16.) since, therefore, it is difficult for men to have resources of this kind
in abundance without being also lifted up with pride, it was the will of God
that his people should not have them at all, or at least should be satisfied
with a moderate share.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their land is also full of
idols</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He repeats what he had already noticed
about idolatry, but enters into it more fully; and, having first mentioned the
subject itself, he next speaks of the use of it, which almost always follows. It
seldom happens that we do not abuse <i>idols</i> when they are set up among us,
for it is as when fire has been applied to a pile of wood, which must
immediately burn; and wood is not more ready to be set on fire than we are to
follow superstition. In the Hebrew language idols are very properly denominated
by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylyla</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>elilim</i>) which the Prophet here employs, for they are empty things, and
of no value.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
undoubtedly the Holy Spirit intended by this word to reprove the madness of men
who imagined that, by relying on such inventions, they approached nearer to God;
as the papists of the present day, in order to plead for the usefulness of their
idols, boast that they are the books of the unlearned: but we ought rather to
believe the testimony of the Holy Spirit; and even the facts themselves plainly
show what advantage the unlearned derive from them; for, led away by gross
fancies, they imagine to themselves earthly and carnal gods. Hence Jeremiah
justly declares not only that <i>idols</i> are useless, but that they are
teachers of falsehood and lies.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

also attend to this description, in which the Prophet relates that the people
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowed down before the works of
their own hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for how stupid was it that men
should not only worship wood and stone instead of God, but should honor their
own workmanship with the appellation of Deity, which they cannot bestow on
themselves! It is truly shocking and monstrous that, as soon as a block of wood
which lay neglected has received the finishing-stroke from a mortal man, he
presently worships it as if it had been made a God. Although the Prophet
addresses the ancient people, the same reasoning applies to the papists, who
acknowledge no majesty of God but in the works of their own
hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before that which their
own fingers have made</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The repetition is
emphatic, and to the <i>hands</i> he adds the <i>fingers</i>, in order to
exhibit more strongly the grossness of the crime. We must also attend to the
mode of expression, which denotes adoration by means of outward gesture; not
that it is unlawful among men to bend the knee or the head for the sake of
paying public respect, but because he who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bows down
before</i></font><font face="Palatino"> an idol professes to render divine
worship. Consequently, the silly talk of papists about that adoration which they
call <i>Dulia</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">doulei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
is a childish evasion; for when the Prophet speaks of religious worship he
condemns universally every token of
homage.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the mean man boweth
down</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Some commentators read these words in
immediate connection with what goes before, as if the Prophet were proceeding
still farther to show the extent of their criminality. If we adopt this meaning,
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the mean man and the
mighty man</i></font><font face="Palatino"> we must understand all the
Israelites; as if the Prophet said that no man is pure and free from this stain.
Others not improperly are of opinion that he repeats in other words what he had
said about punishment, and that in this way he expresses the destruction which
awaits a people forsaken by God. This will agree best with the scope of the
passage, that all, both small and great, will speedily be overtaken by the ruin
which lays low a whole nation; because amidst so great wickedness there was no
reason to expect deliverance from the vengeance of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, in those two expressions, <i>bow
down</i> and <i>humble</i>, there is a rapid allusion to that <i>bowing down</i>
which he mentioned a little before, as if he had said, "They have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowed
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"> down before idols, therefore God
will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lay them
low</i></font><font face="Palatino"> under a vast weight of calamities." Yet I
have no doubt that he likewise attacks their pride; for it was difficult to
believe that a nation so abundantly supplied with wealth would, in a short
period, be overwhelmed by
calamities.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore forgive
them not;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, <i>thou wilt not forgive
them</i>. This latter clause is explained in two ways, though it does not much
affect the real meaning which of the views you adopt; for the design of the
Prophet is to show that towards such obstinate men God will not be appeased. If
it be taken in the future tense, <i>thou wilt not forgive them</i>, the meaning
will be more easily brought out; but if it be taken as a prayer, <i>forgive them
not</i>, it will amount to the same thing; for we know that, when the prophets,
inflamed by zeal for God, pour out prayers as under the dictation of the Spirit,
they threaten just punishment against the ungodly: and we need not wonder that
the Prophets offended by crimes so numerous and so shocking, kindles into such
warmth that he consigns his countrymen to destruction; for nothing was more dear
to him than the sacred honor of God. But at the same time it must be understood
that he makes a tacit reservation of a remnant; because he does not here speak
of every individual, but of the body of the people, which was so deeply infected
by its vices that there was no hope of cure; otherwise it would have been
unreasonable to give exhortations to repentance, and to hold out the hope of
pardon to men who were incurable and thoroughly obstinate. The meaning therefore
amounts to this, that the restoration of a new Church must not be expected till
God has executed his judgments by destroying the
temple.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Enter into the
rock</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> As ungodly men, for the most part, lull
themselves in excessive indifference about God's threatenings, it is customary
with the prophets, when they threaten sinners, with the view of producing
terror, to add lively descriptions, as if for the purpose of bringing those
matters under the immediate view of men. This is the reason why the Prophet now
bids despisers of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God enter into
the rocks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and caves, to conceal
themselves under ground. And, first, he means that the judgment of God is more
to be dreaded than a thousand deaths, and that for the sake of escaping that
judgment it were to be wished that they should go down into the grave. But, by
addressing men themselves, he gives a more impressive illustration of the weight
of the divine vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From
the dread of the LORD, and from the glory of his
majesty</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Although <i>by the dread of God</i> he
means the scourges by which God would take vengeance on a wicked people, yet it
is not without good reason that he immediately adds, his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>magnificent
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as if he had said, "It is according to
the measure of his own glory that God ought to be dreaded by the ungodly, in
whose destruction he displays his boundless power." But though the ungodly are
not reformed or made to bow down by any punishment, they are forced to tremble
when they feel the presence of the wrath of God. In quite a different manner do
punishments instruct the elect to fear God; for, in consequence of being subdued
by strokes, they learn to bear the yoke. Isaiah therefore declares that the
glory of God will be more illustriously displayed when he shall come forth as a
righteous judge; for when he conceals himself he is not observed, and they
scarcely think of his existence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence let
pastors learn how they ought to deal with drowsy consciences, which must be
awakened by the judgment of God, that they may regard that judgment with actual
<i>dread.</i> Though we often sing to the deaf, yet terror pierces even hearts
of iron, so that they are without excuse. Frequently, too, it happens that some
are healed; and in like manner believers gain advantage from it, when they learn
the terrific forms of punishment which await the ungodly and
reprobate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.</i></b><i>

wealth and quietness and prosperity which they at present enjoy, regard the
threatenings of the Prophets with haughty disdain, and thus harden their hearts
against God, and are even led to indulge in wantonness. 0n this account, Isaiah
here determines, as we have already said, to repress their arrogance; as if he
had said, "The time will come when this pride of yours, by which you vainly and
madly contend against God, shall be brought down." For wicked men, though they
pretend to have some religion, are yet so daring that they raze against God
himself, and imagine that they are higher than God. On the other hand, by
thundering against them, he lays low their haughtiness, that he alone may be
exalted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And this is what we have already said,
that when crimes are allowed to pass unpunished, it is a sort of cloud held
before our eyes, which hinders us from beholding the glory of the Lord; but when
he takes vengeance on men's transgressions, his glory shines forth
illustriously. This is also the reason which Solomon assigns why wicked men are
hardened against God: it is because they think that bad and good men are equally
happy in this world.</font><br></div>

men shall have been brought to their proper level, there will be nothing to
prevent God from being acknowledged to be what he is. It was indeed highly
becoming that the people should, of their own accord, humbly behold the
greatness of God, under whose shadow they were defended; and for this purpose
the posterity of Abraham was so remarkably distinguished by numerous blessings,
that it might be the mirror of the glory and holiness of God. Isaiah now
threatens that, because the Jews have risen up against him, God will employ a
new method of exalting his glory, that is, by their destruction. When he speaks
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lofty
looks</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and <i>loftiness</i>, he employs an
outward gesture to denote the inward pride of the mind; for sinful confidence
almost always betrays, by the very looks, a contempt of God and of men. In the
same sense does David describe<i> the man whose eyes are lofty</i>. (Psalm
1015.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the day of the LORD of hosts
will be on every one that is proud and lofty</i>.</font><font face="Palatino">
In this verse he confirms the same thing more fully and from the vehement manner
in which he heaps up words, we may easily infer how bold was the wickedness
which at that time abounded. But we shall not wonder that he labors so hard to
subdue the arrogance of men, if we consider how difficult it is to bend the
stubbornness of those who, relying on their wealth, are afraid of nothing, and
who suppose that the design of their elevated rank is, that whatever they do
shall pass unpunished. For even at the present day we experience how sensitive
and passionate those men are who make arrogant claims for themselves, and how
obstinately they reject all admonitions. And this is also the reason why the
Prophet uses sharp language against theme instead of threatening vengeance, in
general terms, against the whole nation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it
is not against the princes alone, whose high rank raised them far above other
men, that his invectives are launched; for not only they, but even persons of
the lowest rank, often swell with pride; and, as the common proverb runs, "Every
man carries within him the heart of a king." In like manner, we find that even
the basest persons, if you do but prick them with a pill, vomit out the poison
of intolerable arrogance. Since, therefore, this vice was so widely spread,
Isaiah includes both the highest and the lowest of the people, declaring that in
proportion to the forbearance which God had exercised toward them is the
severity of the impending judgment; for, in consequence of their abundance,
their hearts had swollen to
fierceness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, though the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lamed</i>,)</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is the sign of the dative case, be
sometimes superfluous, yet in this passage it retains its force; for it would
appear that Isaiah appoints a fixed day, as usually happens in judicial trials.
Accordingly, I interpret it to mean that God himself hath previously appointed a
day on which proud men must be summoned to the judgment-seat of God, to receive
a sentence of condemnation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may also learn
from these words that God avows himself to be the enemy of all the proud. This
appointing of a day is therefore to the same effect as if God declared that he
cannot endure men wickedly to indulge in pride, and that they who unduly exalt
themselves cannot escape being crushed by his hand. And if our minds were
sincerely convinced of this, who would not abhor pride, which provokes the anger
of God against us? If any person choose rather to interpret (<i>superbum et
elatum</i>) <i>proud</i> and<i> lofty</i> as in the neuter gender, meaning
<i>that which is proud and lofty</i>, we must understand them to refer to the
fortresses, bulwarks, and fortifications; but the rules of grammar do not admit
of their being applied in any other way than to
persons.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon all the cedars of
Lebanon</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The allegory which is here introduced,
about the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trees of
Lebanon</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the lofty
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">, instead of obscuring, sheds light on
the subject; for however high may be the wishes or endeavors of a mortal man,
yet he will never be able to reach the height of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lofty trees,
which</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it is as easy for God to throw down as
for a breath of wind to scatter the fallen leaves. Accordingly, in what may be
called a painting, Isaiah shows to proud men how idle and foolish they are in
believing that their elevation will be their defense. There is also an implied
exaggeration, which must have contributed to heighten the terror. It cannot be
supposed that God is actually angry with the mountains and trees, or that,
having changed his purpose, he throws down what he has built up; but in the
harmless creatures Isaiah holds out to view the judgment of God, in order more
fully to convince wicked and unprincipled men that their presumption will not
pass unpunished. Thus we see the reason why he mixes up the metaphors of
<i>cedars, oaks</i>, and
<i>mountains</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And upon every lofty
tower</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> What he adds about <i>towers</i> and
<i>walls</i> is not figurative or metaphorical. We know how men, when they think
that they are well defended, congratulate themselves that they no longer need
the assistance of God. Accordingly, under the name of <i>towers and walls</i>
Isaiah mentions the object of false confidence; for if any place seem to be
impregnable, there do irreligious men build their nest, that they may look down
from it on heaven and earth; for they imagine that they are placed beyond all
the uncertainties of fortune. Isaiah therefore threatens that, when it shall
please God to humble men, he will throw down all the defenses on which they
place a false confidence. And although those things are not in themselves evil,
yet because they receive too large a share of our attention, it is with great
propriety that Isaiah sharpens his pen against
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he says about
<i>horses</i> and <i>chariots</i>; for, as we are told by Micah, because men
have improperly relied on earthly riches, they must be altogether deprived of
them, that they may owe this preservation entirely to the hand of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
5:10.) A little before, he had reproved them for the abundance of their horses
(verse 7); he now addresses them about the judgment of God, and warns them that,
as the only possible way of gaining the favor of God, he must take from the Jews
all their horsemen, that they may no longer place sinful reliance on earthly
support.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And upon all ships of
Tarshish</i>. </font><font face="Palatino"><i>Tarshish</i> was unquestionably
the Hebrew name for Cilicia; and as the Jews had much traffic with that nation,
Scripture frequently mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
ships of Tarshish</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which are so called, because
they sailed on that sea. Navigation cannot, indeed, be condemned on its own
account; for, by importing and exporting articles of merchandise, it is of great
advantage to mankind. Nor can any fault be found with this mode of intercourse
between nations; for it is the will of God that the whole human race should be
joined together by, mutual acts of kindness. But as it most frequently happens
that abundance leads to pride and cruelty, Isaiah reproves this kind of
merchandise, which was the chief source of the wealth of the land. Besides, in
that merchandise which is carried on with distant and foreign nations, there is
often a large amount of tricks and dishonesty, and no limit set to the desire of
gain. First, then, Isaiah means that the Jews will be deprived of riches, that
they may learn to submit to God. Secondly, he describes covetousness and
unlawful gains by means of a sign, as if one were to express murder by holding
out a bloody sword.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And upon
elegant pictures</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This second part of the verse
shows still more clearly that the Prophet condemns navigation, which had brought
many corruptions into the land. It is too frequent and common that riches are
followed by luxury, effeminacy, and a superfluity of pleasures, which we
commonly see in wealthy countries and commercial cities; for those who trade by
sea in distant countries are not satisfied with the commodities obtained at
home, but carry away new luxuries which were formerly unknown. Since, therefore,
wealth is usually the mother of superfluity, the Prophet here mentions costly
furniture, as if he had said that the Jews, by adorning their houses at great
expense, draw down upon themselves the judgment of God; for he employs the word
<i>pictures</i>, by a well-known figure of speech, to denote rich tapestry, and
the productions of Phrygia, and vessels framed with consummate
skill</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is certain that the manners of men are
corrupted, when they eagerly pursue, in every direction, superfluous enjoyments
And we see how destruction was brought on the Roman Empire by delicacies of this
nature; for before they traveled into Greece, the greatest moderation prevailed
among them; and no sooner had Asia been vanquished than they began to grow soft
and effeminate; and when their eyes were dazzled by pictures, furniture,
precious stones, and tapestry and their nostrils regaled by ointments and
perfumes, all their senses were immediately overpowered, and, by imitating the
luxury of the East as a higher form of civilization, they began gradually to
indulge in every kind of debauchery.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the loftiness of man shall be
bowed down</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet declares that he had
his eye on men, when he described the various kinds of <i>loftiness</i>; for God
is not displeased saith the steep mountains or tall cedars, which he created,
but informs us that the whole evil lies in men, who vainly trust to what is high
and lofty. It may be objected, that it frequently happens that wicked men are
not rendered more humble by chastisement, but, on the contrary, become more
fierce and obstinate, as is evident from the case of Pharaohs whose hardness of
heart no plagues could subdue,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
8:15, and 3:34;) and consequently that what the Prophet here threatens does not
always take place. I reply, he does not describe the effect of chastisement, as
if God bent rebellious men to obey hills; but the meaning of this passage is,
that, although the hearts of the reprobate be not changed, yet the Lord will not
cease to inflict punishment upon them, till their haughtiness and presumption
are brought low. For, trusting to their wealth and fortifications, they
congratulate themselves, as we have said, on their safety, and do not fear God.
But whatever may be the nature of their defenses, the Lord will easily subdue
and lay them low, and that not only by one or another chastisement, but by
chastisements so numerous and so severe, that they will at length be beaten down
and subdued, will cease to rise up against him, and will acknowledge that they
gain nothing by their insolence and presumption. The next clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the LORD alone shall be
exalted</i></font><font face="Palatino">, has been already
explained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the idols he will utterly
abolish</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> As he had formerly, in his reproof,
joined idolatry with luxury and covetousness, and other views; so he now joins
them in the threatening of
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall enter into the
holes of the rocks</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He had formerly used other
words when addressing them in the second person, <i>Enter into the rock</i>,
(ver. 10,) that he might inflict a severer stroke on their minds. But now he
declares what they will do, and says that they must <i>enter</i>; and hence it
is evident that the former statement was not an exhortation, but a severe
denunciation of the wrath of God, in order to terrify wicked and obstinate men,
who despise all warnings and all
threatenings.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the
presence of the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his
majesty</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> What he adds about the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>terror of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> must be understood to mean that terror
which was thrown into them by the Chaldeans and Assyrians, whose hand he called
a little before, and now also calls,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the glory of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for God employed their agency to chastise
his people. Although they were wicked and treacherous, yet they promoted the
<i>glory</i> of God; for even the devil himself contributes in some way to the
glory of God, though contrary to his wish. Thus he speaks of the Assyrians and
Chaldeans, because in the punishments which the Lord will inflict on the Jews by
their agency we may behold his <i>glory</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
same thing is confirmed by the word <i>Arise</i>, which means to go before the
judgment-seat. In the phrase which immediately follows,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#732;rah
&#732;r[l</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>laarotz haaretz</i>,) <i>to shake

hardly be conveyed in any other
language.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He says that the Lord <i>ariseth</i>,
because he appears to sleep so long as he delays his judgments. But he
<i>ariseth</i>, when he comes forth as a judge to inflict punishments on the
wicked; so as to make it evident to men that nothing escapes the knowledge, or
is hidden from the eyes, of Him who permits no crime to pass
unpunished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day a man will cast away
his idols</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Idolaters are amazingly delighted
with their own superstitions and ungodly worship; for although they abound in
enormities and crimes, still they betake themselves to this refuge, that they
imagine that their worship appeases God. Just as in the present day, if we
should represent the crimes and lawless passions of every kind which abound
among the papists, they certainly will not be able to deny our statements, but
will flatter themselves on this ground, that they have a plausible form of
worship, and will believe that this vail covers all their crimes. Accordingly,
the Prophet deprives idolaters of this cloak, and threatens that they will no
longer be able to conceal their pollution; for the Lord will compel them to
throw away their idols, that they may acknowledge that they had no good reason
for placing their hope and confidence in
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In short, they will be ashamed of their
foolishness; for in prosperity they think that they enjoy the favor of God, as
if he showed that he takes delight in their worship; and they cannot be
convinced to the contrary, until God actually make evident how greatly he abhors
them. It is only when they are brought into adversity that they begin to
acknowledge their wickedness, as Hosea strikingly illustrates by comparing them
to whores, who do not acknowledge their wickedness so long as they make gain,
and live in splendor, but who, when they are deprived of those enjoyments, and
forsaken by their lovers, begin to think of their wretchedness and disgrace, and
enter into the way of repentance, of which they had never thought while they
enjoyed luxury.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:5.) The same thing almost always happens with idolaters, who are not ashamed
of their wickedness, so as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast away their
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino">, until they have been visited by very
sore distress, and made almost to think that they are
ruined.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which they made</i>;
</font><font face="Palatino">that is, which were made for them by the agency of
workmen. Nor was this all unnecessary addition; for he means that pretended gods
are not entitled to adoration: and what sort of gods can they be that have been
made by men, seeing that God exists from himself, and never had a beginning? It
is therefore highly foolish, and contrary to reason, that men should worship the
work of their own hands. So then by this expression, he aggravates their
criminality, that idols, though they are composed of gold or silver, or some
other perishable material, and have been manufactured by men, are yet worshipped
instead of God; and at the same time he states the reason why they are
displeasing to God: it is, because they are worshipped. On what pretense will
the papists now excuse their ungodliness? for they cannot deny that they render
adoration to images; and wherever such worship is performed, there ungodliness
is clearly proved.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into the
holes of the moles and of the bats</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the
holes of the moles</i> he means any filthy places in which they are
disgracefully concealed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall enter into the
clefts of the rocks</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This repetition is not
superfluous, though Isaiah again employs the same words which he had lately
used; for what is so difficult as to impress on the minds of men sincere fear of
God? Nor is it only in hypocrites that we perceive this, but in ourselves, if we
bestow careful attention; for how many things are presented to us by which our
minds ought to be deeply affected, and yet we are scarcely moved! More
especially, it was necessary that this judgment of God should be earnestly
placed before hypocrites, who took delight in wickedness. But now he points out
the severity of God's vengeance by this consideration, that the ungodly choose
rather to be swallowed up by the deepest gulfs than to come under the eye of
God. This, too, is the passage from which Christ borrowed the threatening which
he pronounces on the Jews,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">In that day shall they
say to the mountains cover us; and to the hills, Hide us.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cease therefore from
man</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> These words are clearly connected with
what goes before, and have been improperly separated from them by some
interpreters. For Isaiah, after having addressed the ungodly in threatenings
concerning the judgment of God, exhorts them to refrain from deluding themselves
by groundless confidence; as if he had said, "I see that you are blinded and
intoxicated by false hope, so that no argument can prevail with you; and this
you do, because you claim too much for yourselves. But man is nothing; and you
have to do with God, who can reduce the whole world to nothing by a single act
of his will."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose breath is
in his nostrils</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> The former part of the verse
is explained in various ways; for some interpret it as referring to Christ, and
view the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ruach</i>,) which we render <i>breath</i>, as denoting <i>violence</i>, by a
comparison which is frequently used in other parts of
Scripture;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">
</font><font size="2" color="Maroon">F42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
the nostril as denoting anger, because the outward sign of anger is in the
nostrils. They bring out the meaning in this manner: "Beware of provoking the
anger of Christ."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if we examine the passage closely,
that exposition will be found to be at variance with the meaning of the
words.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others understand it as relating to men
in general, but explain it by that saving, <i>Fear not them who kill the
body</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401028&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:28.) But neither can this interpretation be admitted, which does not agree
either with the time or the occasion, since there was no reason for dissuading
them from the fear of men. But, as I have already said, the context will quickly
remove all doubt; for the commencement of the following chapter clearly explains
and confirms what is here stated; and he who made this division has improperly
separated those things which ought to have been joined together. For the Prophet
is about to add, "The Lord will take from you those things which so highly
elevate your minds, and put you in such high spirits. Your confidence is foolish
and groundless."Such is the connection of what he now says, "Cease therefore
from man, whose breath is in his nostrils."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
first we must see what is meant by <i>breath in the nostril</i>. It denotes
human weakness, or, that the life of man is like a <i>breath</i>, which
immediately vanishes away. And as David says,</font><br></div>

for nothing is more frail.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, when we are
forbidden to place confidence in men, let us begin with ourselves; that is, let
us not in any respect trust to our own wisdom or industry. Secondly, let us not
depend on the aid of man, or on any creature; but let us place our whole
confidence in the Lord. <i>Cursed</i>. says Jeremiah, <i>is
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he who trusteth in
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and who placeth his strength and his aid
in flesh, that is, in outward resources.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:5.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For wherein is he to be
accounted of?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the true method of
repressing haughtiness. Nothing is left to men on which they ought to
congratulate themselves; for the meaning is as if the Prophet had said that the
whole glory of the flesh is of no value. It ought also to be observed that this
is spoken comparatively, in order to inform us, that if there be in us anything
excellent, it is not our own, but is held by us at the will of another. We know
that God has adorned the human race with gifts which ought not to be despised.
We know, also, that some excel others; but as the greater part of men neglect
God, and flatter themselves beyond measure; and as irreligious men go so far as
to think that they are more than gods, Isaiah wisely separates men from God,
which the Holy Spirit also does in many other parts of Scripture: for when we
look at them in themselves, we perceive more fully the frail, and fading, and
transitory nature of their condition. Accordingly, as soon as men begin to make
the smallest claim for themselves, they ought to have an opportunity of
perceiving their vanity, that they may acknowledge themselves to be nothing.
This single expression throws down the pompous applauses of free-will and
merits, by which papists extol themselves in opposition to the grace of God.
That intoxicated self-love, in which irreligious men indulge, is also shaken
off. Lastly, we are brought back to God, the Author of every blessing, that we
may not suppose that anything excellent is to be found but in hilly for he has
not received what is due to hilly until the world has been stripped of all
wisdom, and strength, and righteousness, and, in a word, of all
praise.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For,
behold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We stated, a little before, that this
is the same subject which the Prophet began to treat towards the close of the
former chapter; for he warns the Jews that their wealth, however great it may
be, will be of no avail to prevent the wrath of God, which, when it has once
been kindled, will burn up all their defenses. Hence it follows that they are
chargeable with excessive madness, when, in order to drive away their alarm,
they heap up their forces, strength, and warlike accoutrements, consultations,
armor, abundant supply of provisions, and other
resources.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The demonstrative particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hinneth</i>,) "behold," is employed not only to denote certainty, but to
express the shortness of time, as if Isaiah caused wicked men to be
eye-witnesses of the event; for it frequently happens that they who do not
venture openly to ridicule the judgments of God pass them by, as if they did not
at all relate to them, or were still at a great distance. "What is that to us?"
say they; " Or, if they shall ever happen, why should we be miserable before the
time? Will it not be time enough to think of those calamities when they actually
befall us?" Since, therefore, wicked men, in order to set at naught the
judgments of God, dig for themselves lurking-places of this description, on this
account the Prophet presses them more closely and earnestly, that they may not
imagine that the hand of God is distant, or vainly expect that it will be
relaxed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord Jehovah of
hosts will take away from Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is
also the reason why he calls God the <i>Lord</i> and <i>Jehovah of Hosts</i>,
that the majesty of God may terrify their drowsy and sluggish minds; for God has
no need of titles, but our ignorance and stupidity must be aroused by perceiving
his glory. First, the Prophet threatens that the Jews will have the whole
produce of the harvest taken from them, so that they will perish through famine.
Immediately afterwards he speaks in the same manner about military guards, and
all that relates to the good order of the state. Hence we may infer that the
Jews boasted of the prosperity which they at that time enjoyed, so as to
entertain a foolish belief that they were protected against every danger. But
Isaiah threatens that not only the whole country, but Jerusalem herself, which
was the invincible fortress of the nation, will be exposed to God's
chastisements; as if he had said,"The wrath of God will not only fall on every
part of the body, but will pierce the very
heart."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The power and the
strength.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As to the words </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;[&ccedil;m
hn[&ccedil;mw</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>mashgnen umashgnenah</i>) which
differ only in this respect, that one is in the masculine, and the other in the
feminine genders, I have no doubt that the Prophet intended by this change to
express more fully the certainty that supports of every kind would be broken;
and therefore I have translated them the <i>power</i> and the
<i>strength</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I do not agree with those interpreters
who view it as referring to the persons of men, for it more appropriately
denotes all supports, whatever may be their
nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Still it is doubtful whether the Prophet
limits it to food, or extends it to all other kinds of support, which he
mentions immediately afterwards. But it is natural to suppose that by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[&ccedil;mw
&#710;[&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>mashgnen umashgnenah</i>) is
included generally everything that is necessary to sustain the order of the city
or of the people; and next that, for the sake of explanation, he enumerates some
particulars. The first clause therefore means, "God will take away every help
and assistance by which you think that you are upheld, so that nothing whatever
may be left to support you."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next, he adds, what
will be their want and nakedness; and he begins, as we have said, with food and
nourishment, which hold the first rank in sustaining the life of men. Now there
are two ways in which God takes away the <i>strength</i> of bread and water;
either when he deprives us of victuals, or when he takes from them the power of
nourishing us; for unless God impart to our food a hidden power, the greatest
abundance of it that we may possess will do us no good.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:26.) Hence in another passage God is said to <i>break the staff of bread</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;260416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
4:16,) when <i>the bakers deliver the bread by weight</i>, and yet it does not
yield satisfaction. And this comparison ought to be carefully observed, in order
to inform us that, even though the belly be will filled, we shall always be
hungry, there being nothing but the secret blessing of God that can feed or
support us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Though the hunger which the Prophet
threatens in this passage may be understood to mean that the fields will be
unproductive, or, that God will take away from the Jews every kind of food, yet,
since the Prophets are generally accustomed to borrow their forms of expression
from the law, this interpretation will apply very well. For he might simply have
said, "I will take away the bread and wine;" but he expresses something more
secret when he speaks of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>support of bread and
water;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as if he had said that, though the
people be not reduced to famine, yet God will make them, even while they are
rioting in gluttony, to pine with hunger; for when the blessing of God is
withdrawn, all its usefulness will vanish away. We may sum it up in this manner,
that the people will have no food to strengthen them; either because they will
not have bread and water, or, if they have, will derive no advantage from
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The strong man, and the man of
war</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He mentions other ends which
contribute to the safety and good order either of nations or of cities. Of these
he threatens that the Jews will be wholly deprived, so that they will neither
have wisdom or bravery at battle, nor military forces abroad. He is not careful
to attend to order, but is satisfied with giving a short abridgement, and mixes
one subject with another. He begins with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of
war,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> into whose hands was committed the defense
of the country. God sometimes takes them away by death, and sometimes by making
them soft and effeminate. The latter is more frequent, so that posterity
degenerates from the bravery of ancestors, and those who were formerly
courageous become, in process of time, cowardly and unfit for war. But we see
also that the former sometimes happens, in consequence of which the boldest men
suddenly lose heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The judge
and the prophet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We know that, in the Hebrew
language, the word <i>judge </i>stands for every kind of governors; and it is
certain that by <i>prophets </i>are meant every kind of teachers. Accordingly,
he threatens that the civil government will be set aside, and that instruction
will be at an end, and that thus the Jews will be destroyed; and, indeed
magistrates and teachers hold the same place in the commonwealth that the two
eyes do in the human body.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Aged diviners and old
men
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I consider the same rank as before to be denoted by <i>old men</i>, who are more
fit for governing, because age brings along with it prudence, wisdom, and
gravity. As to the word <i>diviner</i>, though it is used in a bad sense in
Scripture, yet here it appears to be used in a good sense, when Isaiah
enumerates those things which contribute to preserve the good order of a city
and of a kingdoms. The term might, therefore, be applied to a soothsayer, who
divines or penetrates into dark matters, not by omens or superstitious arts, but
by extraordinary acuteness and skill. But as God forbade them to consult
magicians, soothsayers, and <i>diviners</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:20,) and as Balaam himself declares that <i>there is no divination against
Israel</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
23:23,) I do not quarrel with those who would prefer to use the word
<i>diviner</i> as denoting magical <i>divinations</i>; nor will there be any
absurdity in enumerating among the punishments of the nation, that it would be
deprived also of those aids which were sinful and criminal; for along with the
altar and sacrifices Hosea mentions teraphim.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
3:4.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The captain of fifty. He employs this term
agreeably to the custom which then prevailed; for as the Romans had
<i>centurions</i>, or <i>captains of hundreds</i>, so the Jews had
<i>captains</i>, or <i>rulers of fifties</i>, which the Greeks call
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">penthkonta&gt;rcouv</font><font face="Palatino">,
but as that custom did not exist among the Latins, so the name was unknown among
them. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>persons of venerable
aspect</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he means those whose reputation for bravery gave then influence among the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The senator.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The word

(<i>yognetz</i>,) for which I have put <i>senator</i>, may be applied to men in
private life who are eminent for prudence; but as it is strictly applicable to
<i>counsellors</i>, who discharge a public office, I resolved not to depart from
the common opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The sinful artificer.
Because the mechanical arts are not less advantageous for upholding the
prosperity of a nation, and for the support of animal life, Isaiah likewise
mentions that, through the want of them, the destruction of the Jews is at
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And the eloquent.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">he
word which is placed last in the enumeration has been variously explained by
commentators. Literally it means, "skilled in muttering, or in a subdued tone of
speech. "Now since the heathen oracles give out their replies by whisperings or
in <i>mutterings</i>, some think that the word denotes <i>enchantments</i>. A
better exposition is given by those who interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;jl</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lahash</i>) to mean <i>secret designs</i>; but as a style which is both
mysterious and weighty may be not inappropriately denoted by this word, I had no
hesitation in rendering it by the word <i>eloquent</i>. Yet if it be thought
preferable to view it as denoting wise and cautious men, who, though not
qualified for public speaking, give private advices of what may profitably be
done, I have no objection.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must attend to
this comprehensive description of a well-regulated state. For Isaiah has placed
first corn and other things necessary for bodily support; secondly, military
forces; thirdly, skill in governing a nation and the various parts of civil
government; fourthly, the prophetical office; and fifthly, the mechanical arts.
With these ornaments does God adorn the nations which he intends to render safe
and sound; and, on the other hand, he takes them from those nations which he
intends utterly to destroy. Let us, therefore, know that everything which we
find to be profitable for the support of life flows from the undeserved goodness
of God. Hence also there follows another instruction, namely, that we ought to
beware lest, by our ingratitude, we deprive ourselves of those excellent gifts
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will appoint children to be
their princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">That
the vengeance of God may be more manifest, he now describes how sad and wretched
will be the change, when competent and faithful rulers shall be taken from among
them and God shall put cowardly and worthless persons in their room. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children</i></font><font face="Palatino">
are meant not only those who are so by age, but also by mind and conduct, such
as delicate and effeminate persons, who are destitute of courage and cannot
wield the sword entrusted to them. He does not here carry out the contrast,
clause by clause; for he thought it enough to point out one way in which a
commonwealth is speedily ruined; that is, when its rulers are weak and foolish
men like
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
who have no gravity or wisdom. But it must be laid down as a principle, that no
man is qualified for governing a commonwealth unless he have been appointed to
it by God, and be endued with uncommon excellence. Plato, too, understood this
matter well: for though, being a heathen, he had no true knowledge of this kind,
yet his quick sagacity enabled him to perceive that no man is fit and qualified
for public government which has not been prepared for it by God in an
extraordinary measure; for public government proceeds from God alone, and in
like manner every part of it must be upheld by him. Besides, they whom the Lord
does not govern have nothing left for them but to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or rather to be twice children, that is, destitute of all skill and of all
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now the Lord executes this vengeance in
two ways; because it frequently happens, that when we appear to have those who
are grave and skillful in business, no sooner do they come to action than they
stumble like blind men, and have no more wisdom than children; for the Lord
deprives them of that remarkable ability which they had formerly received from
him, and stuns them, as if he had struck them with a thunderbolt. But sometimes
the Lord proceeds more gently, and gradually removes men of extraordinary
ability, who were fit for ruling, and commits the reins of government to those
who were unable to govern a family, or even a single child liken these things
happen, it is very certain that destruction is not far
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, it deserves our notice, as I
lately mentioned, that a well-regulated commonwealth is a singular gift of God,
when the various orders of judges and senators, soldiers, captains, artificers,
and teachers, aid each other by mutual intercourse, and join in promoting the
general safety of the whole people. For when the Prophet threatens, and
pronounces it to be a very severe punishment, that these things shall be taken
away, he plainly shows that those eminent and uncommon gifts of God are
necessary for the safety of nations. Accordingly, he here commends the office of
magistrates, and captains, and soldiers, and likewise the office of teachers.
This deserves our notice in opposition to fanatics, who endeavor to banish from
the world the power of using the sword, together with all civil government and
order. But the Prophet declares that these things are not taken away or removed
unless when God is angry. It follows, therefore, that they who oppose, and, as
far as lies in their power, set aside or destroy such benefits, are wicked men
and enemies of the public safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He likewise
commends instruction, without which a commonwealth cannot stand; for, as Solomon
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">where prophecy is not,
the nation must be ruined.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
29:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, he commends the mechanical arts,
agriculture, manual occupations of every description, architecture, and such
like, which we cannot dispense with; for all artisans of every kind, who
contribute what is useful to men, are the servants of God, and have the same end
in view with those who were formerly mentioned, namely, the preservation of
mankind</font><br><font face="Palatino">The same thing must be said about war;
for, although lawful, war ought to be nothing else than an attempt to obtain
peace; yet sometimes an engagement is unavoidable, that they who have the power
of the sword may use it, and defend themselves and their followers by arms. War,
therefore, is not in itself to be condemned; for it is the means of preserving
the commonwealth. But neither must eloquence be despised; for it is often
needed, both in public and in private life, that something may be clearly and
fully explained and demonstrated to be true. This is also reckoned among the
gifts and important blessings of God, when a state abounds in wise and eloquent
men,</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The people will oppress every man
his neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He describes the utmost
confusion, which was about to overtake the Jews, when order was destroyed or
relaxed; and this will happen to all nations, as soon as government is removed
or falls to the ground. We know how great is the wantonness of the human mind,
when every man is hurried along by ambition and, in short, how furious the
lawless passions are when they are laid under no restraint. There is no reason,
therefore, to wonder if, when the judgment-seats have been laid low, every man
insults his neighbor, cruelty abounds, and licentiousness rages without control.
If we considered this wisely, we would set a higher value on the kindness of
God, when he preserves us in any tolerable condition, and does not allow us to
be lamentably ruined. Hence it is evident that they who direct or apply their
minds to sap the foundations of civil government are the open enemies of
mankind, or rather, they are in no respect different from wild
beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But this confusion described by the
Prophet is most disgraceful, that a child shall dare to insult an old man, that
the dregs of a low and despised multitude shall rise up against nobles and men
of high reputation; for it is the most preposterous of all things that modesty
shall be thrown away, so that they who were worthy of veneration shall be
treated with contempt. And yet this spectacle, so shameful and revolting, must
unavoidably be exhibited when civil government has been overthrown. As to my
rendering of the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;gn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>niggash</i>) in an active sense, <i>to oppress</i>, I was forced to adopt
it, for otherwise the meaning of the passage would have been
imperfect.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When every man shall take hold of
his brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As this verse is closely
connected with the former, and proceeds without interruption as far as the
phrase </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall
swear,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>) is evidently taken for an adverb of time. For Isaiah, intending to
express the extreme wretchedness of the people, says that there will be no man
who will undertake to govern them, though he were requested to do so. To such an
extent unquestionably does ambition prevail among men, that many are always
eager to contend for power, and endeavor to obtain it even at the hazard of
their lives. In every age the whole world has been convulsed by the desire of
obtaining kingly power; and there is not a villain so inconsiderable as not to
contain men who willingly undertake to become rulers; and all this proves that
man is an animal desirous of honor. Hence it follows that everything is in a
deplorable condition, when that dignity is not only despised but obstinately
rejected; for the mournful calamity has reached its lowest depth, when that
which men naturally desire with the greatest ardor is universally
disclaimed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah mentions other circumstances
of an aggravating nature, tending to show that the Jews will rather lay aside
every feeling of humanity and compassion than undertake the office of rulers. If
one shall refuse to rule foreign nations, it will not perhaps be thought so
wonderful; but when the preservation of brethren is in question, it is
excessively unkind to decline the honorable office. It is therefore a proof that
matters are utterly desperate, when the office of ruler is disdainfully rejected
by that man to whom his kinsmen appeal, by entreating his support and throwing
themselves on his protection. Now, since princes are commonly selected on
account of their wealth, or, at least, kingly power is not usually bestowed on
any who have not a moderate share of riches, lest poverty should lay them open
to contempt and reproach, or drive them to unworthy means of gain, he likewise
adds this circumstance, that though they are able to bear the burden, still they
will not accept of it; as if he had said, "Not only the common people, but also
the nobles and the wealthy, decline the task of
government."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The phrase <i>take hold</i> is
likewise emphatic, for it means to "lay hands" on a person; as if Isaiah had
said that those who shall wish to obtain a prince will not employ flatteries and
entreaties, but will proceed with disorder and violence to seize on some person,
and endeavor to compel him to occupy the
throne.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let this ruin be under
thy hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This last circumstance is not less
weighty. The meaning is, "At least if you have any compassion or humanity, do
not fail to aid us in our extreme wretchedness." For when a multitude of men,
like a scattered flock, bewailing with tears their ruinous condition, implore
the protection of a shepherd, he who will not stretch out a helping hand must
have a heart as hard as iron. Some translate it as if, by a figure of speech,
(hypallage,) one word had been put for another,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy hand be under this
ruin</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, for the sake of upholding
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall he
swear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word <i>swear</i> expresses an
absolute and vehement refusal; for frequently he who at first excuses himself,
or declares that he will not do it, at length yields to entreaty; but he who, in
refusing, employs an oath, shuts out all hope, because he gives them to
understand that his purpose is firm and decided. Perhaps, too, the phrase <i>in
that day</i>, means "<i>immediately</i>, without any delay, and without long
consultation;" but as it may also be viewed demonstratively,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">deiktikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
as pointing out more fully the time of the calamity, I do not express a strong
opinion. The general meaning is obvious, that their ruinous condition will be
past remedy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the word

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">His

man, even when matters are at the worst, will venture to take measures for their
defense.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Jerusalem is
ruined.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Lest it should be thought that God is
excessively cruel, when he punishes his people with such severity, the Prophet
here explains briefly the reason of the calamity; as if he had said that the
destruction of that ungodly people is righteous, because in so many ways they
have persisted in provoking God. And thus he cuts off all ground of complaint;
for we know with what insolent fury the world breaks out, when it is chastised
with more than ordinary severity. He says that they were ready, both by words
and by actions, to commit every kind of crimes. In speaking of their
destruction, he employs such language as if it had already taken place; though
the past may be taken for the future, as in many other
passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To provoke the eyes
of his glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This mode of expression
aggravates the crime, as denotes that they had intentionally resolved to insult
God; for those things which are done before our eyes, if they are displeasing to
us, are the more offensive. It is true that wicked men mock God, as if they were
able to deceive him; but as nothing, however it may be concealed, escapes his
view, Isaiah brings it as a reproach against them, that they openly and
shamelessly, in his very presence, indulged in the commission of crimes. The
word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">
also deserves our attention; for it is a proof of extraordinary madness, if we
have no feeling of reverence, when the majesty of God is presented to our view.
If God had so illustriously displayed his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">
before the nation of Israel, that they ought justly to have been humbled, if
they had any remains of shame or of modesty. Whatever, then, may be the
murmurings of wicked men against God, or their complaints of his severity, the
cause of all the calamities which they endure will be found to be in their own
hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The proof of their countenance
will answer in them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(or, will answer
against them.) As the Prophet had to do with impudent and brazen-faced
hypocrites, who impudently boasted that they were good men; so he says that
their countenance testifies what kind of persons they are, and that it will not
be necessary to bring witnesses from a distance, in order to prove their
wickedness; for <i>to answer</i> means "to bear testimony," or "to confess."
Although, therefore, they disguise their face and countenance, so that they
frequently deceive others, yet God compels them to show and prove what they are;
so that, in spite of themselves they carry, as it were, in their forehead a mark
of their deceit and hypocrisy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some explain it,
that their crimes are so manifest that they cannot avoid seeing, as in a mirror,
the baseness which they desire to conceal But the former meaning is confirmed by
what immediately follows, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>declared their sin in the same
manner as the inhabitants of Sodom</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these
words he intimates that they devoted themselves to iniquity in such a manner,
that they boasted of their transgressions without any shame; as if it had been
honorable and praiseworthy in them to trample on every distinction between right
and wrong, and not to indulge in every kind of wickedness. On this account he
compares them to the inhabitants of <i>Sodom</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
18:20; 19:5,) who were so much blinded by their lusts, that they rushed, with
brutish stupidity, to everything base. So, then, this <i>is
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the answer of the
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which he mentioned a little
before, that they carry about with them plain tokens of impiety, which are
abundantly sufficient to prove their
guilt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe unto their
soul!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he declares what was formerly
mentioned, that the whole cause of their calamities is to be found in
themselves; for by their sins and iniquities they provoked the Lord; and
consequently that they have no means of evasion, that it is useless to contrive
idle pretenses, because the evil itself dwells in their bones; as if he had
said, "God cannot be accused, as if he punished you unjustly. Acknowledge that
it has been done by yourselves; give glory to a righteous judge and lay the
whole blame on yourselves."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say, it shall be well with the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Before quoting the opinions
of others, I shall point out the true meaning As punishments so severe commonly
present to pious minds an exceedingly sharp temptation, and especially since
hardly any public calamities occur which do not involve good men along with the
bad; so the Prophet &#8212; at least, in my opinion &#8212; reminds them of the
providence of God, which never confounds anything, but even, when there is
apparent confusion, never ceases to distinguish between good and bad
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But there are various ways in which this
passage is explained; for some render it<i>, "Say to the righteous man, because
he is good, therefore he shall eat the fruit of his hands."</i> From that
interpretation this meaning is obtained: "I wish and command the godly to be of
good cheer; for with whatever severity I may punish the crimes of the nation,
still it shall be well with the godly." But a more suitable meaning is this:
<i>Say</i>; that is, hold it to be a settled point; for in Scripture <i>to
say</i> often means <i>to think</i>, and <i>to be convinced</i>; as David
writes, I said, I will take heed to thy ways,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
39:1,) and in a thousand instances of the same kind; so that he does not bid
them tell the righteous man, but he bids every man be fully convinced, that
happy will be the condition of the righteous man, though he may only appear to
be unhappy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, I consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>tob</i>,) to mean a happy and prosperous condition; as in the former verse
he employed the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ragnah</i>) with which
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf</font><font face="Palatino">
is now contrasted; and thus I do not think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ragnah</i>,) means wickedness, but a miserable condition. Now since it
literally runs, <i>Say to the righteous man</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf
yk</font><font face="Palatino">: (ki tob,) <i>that it shall be well</i> either
the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ki</i>,) has an affirmative sense, as in many other passages, or it appears
to be superfluous, though the probability is, that it is intended for
confirmation. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely it shall be
well with the righteous man</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, let every
ground of doubt be removed, and let us be fully convinced, that the condition of
the righteous man will be most excellent and prosperous. It is difficult to
believe this, and therefore it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall eat the fruit of his
doings</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, he shall not be defrauded of
the reward of his good conduct. Others consider to say as meaning <i>to
exhort</i>, and render the two words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf
yk</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>ki</i> <i>tob</i>,) <i>that he will do
well</i>; but I reject it as a forced
interpretation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe unto the wicked!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It shall be ill with him. He brings forward
this clause as a contrast to the former one; from which it may be easily
inferred what was the design of the Prophet, namely, to comfort the godly, and
to terrify the wicked by the judgment of God. For when an uncommonly severe
calamity occurs, which attacks all without discrimination, we doubt whether it
be by the providence of God, or, on the contrary, by blind chance, that the
world is governed. On this account godly men fear and dread that the same
destruction which overtakes the wicked will ruin them also. Others think that it
is of no importance whether a man be good or bad, when they see both classes
visited by pestilence, war, famine and other calamities. And hence arises the
wicked thought, that there is no difference between the rewards of the good and
of the bad; and in the midst of these gloomy thoughts carnal appetites lead many
to despair.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, the Prophet shows that
the judgement of God is right, that men may continue to fear God, and may be
aware that those who, in the expectation of escape of punishment, provoke God,
will not pass unpunished. He likewise exhorts them to ascribe to God the praise
of justice; as if he had said, "Think not that blind chance rules in the world,
or that God punishes with blind violence, and without any regard to justice, but
hold it as a principle fully settled in your minds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall be well with the
righteous man</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for God will repay him what he
hath promised, and will not disappoint him of his hope. On the other hand,
believe that the condition of the wicked man will be most wretched, for he
brings on himself the evil which must at length fall on his
head."</font><br><font face="Palatino">By these words the Prophet, at the same
time, charges the people with stupidity in not perceiving the judgment of God;
for they suffered the punishments of their crimes, and yet hardened themselves
under them, as if they had been altogether devoid of feeling. Now there cannot
befall us anything worse than that we should be hardened against chastisements,
and not perceive that God chastiseth us. When we labor under such stupidity, our
case is almost hopeless.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The oppressors of any people are
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Here
also is reproved the madness and sottishness of the people, because they shut
their eyes at noon-day. There is nothing which men are more reluctant to allow
than to have a yoke laid on them; nor do they willingly submit to be governed by
nobles. Feeble and cowardly, therefore, must be the minds of those who obey
delicate and effeminate men, and permit themselves to be oppressed by them; nor
can it be doubted that God has struck with a spirit of cowardice those who offer
their shoulders, like asses, to bear burdens. The power of a tyrant must indeed
be endured, even by men of courage; but the reproach which Isaiah brings against
the Jews is, that while they obstinately shake off the yoke of God, they are
ready to yield abject submission to men, and to perform any services, however
shameful or degrading.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For the Jews could not
complain that they were compelled by violence, when of their own accord they
obeyed those whose authority they would gladly have declined. Hence it is
evident that they were struck by the hand of God, and were shaken with terror,
so that they had no strength either of body or of
mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is also the vengeance which God had
formerly threatened by Moses; for the general doctrine of Moses, as we have
already said, is continually alluded to by the prophets.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or how was it possible that men who had the power of resistance should of their
own accord undergo a slavery from which they would willingly have escaped, had
not God deprived them of understanding and forethought that he might in this
manner take vengeance on their crimes? Whenever, therefore, anything of this
kind shall befall us; let us not imagine that it came by chance. On the
contrary, whenever it shall happen that we are governed by men who are of no
estimation, and which are more insignificant than children, let us acknowledge
the wrath of the Lord, if we do not choose that the Prophet shall charge us with
the grossest stupidity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
who govern thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">He
continues to teach the same doctrine, that when God lets loose the reins against
the wicked, so as to disturb everything, he shows that he is highly offended at
the Jews; for if they had enjoyed his favor, there was reason to hope that his
government would be most holy and blessed. At the same time it is probable that
the common herd of men were so foolishly devoted to their rulers, that they
revered as oracles both their injunctions and their conduct; and hence arose all
the corruption that everywhere prevailed. Since, therefore, the contagion was
spreading farther without being perceived by the people, Isaiah cries aloud that
they ought to guard against the governors themselves, who corrupt and destroy
the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others explain it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they who bless
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but as the participle which he employs
may be taken from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>yashar</i>,) which signifies <i>to rule</i>, I shall rather adopt that
interpretation, for it is more agreeable to the context.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">I
do acknowledge that the false prophets flattered the people, but I see no reason
why their flatteries should be mentioned here. But it applies very well to the
rulers and heads, that they were the cause of the destruction; for as princes
are raised to their office for the sake of the public safety, so no plague is
more destructive than when they are bad men, and rule according to their own
caprice. He says, therefore, that they who rule are the causes of the evils, and
that they corrupt everything, since it was their duty to correct other men, and
to point out the way by their own
example.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah standeth up to
plead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> So long as wickedness rages
without control, and the Lord sends no relief from on high, we think that he is
idle and has forgotten his duty. More especially, when the nobles themselves are
spared, he appears to grant them liberty to commit sin, as if they were most
sacred persons that must not be touched. Accordingly, after having complained of
the princes, he adds that the Lord will do what his authority demands, and will
not permit such flagrant crimes to pass unpunished. For there is hardly any
conduct more offensive, or more fitted to disturb our minds, than when the worst
examples of every sort are publicly exhibited by magistrates, while no man
utters a syllable against them, but almost all give their approbation. We then
ask, Where is God, whose glory, a great part of which, consisting in authority,
is taken away, ought to have been illustriously displayed by men of that rank?
Isaiah meets this difficulty by saying, "Though the nation is wicked, yet
because the princes themselves are very greatly corrupted, and even pollute the
whole nation by their vices, God sits as judge in heaven, and will at length
call them to account, and assign to every one his reward." Although he does not
exempt the multitude from guilt, yet that the sources of the evils may be known,
he particularly attacks the rulers, and threatens them with the punishment which
they deserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the

allusion to lawful assemblies, in which older men sit as God's deputies; but I
assent to the opinion more commonly entertained, that God contends against the

of that time were very unwilling to hear. They have no wish, and do not think
that it is right, that any one should treat them with such sharpness and
severity; for they wish that everything should be at their disposal, that their
will should be held as a law, and that they should be allowed to do whatever
they choose; that all men ought to flatter and applaud them, and to approve of
their very worst actions. They think that no man is a judge of their actions,
and do not yield subjection to God himself. Since, therefore, they are so
unbridled that they neither endure any advices nor any threatening the Prophet
summons them to the judgment seat of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with their

of the people. This also deserves attention; for they thought that, on account
of their rank, they enjoyed a kind of privilege which set them free from the
restraints of law, and that though heathen kings and princes might give an
account of their actions, they, on the contrary, were sacred persons. They
thought, therefore, that they were beyond the reach of all reproof, and ought
not to be addressed, like heathen men, by threats and terrors. On this account
Isaiah expressly declares, that the Lord will not only call to account every
kind of princes, but especially the proud hypocrites to whose care he had
committed his people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you

affection that if they had ruled over a heathen nation. The pronoun <i>you</i>
is likewise emphatic; for he addresses the vine-dressers themselves, who,
instead of devoting themselves, as they ought to have done, to the cultivation
of the vine, devoured it like wild beasts. Accordingly, he represents this to be
a great aggravation of their cruelty; for how treacherous was it to
<i>destroy</i> what they ought to have preserved and protected? By this
comparison the Lord shows how great care he takes of his own people, and how
warmly he loves them; not only because the Church is called his vine and
inheritance, but by declaring that he will not endure the treachery and
wickedness of those who have ruled over it
tyrannically.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The spoil of the
poor is in your houses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds one
circumstance, by which the other parts of their life might be known, that they
had in their houses the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prey and
spoil of the poor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now the palace of princes
ought to resemble a sanctuary: for they occupy the dwelling place of God, which
ought to be sacred to all. It is, therefore, the grossest sacrilege to turn a
sanctuary into a den of thieves. He represents still more strongly their
criminality by adding <i>of the poor</i>; for it is the most wicked of all acts
of cruelty to plunder a poor and needy man, who cannot defend himself, and who
ought rather to have been protected.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What mean ye that ye beat my
people to pieces?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions also other
particulars, from which it is evident that they ruled in a haughty, cruel and
oppressive manner. It was not necessary that the Prophet should describe
minutely everything deserving reproof in the princes; for from these few
circumstances it is evident with what injustice and cruelty and tyranny they
ruled. But to whom shall the poor betake themselves but to the magistrate, who
ought to be the father of his country and the protector of the wretched? On this
account he employs a vehement interrogation, <i>What?</i> as if he had said,
"What effrontery is this! What cruelty and barbarity, to abuse the mean
condition of the poor, so as to have no compassion on them!" By two comparisons
he describes their cruel oppression mingled with
pride.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saith the Lord Jehovah
of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That the reproof may have all the
weight that it ought to have, he brings forward God as speaking; for there is an
implied contrast that these things should not be viewed as coming from the mouth
of men, but that the accusation proceeds from God himself, and that he pursues
those who are guilty of such injustice, and will at length take vengeance on
them. Because those who have been exalted to any kind of honor conduct
themselves so haughtily as to disdain every direction and advice, he therefore
meets their pride by bringing forward the majesty of God, that they may not
venture to despise his earnest and severe threatenings. Yet let us remember that
this passage ought not to be understood as if the Prophet were speaking only
about the mercy of God; for after having threatened vengeance indiscriminately
on all, he particularly mentions those who are their heads, in order to show
that no man can escape the arm of God: and here he employs what is called the
argument from the greater to the less." How would the Lord spare the lowest of
the people, when he punishes even the princes themselves, because they have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed the
vineyard?"</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the daughters of Zion are
haughty. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Next follows another threatening
against the ambition, luxury, and pride of women. On these points the Prophet
has not followed an exact order, but reproves sometimes one vice and sometimes
another, as the subject appears to require, and afterwards sums up what he has
said in a few words, as he did in the seventh verse of the first chapter. He
therefore pronounces censure on gorgeous robes and superfluous ornaments, which
were undoubted proofs of vanity and ostentation. Wherever dress and splendor are
carried to excess, there is evidence of ambition, and many vices are usually
connected with it; for whence comes luxury in men and women but from
pride?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And walk with stretched
forth neck.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> First, then, he justly declares
pride to be the source of the evil, and points it out by the sign, that is, by
their gait; that the women </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walk
with stretched-forth neck</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For as it is a sign
of modesty to have a down-cast look, (as even heathen writers have declared,) so
to have excessively holy looks is a sign of insolence; and when a woman lifts up
her head it can betoken nothing but pride. The Prophet certainly acts wisely in
beginning at the very fountain; for if he had begun by mentioning signs, such as
dress, gait, and matters of that sort, it might have been easy to reply that
still the mind was pure and uplight; and that if their dress was somewhat too
elegant and splendid, that was not a sufficient reason for approaching them with
such bitter language, and summoning them to the judgement seat of God.
Accordingly, in order to meet their unfounded accusations, he lays open the
inward disease, which is manifested in the whole of their outward
dress.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wandering
eyes.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What he adds about <i>wandering eyes</i>
denotes shameless lust, which for the most part is expressed by the <i>eyes</i>;
for unchaste eyes are the heralds of an unchaste heart; but the <i>eyes</i> of
chaste women are sedate, and not wandering or
unsteady.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And make a tinkling
with their feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is a part of the
indecent gesture by which wantonness is discovered. But it is not easy to say
whether the women wore on their sandals some tinkling ornaments which made a
noise as they walked, or whether they imitated the dancing women by a measured
step; for the form of dresses since that time has been greatly changed. Yet I
readily adopt the interpretation that they made a noise in walking, for this is
very plainly expressed by the word
employed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore will the Lord make
bald</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the crown of the
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
(vau,) which signifies <i>and</i>, is put for <i>therefore</i>; for he threatens
that, since neither gentle advices nor any words can reform them, the Lord will
deal with them in a very different manner, and will not only employ sharp and
severe language, but will advance in dreadful array, with an armed band, to take
vengeance. Accordingly, as they had manifested their obstinacy from <i>head to
foot</i>, so he declares that the Lord will exhibit the marks of his vengeance
in every part of their body. He therefore begins with the head, where ornament
is chiefly bestowed, and afterwards takes notice of the other
parts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is worthy of notice that the Prophet
had good reason for reproving, with so great earnestness and vehemence, the
luxury of women; for while they are chargeable with many vices, they are most of
all inflamed with mad eagerness to have fine clothes. Covetous as they naturally
are, still they spare no expense for dressing in a showy manner, and even use
spare diet, and deprive themselves of what nature requires, that their clothes
may be more costly and elegant. So grievously are they corrupted by this vice,
that it goes beyond every other.</font><br><font face="Palatino">History tells
us what vast crowds the women brought together on account of the Oppian Law
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F62</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which some wished to maintain, and others to repeal; and that transaction was
not conducted with any gravity or moderation in consequence of the crowds of
women. But we need not go far to find examples; for they are innumerable in
almost every nation, and it is a vice which has been very common in every age.
As we are dexterous and sharp-sighted in contriving apologies for defending our
luxury and extravagance, the Prophet, on that account, has pointed his finger at
the source of all the evils, namely, that mad ambition by which men are hurried
along to obtain public notice, and to arrive at eminence above others; for, in
order that they may be better known, they wish to outshine their neighbors by
the elegance of their dress, that they may draw the eyes of others upon
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Having pointed to the source of the evil,
the Prophet descends to many particulars for the purpose of bringing to public
view the fooleries of women, and enumerates a long catalogue of them, to show
that, in gathering them together, nothing can exceed the curiosity which dwells
in woman. Indeed there is no end to those contrivances; and it was not without
reason that the ancients called the collection of a woman's ornaments <i>a
world</i>;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for if they were collected into one heap, they would be almost as numerous as
the parts of the world. On this account the Prophet appears to search the
women's chests, and to bring into public view the gaudy trifles which they have
treasured up in them, that their extravagant delight and boasting of these
things may render their idleness and folly more evident to all. There is no
superfluity, therefore, in this enumeration, though spread out in many words, by
which their lawless desires are proved to be
insatiable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the particulars, I shall not
stay to explain them, especially as the best Hebrew scholars have doubts about
some of them, and cannot distinguish with certainty the forms of those
ornaments. It is enough if we understand the general import and design of the
Prophet; namely, that he heaps up and enumerates these trifles in order that the
prodigious variety of them may disclose their luxury and ambition, so as to
leave them without any excuse. It would be the height of impudence to allege
that the contrivances made by the childish vanity of women, beyond what nature
requires, are necessary for protecting the body. How many things are here
enumerated which are not demanded by nature or necessity or propriety! What is
the use of chains, bracelets, earrings and other things of the same sort? Hence
it is plain enough that a superfluous collection of such ornaments admits of no
excuse; that it gives evidence of excessive luxury which ought to be suppressed
or restrained; and that frequently they are unchaste contrivances for weakening
the mind and exciting lust. We need not wonder, therefore, that the Prophet
speaks so sharply, and threatens severe punishments, against this
vice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instead of a sweet smell there
shall be stink.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is evident that the country
here described abounds in aromatic herbs; and there is no reason to doubt that
in pleasant smells, as well as in other matters, they were luxurious. We see
that those nations which are farthest removed from the east are not prevented
either by distance or by expense from indulging in that kind of luxury. What may
be expected to happen in those places where they are abundant? That they will
excite lust and promote luxury is beyond all doubt He means, therefore, that
ointments and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sweet
smells</i></font><font face="Palatino"> were abused by them in a variety of
ways; for the sinful desires of men are ingenious in their contrivances, and can
never be satisfied.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instead of
a girdle a rent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others have rendered it <i>a
falling off</i>; because the Lord will ungird them. He intends to contrast
things which are exceedingly opposite to each other; that as the women formerly
were most carefully girt and adorned when they walked, they shall henceforth be
torn and naked. He likewise contrasts <i>baldness</i> with <i>curls</i>; because
they arranged their hair not in a modest but an extravagant fashion. Again, <i>a
belt</i> is contrasted with <i>sackcloth.</i> Whether it was a belt, or some
other kind of binding, it is certain that the Prophet meant <i>a girdle</i>,
which was held in high estimation. Again, <i>burning</i> is contrasted with
<i>beauty</i>; because fashionable ladies hardly venture to expose themselves to
the sun's rays, for fear of being sunburned; and he tells us that this will
happen to them. In short, both men and women are instructed to make a sober use
of the gifts of Goal, both in food and in clothing, and in the whole conduct of
life. For the Lord cannot endure extravagance, and absolutely must inflict
severe punishment on account of it; for it cannot be restrained by a lighter
chastisement.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy men shall fall by the
sword.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He directs his discourse to Jerusalem
and to the whole kingdom of Judah; for, after having demonstrated that the whole
body is infected with a plague, and that no part of it is free from disease, and
after leaving not even spared the women, he returns to the general doctrine. It
would be improper that more than one husband should be assigned to one woman.
Besides, what immediately follows applies exclusively to this nation. He
particularly describes the punishment, that God will bring down by wars the
whole strength of the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her gates shall mourn and
lament.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence arises the <i>mourning of the
gates</i>, which, he threatens, will take place when they have met with their
calamities; for he means, that where there were great crowds and multitudes,
nothing but a dismal solitude will be found. We know that at that time public
meetings were held at <i>the gates</i>; and, therefore, as the gates sometimes
rejoice at the multitude of citizens, so they are said <i>to mourn</i> on
account of their frightful desolation. And yet I do not deny that he compares
Jerusalem to a woman who is sad, and who bewails her widowhood; for it was
customary with mourners </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to sit on
the ground</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as that nation was in the habit of
using ceremonies and outward signs to a greater degree than would be consistent
with our customs. But the sum of the matter is that the city will have lost her
inhabitants.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall seven women
take hold of one man</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> He pursues the same
subject, and unquestionably this discourse is immediately connected with what
goes before. This verse certainly ought not to have been separated from the
preceding. By this circumstance he describes more fully the nature of that
desolation and calamity which he had formerly threatened against the Jews; for
hypocrites; unless the threatening be conceived in strong terms, either
disregard or palliate warnings, so that God's severity never produces its proper
effect upon them. From the effect, therefore, he describes the appalling nature
of the approaching calamity, that they may not indulge the hope of making an
easy escape. As if he had said, "Do not imagine that it will be of moderate
extent, lessening your numbers in a small degree; for utter destruction awaits
you, so that hardly </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"> will be found for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
women</i></font><font face="Palatino">."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
phrase </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take hold
of</i></font><font face="Palatino"> conveys the same meaning. It is, no doubt,
inconsistent with the modesty of the sex that a woman should, of her own accord,
offer herself to a man. But the Prophet says, that not only will they do this,
but that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
women</i></font><font face="Palatino"> will, as it were, lay hands on a man, and
keep hold of him; so small will be the number of men. The greatness of the
calamity is likewise denoted by what immediately follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we will eat our own bread, and
wear our own apparel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for as it is a duty which
belongs to a husband to support his wife and family, the women ask a husband for
themselves on unreasonable conditions, when they release him from all concern
about supplying them with food. Very great must, therefore, be the scarcity of
men, when a great number of women, laying aside modesty, are not only
constrained to solicit one man, but do not even shrink from the agreement to
procure their own victuals, and request nothing more from a husband than to
receive them within the bond of
marriage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy name be
called on us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be rendered, <i>Let us
be</i> <i>called by thy name</i>; for when a woman passes into the family of her
husband, she is <i>called by his name</i>, and loses her own, because the
husband is her head.

the wife of Cato."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F64</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And take away our
reproach.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Their reason for saying so is, that
women are sometimes treated with disdain, when they do not obtain husbands, not
only because they appear to be despised as unworthy, but because among the
ancient people offspring was reckoned an important blessing, and therefore the
Prophet says that they will be desirous to wipe away this reproach, and will
employ every argument for that purpose. Lastly, he declares that the calamity
will be so great, that almost all the men will be carried
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall the branch of

F65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This consolation is seasonably added; for
the announcement of a dreadful calamity might have alarmed the godly, and led
them to doubt as to the stability of God's covenant being maintained amidst the
destruction of the people. For there is a wide difference between the two
statements, that the people will be <i>like the sand of the sea</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:17;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:22,) and yet that they would be cut down by such a frightful massacre, that
in the remnant there would be found no dignity, no magnificence, and hardly any
name. Isaiah, therefore, according to the custom generally followed by himself
and by the prophets, provides against this alarm, and, by adding a consolation,
assuages their excessive terror, that believers may still rest assured that the
Church will be safe, and may strengthen their hearts by good hope. As he spoke
of the restoration of the Church in the second chapter, so he now promises that
a new Church will arise, as a <i>bud</i> or <i>shoot</i> springs up in a field
which was formerly uncultivated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage is
usually expounded as referring to Christ; and the opinion, plausible in itself,
derives additional probability from the words of the prophet
Zechariah:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Behold the man whose name
shall be The
Branch.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
6:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is still further strengthened by the
consideration, that the Prophet does not barely name this <i>Branch</i>, but
mentions it with a title expressive of respect, as if he had intended to honor
the Divinity of Christ. When he afterwards adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fruits</i> <i>of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, they consider this as referring to his
human nature. But after a careful examination of the whole, I do not hesitate to
regard the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Branch of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fruit of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as denoting an unusual and abundant
supply of grace, which will relieve the hungry; for he speaks as if the earth,
barren and exhausted after the desolation, would hold out no promise of future
produce, in order that the sudden fertility might render the kindness of God the
more desirable; as if the parched and barren fields would yield unexpected
herbage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This metaphor is frequently employed in
Scripture, that the gifts of God <i>spring up</i> in the world.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Truth shall spring out of
the earth, and</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">righteousness shall

<div><font face="Palatino">In like manner the Prophet afterwards
says:</font><br></div>

45:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words unquestionably denote a rich supply both
of spiritual and of earthly blessings. That such is the meaning of the passage
now under consideration is evident from the context; for Isaiah immediately
afterwards adds, that it will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for honor and lustre to the
delivered of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is, to the number left, whom the
Lord will rescue from destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tfylp</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>pheletath</i>) is commonly translated <i>escape</i>, but here, as in many
other passages, it is a collective noun, denoting <i>those who have escaped</i>.
He declares that the elect will enjoy that happy fertility which he had
promised, and therefore (verse 3) that those who shall be left will be
<i>holy</i>. The meaning of the Prophet is, that the glory of God will be
illustriously displayed when a new Church shall arise; as if he would create a
people for himself out of nothing, and to enrich it with every kind of
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They who limit it to the person of
Christ expose themselves to the ridicule of the Jews, as if it were in
consequence of scarcity that they tortured passages of Scripture for their own
convenience. But there are other passages of Scripture from which it may be more
clearly proved that Christ is true God and true man, so that there is no need of
ingenious glosses. Yet I acknowledge that the Prophet speaks here about the
kingdom of Christ, on which the restoration of the Church is founded. But it
ought to be observed, that the consolation is not addressed indiscriminately to
all, but only to the remnant, which has been marvellously rescued from the jaws
of death.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, as it might be deemed a cold
consolation if he had only said that a small number would be saved, he
discourses about the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>magnificent
glory and dazzling brightness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to lead
believers to hope that this diminution will do no harm; because the excellence
of the Church does not consist in multitude but in purity when God bestows
splendid and glorious communications of the Spirit of God on his elect. Hence we
ought to draw a very useful doctrine, that though believers be exceedingly few,
when they are like <i>brands plucked out of the fire</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
3:2,) yet that God will glorify himself amongst them, and will display in the
midst of them a proof of his unspeakable greatness not less illustrious than
amidst a large number.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass that he
who is left in Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He follows out the same
statement, that when the pollution of the people shall have been washed away,
what remains will be pure and <i>holy</i>. The explanation given by some, that
they who shall be found written in the book of life will <i>be called holy</i>,
appears to me to be too limited. These two clauses ought rather to be read
separately, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all who shall be
left in Zion will be holy,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they who shall be left in
Jerusalem will be written in the book of life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
And this repetition is very frequent and customary among the Hebrews, when the
prophets set forth under various titles the same gift of God. Thus, when it is
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">There shall be salvation
in Jerusalem,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and forgiveness of
sins in Zion,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joel
2:32,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">both must be viewed as referring to the same subject;
but the grace of God is more fully extolled when the cause of salvation is
declared to consist in a free pardon.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
f67</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">In this passage the argument is of the
same kind; for he says that, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when
the filth shall have been washed away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the
Church will be clean, and that all who shall have a place in her will truly be
the elect of God. Now, it is certain that this does not apply universally to the
external Church, into which many have been admitted under the designation of
believers who have nothing that corresponds to their profession, and who even
exceed the small number of good people, as the chaff exceeds the wheat in the
barn. And although the captivity in Babylon had been employed by God, as a
sieve, to remove a large portion of chaff, yet we know that the Church was still
very far from being as pure as she ought to have been. But as at that time there
was displayed, in some measure, a resemblance of that purity which will be truly
and perfectly manifested after that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the lambs shall have been
separated from the

25:32,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">when Isaiah speaks of those beginnings, he includes,
as his custom is, a period extending to the end, when God will bring to
perfection that which he then began.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is the
same thing which we see every day going forward; for although chastisements and
punishments do not entirely remove all spots from the Church, yet when spots
have been washed out, she recovers a part of her purity. Thus she suffers no
loss by the strokes inflicted on her; because, while she is diminished, she is
at the same time comforted by casting out many hypocrites; just as it is only by
casting out the offensive or corrupt matter that a diseased body can be restored
to health.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we obtain a most useful
consolation; for we are wont always to desire a multitude, and to estimate by it
the prosperity of the Church. On the contrary, we should rather desire to be few
in number, and that in all of us the glory of God may shine brightly. But
because our own glory leads us in another direction, the consequence is, that we
regard more a great number of men than the excellence of a
few.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought also to learn what is the true
glory of a Church; for she is truly prosperous when the saints have a place in
her; though they be few and despised in the world, yet they render her condition
prosperous and desirable. But as it will never happen in the world that the
saints alone will hold a place in the Church, we ought patiently to endure a
mixture, and, in the meantime, we ought to reckon it a most valuable blessing
when she makes a near approach to the cleanness which ought to be found in
her.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall all be
written among the living [or, to life] in
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have already said that by those
who are written in the book of life are meant the elect of God; as if he had
said that the profane multitude, which have only a name on the earth, will be
cut off. The Prophet alludes to a mode of expression which often occurs in the
Scriptures, as when Moses desires that he should be <i>blotted out of</i> <i>the
book</i> of life,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:32,) rather than that the whole nation should be destroyed. Christ also says
to the Apostles,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Rejoice because your
names are written in
heaven,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421020&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
10:20;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and Ezekiel says, <i>They shall not be written in the
catalogue of my</i> <i>people</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, although God has no other book than
his eternal counsel, in which he has predestinated us to salvation by adopting
us for his children, yet this comparison is exceedingly suitable to our
weakness, because in no other way could our mind conceive that God's flock is
known to him, so that none of the elect can ever be deprived of eternal life.
Since, therefore, God has the names of his people in some manner written down,
the decree of adoption, by which their eternal blessedness is secured, is called
<i>the book of life</i>. The reprobate, though for a time they appear to be on a
level with the sons of God, are excluded from this catalogue, as we see that
they are cut off when he collects and separates his own people. This matter will
not be fully completed before the last day; but as the children of God, by
continually persevering, when the reprobate fall off, have their election made
sure, it is no small consolation amidst their afflictions, when the temptations
by which they are assailed do not cause them to fall from their
steadfastness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When the </i>Lord<i> shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of
Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He still follows out the same
statement; for in consequence of its being generally believed that those
calamities by which the Church is diminished inflict upon her grievous injury,
the Prophet more zealously inculcates the opposite opinion. And now, for the
purpose of refuting that error, he argues, on the contrary, that by this method
God washes away the filth, and removes the corruptions, of his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The blood of
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>blood</i> I understand not
only murders or other atrocious crimes, but defilements and stains of every
description. This metaphor is a reduplication,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnadi&gt;plwsiv</font><font face="Palatino">,)
by which he repeats the same thing twice; for, having formerly spoken of
pollution in general, he now particularly mentions <i>blood</i> as one kind of
ceremonial uncleanness. In short, he shows the fruits which spring from God's
chastisements. By them our spots are washed away. When abounding iniquity is not
punished, we become corrupted along with others; and therefore it is necessary
that God should earnestly warn us, and, like a physician, apply physic, and the
lancet, and sometimes proceed to
<i>burning</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the spirit
of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here
<i>judgment</i> stands for <i>uprightness</i> from its effect; that is, when
they who had deeply fallen are restored to their former condition. He adds,
<i>the spirit of burning</i>, by which the filth must be <i>burned</i> and
consumed. In this expression there are two things to be observed; first, that
the purification of the Church is accomplished by the Spirit; and secondly, that
from the effects which he produces the Spirit receives the name, sometimes of
<i>judgment</i> and sometimes of <i>burning</i>; as if he had said, The
<i>judgment</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>, The <i>burning</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>.
Whenever, therefore, expressions of this sort occur in Scripture, "The Lord will
do these things by the Spirit of truth, of power, of righteousness," we may
change the expression thus, "by the truth, by the power, by the righteousness,
of the Spirit." In this manner doth the Spirit of God work in us, from whom is
both the beginning and the end of our salvation. From these terms, therefore, we
ought to learn what are the chief effects which he produces. By his Spirit the
Lord purifies our affections that he may renew and sanctify us. The word
<i>judgment</i> explains what is of chief importance in the restoration of the
Church; that is, when those things which were confused or decayed are restored
to good order. <i>Burning</i> points out the plan and method by which the Lord
restores the Church to her purity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah will create on every
dwelling-place of Mount Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said
that "there will not be a corner of Mount Zion on which the grace of God does
not shine."
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dwelling-place</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>assembly</i></font><font face="Palatino">
I understand to mean the same thing; for <i>assembly</i> does not here denote a
<i>congregation</i>, but the place where men assemble. With the design to
express a full blessing, he alludes to what Moses relates, when the Lord
delivered the people from Egyptian bondage, and sent</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">pillars of cloud by day
and pillars of fire by
night.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
13:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was customary with the prophets, in describing any
remarkable blessing, to remind them of that deliverance from Egypt as an
extraordinary work of God; for on that occasion God made a remarkable display of
the boundless treasures of his grace in establishing his Church, and left out no
proof of his kindness, in order to make known the happiness of that nation. But
what chiefly deserved to be commemorated was, that by the covering of <i>a
cloud</i> by day he protected them from excessive heat, and that by night <i>a
pillar of fire</i> went before them, to prevent them from wandering or going
astray.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It amounts to this, that when God shall
bring back the Church from the captivity in Babylon, the deliverance will be of
a kind not less striking and magnificent than when, at an early period, the
nation went out of Egypt. Not that during their journey from Babylon to Judea
they would be accompanied, as in the wilderness, by a <i>cloud</i> and a
<i>pillar of</i> <i>fire</i>, but that he would display his grace and kindness
by other methods not less remarkable. Just as if we were to say at the present
day, "God will enlighten us by his Spirit of <i>fire</i>; He will give <i>cloven
tongues</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:3,) to spread his Gospel throughout the whole world." Such expressions ought
not to be understood literally, as if the Spirit would be sent down from heaven
under that visible sign; but by reminding them of the miracle, it would lead
believers to expect that the same power of God, which the Apostles formerly
experienced, will now be displayed in restoring the Church. Add to this, that
the Prophet, by this mode of expression, points out an uninterrupted continuance
of blessing; as if he had said, "Not only will God for a moment stretch out his
hand for your deliverance, but as he always accompanied your fathers in the
wilderness, so likewise he will deliver and protect you to the
end."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For on all the glory
shall be a defense.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is connected with what
he formerly said, that the <i>bud</i> or <i>branch</i> which should afterwards
spring up would be <i>for glory</i>. It is as if he had said, "on all who shall
bear the proof and marks of their deliverance." Perhaps also he alludes to the
passage in which it is related that the destroying angel passed over the houses
which were marked without doing them any injury,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:23;) for as <i>the sprinkling of blood</i> at that time protected and saved
them, so Isaiah promises that believers, when God has marked them, will be safe.
This must be carefully observed; for we are reminded that we shall not become
partakers of the grace of God in any other way than by bearing his image, and by
his glory shining in us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a covering in the day-time
shall be a shadow from the heat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though the
Prophet confirms what we have already noticed, that God will be our perpetual
guide till he has brought us to the end of our journey, yet we are reminded that
believers will always be exposed to numerous calamities. Scorching heat, and
piercing cold, and still heavier distresses, press on them severely; when they
escape from one danger, they meet with another. But the highest consolation is
that against every inconvenience the <i>shadow</i> of the Lord will of itself be
sufficient; for it will cover them in such a manner that nothing can injure or
do them any harm. Although, therefore, various calamities and afflictions
surround us on every side, still the Lord promises that he will assist us; as it
is said in the Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The sun shall not scorch
thee by day, nor the moon by night; for the Lord will preserve thee from all
evil.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
121:6, 7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nothing more is necessary than that we follow our
calling, and perform our duty faithfully. It belongs equally to the condition of
the good and of the bad that they suffer many inconveniencies; but bad men have
no refuge, no place of concealment in which they may hide themselves, and they
must be utterly overwhelmed. But blessed is the condition of the godly; for
although they endure heat and cold, still they have a safe refuge in God. But
that glory of which we formerly spoke must shine in us; otherwise we shall have
no share in these things; and if we carry about with us God's mark, whenever we
shall be assailed by a tempest, let us rest assured that he will be our
protection.</font><br></div>

perceive their faults, and might thus be led by shame and self-loathing to
sincere repentance. Here, as in a mirror, the people might behold the misery of
their condition. But for this, they would have flattered themselves too much in
their crimes, and would not have patiently listened to any instructions. It was
therefore necessary to present a striking and lively picture of their
wickedness; and in order that it might have the greater weight, he made use of
this preface; for great and memorable events were usually described in verse,
that they might be repeated by every one, and that a lasting record of them
might be preserved. In like manner, we see that Moses wrote a song, and many
other compositions,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
15:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:1,) in order that all the events might be proclaimed in this manner, both in
public and in private. The instruction becomes more widely diffused than if it
had been delivered in plainer language. For the same reason Isaiah composed this
song, that he might present to the people a clearer view of their wickedness;
and, undoubtedly, he handled this subject with magnificent and harmonious
language, for the highest skill is commonly exercised in the composition of
poems.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To my
beloved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There can be no doubt that he means
God; as if he had said that he would compose a poem in behalf of God, that he
might expostulate with the people about their ingratitude; for it gave
additional weight to his language to represent God as speaking. But a question
arises, Why does Isaiah call God his friend? Some reply that he was a kinsman of
Christ, and I acknowledge that he was a descendant of David; but this appears to
be a forced interpretation. A more natural and appropriate one would be, to
adopt the statement of John, that the Church is committed to <i>the friends of
the bridegroom</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:29,) and to reckon prophets as belonging to that class. To them,
unquestionably, this designation applies; for the ancient people were placed
under their charge, that they might be kept under their leader. We need not
wonder, therefore, that they were jealous and were greatly offended when the
people bestowed their attachment on any other. Isaiah therefore assumes the
character of the bridegroom, and, being deeply anxious about the bride entrusted
to him, complains that she has broken conjugal fidelity, and deplores her
treachery and ingratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn that
not only Paul, but all those prophets and teachers who faithfully served God,
were jealous of God's spouse.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:2.) And all the servants of God ought to be greatly moved and
aroused by this appellation; for what does a man reckon more valuable than his
wife? A well-disposed husband will value her more highly than all his treasures,
and will more readily commit to any person the charge of his wealth than of his
wife. He to whom one will entrust his dearly-beloved wife must be reckoned very
faithful. Now to pastors and ministers the Lord commits his Church as his
beloved wife. How great will be our wickedness if we betray her by sloth and
negligence! Whosoever does not labor earnestly to preserve her can on no
pretense be excused.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A song of
my beloved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By using the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ydwd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>dodi</i>, he changes the first syllable, but the meaning is the same as in
the former clause. Though some render it <i>uncle</i>, and others <i>cousin</i>,
I rather agree with those who consider it to contain an allusion; for greater
liberties are allowed to poets than to other writers. By his arrangement of
those words, and by his allusions to them, he intended that the sound and rhythm
should aid the memory, and impress the minds, of his
readers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My beloved had a
vineyard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The metaphor of <i>a vineyard</i> is
frequently employed by the prophets, and it would be impossible to find a more
appropriate comparison.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
80:8;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:21.) There are two ways in which it points out how highly the Lord values his
Church; for no possession is dearer to a man than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
vineyard</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and there is none that demands more
constant and persevering toil. Not only, therefore, does the Lord declare that
we are his beloved inheritance, but at the same time points out his care and
anxiety about us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this <i>song</i> the
Prophet mentions, first, the benefits which the Lord had bestowed on the Jewish
people; secondly, he explains how great was the ingratitude of the people;
thirdly, the punishment which must follow; fourthly, he enumerates the vices of
the people; for men never acknowledge their vices till they are compelled to do
so.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On a
hill.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He begins by saying that God had placed
his people in a favorable situation, as when a person plants a vine on a
pleasant and fertile hill. By the word <i>horn</i> or <i>hill</i> I understand a
lofty place rising above a plain, or what we commonly call <i>a
rising-ground</i>, (<i>un coustau</i>.) It is supposed by some to refer to the
situation of Jerusalem, but I consider this to be unnatural and forced. It
rather belongs to the construction of the Prophet's allegory; and as God was
pleased to take this people under his care and protection, he compares this
favor </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the planting of a
vineyard;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for it is better to plant vines on
hills and lofty places than on a plain. In like manner the poet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The vine loves the open hills;
the yews prefer the north wind and the
cold</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, therefore, having alluded to
the ordinary method of planting the vine, next follows out the comparison, that
this place occupied no ordinary situation. When he calls it <i>the</i> <i>son of
oil</i> or <i>of fatness</i>,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F70</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he means a rich and exceedingly fertile spot. This is limited by some
commentators to the fertility of Judea, but that does not accord with my views,
for the Prophet intended to describe metaphorically the prosperous condition of
the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he fenced
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The incessant care and watchfulness of God
in dressing his vine are asserted by the Prophet, as if he had said, that God
has neglected nothing that could be expected from the best and most careful
householder. And yet we do not choose to attempt, as some commentators have
done, an ingenious exposition of every clause, such as, that the Church is
<i>fenced</i> by the protection of the Holy Spirit, so that it is safe against
the attacks of the devil; that the <i>wine-press</i> is doctrine; and that by
<i>the stones</i> are meant the annoyances of errors. The design of the Prophet,
as I have mentioned, was more obvious, namely, that by incessant care and large
expenditure God has performed the part of an excellent husbandman. Yet it was
the duty of the Jews to consider how numerous and diversified were the blessings
which God had conferred on them; and at the present day, when the Church is
represented under the metaphor of <i>a vineyard</i>, we ought to view those
figures as denoting God's blessings, by which he makes known not only his love
toward us, but likewise his solicitude about our
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the verb <i>planted</i> the order
appears to be reversed, for one ought to begin with <i>planting</i> rather than
with the <i>fence</i>; but my explanation is, that after having <i>planted</i>,
he did everything else that was necessary. Justly, therefore, does he charge
them with ingratitude and treachery, when the fruits that ought to have followed
such laborious cultivation were not brought forth. There is reason to fear that
the Lord will bring the same accusation against us; for the greater the benefits
which we have received from God, the more disgraceful will be our ingratitude if
we abuse them. It is not without a good reason, or to enable them to make any
idle display, that the Lord blesses his people; it is, that they may yield
<i>grapes</i>, that is, the best fruit. If he be disappointed of his
expectation, the punishment which the Prophet here describes will follow. The
mention of his benefits ought, therefore, to produce a powerful impression on
our minds, and to excite us to
gratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vineyard</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and a <i>vineyard</i> so carefully cultivated, suggests an implied contrast; for
so much the more highly ought we to value the acts of God's kindness, when they
are not of an ordinary description, but tokens of his peculiar regard. Other
blessings are indiscriminately bestowed, such as, that he</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">maketh the sun to shine
on the evil as well as on the good,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400545&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
5:45,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and supplies them with what is necessary for food and
clothing. But how much more highly ought we to esteem that covenant of grace
into which he has entered with us, by which he makes the light of the Gospel to
shine on us; for his own people are its peculiar objects! That care and
diligence, therefore, which the Lord continually manifests in cultivating our
minds deserves our most earnest
consideration.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore he
hoped that it would bring forth
grapes</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He now complains that the nation which
had enjoyed such high advantages had basely and shamefully degenerated; and he
accuses them of undervaluing the kindness of God, for he says that, instead of
<i>pleasant grapes</i>, they yielded only <i>wild</i> and bitter fruits. It is
undoubtedly true that God, to whose eyes <i>all things are naked and opened</i>,
(Hebrew 4:13,) is not deceived by his expectation like a mortal man. In the Song
of Moses he plainly declares that he well knew from the beginning what would be
the wickedness of his people.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">My beloved, says he, when
she fares well and becomes
fat,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">will kick.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
32:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is therefore not more possible that God should be
mistaken in his expectations, than that he should repent. Isaiah does not here
enter into subtle reasonings about the expectations which God had formed, but
describes the manner in which the people ought to have acted, that they might
not lose the benefit of such excellent advantages. Thus God commands that the
Gospel be proclaimed <i>for the obedience of</i> <i>faith</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:26,) not that he expects all to be obedient, but because, by the mere hearing
of it, unbelievers are rendered inexcusable. Moreover, there is nothing that
ought to excite us more powerfully to lead a devout and holy life, than to find
that those duties whicn we perform towards God are compared by the Holy Spirit
to fruits of exquisite flavour.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now, therefore, O inhabitant of
Jerusalem!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Those persons with whom he contends
are made judges in their own cause, as is usually done in cases so plain and
undoubted that the opposite party has no means of evasion. It is, therefore, a
proof of the strongest confidence in his cause, when he bids the guilty persons
themselves declare if this be not the true state of the fact; for immediately
afterwards we shall find him declaring that the accusation is decided against
those persons to whom he now commits the
decision.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What more ought to have been done
to my vineyard?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He first inquires what could
have been expected from the best husbandman or householder,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which he has not done to his
vineyard</i></font><font face="Palatino">? Hence he concludes that they had no
excuse for having basely withheld from him the fruit of his
toil.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How did I expect that it
would yield grapes?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this clause he appears
to expostulate with himself for having expected any good or pleasant fruit from
so wicked a people; just as, when the result does not answer to our expectation,
we complain of ourselves, and are angry at having ill-bestowed our labor on
ungrateful persons whose wickedness ought to have restrained us from doing what
we did, and acknowledge that we are justly deceived, because we were too simple
and easily imposed on. But a more natural interpretation will be this: "Since I
discharged every part of my duty, and did more than any one could have expected
in dressing my <i>vineyard</i>, how comes it that it yields me so poor a return,
and that, instead of the fruit which was expected, it yields what is absolutely
bitter?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be objected that God had the
remedy in his hands, if he had turned the hearts of the people, this is an idle
evasion as applied to those men; for their conscience holds them fast, so that
they cannot escape by laying the blame on another. Though God do not pierce the
hearts of men by the power of his Spirit, so as to render them obedient to him,
yet they will have no right to complain that this was wanting; for every
pretense of ignorance is fully and abundantly taken away by the outward call.
Besides, God does not speak here of his power, but declares that he was not
under any obligation to do more than he
did.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now come, I will show you
what I will do to my vineyard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having held the
Jews to be condemned, as it were, by their own mouth, he next adds that he will
take vengeance for their contempt of his grace, so that they will not escape
from being punished. The reproof would not have been sufficiently powerful to
affect their minds, if he had not also threatened punishment; and therefore he
now declares that the heinous offense, of having wickedly imposed on him, will
not escape vengeance. Now the punishment to be inflicted on them amounts to
this, that they will be deprived of the gifts which they had abused, when God
shall not only withdraw his care of them, but shall give them up to be plundered
by their enemies. At the same time he shows how wretched their condition will
be, when God shall have ceased to bestow on them his multiplied
favors.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows that it must have been
owing entirely to the extraordinary goodness of God, that the <i>vineyard</i>
remained safe and uninjured till that time. He goes so far as to point out the
various supports by which it was upheld, and the vast resources which God
possesses for destroying it both within and without; for when his protection has
been removed, they must become a prey to all that pass by, whether men or
beasts. "When the fence has been removed," says he, "the cattle will tread on it
and lay it bare, robbers will ransack and plunder it, and thus it will become a
wilderness."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will lay it
waste.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God will not take pains to dig and prune
it, and consequently it will become barren for want of dressing; <i>briars and
thorns</i> will spring up to choke its branches; and, what is more, by
withholding rain, God will dry up its roots. Hence it is evident how manifold
are the weapons with which God is supplied for punishing our ingratitude, when
he sees that we despise his kindness. Isaiah is still, no doubt, proceeding with
his metaphor, and, in order to obtain more eager attention, adorns his style by
figures of speech. But we ought simply to conclude, that as God continually
bestows on us innumerable benefits, so we ought to be earnestly on our guard
lest, by withdrawing first one and then another, he punish us for despising
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the government of the
Church, the more numerous the kinds of assistance which she needs, the more
numerous are the punishments to which she will be liable, if she wickedly
corrupt what was appointed by God for her salvation. Nor ought we to wonder, if
at the present day so many distresses threaten ruin and desolation; for whatever
calamity befalls us, whether it be that there is a deficiency of instruction, or
that the wicked abound, or that foxes and wolves creep into the Church, all this
must be ascribed to our ingratitude, because we have not yielded such fruit as
we ought, and have been indolent and sluggish. Whenever, therefore, we are
justly deprived of those great favors which he freely bestowed on us, let us
acknowledge the anger of the Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Truly the vineyard of Jehovah of
hosts is the house of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hitherto he spoke
figuratively; now he shows what is the design of this <i>song</i>. Formerly he
had threatened judgment against the Jews; now he shows that they are not only
guilty, but are also held to be convicted persons; for they could not be
ignorant of the benefits which they had received from God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Thou broughtest a vine
from Egypt, says the Psalmist, and, having driven out the nations, plantedst it.

80:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Their ingratitude was plain and
manifest.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah does not illustrate every part
of the metaphor; nor was it necessary; for it was enough to point out what was
its object. The whole nation was <i>the vineyard</i>; the individual men were
<i>the plants</i>. Thus he accuses the whole body of the nation, and then every
individual; so that no man could escape the universal condemnation, as if no
part of the expostulation had been addressed to himself. Why the nation is
called <i>a vineyard</i> is plain enough; for the Lord chose it, and admitted it
to the covenant of grace and of eternal salvation, and bestowed on it
innumerable blessings. The <i>planting</i> is the commencement, and the dressing
of it follows. That nation was adopted, and in various respects was the object
of Divine care; for the adoption would have been of no avail, if the Lord had
not continually adorned and enriched it by his
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The same doctrine ought to be
inculcated on us at the present day. Christ affirms that he is <i>the vine</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
15:1,) and that, having been ingrafted into this <i>vine</i>, we are placed
under the care of the Father; for God is pleased to perform towards us the
office of a husbandman, and continually bestows those favors which he
reproachfully asserts that he had granted to his ancient people. We need not
wonder, therefore, if he is greatly enraged when he bestows his labor uselessly
and to no purpose. Hence that threatening,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He looked for
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He begins without a metaphor to
relate how wickedly the Jews had degenerated, among whom equity and justice was
despised, and every kind of injustice and violence abounded. The words contain
an elegant play of language, (paronomasia,) for those which have nearly the same
sound have an opposite meaning.

(<i>tzeakah</i>) denotes the <i>cry</i> and <i>complaint</i> of those who are
oppressed by violence and injustice; sounds which are not wont to be heard where
every man receives what is his own. He mentions two things which the Lord
chiefly demands from his people as the genuine fruits of the fear of God; for
although piety comes first in order, yet there is no inconsistency in taking the
description of it from the duties of the second table. They are justly charged
with having despised God, on the ground of having acted cruelly towards men; for
where cruelty reigns, religion is
extinguished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us now understand that the
same things are addressed to us; for as that nation was <i>planted</i>, so were
we. We should call to remembrance what Paul says, that we were like <i>wild
olive-plants</i>, but that they were the true and natural olive-tree.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:25.) since we who were strangers have been ingrafted into the true
olive-tree, the Lord has cultivated and adorned us with unceasing care. But what
kind of fruits do we bring forth? Assuredly they are not only useless, but even
bitter. So much the greater is the ingratitude for which we ought to be
condemned, for the blessings which he has bestowed and heaped on us are far more
abundant. And justly does this expostulation apply to us, for violence and
injustice abound everywhere. But since the general doctrine did not strike their
minds so powerfully, the Prophet described chiefly these two kinds of
wickedness; that he might point out with the finger, as it were, how far that
nation was from the fruit which a good <i>vineyard</i> ought to have
yielded.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to them that join house to
house and field to field.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now reproves their
insatiable avarice and covetousness, from which the acts of cheating, injustice,
and violence are wont to arise. For it cannot be condemned as a thing in itself
wrong, if a man </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>add field to
field and</i> <i>house to house</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but he looked
at the disposition of mind, which cannot at all be satisfied, when it is once
inflamed by the desire of gain. Accordingly, he describes the feelings of those
who never have enough, and whom no wealth can satisfy. So great is the keenness
of covetous men that they desire to have everything possessed by themselves
alone, and reckon everything that is obtained by others to be something which
they want, and which has been taken from them. Hence the beautiful observation
of Chrysostom, that "covetous men, if they could, would willingly take the sun
from the poor," for they envy their brethren the common elements, and would
gladly swallow them up; not that they might enjoy them, but because such is the
madness to which their greed carries them. All the while they do not consider
that they need the assistance of others, and that a man left alone can do
nothing: all their care is to scrape together as much as they can, and thus they
swallow up everything by their covetousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He
therefore accuses covetous and ambitious men of such folly that they would wish
to have other men removed from the earth, that they might possess it alone; and
consequently they set no limit to their desire of gain. For what madness is it
to wish to have those driven away from the earth whom God has placed in it along
with us, and to whom, as well as to ourselves, he has assigned it as their
abode! Certainly nothing more ruinous could happen to them than to obtain their
wish. Were they alone, they could not plough, or reap, or perform other offices
indispensable to their subsistence, or supply themselves with the necessaries of
life. For God has linked men so closely together, that they need the assistance
and labor of each other; and none but a madman would disdain other men as
hurtful or useless to him. Ambitious men cannot enjoy their renown but amidst a
multitude. How blind are they, therefore, when they wish to drive and chase away
others, that they may reign alone!</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the
size of <i>houses</i>, the same remark which we formerly made about
<i>fields</i> will apply; for he points out the ambition of those who are
desirous to inhabit spacious and magnificent <i>houses</i>. If a man who has a
large family makes use of a large <i>house</i>, he cannot be blamed for it; but
when men, swollen with ambition, make superfluous additions to their houses,
only that they may live in greater luxury, and when one person alone occupies a
building which might serve for the habitation of many families, this undoubtedly
is empty ambition, and ought justly to be blamed. Such persons act as if they
had a right to drive out other men, and to be the only persons that enjoyed a
house or a roof, and as if other men ought to live in the open air, or must go
somewhere else to find an abode.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is in the ears of Jehovah of
hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here something must be supplied; for he
means that the Lord sits as judge, and as taking cognizance of those things.
When covetous men seize and heap up their wealth, they are blinded by their
desire of gain, and do not understand that they will one day render an account.
Never, certainly, were men so utterly stupid as not to ascribe some judgment to
God; but they flatter themselves so far as to imagine that God does not observe
them. In general, therefore, they acknowledge the judgment of God: when they
come to particular cases, they take liberties, and suppose that they are not
bound to proceed to that
extent.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If many houses be not
laid desolate. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Having warned them that none of
these things escape the eyes of God, lest they should imagine that it is a
knowledge which does not lead to action, he immediately adds, that vengeance is
close at hand. He likewise makes use of an oath; for the expression <i>If
not</i> is a form of swearing that frequently occurs in the
Scriptures.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In order to strike them with greater
terror he breaks off the sentence with studied
abruptness.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He might indeed have brought out this
threatening with full expression, but the incomplete form is better fitted to
keep the hearer in doubt and suspense, and is therefore more alarming. Besides,
by this instance of reserve the Lord intended to train us to modesty, that we
may not be too free in the use of oaths.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
what does he threaten? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many
houses will be laid desolate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a just
punishment, by which the Lord chastises the covetousness and ambition of men,
who did not consider their own meanness, that they might be satisfied with a
moderate portion. In a similar manner the poet ridicules the mad ambition of
Alexander the Great, who having learned from the philosophy of Anacharsis that
there were many worlds, sighed to think, that after having worn himself out by
so many toils, he had not yet made himself master of one world. "One globe does
not satisfy the Macedonian youth. He writhes in misery on account of the narrow
limits of the world, as if he were confined to the rocks of Gyaros, or to the
puny Seriphos. But when he shall enter the city framed by potters, he will be
content with a tomb. Death alone acknowledges how small are the dimensions of
the bodies of men."

exhibits to us, as in a mirror, the absurd vanity of men, who spend a vast

our eyes, and yet we do not apply our mind to the consideration of them. So
sudden and various are the changes that happen, so many houses are laid
desolate, so many cities are overthrown and destroyed, and, in short, there are
so many other evident proofs of the judgment of God; and yet men cannot be
persuaded to lay aside this mad ambition. The Lord threatens by the Prophet

thing will befall their fields and vineyards; that covetous men will not obtain
the desired returns, because their greed is insatiable; that, like certain
animals which, by their breath, scorch the branches, and wither the corn, those
men destroy the fruits of the earth by their extortion. The fields will be so
barren as scarcely to yield a tenth part of the seed: the vineyards will yield
very little wine.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A

curse of God punishing the extortion of men. And yet men blame the niggardliness
of the soil, as if the fault lay there, but all in vain; for we would not want
abundant increase, if God did not curse the soil on account of men's
covetousness. When they are so eagerly employed in gathering and heaping up,
what else are they doing than swallowing up the goodness of God by their greed?
If this is not seen in all, because they want the power, still they do not want
the disposition. Never was the world so much inflamed by this covetousness, and
we need not wonder if God visit it with
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>

The Prophet does not aim at an enumeration of all the vices which then
prevailed, but only points out some particular kinds of them, to which they were
peculiarly addicted. After having handled the general doctrine, he found it
necessary to come to particular vices; and the enumeration of those was more
urgently needed, for there would have been no end of going through them all one
by one. Having reproved covetousness, he now attacks drunkenness, which
undoubtedly was also a prevailing vice; for the kinds of vices which he selects
are not those which were found in one person or another, but those which
universally prevailed; and indeed the vices are of such a kind as infect the
whole body by their contagion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To

104:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if he lay aside his labors, and rise to partake
of luxuries, and to follow drunkenness, this is monstrous. He adds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And who continue till
night</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The meaning is, that from the dawn of
the morning to the twilight of the evening they continue their drunken
carousals, and are never weary of drinking. Abundance and luxury are closely
joined together; for when men enjoy abundance, they become luxurious, and abuse
it by intemperance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
harp</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds the instruments of pleasures by
which men addicted to intemperance provoke their appetite. These might be
different from ours, but they belonged to music. Now, Isaiah does not blame
music, for it is a science which ought not to be despised; but he describes a
nation swimming in every kind of luxury, and too much disposed to indulge in
pleasures. This is sufficiently evident from what
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they regard not
the work of the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As if he had said, "They
are as constant in luxurious indulgence, and as much devoted to it, as if this
had been the purpose for which they were born and reared; and they do not
<i>consider</i> why the Lord supplies them with what is necessary." Men were not
born to eat and drink, and wallow in luxury, but to obey God, to worship him
devoutly, to acknowledge his goodness, and to endeavor to do what is pleasing in
his sight. But when they give themselves up to luxury, when they dance, and
sing, and have no other object in view than to spend their life in the highest
mirth, they are worse than beasts: for they do not <i>consider</i> for what end
God created them, in what manner he governs this world by his providence, and to
what end all the actions of our life ought to be
directed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Having stated this meaning, which
appears to me to be natural, I consider nothing more to be necessary; for I
cannot adopt the ingenious expositions of some authors, such as, when they
explain the <i>work</i> of God to mean <i>the law</i>; nor did I intend to state
every opinion which others have maintained. It is enough to know that all who
are addicted to gormandizing are here subjected by the Prophet to the reproach
of voluntarily becoming like brute beasts, when they do not direct their minds
to God, who is the author of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore my people are gone into
captivity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not approve of the
interpretation given by some commentators, that in consequence of the teachers
having failed to perform their duty, the people, through ignorance and error,
fell into many vices, which at length became the cause of their destruction. On
the contrary, he charges them with gross and voluntary ignorance, as if he had
said that, by their madness, they brought down destruction on themselves. The
meaning therefore is, that the people perished because they despised
instruction; whereas they might have been preserved if they had listened to good
counsels: and therefore he expressly says, <i>My people</i>; that is, the nation
which enjoyed the extraordinary privilege of being separated from the rest of
the nations, that by relying on the guidance and direction of God, they might
have a fixed rule of life. Thus it is
said,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"What nation is so eminent
and so distinguished as to have gods nigh to it, as thy God draws near to thee
this day? This shall therefore be your knowledge and understanding above all
nations, to hear your God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
4:6, 7.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This baseness heightens the criminality
of the people, that they shut their eyes in the midst of so much light. It was
therefore a very severe accusation, that a people which God had undertaken to
govern possessed <i>no knowledge</i>: for the law might have given them abundant
direction for the whole conduct of life; it was a light shining before them
amidst the general darkness of the world; and therefore it was monstrous that
the nation should refuse to follow that path which had been pointed out to them,
and, on the contrary, should shut their eyes, and rush forward to
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have gone into
captivity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some consider the word
<i>captivity</i> to be used here in a metaphorical sense; but this is a forced
interpretation; for the Prophet here describes the punishments which God had in
part inflicted, and in part intended to inflict, so as to make it evident that
the people were wretched through their own fault, as if they wished to draw down
upon themselves the curses of God. When this discourse was delivered, some
tribes of Israel had already been banished, and the destruction of both kingdoms
was at hand. The Prophet accordingly speaks as if all had already been led
<i>into captivity</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
their glory are men famished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and their multitude are dried
up with thirst.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now adds another punishment,
namely, that they are wasted with hunger and famine, and not only common men,
but some persons of the highest rank, in whom the vengeance of God is more
clearly seen; for it was shocking to see wealthy men and nobles, on whom the
respectability of the whole nation rested, wandering about and famished. And yet
the severity of God's vengeance did not exceed proper bounds; for we must always
take into account that ignorance was the cause; that is, the Jews were
rebellious, and obstinately rejected the light of heavenly doctrine; yea, shut
their ears against God when he was willing to perform the part of a master in
instructing them. Hence we draw a useful doctrine; namely, that the source of
all our calamities is, that we do not allow ourselves to be taught by the word
of God, and this is what the Prophet chiefly intended that we should
observe.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, Is ignorance the cause
of all calamities? Many persons appear to sin not so much through ignorance as
through obstinacy; for they see what is right, but refuse to follow it, and the
consequence is that they sin willingly, and not merely through inadvertency. I
answer, ignorance is sometimes the <i>near</i>, and sometimes the <i>remote</i>
cause; or, to use the common expressions, the one is <i>immediate, and the other
is mediate</i>. It is the <i>near</i> cause, when men deceive themselves under
any pretense, and intentionally blind their understanding. Again, it is the
<i>remoter</i> cause, when men reject the principles from which they ought to
frame the rule of their life; for it was their duty to look to God, and to
attend to his will. When they disregard his will, they are indeed rebellious and
obstinate; but they are ignorant because they refuse to learn, and on this rock
they split: and yet ignorance does not excuse them, for of their own accord they
bring it on themselves when they reject such a Teacher. So then it is a true
statement, that the reason why the people endure such a variety of afflictions
is, that they are ignorant of God, and will not allow themselves to be taught by
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore hell hath enlarged his
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In this verse the Prophet intended to
heighten the alarm of men who were at their ease, and not yet sufficiently
affected by the threatenings which had been held out to them. Though it was
shocking to behold <i>captivity</i>, and also famine, yet the slowness and
insensibility of the people was so great that they did not give earnest heed to
these tokens of God's anger. Accordingly the Prophet threatens something still
more dreadful, that hell has opened his belly to swallow them all
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I said a little ago, that what is here
stated in the past tense refers partly to the future. Nor is it without good
reason that the Prophet speaks of the events as plain and manifest; for he
intended to bring them immediately before the people, that they might behold
with their eyes what they could not be persuaded to believe. Again, when he
compares <i>hell</i> or <i>the grave</i> to an insatiable beast, by the
<i>soul</i> he means the belly into which the food is thrown. The general
meaning is, that the grave is like a wide and vast gulf, which, at the command
of God, yawns to devour men who are condemned to die. This personification
carries greater emphasis than if he had said that all are condemned to the
grave.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And her glory hath
descended, and her multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He joins together
the nobles and men of low rank, that none may flatter themselves with the hope
of escape: as if he had said, "<i>Death</i> will carry you away, and all that
you possess, your delicacies, wealth, pleasures, and everything else in which
you place your confidence." It is therefore a confirmation of the former
statement, and we ought always to attend to the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kl</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>laken</i>,) <i>therefore</i>; for the people ascribed their calamities to
fortune, or in some other way hardened themselves against the Lord's
chastisements. On this account Isaiah says that these things do not happen by
chance. Besides, men are wont to argue with God, and are so daring and
presumptuous that they do not hesitate to call him to account. In order,
therefore, to restrain that pride, he shows that the punishments with which they
are visited are just, and that it is owing entirely to their own folly that they
are miserable in every respect.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the mighty man shall be bowed
down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may be called the summing up, for it
points out the end and result of those chastisements, that all may be cast down,
and that the Lord alone may be exalted. We have formerly met with a similar
statement,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:11,17,) and on that occasion we explained what was the Prophet's
meaning;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is, that he shows the design of the
chastisements which God inflicts on us. Adversity is so hateful to us, that we
can perceive nothing good in it. When he speaks of punishments, we detest and
abhor them, because we do not perceive the justice of God. But the prophets
remind us of another consideration, that so long as men go on in their sins
regardlessly, the justice of God is in some degree smothered, and never shines
so brightly as when he punishes our sins. This fruit is indeed very great, and
ought to be preferred to the salvation of all men; for the glorv of God, which
shines in his righteousness, ought to be more highly esteemed than all things
else.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is, therefore, no reason why we
should so greatly dread the chastisements which God inflicts upon us, but we
ought to embrace with reverence what the prophets declare concerning them. In
this way, however, the Prophet has severely chastised arrogant hypocrites. who
become the more insolent when they are not punished; as if he had said, "Do you
imagine that, when God has endured you so long, you will at last be able to
tread him under your feet? Assuredly he will arise, and will be exalted in your
destruction."</font><br><font face="Palatino">As the Prophet has employed,
first, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;da</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>adam</i>) and next
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ya</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ish</i>), it is supposed that this denotes both the noble and the mean; as
if he had said, "Not only will the common people perish, but likewise those who
are eminent for riches, honor, and high rank." I cheerfully adopt this opinion;
for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ya</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ish</i>) is derived from <i>strength</i> and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;da</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>adam</i>) from <i>earth</i>. But if any one prefer a more simple
interpretation, I leave it to his judgment. However this may be, the Prophet
includes all men, both the highest and the
lowest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But Jehovah of hosts shall be
exalted in judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresses the manner,
or, as it is commonly called, the formal cause, of the excellence of which he
has spoken; as if he had said, "The God of hosts, whom ungodly men insolently
tread under their feet, will be raised on high, when he shall show himself to be
the judge of the world." In this manner he ridicules the foolish confidence with
which the ungodly vaunted; for if judgment and righteousness must at length come
forth, it follows that they shall be cast down, since the only way in which
those men rise is by overturning the order of nature. And it ought to be
carefully observed, that it is not more possible for wicked men to continue in
prosperity than for God to permit his glory to be set aside. Though
<i>judgment</i> is not at all different from <i>righteousness</i>, still the
repetition is not
superfluous.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God, who is
holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
language becomes more vehement, that wicked men may not, by a false imagination,
assure themselves of uninterrupted happiness, which they cannot have, unless by
setting aside the <i>holiness</i> of God. But since God <i>is holy</i> by
nature, he must be <i>sanctified</i>. Hence it follows that destruction hangs
over the wicked, that their obstinacy and rebellion may be subdued, for God
cannot deny himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the lambs shall feed after
their manner.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render it <i>according to
their measure</i>, or, <i>in proportion to their capacity</i>, but it means
<i>in the usual manner</i>. There are various ways of explaining this verse; but
we ought first of all to observe that the Prophet intended to bring consolation
to the godly, who trembled at hearing the dreadful judgments of God; for the
more powerfully a man is under the influence of religion, the more does he feel
the presence of the hand of God, and the more is he impressed by the
apprehension of his judgment. In short, fear and reverence for God cause us to
be deeply moved by everything that is presented to us in his
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, after having heard such
dreadful threatenings, they must have fainted, if this consolation had not been
added as a seasoning, to give them a taste of the mercy of God. It is customary
with the prophets always to pay attention to the godly, and to support their
minds. "Although, therefore," says Isaiah, "it may seem as if God were about to
destroy the whole nation, still he will show himself to be a faithful shepherd
to his <i>lambs</i>, and will <i>feed</i> them in his usual
manner."</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is one object; but it was also the
intention of the Prophet to repress the haughtiness of the nobles, who oppressed
with unjust tyranny the godly and poor, and yet boasted that they were the
Church of God. He reminds them, therefore, that it is an idle and false
boasting, when they assume the designation of God's flock; for they are
<i>goats</i>, not <i>lambs</i>. Not only will God have it in his power to feed
his flock, when the <i>goats</i> have been cut off, but it will never fare well
with the <i>lambs</i> till they have been separated from the
<i>goats</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the waste
places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
There is a still greater diversity here among commentators; but I consider the
true meaning to be, that the children of God, banished and treated as foreigners
for a time, will regain their lost rights, and will then obtain those places
which have been laid <i>waste</i>, or reduced to desolation by <i>the fat
ones</i>, that is, by the proud and cruel men who had seized their property. For
he calls the children of God <i>strangers</i> who would be exiles for a time,
and by <i>waste places</i>, or <i>forsaken places</i>, he means those
possessions which they had relinquished, and which others had seized. He refers
to a custom well known and exceedingly common, which is, that if any one possess
fields or houses, he keeps his hand, as it were, stretched over them, so that no
one will venture to touch a clod; but if he forsake them they are seized. The
people, therefore, had forsaken the possessions from which they had been
expelled, so far as to despair of being ever able to regain them; so that they
might justly be called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forsaken
places</i></font><font face="Palatino">, with respect to themselves, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forsaken places of the fat
ones</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because they had been possessed by the
mighty and powerful. We may, indeed, view the expression more simply as denoting
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forsaken fat
places</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but it is more probable that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fat
ones</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are meant
tyrants.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo unto them that draw iniquity
with cords of vanity!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having inserted a
short consolation for the purpose of allaying the bitterness of punishments as
regards the godly, he returns to threatenings, and proceeds to launch those
thunderbolts of words which are fitted to awaken some degree of alarm. By
<i>cords</i> he means nothing else than the allurements by which men suffer
themselves to be deceived, and harden their heart in crimes; for either they
ridicule the judgment of God, or they contrive vain excuses, and allege the plea
of necessity. Any concealment, therefore, which they employ, he calls
<i>cords</i>; for whenever men are prompted to sin by the lust of the flesh,
they at first pause, and feel that something within restrains them, which would
certainly keep them back, if they did not rush forward with opposing violence,
and break through all opposition. When any man is tempted to do what is sinful,
his conscience secretly asks him, What are you doing? And sin never advances so
freely as not to feel this check; for God intended in this manner to provide for
the good of mankind, lest all should break out into unbridled
licentiousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How comes it, then, that men are
so obstinate in doing what is sinful? Assuredly they permit themselves to be
deceived by allurements, and stupify their minds, that they may despise the
judgment of God, and may thus have some freedom to commit sin. They flatter
themselves by imagining that what is sin is not sin, or by some excuse or idle
pretense they lessen its enormity. These, then, are <i>cords</i>, wicked
<i>ropes</i>, by which they <i>draw iniquity</i>. Hence it is evident that the
Lord has good reason for threatening them; for they sin, not only of their own
accord, but perversely and obstinately, and, in short, they bind themselves to
sin, so that they are without excuse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who say, Let him make
speed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He specifies one class of sins, by means
of which he shows that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>draw
sins as by ropes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When men not only lay aside
all thought of the Divine judgment, but despise and treat as fabulous all that
is said about it, nothing can be worse than this. He intended to say that the
utmost contempt is manifested when men, to whom the judgment of God has been
declared, say that it would give them joy to see it, and treat it with ridicule
as a silly alarm; which is denoted by these words full of contempt and of wicked
confidence: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him come, let him
make
speed.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Work</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
is here put, by way of eminence,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,) for <i>judgment</i>; for God appears
to be doing nothing when he does not punish the crimes of the ungodly; but when
he rises up to execute
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and inflicts punishment, his <i>work</i> is then seen, and becomes visible (as
is commonly said) by action; because from the very fact we learn that the world
is governed by his authority and power.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Work</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
therefore, is taken specially for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
because by means of it we see that God is by no means unemployed, but performs
his office. Now, ungodly men speak of him with reproach and contempt, and at
this very day we have abundant instances of such wickedness and rebellion; and
the same war which was formerly waged by the prophets is that which we also are
called to maintain.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The ungodly think that God
does nothing, and cares not about the affairs of men; as Epicurus thought that
God's highest happiness consisted in his being free from all occupation. Though
they imagine that there is some God, yet they do not at all acknowledge his
<i>judgment</i>; and in the meantime they bid themselves be of good cheer, and
resolve that they will not wear themselves out by such thoughts. "Let these
prophets and ministers cry, and bawl, and hold out terrors and threatenings; we
will wait without any concern for what they tell us, and in the meantime we will
enjoy our mirth." In this way the Prophet relates the speeches of the ungodly,
by which they expressed ridicule and contempt of the word. Not only do they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let his work come, but, Let him
hasten, Let him make speed;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for when he delays,
they conclude that everything which God does not execute as soon as he has
spoken it is idle talk. Thus Peter represents the ungodly as
saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"<i>Since the world

<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, they purposely, as it were, provoke
God to exert his power immediately, if he has
any.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the counsel of the
Holy One of Israel draw near and come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To
<i>work</i> is added <i>counsel</i>, as if they had said, "Why does God
deliberate so long, or say what he intends to do? Let him rather show that what
he has decreed is accomplished." It is a great aggravation of their crime, that
they wickedly dared to set aside the doctrine which was well known to them. They
were more wicked than the heathen Gentiles in this respect, that they despised
the doctrine by which he had adopted them to be his peculiar
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may see
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These are proofs of infidelity; for ungodly
men will not acknowledge God, unless they have immediate evidence of his
presence, and they refuse to believe his words. Now, if the Holy Spirit, by
means of this mark, holds up ungodly men to detestation, we ought to testify our
faith and piety by the opposite sign, that is, by relying on the word of God,
though the effect does not immediately appear; for it is the peculiar excellence
of faith to hold us dependent on the mouth of God. True, we next derive
confirmation from works, but we must not begin at them; for this is the
distinction between the elect and the reprobate, that the elect simply rely on
the word, but do not disregard works, while ungodly men scorn and disdain the
word, though God speak a hundred times; and yet they continually and eagerly
call upon him for works. And when the judgment of God is declared, they say,
"Where is it?" They cannot endure the mention of it, unless it be immediately
made known by action. When men are so immoderate, it follows that they have no
faith, but rather obstinate rebelliousness, Which more and more withdraws and
estranges man from God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo to them that call evil
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though some limit this statement to
judges, yet if it be carefully examined, we shall easily learn from the whole
context that it is general; for, having a little before reproved those who
cannot listen to any warnings, he now proceeds with the same reproof. It is
evident that men of this sort have always some excuse to plead, and some way of
imposing on themselves; and, therefore, there is no end to their reproachful
language, when their crimes are brought to light. But here he particularly
reproves the insolence of those who endeavor to overthrow all distinction
between <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lamed</i>), prefixed to the words <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>, is equivalent
to <i>Of</i>; and therefore the meaning is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who say of evil, It is good,
and of good, It is evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they who by
vain hypocrisy conceal, excuse, and disguise wicked actions, as if they would
change the nature of everything by their sophistical arguments, but who, on the
contrary deface good actions by their calumnies. These things are almost always
joined together, for every one in whom the fear of God dwells is restrained both
by conscience and by modesty from venturing to apologize for his sins, or to
condemn what is good and right; but they who have not this fear do not hesitate
with the same impudence to commend what is bad and to condemn what is good;
which is a proof of desperate wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
statement may be applied to various cases; for if a <i>wo</i> is here pronounced
even on private individuals, when they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say of evil that it is good, and
of good that it is evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">, how much more on those
who have been raised to any elevated rank, and discharge a public office, whose
duty it is to defend what is right and honorable! But he addresses a general
reproof to all who flatter themselves in what is evil, and who, through the
hatred which they bear to virtue, condemn what is done aright; and not only so,
but who, by the subterfuges which they employ for the sake of concealing their
own enormities, harden themselves in wickedness. Such persons, the Prophet tells
us, act as if they would change
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light into darkness, and sweet
into bitter</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which he means that their folly
is monstrous, for it would tend to confound and destroy all the principles of
nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo to them that are wise in their
own eyes!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he proceeds to rebuke those on
whom no instruction can produce a good effect, and who do not allow any wise
counsels or godly warnings to gain admission. In short, he pronounces a curse on
obstinate scorners, who set up either the lusts of the flesh or a preposterous
confidence in their wisdom, in opposition to God's instruction and warnings. And
not only does he rebuke those who are puffed up with a false conviction of their
wisdom, and are ashamed to learn from others, but he likewise pronounces a
general condemnation on all who, through prejudices in their own favor, refuse
to hear God speaking, and to listen to his holy
warnings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This fault has been too common in all
ages, and we see it in very many persons at the present day, who, though they
would shrink from openly rejecting the doctrine of godliness, are yet so far
from being truly obedient and teachable, that they haughtily reject everything
that does not please them. They acknowledge that they need some bridle, but, on
the other hand, are so much blinded by their presumption, that, when God points
out the way, they immediately rebel; and not only so, but break out into violent
indignation at the censure passed on their proceedings. Nay, where is the man
who renounces his own judgment, and is ready to learn only from the mouth of
God? But nothing is more destructive than this deceitful show of wisdom; for the
beginning of piety is willingness to be taught, when we have renounced our own
judgment and follow wherever God calls.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor is
this false belief condemned solely on the ground of its rendering men
disobedient to God, and thus being the cause of their ruin, but also on the
ground of being in itself what God cannot endure. We must become fools if we
desire to be God's disciples. But it is also certain that mad rebellion reigns
wherever there is not found that modesty and humility which leads a man
willingly to yield subjection, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
their own eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means what we say in French,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo to them that are mighty to
drink wine!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now censures another vice,
namely, drunkenness and excess in eating, of which he had spoken before; so that
probably this chapter is collected from various sermons, and the leading topics
only are bliefly touched; for when the Prophet saw no repentance, he was forced
to repeat and frequently inculcate the same instructions. He therefore returns
to the same reproofs which he had previously noticed; for he again discourses
about drunkenness, luxury, covetousness, and other corruptions. Hence we ought
to conclude, that when warnings produce no good effect, we ought to employ
greater earnestness in addressing the obstinate and disobedient, and that we
must not be afraid of giving offense by our eagerness, but must frequently
repeat the reproofs, until they either yield or manifest incurable
malice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By calling them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strong or powerful to
drink</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he wittily accuses them of wasting their
strength in bacchanalian warfare. It is disgraceful and beastly ambition, when a
man of vigorous health makes a display of his strength by drinking largely.
Employing a figure of speech (<i>synecdoche</i>) which is frequent in the
Prophets, and indeed in the whole of Scripture, he takes a part for the whole;
as if he had said, "Wo to gluttony; Wo to intemperance." But he purposely
mentioned that which was disgraceful in the highest degree, in order to render
that vice generally hated and abhorred; for, as we have said, nothing is more
base or disgraceful than for a man to make trial of his strength in swallowing
food or in guzzling wine, and thus struggling with himself so as to cram down as
much as his belly can hold. Such men keep by no rule of life, and do not know
why God gives them nourishment; for we eat and drink to support the body, and
not to destroy it. We live that we may yield worship and obedience to God, and
that we may render assistance to our neighbors. When men act so as not to
maintain their strength, but to destroy it by trying how much food and wine they
can bear, most certainly they are worse than
beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who justify the wicked for a
reward.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He censures a corruption which at that
time abounded in judgment-seats, and points out the reason why there is no room
for justice in these places, namely, that they are under the influence of
<i>gifts</i>. For covetousness
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blindeth the eyes of the wise,
and perverteth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> all regard to what is good and
just, even among those who would otherwise be disposed to follow what is right.

16:19.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be objected that there are other
methods, and that it is not by <i>gifts</i> only that judgments are perverted;
for favor, hatred, friendship, and other sinful passions, often blind the
understanding. This is undoubtedly true; but the Prophet had in his eye what
happens for the most part,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt; to&lt;
polu&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,) and at the same time did not intend to
spare those vices which he did not express by name. Following this example,
godly teachers ought to be wise and careful in observing and correcting the
vices which most extensively abound among the people, and most of all to oppose
everything which appears to be sanctioned by wicked
custom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now this corruption which is mentioned
is that which most frequently of all is to be found in judgment-seats; and,
therefore, it ought to be most carefully avoided by those judges who wish to
form an upright judgment. Nor ought we to listen to what is affirmed by many,
that <i>gifts</i> are not bestowed on them for that purpose, or that, after
having accepted them, they are as free as ever to give a just decision; for
where <i>gifts</i> are allowed, the regard to what is just and right must be
corrupted, and it is impossible for your mind not to be favourably disposed
towards him from whom you received them. In short, we should hear the Lord, who
declares that the understanding of the wisest man is corrupted, and the
disposition of the most upright man is perverted, unless we choose to be thought
wiser than God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore as the flame of fire
devoureth the stubble.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Lest it should be
thought that he has so frequently cried out without good reason, he again shows
what grievous and dreadful punishment awaits the nation, and threatens utter
destruction to the stubborn, because they did not permit themselves to be
brought back to the right path, but obstinately resisted instruction. He employs
metaphors exceedingly well adapted to express his meaning, and better fitted to
affect their hearts than if he had spoken plainly and without a figure. He
begins with a comparison, but immediately slides into a metaphor, attributing a
<i>root</i> and <i>branch</i> to the nation as to a tree. Under those two words
he includes all the strength, either hidden or visible, that belongs to the
nation, and says that the whole will be destroyed; for when the root, which
alone gives strength and nourishment to the tree, becomes rotten, it is all over
with the tree; and in like manner he threatens that it is all over with the
nation, and that its whole strength is wasted and
consumed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they have
rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does
not now enumerate, as formerly, the particular kinds of crime by which they had
provoked the wrath of God, but assigns a general cause, namely, contempt of the
law of God; for this, as all men know, is the source of everything bad. And it
is no small aggravation of their crime that, when the will of God had been made
known to them in his law, it was not through ignorance or mistake, but through
inveterate malice, that they shook of the yoke of God, and abandoned themselves
to every kind of licentiousness; which was nothing else than to reject so kind a
Father, and to give themselves up to be the slaves of the devil. Besides, he
accuses them of open revolt; as if he had said that it was not in one or a few
instances that they were rebellious, but that they might be regarded as
treacherous apostates, and had altogether forsaken
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And loathed the word of
the Holy One of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He complains that they
not only despised the word of God, but &#8212; what is far more shocking &#8212;
turned away from it, or threw it away in wicked disdain. But if contempt for
<i>the law of God</i> is the source, head, and accumulation of all that is evil,
there is nothing against which we ought more carefully to guard than that Satan
should take away our reverence for it; and if there are any faults to which we
are liable, we ought, at least, to allow a remedy to be applied to them, if we
do not choose, by wickedly rejecting it, to draw down upon ourselves everlasting
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore is the anger of the
LORD kindled. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet relates
the former punishments which the Jews had already endured, and shows that they
are not near an end; but that, on the contrary, heavier judgments await them, if
they do not return to the right path. I readily acknowledge that the past tense
is frequently employed instead of the future, but the meaning which I have
stated will best agree with the context; for there are two things quite distinct
from each other, which he lays down, on account of the resolute obstinacy of the
people. First, how God perceives their crimes. Secondly, since there are no
signs of repentance, he has other scourges within his reach for chastising the
people. Thirdly, he describes what those scourges are, and forewarns them that
the Assyrians will come at the bidding of the Lord, as soon as he shall express
it by merely <i>hissing</i> to them, (verse.
26.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such is the connection of what the Prophet
states; and hence it ought to be observed that the great body of men, as soon as
they have escaped any calamity, forget their chastisements, and no longer regard
them as the judgments of God; and that, though experience be the instructor of
fools, still they grow hardened by strokes. This insensibility Isaiah sharply
rebukes; as if he had said, "Have you so quickly forgotten the calamities under
which you lately groaned? Whence came the distressful casting out of dead
bodies, but because God had raised his arm against you? And if God has
discharged the office of a judge, why do not those recent chastisements induce
you to fear him, and to refrain from drawing down a succession of chastisements
by new crimes?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, he repeats the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kAl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnal ken</i>,) <i>therefore</i>; as if he had said that those distresses are
not accidental, but are manifest tokens of God's vengeance; and so he expressly
says that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was angry with his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for if the Jews had not fallen from
their own rank, their condition would have been happier than that of any other
nation. When God's chosen people, therefore, are treated by him with so much
sharpness and severity, it is beyond all doubt that he has been provoked by
heinous crimes. At the same time he refutes the false boasting by which the Jews
were wont to vaunt and exalt themselves, as if they ought to be exempt from
chastisements on the ground of their being God's peculiar
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the mountains
trembled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this comparison the dreadful
nature of those punishments to which they were insensible is described in such a
manner as to prove more clearly the stupidity of the people. They were more
stupid than inanimate objects, if they did not perceive the wrath of God, and
the dreadful vengeance which had been inflicted on the kingdom of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He threatens heavier chastisements in
future, as we have already said; for although wicked men acknowledge that the
Lord has punished them, still they think that they have no right to expect
anything more than one or two chastisements. As if therefore nothing worse could
befall them, and as if God's power to punish them had been exhausted, they wrap
themselves up in blind indifference. This is the reason why he exclaims that the
wrath of God is not yet appeased, and that, although it has inflicted on them
many calamities, still it has within its stores many weapons from which they
have reason to dread innumerable wounds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) may be taken as a disjunctive, so as to mean, <i>but, on the
contrary, his hand is stretched out still</i>. He refers to what he had formerly
said, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of God is
stretched out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He tells them that it is not yet
drawn back, and that it may yet pursue them, and inflict plagues of the same
kind, or even of greater severity. We ought diligently to meditate on these
statements, in order to shake off that drowsiness to which the greater part of
men are frequently liable, even after having received
chastisements.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will lift up an ensign to
the nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this and the following verses
he describes the nature of the punishment which the Lord would inflict on his
people; namely, that they were about to suffer from the Assyrians a similar, or
even a heavier calamity, than that which their brethren the Israelites had
lately endured. Many distresses had indeed been suffered by themselves from the
Assyrians, though the kingdom of Judah was not yet overturned. Besides, what had
befallen the kingdom of Israel might be viewed as a mirror in which they could
behold God's wrath and righteous
chastisement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet this prediction, though it
was accompanied by clear proofs, must undoubtedly have appeared to be
incredible; for at that time they enjoyed repose, and the slightest truce of any
kind easily laid them asleep. He says, therefore, that this calamity will come
to them from distant nations, from whom nothing of this kind was expected; and
he sounds an alarm as if the enemy were already at hand. It is not for the sake
of soothing their fear that he uses those words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
afar,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the end of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but, on the contrary, he speaks in this
manner for the express purpose of informing them that they ought not to judge of
the anger of God from what meets the eye, for we are wont to judge of dangers
from the outward appearance of things. Now, if the enemies are not so near, or
if other circumstances hinder them from giving us immediate annoyance, we give
ourselves no concern. Thus the people were lulled into a profound sleep, as if
there were no danger to be dreaded. But Isaiah says that this will not hinder
the Lord from <i>erecting a</i> <i>banner</i>, and instantly commissioning the
Assyrians to slaughter them. The expression is metaphorical; for when a banner
is displayed it is customary for soldiers, at the bidding of their general, to
advance in hostile array and rush into the
battle.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will hiss to
it.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though a change of number frequently
occurs in Scripture, yet it is on solid grounds that the Prophet, by changing
the number, makes many nations to be but one nation. The meaning is, that when
it shall please God to assemble various nations, and form them into one body, it
will not be a confused multitude, but will resemble a body which has a visible
head that rules and guides. He chose to employ the word <i>hiss</i> rather than
a word of weightier import, such as <i>sound a trumpet</i>, or anything of that
sort; in order to show that God does not need to sound a trumpet in order to
call the enemies to battle, and that he has no difficulty in inflicting
punishment when the time for taking vengeance is fully at hand, for by a mere
nod he can accomplish the whole.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F82</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And lo, it will come
speedy and swift.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This confirms still more what
I have already observed, that we ought not to judge of the anger of the Lord
from the present appearance of things; for although everything appears to give
assurances of peace, yet suddenly war will break out from a quarter from which
we do not expect it. Even though we think that we are defended on all sides by
friends, yet God will stir up enemies from the farthest corners of the earth,
who will break through every obstruction, and overtake us with ease, as if the
way were plain and smooth. This ought to be carefully observed, that we may not
suffer ourselves to be blinded by vain presumption and foolish
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought also to observe that wars
are not kindled accidentally, or by an arrangement of men, but by the command of
God, as if he assembled the soldiers by the sound of a trumpet. Whether,
therefore, we are afflicted by battle, or by famine, or by pestilence, let us
know that all this comes from the hand of God, for all things obey him and
follow his direction. And yet it was not the intention of the Chaldeans to obey
God, for they were hurried on by their eagerness to obtain wealth and power,
while he has quite another object in view: but God employs their agency for
executing his judgments. Hence arises a remarkable and illustrious display of
the power of God, which is not limited by the will of men, or dependent on their
decisions, but leads them, though contrary to their wish, or without their
knowledge, to obey him. And yet it is no excuse for the ungodly that they are
drawn contrary to the disposition of their mind, and do not willingly serve God,
for they aim at nothing else than fraud, cruelty, and violence; and by their
cruelty God punishes the transgressions and crimes of his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>None shall be weary, nor stumble
among them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning is, that everything
will be prepared and arranged in such a manner that there shall be no delay or
obstruction to their march; as if a prince, having recruited the ranks of his
soldiers, immediately gave orders that the roads should be cleared, provisions
obtained, and everything necessary provided. He therefore shows that they will
be fleet and swift, and that there will be nothing to hinder their rapid
march.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>None shall slumber nor
sleep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresses their vast activity by
saying that they will not be drowsy. In these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall not slumber nor

rather to have said, <i>They shall not sleep nor slumber</i>; for it is a
smaller matter to <i>slumber</i> than to <i>sleep</i>. But that phrase ought to
be explained in this manner: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall not slumber nor even sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they
will be so far from <i>sleeping</i>, that they will not even <i>slumber</i>. You

Assyrians and other eastern nations, who frequently made use of bows and arrows
in battle, as Englishmen of the present day enter into the battlefield with a
loaded quiver.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Under this class he includes every kind
of weapons of war. But as the way was long, and the journey difficult, the Jew
might think that many things would occur to interrupt the march of the enemy. He
therefore says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hoofs of
the horses will be like flint</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which he
means that they will suffer no molestation, and will at length arrive in Judea
without weariness. For a similar reason he compares
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their wheels to a
whirlwind</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The ancients were wont to employ
chariots in going to war, and therefore he mentions not only <i>horses</i>, but
<i>wheels</i>. All these circumstances must be understood to relate to the haste
and rapidity with which they would proceed; or, in other words, that no length
of journey would prevent the Lord from carrying forward the enemies without
delay for the destruction of the
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His roaring shall be like that of
a lion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This denotes fierceness and cruelty,
for he compares the Chaldeans to <i>lions</i>, which, we know, are frightful to

were moved by any feeling of compassion or tenderness, but rather that they
would be savage beasts. He adds, that they will likewise possess great strength,
so that none will venture to approach for rescuing their prey. He means that the
Jews will have no defense for warding off their attacks, because the dread of
their cruelty will keep all at a distance from them. It was God who employed
their agency in punishing the Jews, and therefore it was necessary that they
should be armed with formidable power, that this wayward people might at length

</font><font face="Palatino">he means an attack so violent that it will look
like a deluge, by which the whole of Judea will suffer shipwreck. He likewise
cuts off all hope by foretelling that the punishment will have no alleviation
and no end. "The Jews," he says, "will do what is usually done in a season of
perplexity, will cast their eyes up and down to discover the means of escape;
but in whatever direction they look, whether to heaven or to earth, they will
find no relief whatever; for on all sides distresses and calamities will
overwhelm them." This mode of expression has come to be frequently employed even
by the common people, when misery and ruin appear on all sides, and no escape or
relief can be found. This must unavoidably happen when the Lord pursues us, so
that his uplifted arm meets our eyes on every side, and, wherever we turn, we
behold his creatures armed against us to execute his judgments; for we may
sometimes escape the hand of men, but how can we escape the hand of
God?</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the year that king Uzziah
died.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is usually the beginning of the
sixth chapter; but some think that it is the beginning of the book itself, and
that in collecting the prophecies of Isaiah an error was committed. The reason
which they assign is, that the Prophet here declines the office of a teacher,
which he would not have refused if he had hitherto discharged it; that he
appears to be a mere novice as yet unacquainted with his calling; and besides,
that he declares that he has now seen the Lord, and that he has not seen him,
before. But such arguments I consider, as I have already noticed, to be too
feeble and unsatisfactory; and I reply that it ought not to be thought strange
that he was so completely overpowered by this extraordinary vision as to forget
that he was a prophet. For there was no feeling in him which was not overpowered
by the presence of God, so that, like one who had lost his senses, he willingly
plunged himself in darkness, or rather, like one who despaired of life, he of
his own accord chose to die. And it is necessary that the godly should be
affected in this manner, when the Lord gives them tokens of his presence, that
they may be brought low and utterly confounded. Besides, in the person of his
servant God intended to strike his rebellious people with alarm; and therefore
we need not wonder if he offers an apology for himself under the overwhelming
influence of fear, and likewise because he had not felt the weight of his
office, as he now felt it, after having beheld an illustrious display of the
majesty of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But why was not this vision
exhibited to him at the beginning? I answer, it was necessary in regard to the
time, that he might be more and more confirmed in the discharge of his office.
We have an instance of this in the Apostles themselves; for at first they were
sent out with an injunction not to pass beyond the limits of Judea,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:5;) but after that Christ had risen, he again set them <i>apart</i> in a new
and solemn manner, <i>breathed on them, bidding them receive the Holy Ghost</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;432021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
20:21,22;) and not only so, but sending his Spirit from heaven <i>in the forms
of tongues of fire</i>, invested them with extraordinary power.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:3.) Thus, on account of the various changes of times and of kings, it was
necessary that Isaiah should be encouraged and again attested by a new vision;
that he might be excited to perseverance, and might afterwards proceed with
greater cheerfulness in his course; and also that the Jews might perceive his
ministry to be supported by heavenly
authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This appears to me to be a sufficient
reason why this vision was not exhibited to him at the very beginning, but after
that he had for some time discharged the office of a teacher. That this was not
the beginning of the prophecy is evident enough from the consideration that the
preface, which we have already examined, is much better adapted for the
commencement, and more appropriate than what is contained in this chapter; and
every approach having been shut up by the hard-hearted obstinacy of the people,
it was proper that he should burst forth in this vehement manner. Besides, it is
probable that he had long performed the office of a teacher under King Uzziah,
who, I think, was dead before this prediction was published. In short, the
Prophet means that it was not till he had commenced his course that God appeared
to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some think that <i>death</i> here means
<i>leprosy</i>, which undoubtedly was a civil death, when the king was compelled
to withdraw from the society of men, and to lay down the reins of government,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:5;) but I choose rather to take <i>death</i> in its literal sense. So
then, I think that Isaiah uttered the former predictions during the reign of
Uzziah, even after he had been struck with leprosy; and that when he had died,
and Jotham had succeeded him, this vision was presented to Isaiah. We know what
various commotions are produced by a change of kings, so that we need not wonder
that Isaiah had his calling again sealed. But the prophecy itself, which
follows, will sufficiently show that he had been a public teacher for some time
before he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw
the</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">Lord</font><font face="Palatino">;
for it relates that the blinding of the people, whose obstinacy he had
experienced to such an extent that he might have been induced to cease from his
undertaking, for he saw that he was doing no good. The Lord, therefore, confirms
him by this vision, that the opposition may not prevent him from boldly
discharging his office, and performing what he undertook at the commandment of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I saw the
</i>Lord<i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is asked, How could Isaiah see
God who <i>is a</i> <i>Spirit</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24,) and, therefore, cannot be seen with bodily eyes? Nay, more, since the
understandings of men cannot rise to his boundless height, how can he be seen in
a visible shape? But we ought to be aware that, when God exhibited himself to
the view of the Fathers, he never appeared such as he actually is, but such as
the capacity of men could receive. Though men may be said to creep on the
ground, or at least dwell far below the heavens, there is no absurdity in
supposing that God comes down to them in such a manner as to cause some kind of
mirror to reflect the rays of his glory. There was, therefore, exhibited to
Isaiah such a form as enabled him, according to his capacity, to perceive the
inconceivable majesty of God; and thus he attributes to God a <i>throne</i>, a
<i>robe</i>, and a bodily appearance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we
learn a profitable doctrine, that whenever God grants any token of his presence,
he is undoubtedly present with us, for he does not amuse us by unmeaning shapes,
as men wickedly disfigure him by their contrivances. since, therefore, that
exhibition was no deceitful representation of the presence of God, Isaiah justly
declares that he <i>saw him</i>. In like manner, when it is said that
John</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">saw the Holy Spirit in
the shape of a dove,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
1:32)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">the name of the Holy Spirit is applied to the outward
sign, because in the representation there was no deception; and yet he did not
see the essence of the Spirit, but had a clear and undoubted proof, so that he
could not doubt that the Spirit of God rested on
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Secondly, it is asked, Who was that
Lord? John tells us that it was Christ,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431241&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
12:41,) and justly, for God never revealed himself to the Fathers but in his
eternal Word and only begotten Son. Yet it is wrong, I think, to limit this, as
some do, to the person of Christ; for it is indefinitely, on the contrary, that
the Prophet calls him God. Nor do their views derive any support from the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynwda</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>adonai</i>,) which seems particularly to apply to Christ; for it is often
applied to God in an absolute and unrestricted manner. In this passage,
therefore, God is mentioned indefinitely, and yet it is correctly said that
Isaiah saw the glory of Christ, for at that very time he was <i>the image of</i>
<i>the invisible God</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sitting upon a
throne.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He could not have given a better
description of God, in regard to place, than in the person of a Judge, that his
majesty might strike greater terror into the Jews; for we shall afterwards see
the dreadful judgment which the Lord pronounced from his judgment-seat. But lest
we should suppose that the Prophet contrived the manner in which he would paint
God, we ought to know that he faithfully describes the very form in which God
was represented and exhibited to him. It may be questioned whether the Prophet
was conducted into the temple, or saw this vision while he was asleep. Though
many things are frequently adduced on both sides, which are fitted to leave the
matter in doubt, yet it may be conjectured with some probability, that even if
he had not been within the temple, this vision might have been presented to him,
either in his own house or on a field, in the same manner as to other
prophets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his remotest
parts filled the temple.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Almost all the commentators understand by
this the fringes of his robe, though it may be understood to refer to the
extremities of the judgment-seat, giving us to understand that its dimensions
were so vast as to extend to every part of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
temple</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He intends to ascribe to God a
venerable aspect, and far beyond any human form. There is great weight in the
circumstance that he appeared in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
temple</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he had promised that he would meet
with his people there, and the people expected his answers from that place, as
Solomon had expressly stated at the dedication of it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 8:30.) In order, therefore, that the people might understand that those
things came from God, on whom they called every day, and on whom they relied
with a vain confidence which puffed them up, this vision was exhibited to the
Prophet <i>in the temple</i>. To the certainty of what was said it contributed
not a little, that he openly proclaimed that the discourse was not pronounced to
him by any mortal man, but was a heavenly oracle, uttered by that God whose name
they were accustomed disdainfully to hold out as a pretense, whenever they
wished to make any extravagant claims; for otherwise this prophecy would have
been harsh and repulsive, and needed great confirmation. It was also not
uncommon with the Prophets to say that the Lord spake to them <i>from his
temple</i>, or <i>from his</i>
<i>sanctuary</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the seraphim stood upon
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having declared that God appeared to him
full of majesty and of glory, he adds, that God was attended by angels, whom the
Prophet calls <i>seraphim</i> on account of their fervor. Though the etymology
of this word is well known, yet various reasons are adduced. Some think that
they are called <i>seraphim</i> because they burn with the love of God; others,
because they are swift like fire; others, because they are bright. However that
may be, this description holds out to us, as in sunbeams, the brightness of
God's infinite majesty, that we may learn by it to behold and adore his
wonderful and overwhelming glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Many think
that there were two <i>seraphim</i>, as there were two cherubim that encompassed
the ark of the testimony. This opinion I willingly adopt, though I do not
venture to make any assertion where Scripture is silent. As it is customary with
the sacred writers to accommodate their descriptions of God to those outward
signs which were commonly used and familiarly known among the godly, it is
possible that the Prophet saw a representation of this kind. While I hold this
to be a probable conjecture, I leave room for other interpretations which some
may be disposed to prefer; for Daniel saw not two angels only, but thousands of
thousands of angels.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
7:10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Each one had six
wings.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This representation is instructive; for
those wings thus arranged contained some mystery which it was the will of the
Lord should not remain wholly unknown. The <i>two wings</i> with which the
angels <i>fly</i> mean nothing else than their ready and cheerful performance of
the commandments of God. On this point the resemblance is so clear and manifest,
that it will be at once admitted by all who do not take delight in controversy.
The </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two
wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"> with which they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cover their
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"> show plainly enough that even angels
cannot endure God's brightness, and that they are dazzled by it in the same
manner as when we attempt to gaze upon the radiance of the sun. And if angels
are overwhelmed by the majesty of God, how great will be the rashness of men if
they venture to intrude so far! Let us, therefore, learn that our inquiries
concerning God ought never to go beyond what is proper and lawful, that our
knowledge may soberly and modestly taste what is far above our capacity. And yet
the angels do not cover their face in such a manner as not to be favored with
beholding God in some degree; for their flight is not at random. In like manner
we too ought to look at God, but only so far as our capacity shall enable
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the remaining
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two
wings,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which were placed lower, the difficulty
is somewhat greater. Some think that the angels
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covered their
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they might not touch the earth, and
contract any defilement from it, as human beings like ourselves are wont to do;
for in walking we gather filth and dust, and accordingly, so long as we dwell on
earth, we are always tainted by some kind of contagion. This reminds believers
that they will have no intercourse with angels till they raise themselves high,
and are no longer fastened to the earth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such is
the interpretation given by some expositors. But I rather agree with those who
think that the use of those <i>wings</i> was opposite to that of the upper
<i>wings</i>; for, as by the upper wings they <i>cover their</i> <i>face</i>,
that they may not be overpowered by God's brightness, so they have also lower
wings to conceal them from our view. Now, if it be true that we cannot behold
the small and feeble rays of the Divine brightness without being altogether
overpowered, how could we gaze upon that unspeakably bright and glorious majesty
which lays prostrate all our faculties? Let men learn, therefore, that they are
far distant from a perfect knowledge of God, since they cannot even reach to the
angels. The latter appears to me to be the more correct exposition, but I do not
disapprove of the former.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they cried one to
another.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It was necessary that all these things
should be presented to the Prophet in vision, in order to produce a stronger
impression on the people, and on Isaiah himself; for the vision was not less
necessary to him than to the whole nation, because sharp and painful struggles
awaited him, and he could not have boldly announced those events if he had not
been previously confirmed. The people also, being warned by this vision how
great and how dreadful was the majesty of God, by whom this condemnation was
pronounced, had good reason for being alarmed. He who now came forth to public
view is God, at the sight of whom the very angels tremble, whose praises they
continually and loudly utter, and whom, in a word, they serve and obey; but men,
whom he had been pleased to adopt as his children, obstinately and rebelliously
opposed him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, when we are informed that the
angels are employed in uttering the glory of God, let us know that their example
is set before us for imitation; for the most holy service that we can render to
him is, to be employed in praising his name. When he associates us with angels,
it is in order that, while we sojourn on earth, we may resemble and be joined to
the inhabitants of heaven. That the harmony between us and the angels may be in
every respect complete, we must take care not only that the praises of God may
be sounded by our tongues, but likewise that all the actions of our life may
correspond to our professions; and this will only be done if the chief aim of
our actions be the glory of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holy, holy, holy, is
Jehovah of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The ancients quoted this
passage when they wished to prove that there are three persons in one essence of
the Godhead. I do not disagree with their opinion; but if I had to contend with
heretics, I would rather choose to employ stronger proofs; for they become more
obstinate, and assume an air of triumph, when inconclusive arguments are brought
against them; and they might easily and readily maintain that, in this passage,
as in other parts of Scripture, the number "three" denotes perfection. Although,
therefore, I have no doubt that the angels here describe One God in Three
Persons, (and, indeed, it is impossible to praise God without also uttering the
praises of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit,) yet I think that it would
be better to employ more conclusive passages, lest, in proving an article of our
faith, we should expose ourselves to the scorn of heretics. And, indeed, this
repetition rather points out unwearied perseverance, as if the Prophet had said,
that the angels never cease from their melody in singing the praises of God, as
the holiness of God supplies us with inexhaustible reasons for
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The whole earth is full
of his glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Literally it is, <i>the</i>
<i>fullness of the whole earth</i>, which might be understood to refer to the
fruits, and animals, and manifold riches with which God has enriched the earth,
and might convey this meaning, that in the ornaments and great variety of
furniture of the world the glory of God shines, because they are so many proofs
of a father's love. But the more simple and natural interpretation is, that
<i>the glory of God fills the whole world</i>, or is spread through every region
of the earth. There is also, I think, an implied contrast, by which he puts down
the foolish boasting of the Jews, who thought that the glory of God was nowhere
to be seen but among themselves, and wished to have it shut up within their own
temple. But Isaiah shows that it is so far from being confined to so narrow
limits, that it fills <i>the whole earth</i>. And to this agrees the prophecy
which immediately follows, (verse 10,) about the blinding of the Jews, which
opened up for the Gentiles admission into the Church of God; for they occupied
that place which the Jews had forsaken and left
empty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the lintels of the posts were
moved. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This noise was an indication that it was
not a human voice which the Prophet had heard; for no mortal man has a voice so
powerful as to be capable of making the <i>lintels</i> and <i>posts</i> shake.
Now, the Lord intended not only to establish the authority of his voice over the
Prophet, but to confirm it to posterity in all ages, that it might never be
forgotten. Let us, therefore, know that this noise confirms at this day the
voice of God, that we may tremble whenever he speaks; for if inanimate and dumb
creatures are moved, what ought we to do, who feel, smell, taste, and
understand, for no other purpose than that we may obey his word in a holy and
reverent manner?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the house
was filled with smoke.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was the common and
ordinary sign which the Lord employed with his ancient people; for we read that,
whenever Moses entered into the tabernacle, <i>smoke</i> was wont to be diffused
through it in such a manner that the people could not see either Moses or the
tabernacle.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
33:9.) The <i>smoke</i>, therefore, which Isaiah describes was not an unusual
occurrence; but in the ordinary way God intended to demonstrate that he would
display his power in executing judgment on the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, Why did God
manifest his presence by this sign rather than by any other? This question may
be answered in two ways. First, it was always the will of God to repress the
insolence of men, in pushing their inquiries about his majesty beyond what is
proper; for on this point almost all men are too rash and daring. They wish to
rise above the clouds, and to penetrate into the secrets of God, while they do
not see what lies at their feet. Hence arises a labyrinth of errors, and when
the minds of men have been entangled in it, they adopt false and pretended modes
of worship; for when men allow themselves to adopt any false notions about God,
there is nothing which they will not venture to attempt against him. It was not
without good reason, therefore, that he made use of <i>smoke</i>, in order to
remind men of their weakness; and yet he did not intend that they should be
blind or stupid, that is, that they should have the stupidity and error which
the papists disguise under the name of simplicity; but he forbids us to inquire
or search beyond what he has revealed to us in his word; for, as Augustine says,
"that is a learned ignorance." Whenever, therefore, <i>smoke</i> of this kind is
mentioned, let us know that it lays a restraint upon us from indulging curiosity
in our researches into the purpose of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Secondly, this <i>smoke</i> ought to strike
terror, as David, when describing an angry and terrible God, says that <i>clouds
and darkness</i> <i>are round about him</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
97:2.) This also agrees well with the present passage; for he pronounces a
dreadful judgment, namely, the blinding of the Jews. Others think that it
indicated the burning by which he consumed the temple; but the view which I have
given is more probable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo to me! for I am
undone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now relates how powerfully
he was affected by that vision; namely that he was so terrified by seeing God;
that he expected immediate destruction. He assigns the reason for believing that
it is all over with him;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
says he, <i>I</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> am a man of
unclean lips</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I
wonder why Jerome renders it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because I was
silent</i></font><font face="Palatino">; seeing that there is no ambiguity in
the expression.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmd</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>damah</i>) does indeed signify <i>to be silent</i>, but here the undoubted
mark of a passive verb is added. This passage may likewise be rendered, <i>Wo to
me! for I</i> <i>have been reduced to silence</i>. In the Scriptures
<i>silence</i> is often taken for death and those who have been buried are said
to have been <i>reduced to silence</i>. But as the meaning is the same, I will
not dispute much about the translation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
Prophet therefore means, that he was so terrified as to resemble a dead man. And
certainly we need not wonder at this; for the whole man, so far as relates to
the flesh, must be reduced to nothing, that it may be renewed according to God.
Whence comes it that men live, that is, imagine that they live, and are swelled
with vain confidence in their wisdom or strength, but because they know not God?
Accordingly, until God reveal himself to us, we do not think that we are men, or
rather, we think that we are gods; but when we have seen God, we then begin to
feel and know what we are. Hence springs true humility, which consists in this,
that a man makes no claims for himself, and depends wholly on God; and therefore
on this point the present and similar passages ought to be carefully
studied.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was customary with the godly
fathers, whenever they saw God, to break out into these words:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I am gone; I am utterly
undone.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;071302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Judges
13:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our life, therefore, until our minds earnestly draw
near to God, is a vain delusion; we walk in darkness, and can with difficulty
distinguish truth from falsehood; but when we come into the light it is easy to
perceive the difference. So when God draws near to us, he brings light with him,
that we may perceive our worthlessness, which we could not formerly see, while
we entertained a false opinion of
ourselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And yet mine eyes
have seen the king, Jehovah of
hosts.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But does the sight of God bring death to
men? For it appears strange that the sight of God or approach to him should take
away life, of which he is the source and giver. I reply that this is an
accidental result; for it takes place through our fault, and not on account of
the nature of God. Death is within us; but we do not perceive it, unless when it
is compared with the life of God. This is unquestionably what the Prophet means;
for he does not merely say that he is dead, but assigns the reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he has unclean
lips.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">But why does he confine the pollution
to the <i>lips</i>? Was he pure in understanding, or in the other parts of the
body? I answer: the Prophet mentions that which he regarded as the most
valuable, his tongue, which was consecrated to God; for God had appointed him to
be a Prophet. Even though he was in other respects a sinner, yet because the
office which he held was holy, this part of his body was sacred; and as it does
not correspond to the divine holiness, he confesses that, even in that part
which in itself is more holy, he is <i>polluted</i>. Such appears to me to be
the true and natural meaning of this passage, in the explanation of which
commentators have hitherto been
unsuccessful.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I dwell in
the midst of a people of unclean lips.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is
added by way of explanation; for he includes himself as an individual in the
number of the common people, tainted with that pollution which extends to the
whole body, and forgets the purity which he had received from God, because it
cannot dwell in his presence. Hence it is evident that they are mistaken who
imagine that the Prophet spoke under erroneous views; as the common people are
wont to contrive a variety of false notions concerning God. For, as I have said,
the presence of God and approach to him is the destruction of our flesh; because
it shows that we are nothing in ourselves. When he who is conscious of his
wretchedness sees God, what can he expect but destruction? For God is our judge,
to whom, we know, nothing is concealed or unknown, in whose sight our purity is
impure. And if this happened to the Prophet, what ought we to think of
ourselves? For what are we in comparison of him? Even if the LORD hath begun to
cleanse us, yet we ought to acknowledge our pollution, the remains of which
always continue in our flesh. Hence also we ought to draw a universal doctrine,
that the <i>lips</i> of all men are impure and <i>polluted</i>, till the Lord
has cleansed them; from which it also follows, that human doctrines have an
uncleanness which betrays them, and that there is nothing pure but what has come
from God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then flew one of the seraphim to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet shows what kind of relief was
brought to him, when he was so terrified as to think that he was a dead man; and
this confirms what we have already said, that purity of <i>lips</i> comes from
God alone; for men can produce nothing of themselves but what is filthy and
abominable. If it be objected that it is absurd to say that the Lord now
cleansed him, as if his tongue had formerly been impure and profane, though it
had been the instrument employed by the Holy Spirit, I have already replied
sufficiently to that objection. The Lord had already cleansed him, but according
to his degree. The cleansing which is now added is greater; for it has its
enlargements and additions, which no man can obtain all at
once.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must not conclude, therefore, that
Isaiah's lips were impure, because they are now cleansed; but we ought to
inquire why it is done. It was because the Lord intended to enlarge and extend
his favor towards him, and to raise him to higher dignity, that he might have
greater influence over the people; and this was rendered necessary by the
character of the times, and the change which had taken place in the
state.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The fire was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken from the
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to intimate that it was divine or
heavenly; for the law forbade any <i>strange fire</i> to be brought to it,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;031001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
10:1,) because in sacred things every human mixture is absolute profanation. By
this figure, therefore, Isaiah was taught that all purity flows from God
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And applying it to my
mouth.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see how God condescends to meet the
weakness of human sense. He puts <i>the tongs</i> into the hand of a seraph,
that by means of it he may take </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
coal from the altar</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and apply it to the
Prophet's mouth. This was, no doubt, done in vision; but by the aid of the
outward sign God assisted the Prophet's understanding. There is no reason to
believe that the <i>coal</i> possessed any virtue, as superstitious persons
imagine that in the magical arts there is some hidden power. Nothing of this
sort is to be found here; for it is God alone who can cleanse our pollution, in
whatever part it exists.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here the angel
administered the cleansing, but was not the author of it; so that we must not
ascribe to another what belongs to God alone. This is expressly stated by the
angel himself, who claims nothing as his own, but bringing forward the sacred
pledge which he had received from God, laid it as a sacrament on the <i>lips</i>
of the Prophet; not that he could not be cleansed without the <i>coal</i>, but
because the visible sign was useful for the confirmation and proof of the fact.
And such is the use of sacraments, to strengthen us in proportion to our
ignorance; for we are not angels, that can behold the mysteries of God without
any assistance, and therefore he raises us to himself by gradual
advances.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, this hath
touched thy lips.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shows that the
confirmation which was obtained by the sign was not without effect, but that the
blessing signified by it was at the same time bestowed, so that Isaiah knew that
he had not been deceived. Hence we may infer, that in the sacraments the reality
is given to us along with the sign; for when the Lord holds out a sacrament, he
does not feed our eyes with an empty and unmeaning figure, but joins the truth
with it, so as to testify that by means of them he acts upon us efficaciously.
And this ought to be the more carefully observed, because there are few persons
in the present day who understand the true use of sacraments, and because many
godly and learned men are engaged in frequent disputes respecting
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First of all, we ought to believe that the
truth must never be separated from the signs, though it ought to be
distinguished from them. We perceive and feel a sign, such as the bread which is
put into our hands by the minister in the Lord's Supper; and because we ought to
seek Christ in heaven, our thoughts ought to be carried thither. By the hand of
the minister he presents to us his body, that it may be actually enjoyed by the
godly, who rise by faith to fellowship with him. He bestows it, therefore, on
the godly, who raise their thoughts to him by faith; for he cannot
deceive.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Unbelievers indeed receive the sign;
but because they linger in the world, and do not arrive at Christ's heavenly
kingdom, they have no experience of the truth; for he who has not faith cannot
raise his thoughts to God, and therefore cannot partake of Christ. Faith alone
opens for us the gate of the kingdom of God; and therefore, whoever wishes to
eat the flesh of Christ must be carried by faith to heaven beyond human
conception. In short, it is the Spirit of God alone who can make us partakers of
that fellowship. And yet it does not follow that the unbelief of men takes
anything away from the truth of the sacrament, since God always presents to us a
spiritual matter, but wicked men treat it with scorn; just as the grace of God
is offered by the gospel, but all do not receive it, though they actually hear
it, and are compelled to yield assent to the
truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, we learn from this passage that
the sacraments are never separated from the word. The angel does not here act
the part of a dumb man, but, after having given the sign, immediately adds the
doctrine, in order to show what was intended by it; for it would have been no
sacrament, if doctrine had not been added, from which Isaiah could learn for
what purpose the <i>coal</i> was applied to his mouth. Let us therefore learn
that the chief part of the sacraments consists in the word, and that without it
they are absolute corruptions, such as we see every day in popery, in which the
sacraments are turned into stage-plays. The amount of the whole is, that there
is nothing to prevent Isaiah, who has been perfectly cleansed, and is free from
all pollution, from appearing as God's
representative.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afterwards I heard the voice of
the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now begins to discourse
about the design of this vision, why God appeared to him with such glorious
majesty, in order to ordain him anew as a prophet. It was because he was called
to deliver an incredible message about blinding the Jews. On this revolting
occasion, therefore, he is more fully assured of his calling, that he may lay
aside fear and obey the command of God; for nothing gives greater confidence to
pious minds than to know that they obey God. He had also another proof, namely,
that the Lord had cleansed him; and this was sufficient to lead him to undertake
any task, however
difficult.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom shall I
send?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet represents the Lord as
speaking, as if he could not find a man qualified for such a message. Some think
that this is intended to reprove the ignorance of the priests and prophets;
because, though they are very numerous, still not one of them was qualified to
teach. This reason carries some probability, but I would rather view it as
referring to the certainty of Isaiah's calling, as implying that it was not at
random, but from choice, that the Lord appointed him. There is here, therefore,
a weighty deliberation whom the Lord will be pleased to send; not that he
hesitates, but such modes of expression are used on our account, just as these
words, <i>I will go</i> <i>down and see</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
18:21.) For God, to whom all things are known, has no need to make any inquiry;
but, lest men should think that he acts with precipitation, he thus accommodates
himself to the ordinary modes of speaking among men. In like manner, when he
asks <i>whom he</i> <i>shall send</i>, the meaning is, that he needs not an
ordinary person, but a teacher of uncommon excellence on a subject of the
greatest importance. Hence we infer that the authority of Isaiah was confirmed,
so that he was reckoned to be not only a prophet, but eminent among the
prophets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will go for
us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I am rather favorable to the opinion that
this passage points to Three Persons in the Godhead, just as we elsewhere
read,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Let us create man in our
likeness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
1:26.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For God talks with himself, and in the plural number;
and unquestionably he now holds a consultation with his eternal Wisdom and his
eternal Power, that is, with the Son and the Holy
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Here am
I.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So ready a reply shows how great is that
cheerfulness which springs from faith; for he who but lately lay like a dead man
dreads no difficulty. Hence we see that the amazement of which we have formerly
spoken did not spring from rebellion, in wishing to flee from God, or to refuse
the charge which had been laid upon him; but because he needed new grace, that
he might know that he would be able to endure the burden. On this account it
ought to be observed, that we cannot undertake anything in a proper manner
without the evidence of our calling; otherwise we shall pause and hesitate at
every step.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, it is a powerful aid to our
confidence, when we know that we are not destitute of the necessary gifts, but
that God has bestowed them on us, in order that we may be better enabled to
discharge our office. Now, this remarkable instance of obedience ought to
produce such an effect on our minds that we shall readily and cheerfully
undertake any task which he may be pleased to enjoin, and shall never refuse any
task, however difficult we may imagine it to be. When the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Here am
I,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the meaning is, that he is ready to obey the
commands of God; for this mode of expression is frequently employed in Scripture
to denote obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then he said, Go, and tell that
people.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This shows still more clearly how
necessary the vision was, that Isaiah might not all at once fail in his course.
It was a grievous stumblingblock, that he must endure such obstinacy and
rebellion in the people of God, and that not only for a year or two, but for
more than sixty years. On this account he needed to be fortified, that he might
be like a brazen wall against such stubbornness. The Lord, therefore, merely
forewarns Isaiah that he will have to do with obstinate men, on whom he will
produce little effect; but that so unusual an occurrence must not lead him to
take offense, and lose courage, or yield to the rebellion of men; that, on the
contrary, he must proceed with unshaken firmness, and rise superior to
temptations of this nature. For God gives him due warning beforehand as to the
result; as if he had said, "You will indeed teach without any good effect; but
do not regret your teaching, for I enjoin it upon you; and do not refrain from
teaching, because it yields no advantage; only obey me, and leave to my disposal
all the consequences of your labors. I give you all this information in good
time, that the event may not terrify you, as if it had been strange and
unexpected." Besides, he is commanded openly to reprove their blind obstinacy,
as if he purposely taunted
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"My labors will do no good;
but it matters not to me: it is enough that what I do obtains the approbation of
God, to whom my preaching will be a sweet smell, though it bring death to
you."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 2:15,16.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Harden the heart of this
people.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here the former statement is more fully
expressed; for God informs Isaiah beforehand, not only that his labor in
teaching will be fruitless, but that by his instruction he will also blind the
people, so as to be the occasion of producing greater insensibility and
stubbornness, and to end in their destruction. He declares that the people,
bereft of reason and understanding, will perish, and there will be no means of
obtaining relief; and yet he at the same time affirms that the labors of the
Prophet, though they bring death and ruin on the Jews, will be to him an
acceptable sacrifice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is a truly remarkable
declaration; not only because Isaiah here foretold what was afterwards fulfilled
under the reign of Christ, but also because it contains a most useful doctrine,
which will be of perpetual use in the Church of God; for all who shall labor
faithfully in the ministry of the word will be laid under the necessity of
meeting with the same result. We too have experienced it more than we could have
wished; but it has been shared by all the servants of Christ, and therefore we
ought to endure it with greater patience, though it is a very grievous
stumbling-block to those who serve God with a pure conscience. Not only does it
give great offense, but Satan powerfully excites his followers to raise a
dislike of instruction on the pretense of its being not merely useless, but even
injurious; that it renders men more obstinate, and leads to their destruction.
At the present day, those who have no other reproach to bring against the
doctrine of the gospel maintain that the only effect produced by the preaching
of it has been, that the world has become
worse.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But whatever may be the result, still God
assures us that our ministrations are acceptable to him, because we obey his
command; and although our labor appear to be fruitless, and men rush forward to
their destruction, and become more rebellious, we must go forward; for we do
nothing at our own suggestion, and ought to be satisfied with having the
approbation of God. We ought, indeed, to be deeply grieved when success does not
attend our exertions; and we ought to pray to God to give efficacy to his word.
A part of the blame we ought even to lay on ourselves, when the fruits are so
scanty; and yet we must not abandon our office, or throw away our weapons. The
truth must always be heard from our lips, even though there be no ears to
receive it, and though the world have neither sight nor feeling; for it is
enough for us that we labor faithfully for the glory of God, and that our
services are acceptable to him; and the sound of our voice is not ineffectual,
when it renders the world without excuse.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence
arises a most excellent and altogether invaluable consolation to godly teachers,
for supporting their minds against those grievous offenses which daily spring
from the obstinacy of men, that, instead of being retarded by it, they may
persevere in their duty with unshaken firmness. As it is also a general offense,
that the lively word of God, at the hearing of which the whole world ought to
tremble, strikes their ears to no purpose, and without any advantage, let weak
men learn to fortify themselves by this declaration. We wonder how it is
possible that the greater part of men can furiously oppose God; and hence also
arises a doubt if it be the heavenly truth of God which is rejected without
bringing punishment; for it can hardly be believed that God addresses men for
the purpose of exciting their scorn. That our faith may not fail, we ought to
employ this support, that the office of teaching was enjoined on Isaiah, on the
condition that, in scattering the seed of life, it should yield nothing but
death; and that this is not merely a narrative of what once happened, but a
prediction of the future kingdom of Christ, as we shall find to be stated
shortly afterwards.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought also to attend to
this circumstance, that Isaiah was not sent to men indiscriminately, but to the
Jews. Accordingly, the demonstrative particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hinneh</i>,) <i>behold</i>, is emphatic, and implies that the people whom
the Lord had peculiarly chosen for himself do not hear the word, and shut their
eyes amidst the clearest light. Let us not wonder, therefore, if we appear to be
like persons talking to the deaf, when we address those who boast of the name of
God. It is undoubtedly a harsh saying, that God sends a prophet to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>close the ears, stop up the eyes,
and harden the heart of the people</i></font><font face="Palatino">; because it
appears as if these things were inconsistent with the nature of God, and
therefore contradicted his word. But we ought not to think it strange if God
punishes the wickedness of men by blinding them in the highest degree. Yet the
Prophet shows, a little before, that the blame of this blindness lies with the
people; for when he bids them hear, he bears witness that the doctrine is fitted
for instructing the people, if they choose to submit to it; that light is given
to guide them, if they will but open their eyes. The whole blame of the evil is
laid on the people for rejecting the amazing kindness of God; and hence is
obtained a more complete solution of that difficulty to which we formerly
adverted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At first sight it seems unreasonable
that the Prophets should be represented as making men's hearts more hardened.
They carry in their mouth the word of God, by
which,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> as by a lamp, the steps of
men ought to be guided</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for this encomium, we
know, has been pronounced on it by David. (Psalm 119:105.) It is not the duty of
the Prophets, therefore, to blind the eyes, but rather to open them. Again, it
is called <i>perfect wisdom</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
19:9;) how then does it stupify men and take away their reason? Those hearts
which formerly were of brass or iron ought to be softened by it; how then is it
possible that it can harden them, as I have already observed? Such blinding and
hardening influence does not arise out of the nature of the word, but is
accidental, and must be ascribed exclusively to the depravity of man. As
dim-sighted people cannot blame the sun for dazzling their eyes with its
brightness; and those whose hearing is weak cannot complain of a clear and loud
voice which the defect of their ears hinders them from hearing; and, lastly, a
man of weak intellect cannot find fault with the difficulty of a subject which
he is unable to understand; so ungodly men have no right to blame the word for
making them worse after having heard it. The whole blame lies on themselves in
altogether refusing it admission; and we need not wonder if that which ought to
have led them to salvation become the cause of their destruction. It is right
that the treachery and unbelief of men should be punished by meeting death where
they might have received life, darkness where they might have had light; and, in
short, evils as numerous as the blessings of salvation which they might have
obtained. This ought to be carefully observed; for nothing is more customary
with men than to abuse the gifts of God, and then not only to maintain that they
are innocent, but even to be proud of appearing in borrowed feathers. But they
are doubly wicked when they not only do not apply to their proper use, but
wickedly corrupt and profane, those gifts which God had bestowed on
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">John quotes this passage as a clear
demonstration of the stubbornness of the Jews. He does not indeed absolutely
give the very words, but he states the meaning clearly enough.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Therefore, says he, they
could not believe, because Isaiah said, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened
their
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431239&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John

<div><font face="Palatino">True, this prediction was not the cause of their
unbelief, but the Lord foretold it, because he foresaw that they would be such
as they are here described. The Evangelist applies to the Gospel what had
already taken place under the law, and at the same time shows that the Jews were
deprived of reason and understanding, because they were rebels against God. Yet
if you inquire into the first cause, we must come to the predestination of God.
But as that purpose is hidden from us, we must not too eagerly search into it;
for the everlasting scheme of the divine purpose is beyond our reach, but we
ought to consider the cause which lies plainly before our eyes, namely, the
rebellion by which they rendered themselves unworthy of blessings so numerous
and so great.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul, too, shows from this
passage, on more than one occasion,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442827&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
28:27;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:8,) that the whole blame of blindness rests with themselves.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have shut their ears, says
he, and closed their eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What Isaiah here
ascribes to doctrine, Paul traces to the wicked disposition of the nation, which
was the cause of their own blindness; and accordingly, I have stated that this
was an accidental and not a natural result of the doctrine. In that passage Paul
introduces the Spirit as speaking,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
28:25;) but John says that Isaiah spake thus of Christ, <i>when he had beheld
his glory</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431241&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
12:41.) From this it is evident, as we formerly said, that Christ was that God
who filled the whole earth with his majesty. Now, Christ is not separate from
his Spirit, and therefore Paul had good reason for applying this passage to the
Holy Spirit; for although God exhibited to the Prophet the lively image of
himself in Christ, still it is certain that whatever he communicated was wholly
breathed into him by the power of the Holy Spirit. Now, however ungodly men may
bark against us with their reproaches, that our doctrine ought to bear the
blame, because the world is made worse by the preaching of it, they gain nothing
at all, and take nothing away from the authority of the doctrine; for they must
at the same time condemn God himself and the whole of his doctrine. But their
calumnies will not hinder his justice from being displayed, or hinder him from
vindicating itself, and at the same time vindicating
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they shall be
converted
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F90</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Here he expressly declares that he did not send the Prophet because he intended
to save the people; but, on the contrary, because he intended to destroy them.
But the word of God brings salvation; at least some benefit must arise from the
preaching of it, that it may do good to some, though many are deprived of the
advantage by their own unbelief. I answer, the subject treated of is the whole
body, which had already been condemned and devoted to destruction; for there
were always some whom the Lord exempted from the general ruin; to them the word
brought salvation, and on them it actually produced its proper effect; but the
great body of the people were cut off and perished through obstinate unbelief
and rebellion. So, then, we perceive that the word of God is never so
destructive that there are not a few who perceive that it brings salvation to
them, and feel that it does so in
reality.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be
healed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We ought also to observe from the order
and connection of the words, that the first step of <i>healing</i> is
repentance. But in the first place, we must understand what he means by the word
<i>healing</i>; for he uses it in reference to the chastisements which had been
inflicted on the people on account of their sins. Now, the cause of all the
evils which we endure is our rebellion against God. When we repent, he is
reconciled to us, and the rods with which he chastised us are no longer
employed. This is our <i>healing</i>. And this order ought to be carefully
observed, from which it is evident what object the Lord has in view in inviting
us to himself, and what is the design of the heavenly doctrine, namely, that we
may be <i>converted</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is another part of
the Gospel, <i>Repent ye</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:2.) Then, offering reconciliation he holds out remedies for all diseases, not
only of the body but of the soul. And such being the eminent advantage derived
from the word of God, if we are not reconciled to God as soon as his word sounds
in our ears, we have no right to lay the blame on any other, for it rests wholly
with ourselves. Indeed, the Prophet here speaks of it as unnatural and
monstrous, that, by the doctrine of the word, the native tendency of which is to
<i>heal</i> and soften, men should become insolent and obstinate and altogether
incurable. It is undoubtedly true, that when we are drawn inwardly,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430644&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:44,) it is an extraordinary gift of God, and that the arm of God is not
revealed to all,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:1;) but by this dreadful punishment of obstinate malice, Isaiah intended to
teach, that we ought earnestly to beware of despising when God
calls.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I said, How long, O
LORD?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although the Prophets are severe in
denouncing the wrath of God against men, yet they do not lay aside human
feelings. It is therefore necessary that they sustain a twofold character; for
they must proclaim the judgment of God with high and unshaken courage, so that
they would rather choose that the world should be destroyed and utterly ruined
than that any part of His glory should be taken away. And yet they are not
devoid of feeling, so as to be unmoved by compassion for their brethren, whose
destruction their office lays them under the necessity of foretelling. These two
feelings, though they appear to be inconsistent, are in full harmony, as appears
from the instance of Jeremiah, who at first complains of the hard task assigned
him of proclaiming destruction to the people, but afterwards revives his
courage, and proceeds boldly in discharging the duties of his office
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:6, 17.) Such was also the state of Isaiah's mind; for, being desirous to obey
God, he earnestly proclaimed His judgments; and yet he had some regard to the
people, which led him to entreat, that if this <i>blindness</i> must come upon
them, it might not be permanent. There can be no doubt, that when he thus prayed
to God, he was moved with compassion, and desired that so dreadful a punishment
should be mitigated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Natural affections,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">storgai&lt;
fusikai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,) therefore, ought not to prevent us
from performing what is our duty. For instance, there is the natural affection
of a husband to a wife, and of a father to a son; but it ought to be checked and
restrained, so that we may chiefly consider what is suitable to our calling, and
what the Lord commands. This ought to be carefully observed; for when we wish to
give loose reins to ourselves, we commonly plead this excuse, that we are
willing and ready to do what God requires, but are overpowered by natural
affection. But those feelings ought to be restrained in such a manner as not to
obstruct our calling; just as they did not hinder the Prophet from proceeding in
the discharge of his duty; for to such an extent ought we to acknowledge the
authority of the Lord over us, that when he orders and commands, we should
forget ourselves and all that belongs to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
although the godly anxiety of Isaiah about the salvation of the people is here
expressed, still the severity of the punishment is likewise stated, that wicked
men may not, as they are wont to do, indulge the hope of some mitigation. Nor
can it be doubted that the Prophet was led by a secret impulse from God to ask
this, that the stern and dreadful reply which immediately follows might be more
fully brought out; from which it is evident what kind of destruction awaits
unbelievers, that they will receive no light or moderate punishment, but will be
utterly destroyed and cut
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until the houses be
without man, and the land become a desolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
This is an additional aggravation; for it is possible that countries might be
wasted, and yet that one city might remain; that even cities might be stormed
and laid desolate, and yet very many houses be left. But here the slaughter, he
tells us, will be so great, that not only the cities, but even the very houses
will be thrown down, and the whole land will be reduced to frightful and
lamentable desolation; though even amidst the heaviest calamities some remnant
is still left. Though Isaiah said this but once, yet let us understand that it
is also spoken to us; for this punishment has been pronounced against all who
obstinately disobey God, or who with a stiff neck struggle against his yoke. The
more violent their opposition, the more resolutely will the Lord pursue them
till they are utterly destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till the Lord have removed
men far away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words contain nothing new,
but merely an explanation of the former verse, and a description by other words
of the ruin that shall overtake Judea; namely, that God will send the
inhabitants <i>far away</i>. He asserts that those who shall survive the war
will not be exempted from punishment, for they will be led into captivity. And
next he adds a general clause about the desolation of the land; as if he had
said that it would be desolate and bereft of inhabitants, because some would
flee away, others would be driven into banishment, and others would perish by
the sword. Such is the reward prepared for obstinate and rebellious persons, who
add crime to crime, till the indignation of God rise to such a height that it
cannot be appeased.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till there shall be in it a
tenth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is some obscurity in the words; but
let us first ascertain the meaning, and then we shall easily find out what is
the signification of the words. There are two ways of explaining this passage.
Some explain
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyry&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>asiriyah</i>) to mean <i>decimation</i>; others make it to mean <i>a
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tenth
part</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and consider it to be a collective noun.
Undoubtedly, the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyry&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>asirith</i>,) and not
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyry&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>asiriyah</i>,) denotes <i>a tenth part</i>, though the difference between
them is not great. Those who render it <i>decimation</i> think that a truce is
promised to the people, because from the reign of Uzziah to the destruction of
Jerusalem there would be ten kings; and undoubtedly that is the number of kings,
reckoning from Uzziah to Zedekiah. His prophetical doctrine would derive no
small support from the circumstance, that he could tell the number of kings who
should reign even after his death, and that he described not only the fact
itself, but likewise the time, and the day.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet
I know not if another meaning be not somewhat more appropriate; for the Prophet
appears to hold out to the people this consolation, that they will retain some
hidden vigor, and will be capable of sprouting out, though they may appear for a
time to be entirely dead; just as, when the winter is past, the trees renew
their foliage. But as the former exposition carries sufficient probability, I
shall therefore explain the whole verse according to the opinion of those who
think that mention is here made of ten kings, so as to mean that, when the ten
kings shall have completed their reign, the people will be carried into
captivity, and then, as by a conflagration, the whole land will be
consumed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the same time, the reader ought to
be aware that whether
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyry&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>asiriyah</i>) be rendered <i>a tenth part</i>, or <i>decimation</i>, it may
with the utmost propriety be viewed as referring to the people; and then the
meaning will be, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till the people
be diminished to a tenth part</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had formerly
spoken of a <i>remnant</i>, and a <i>very small remnant</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9,) and afterwards he will speak of it again,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:22;) for it was a very small number that remained. It might therefore be
naturally viewed as meaning, that out of a thousand there would be left a
hundred; out of a hundred, ten; and out of ten,
one.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall
return.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is, a change will take place for
the better: the Jews will return from captivity to their native country, and the
land will assume a new aspect. But this may be thought to be somewhat at
variance with what follows; for the Prophet immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be
destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino">. How cold comfort will it yield to
the people to be restored, if shortly afterwards they shall be again destroyed!
Some commentators solve this difficulty, by supposing that Isaiah spoke about
the final destruction of the people. But in my opinion he rather means that the
destruction will not be complete, but such as happens to trees, when their
leaves fall off in the winter, and nothing appears but dead timber; but when
spring returns, they bud forth anew: and so also will this
people.</font><br><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">R[bl</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lebaer</i>) means to <i>burn</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and therefore it means here that they
will be <i>consumed</i> by a conflagration: but we ought to read it in
connection with the metaphor which immediately follows; for Isaiah does not
barely mean that it will be <i>consumed</i>, but that it will be consumed
<i>like the teil-tree</i>, that is, with the hope of immediate recovery. When
Jerome rendered it <i>for exhibition</i>, I know not on what he supposed that
opinion to be founded, if it were not that he made a free translation, looking
rather to the meaning than to the etymology of the word; for when trees blossom
or put forth leaves, their life is again brought forth and displayed; and this
meaning will be very
appropriate.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a teil-tree
and an oak.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It appears that Isaiah did not
select at random those two kinds of trees; for one of them puts forth its
leaves, and likewise sheds them, sooner than the other. So it happened to the
tribe of Judah; for first the ten tribes, with the half tribe of Benjamin, were
carried into captivity; and thus they who were the first to blossom were
likewise the first to decay. This tribe was the latest of all in decaying, not
without high expectation of blossoming again; for here the hope of deliverance
is held out, and this was different from the captivity of the Israelites. There
appears, therefore, to be some appropriateness in this metaphor of the trees;
but I would not choose to press it very
far.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they cast their
leaves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the phrase, <i>casting of
leaves</i>, must be understood that <i>throwing of them down</i> which takes
place when trees are stripped of their leaves as of their garment; for trees, in
that state of nakedness, appear to be dry and withered; though there remains in
them a hidden vigor, through which they are at length quickened by the returning
mildness of the season.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So in
it shall be substance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the application
of the metaphor, which is exceedingly forcible; for when we see the spiritual
grace of God in the very order of nature, we are strongly confirmed. As Paul
holds out a likeness of the resurrection in the sowing of corn, which is a daily
occurrence,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461536&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:36,) so in like manner Isaiah in this passage describes the
restoration of the Church, by taking a metaphor from trees, which wither at the
end of autumn, but again blossom at the return of spring, and put forth new
leaves; which could not happen, did they not retain some vigor during the
winter, though to outward appearance they are dead. He foretells that a similar
event will happen to this people; so that, although during their hard and
oppressive captivity they resemble dry timber, and it may be thought that they
can never be delivered, still there will always be preserved in them some vigor,
by which they shall be supported amidst those calamities, and shall at length
come forth and blossom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This doctrine, we have
said, is not peculiar to a single age, and therefore it ought to be carefully
observed; for it frequently happens that the Church, amidst the numerous
afflictions which she endures, appears to have no strength, and is supposed to
be utterly ruined. Whenever this takes place, let us fully believe that,
notwithstanding these appearances, there is still some concealed energy, which,
though it be not immediately manifest to our eyes, will at length yield its
fruit. That energy lies hidden in the word of the Lord, by which alone the
Church is sustained.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The holy
seed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shows what is that <i>substance</i>,
that it consists of a small number of the godly, whom he calls <i>the holy
seed</i>; for he means the elect, who would be preserved by the free mercy of
God, and thus would survive that captivity. That banishment might be regarded as
a cleansing of the Church, by which the Lord took away the ungodly; and when
they had been cut off, he collected a people, small in number, but truly
consecrated to himself. Some commentators consider this phrase to refer to
Christ; but the interpretation appears to be too far-fetched, and it will be
more consistent to extend it to all the godly; for <i>the</i> <i>holy seed is
the substance</i> of the Church.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here is related a remarkable prophecy
about the wonderful deliverance of Jerusalem, when it appeared to have been
utterly ruined. Now the Prophet explains all the circumstances, that by means of
them the miracle may be more fully displayed, and to make it manifest, that not
by the wisdom or power of man, but by the favor of God, the city has been
preserved. For so ungrateful were the people, that, at the close of this
transaction, they would not have understood that they had been delivered by the
hand of the Lord, if all the circumstances had not been expressly brought to
their remembrance. And, indeed, there were very few persons who, in the hour of
danger, ventured to hope what Isaiah promised; because they judged of themselves
and of the state of public affairs from present appearances. In order,
therefore, to make known the remarkable kindness of God, he enters into all the
details, that they may perceive from what danger and from whose hand they have
been delivered. Let us also understand that this kindness was conferred on
ungrateful men, that the Church might be preserved, and that Christ might
afterwards appear.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It ought to be observed that
the Prophet speaks of the second war which was fought by <i>Rezin and Pekah</i>;
and this may easily be inferred from the sacred history; for in the former war
Ahaz was vanquished, and a vast multitude were carried into captivity, who were
at length restored by the Israelites, when the Prophet, in the name of God,
commanded that it should be done. Having again collected an army,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:5,) the kings of Israel and Syria attacked Ahaz, because they thought
that he had been worn out by the former war, and had no power to resist. The
mention of this second war is intended to show the greatness of the miracle; for
Ahaz had not strength left to resist so great a multitude, the flower of the
whole nation having been swept away by the former war, and such of the people as
remained being quite dispirited, and not yet recovered from the terror arising
out of their recent defeat. So much the more, therefore, are the goodness and
power of God displayed, that, pitying so great distress, he gave assistance to
his people, and in a moment rescued them from the jaws of death, when all
regarded their condition as
hopeless.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Went
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may be regarded as a statement and
summary of the whole transaction; for he mentions the subjects on which he is
about to speak, and in the Hebrew modes of expression briefly glances at those
matters which he will afterwards explain more fully and at large. From the first
he tells the result, that the expedition of the two kings was unsuccessful, and
afterwards he will assign the reasons why Jerusalem could not be stormed; but
before coming to that, he briefly notices the plan or design of King
Ahaz.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it was told the house of
David.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not mean that, at the very time
when the two kings were approaching to the city, the king received intelligence
about the league; for it would not have been safe for Ahaz to go out, when the
invading army was spread over the country; but before they had collected their
forces, it is said that King Ahaz trembled. Hence there is reason to believe
that his consternation became greater when he saw the danger nearer. <i>The
house of David</i> means the king's palace and court; as if the Prophet had said
that Ahaz and his counsellors had been informed about the conspiracy which had
been formed against Judea.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the words,

F93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nothing else was meant by the Prophet
than that a league in war hath been formed between the Israelites and the
Syrians, that with their united forces they might attack Jerusalem. In the use
of the word <i>Ephraim</i> there is a figure of speech (synecdoche) very
frequent in the Prophets, by which a part is taken for the whole. Under
<i>Ephraim</i> the whole kingdom of Israel is included, not only because that
tribe was superior to the rest in numbers and wealth, but because their first
king, Jeroboam, was descended from it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;111126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 11:26.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his heart
was moved. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We see that by <i>the house of
David</i> is here meant nothing else than "the king's palace," from which the
terror spread to the whole nation; and indeed it was impossible but that, when
they heard of the alarm of the king and the princes, the body of the people
should be moved by the same kind of terror. As soon as this intelligence was
received, all were struck with such dread that no man was master of himself. He
expresses their trembling by an appropriate metaphor, which is also frequently
employed by ourselves, (<i>Il tremble</i> <i>comme la fueille en l'arbre</i>,)
<i>he trembles like the leaf of a</i> <i>tree</i>. The design of this is to
heighten the miracle; for we learn from it that not only in the opinion of
others, but likewise in their own opinion, their case was desperate. They would
therefore have been utterly ruined if the Lord had not seasonably
interposed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage sets before us a very
bright mirror, in which we may behold the thoughtlessness of the ungodly, when
they do not feel the hand of God; and, on the other hand, the fearful trembling
with which they are suddenly seized, when the Lord presents to them any danger.
In the midst of their prosperity they are so much at their ease that they hardly
believe that they are subject to the government of God, and undoubtedly imagine
that they are placed beyond the reach of all danger. Adversity stuns them in
such a manner that they suddenly fall down, and their senses are so entirely
overpowered by terror that they lie like people who are lifeless or bereft of
their senses. Such is the punishment by which the Lord arouses them from their
deep slumber. At first they appear to be firm and immovable, as if nothing could
throw them down from their rank; but now, at the slightest noise, they are
suddenly seized with trembling. That terror is the righteous vengeance of God,
to whom they never do homage until they are
compelled.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us learn, that if we have any
spark of faith, we ought not to distrust God when we are in any danger. It is
indeed impossible that we should not be agitated and alarmed when dangers press
upon us; but we ought not to tremble so as to be tossed about by our anxiety in
every direction, and unable to see a harbour to which we may safely direct our
course. There must always be this difference between the fear of the godly and
of the ungodly, that the ungodly find no remedy for composing their minds; but
the godly immediately betake themselves to God, in whom, knowing that they have
a very safe harbour, though they be harassed by uneasiness, still they remain
calm.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then said the
LORD.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> First, we see how God, remembering his
covenant, anticipates this wicked king by sending the Prophet to meet him; for
he does not wait for his prayers, but of his own accord promises that he will
grant deliverance. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His son
Shear-jashub</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is joined with the Prophet as a
witness of the prediction, and there is reason to believe that his name,
<i>Shear-jashub</i>, was not given at random, but by the secret inspiration of
the Spirit, or by an immediate command of God, and in order to point out the
future deliverance of the people. He, therefore, carried in his name what might
be regarded as an engraven seal, both of the approaching captivity and of the
return. It is also probable that this symbol of the prediction was generally
known, for he would not have been joined with his father on any other account
than because he bore in his person some
authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the way of the
fuller's field.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The place is mentioned in order
to give authenticity to the history. It is possible that the king, for the
purpose of repelling the enemy, may have set out to watch his approach, which
appears more clearly from the sacred history.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:17.) It is called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
way of the fuller's field</i></font><font face="Palatino">, perhaps because it
was customary to wash clothes there, or because the name arose out of some
ancient occurrence. However that may be, it was an evidence of anxiety and
dread, that this wretched hypocrite was running about in all directions, when
Isaiah came forth to meet him and to soothe his
mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>

The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shamar</i>,) which signifies <i>to keep</i>, is here put in the
Hiphil;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the greater part of interpreters take
it for <i>beware</i>; but they erroneously apply this to an unnatural and
far-fetched meaning, that Ahaz should <i>beware</i> of carrying on war. A more
natural meaning is, that he ought not to waver or wander about in uncertainty,
but to remain calm and serene. Accordingly, I have rendered it <i>refrain</i>.
The meaning therefore is, that Ahab should be composed, and should not be
agitated or harass his mind by uneasiness, as fickle and unsteady persons are
wont to do when they are struck with
terror.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This interpretation is confirmed by the
word which follows, <i>Be</i> <i>quiet</i>; for these two are connected, first,
to keep quiet <i>watch</i>, so as not to be distracted by a variety of opinions,
or gaze around in all directions; and, secondly, to have a calm and composed
mind. Such are the highly delightful fruits which are yielded by faith; for
through a variety of attacks unbelievers give way, and wander in uncertainty,
and know not to which hand they ought to turn, while believers keep themselves
under restraint, and <i>quietly</i> betake themselves to God. Ungodliness is
never at rest; but where faith exists, there the mind is composed, and does not
tremble to an immoderate degree. These words very fitly express the power of
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having pointed out the remedy for
allaying the distresses of the mind, he likewise bids them <i>not fear</i>; for
faith, which places our salvation in the hand of God, is not more opposite to
anything than to <i>fear</i>. It is impossible, I acknowledge, not to
<i>fear</i> when dangers threaten, for faith does not deprive us of all feeling.
On the contrary, the children of God are undoubtedly moved by two kinds of
<i>fear</i>, one of which arises from the feeling of human nature, even though
they be endued with perfect faith. The other arises from the weakness of faith;
for no man has made such proficiency as not to have any remains of that distrust
against which we ought continually to strive. We must not, therefore, understand
the exhortation of the Prophet to mean that the Lord forbids every kind of
<i>fear</i>, but he enjoins believers to be armed with such firmness as to
overcome <i>fear</i>. As if he had said, "Do not suffer yourselves to be
discouraged; and if you are assailed by fierce and severe attacks, maintain
unshaken resolution, that you may not be overpowered by dangers, but, on the
contrary, live to God and overcome all your distresses." For the same reason he
immediately adds, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
let not thy heart be faint.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To be <i>faint</i>
means "to melt away," for not without reason does the Apostle exhort us to
strengthen our hearts by faith.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:27; 13:9.) It is the softness of indolence, when we forget God and melt away,
as it were, through our unbelief. You would not call that man soft or effeminate
who relies on the Spirit of God and steadfastly resists adversity. Hence we
infer that the Prophet meant nothing else than that Ahaz should undauntedly
await the accomplishment of what the Lord had promised to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the two
tails.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah employs an elegant metaphor to
lessen the conception which the Jews had formed about those two very powerful
kings which had filled their minds with terror. Their rage and cruelty appeared
to be a devouring fire, which was sufficient to consume the whole of Judea, and
could not be quenched. Isaiah, on the other hand, calls them not
<i>firebrands</i>, (for that might have been thought to be something great,) but
<i>tails</i>, that is, some fragments or ends of <i>firebrands</i>, and these,
too, not burning, but only <i>smoking</i>, as if some <i>firebrand</i> snatched
from the fire were going out, and gave out nothing else than a slight smoke.
This metaphor yields high consolation, for it warns us to form a very different
opinion about the violence of the ungodly from what it appears to be. One would
think that they are endued with so great power that they could burn and destroy
the whole world. To put down the excess of terror, the Lord declares that what
we imagined to be a burning, and a perpetual burning, is but a slight smoke and
of short duration.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king of Syria hath taken evil
counsel against thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though he foretold that
empty would be the threats, and vain the attempts of the enemies of the people

restrain them. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil

for these two kings had leagued together to destroy Judea. To express it more
fully, and to place it as it were before their eyes, he relates their very
words.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnxyqn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nekitzennah</i>) is rendered by some, <i>Let us distress</i> or
<i>afflict</i>; which is also expressed by the derivation of the word. But in
this conjugation it rather signifies "to stir up and arouse." Though I do not
reject the former interpretation, yet I prefer the latter, because it agrees
better with the scope of the passage. Again, I understand the word <i>arouse</i>
as meaning to <i>disturb</i>, and to cause revolutions; as we commonly say,
<i>to raise disturbances</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so as not to allow the tranquillity of
that kingdom to be
preserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us open it to
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The following word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[yqbn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>nabkignennah</i>,) is interpreted by some, <i>Let us break into it</i>.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Others render it, <i>Let us cause it to break up to us</i>. I have rendered it,
<i>Let us open</i>; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[qb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bakang</i>) also signifies what we commonly express by the phrase, <i>to
make a breach or opening</i>.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, the way to <i>open</i> up the entrance to Judea was to rush through its
fortifications by the force of arms, or, through the influence of fear, to
induce timid and fickle persons to revolt; for so long as they continue to be
loyal, entrance cannot be obtained; but when everything is disturbed by
insurrections, an entrance is made, so that it becomes easy to break through
into the strongest and best fortified
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus, these two kings hoped that, as
soon as they came into Judea, they would immediately terrify the whole nation by
the extent and power of the army, so that there would be no ability or
inclination to resist. When they brought together an army so prodigiously
numerous, it is not probable that they placed any dependence on a long siege;
for Jerusalem was strongly fortified; but they thought that the inhabitants of
Jerusalem would be terrified and alarmed at the sight of their forces, and would
be induced to make an immediate surrender. Yet I leave it to every person to
adopt any interpretation of these words that he pleases, for whatever sense be
put upon them, the meaning of the Prophet is not
doubtful.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The son of
Tabeal.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Who this <i>Tabeal</i> was cannot
easily be learned from history. Probably he was some Israelite, an enemy of the
house of David, whom those kings were desirous to set up as one of their own
dependents.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall not
stand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he had formerly stated was intended
to show more fully that the deliverance was great and uncommon; for when the
Lord intends to assist us in our trials, he represents the greatness of the
danger, that we may not think that he promises less than the necessity requires.
He does not usually give a mitigated view of the evils which press upon us, but
rather holds out their full extent, and afterwards makes a promise, and shows
that he is able to deliver us, though we may appear to be ruined. Such was the
method adopted by the Prophet; for he might have told them in plain terms what
would happen, and might have encouraged the king and the nation not to be
terrified or discouraged at the sight of those armies. But he opened up the
scheme and design of those kings, with which he now contrasts the promise and
decree of God, that his wonderful assistance may be more strikingly
displayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is the sacred anchor which alone
upholds us amidst the billows of temptations; for in adversity we shall never be
able to stand if God take away his word from us. Although, therefore, the king
was almost overwhelmed with despair, Isaiah shows that there is nothing so
dreadful that it may not be despised, provided that he fortify himself by the
promise of God, and patiently look for that which is not yet seen, and which
even appears to be incredible. He affirms, that whatever men attempt, after the
manner of the giants, in rising up against God, <i>it</i> <i>shall not
stand</i>. He uses the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqt</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>thakum</i>,) <i>shall</i> <i>arise</i>, in the same sense in which that
metaphor is employed in the Latin language, that a work is making progress; and,
in a word, he declares that such daring sacrilege <i>shall not
stand</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Still more emphatic is that which he
adds, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyht
al</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>lo</i> <i>thihyeh</i>,) <i>it shall not
be</i>; that is, it shall be reduced to nothing, as if it had never existed.
This mode of expression deserves notice, for it was the bare and naked word of
God which was contrasted with the vast army and scheme of the
kings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the head of Syria is
Damascus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said, "Those two kings
shall have their limits, such as they have them now. They aspire to thy kingdom;
but I have set bounds to them which they shall not pass." <i>Damascus</i> was
the metropolis of <i>Syria</i>, as Paris is of France. He says, therefore, that
those kings ought to be satisfied with their possessions, and that their future
condition would be the same as it then
was.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Ephraim shall be
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having said that it is now
useless to attempt to extend their boundaries, he foretells the calamity of the
kingdom of Israel; for by the word <i>broken</i> he means that the kingdom of
Israel shall be annihilated, so that it shall no longer exist. The Israelites
were carried into captivity, and incorporated with another nation, just as in
our own time a part of Savoy has passed under the government of France, and has
lost its name. This is what the Prophet means, when he says
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>megnam</i>,) <i>that it be not a people</i>; for at that time Israel was
mixed with foreign nations, and its peculiar name was blotted
out.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Within sixty-five
years.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Israelites were led into captivity
in the sixth year of King Hezekiah, and Ahaz reigned not more than sixteen
years; and, therefore, it is certain that this calculation ought not to be made
from the day on which Isaiah was sent to deliver this message, for it was only
twenty years to the time when the ten tribes were carried into captivity. Amoz
had prophesied of that captivity; and there can be no doubt that this prophecy
of Amoz,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
3:11,) and the time specified in it were generally knonvn, and that all
understood the reckoning of the number of years. If, therefore, we reckon from
the time when Amoz makes this prediction, we shall find it to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sixty-five</i>
<i>years</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for Jotham reigned sixteen years,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121533&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:33;) Ahaz as many,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:2;) to those must be added six years of King Hezekiah, which brings us
down to the year when the ten tribes were carried into captivity; and if we
afterwards add twenty-seven years, during which Uzziah reigned after the
publication of the prophecy, there will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sixty-five
years</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This conjecture is highly probable; and
there ought not to be any doubt that this was Isaiah's meaning; for there is a
prediction of the Prophet Amoz, in which the Lord warned the people that they
might not meet with anything unexpected, and complain that they had been
overtaken suddenly. Isaiah confirms that prediction, and announces the same time
which already was universally known.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover,
by these words he sharply reproves the thoughtlessness of the Israelitish
nation, that, when they had been warned of the destruction of their country and
their name, not only did they freely indulge in despising the judgment of God,
but as if they had purposely intended to mock at the heavenly predictions, they
opened their mouth to devour Judea; for a long period was already past, and they
thought that they had escaped. The Prophet ridicules this madness, in imagining
that the word of God grew old in so small a number of years. But because the
Israelites were deaf, Isaiah assigns to the Jews a time when they may look for
the destruction of their enemies. Now, this passage shows that the Prophets
faithfully assisted each other, that by their united labors they might serve
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>

cause; and, therefore, some render it, "If you do not believe, the reason is,
that you are not believers." They limit the former clause to the prophecy of
Isaiah, but extend the latter to any part of the word of God, as if he had said,
"If you have no faith in my sayings, this gives a general proof of your
unbelief." But in that way, the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnymat</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>thaaminu</i>,) which is in Hiphil conjugation, will not differ from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnmat</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>theamenu</i>,) which is in the Niphal. It is not without reason, however,
that the Prophet has changed the termination; and, from many passages of
Scripture, it is abundantly evident that the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ma</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>aman</i>,) in the Niphal conjugation, signifies <i>to stand</i>, or, <i>to
remain fixed in its condition</i>. I interpret it, therefore, as if he had said,
"This is the only support on which you can rely. Wait calmly and without
uneasiness of mind for what the Lord has promised, that is, deliverance. If you
do not wait for it, what else remains for you than
destruction?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ki</i>,) therefore, as in many other instances, means <i>truly</i>; for he
declares that they cannot stand, if they do not rely on the promise; and
indirectly he expresses still more, that God will stand, though they disbelieve
his word, and, as far as lies in their power, endeavor to destroy its stability;
but that they will not stand, unless they rely on the promise which has been
made to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought to draw a universal
doctrine, that, when we have departed from the word of God, though we may
suppose that we are firmly established, still ruin is at hand. For our salvation
is bound up with the word of God, and, when this is rejected, the insult offered
to it is justly punished by him who was ready to uphold men by his power, if
they had not of their own accord rushed headlong to ruin. The consequence is,
that either we must believe the promises of God, or it is in vain for us to
expect salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>

wicked as not to believe the promise, so he enjoins Isaiah to confirm him by
adding a sign; for when God sees that his promises do not satisfy us, he makes
additions to them suitable to our weakness; so that we not only hear him speak,
but likewise behold his hand displayed, and thus are confirmed by an evident
proof of the fact. Here we ought carefully to observe the use of signs, that is,
the reason why God performs miracles, namely, to confirm us in the belief of his
word; for when we see his power, if we have any hesitation about what he says to
us, our doubt is removed by beholding the thing itself; for miracles added to
the word are seals.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>

perhaps in the word <i>deep</i> there is something still more emphatic; as if he
had said, "It belongs to you to choose. God will immediately show that his
dominion is <i>higher</i> than this world, and that it likewise extends to all
<i>depths</i>, so that at his pleasure he can raise the dead from their graves."
It was undoubtedly astonishing forbearance towards this wicked king and people
of God, that not only did he patiently bear their distrust for a time, but so
graciously condescended to them that he was willing to give them any pledge of
his power which they chose. Yet he had in his eye not unbelievers only, but he
intended likewise to provide for the benefit of the weak, in whom there was a
seed of godliness; that they might be fully convinced that Isaiah did not speak
at random, for he could easily give a proof of the power of God in confirmation
of what he had said.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The same goodness of God is
now also displayed towards men, to whom he exercises such forbearance, when he
might justly have been offended at them; for how shockingly do they insult God,
when they doubt his truth? What do you leave to God, if you take that from him?
And whatever may be our doubts, not only does he pardon us, but even aids our
distrust, and not only by his word, but by adding miracles; and he exhibits them
not only to believers, but also to the ungodly, which we may behold in this
king. And if he was at that time so kind to strangers, what ought not his own
people to expect from him?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Ahaz
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a plausible excuse he refuses the sign
which the Lord offered to him. That excuse is, that he is unwilling <i>to</i>
<i>tempt the LORD</i>; for he pretends to believe the words of the Prophet, and
to ask nothing more from God than his word. Ungodliness is certainly detestable
in the sight of God, and in like manner God unquestionably sets a high value on
faith. Accordingly, if a man rely on his word alone, and disregard everything
else, it might be thought that he deserves the highest praise; for there can be
no greater perfection than to yield full submission and obedience to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But a question arises. Do we <i>tempt</i>
God, when we accept what he offers to us? Certainly not. <i>Ahaz</i> therefore
speaks falsehood, when he pretends that he refuses the sign, because he is
unwilling to <i>tempt God</i>; for there can be nothing fitter or more excellent
than to obey God, and indeed it is the highest virtue to ask nothing beyond the
word of God; and yet if God choose to add anything to his word, it ought not to
be regarded as a virtue to reject this addition as superfluous. It is no small
insult offered to God, when his goodness is despised in such a manner as if his
proceedings towards us were of no advantage, and as if he did not know what it
is that we chiefly need. We know that faith is chiefly commended on this ground,
that it maintains obedience to him; but when we wish to be too wise, and despise
anything that belongs to God, we are undoubtedly abominable before God, whatever
excuse we may plead before men. While we believe the word of God, we ought not
to despise the aids which he has been pleased to add for the purpose of
strengthening our faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For instance, the Lord
offers to us in the gospel everything necessary for salvation; for when he
brings us into a state of fellowship with Christ, the sum of all blessings is
truly contained in him. What then is the use of Baptism and the Lord's Supper?
Must they be regarded as superfluous? Not at all; for any one who shall
actually, and without flattery, acknowledge his weakness, of which all from the
least to the greatest are conscious, will gladly avail himself of those aids for
his support. We ought indeed to grieve and lament, that the sacred truth of God
needs assistance on account of the defect of our flesh; but since we cannot all
at once remove this defect, any one who, according to his capacity shall believe
the word, will immediately render full obedience to God. Let us therefore learn
to embrace the signs along with the word, since it is not in the power of man to
separate them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When <i>Ahaz</i> refuses the
<i>sign</i> offered to him, by doing so he displays both his obstinacy and his
ingratitude; for he despises what God had offered for the highest advantage.
Hence also it is evident how far we ought to <i>ask signs</i>, namely, when God
offers them to us; and therefore he who shall reject them when offered, must
also reject the grace of God. In like manner fanatics of the present day
disregard Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and consider them to be childish
elements. They cannot do this without at the same time rejecting the whole
gospel; for we must not separate those things which the Lord has commanded us to
join.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But a question may be asked, Is it not
sometimes lawful to <i>ask signs</i> from the Lord? For we have an instance of
this in Gideon, who wished to have his calling confirmed by some <i>sign</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;070601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
6:17.) The Lord granted his prayer, and did not disapprove of such a desire. I
answer, though Gideon was not commanded by God to ask a sign, yet he did so, not
at his own suggestion, but by an operation of the Holy Spirit. We must not abuse
his example, therefore, so that each of us may freely allow himself that
liberty; for so great is the forwardness of men that they do not hesitate to ask
innumerable signs from God without any proper reason. Such effrontery ought
therefore to be restrained, that we may be satisfied with those signs which the
Lord offers to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, there are two kinds of
<i>signs</i>; for some are extraordinary, and may be called supernatural; such
as that which the Prophet will immediately add, and that which, we shall
afterwards see, was offered to Hezekiah.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:7.) Some are ordinary, and in daily use among believers, such as Baptism and
the Lord's Supper, which contain no miracle, or at least may be perceived by the
eye or by some of the senses. What the Lord miraculously performs by his Spirit
is unseen, but in those which are extraordinary the miracle itself is seen. Such
is also the end and use of all <i>signs</i>; for as Gideon was confirmed by an
astonishing miracle, so we are confirmed by Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
though our eyes behold no miracle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, Hear now, O house of
David.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Under the pretense of honor to exclude
the power of God, which would maintain the truth of the promise, was intolerable
wickedness; and therefore the Prophet kindles into warmer indignation, and more
sharply rebukes wicked hypocrites. Though it would have been honorable to them
to be reckoned the descendants of David, provided that they imitated his piety,
yet it is rather for the sake of reproach that he calls them the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>posterity</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>family of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was indeed no small aggravation of
the baseness, that the grace of God was rejected by that family from which the
salvation of the whole world would proceed. Grievous disgrace must have been
brought on them, by naming their ancestry, from which they had so basely and
shamefully degenerated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This order ought to be
carefully observed; for we ought not to begin with severe reproof, but with
doctrine, that men may be gently drawn by it. When plain and simple doctrine is
not sufficient, proofs must be added. But if even this method produce no good
effect, it then becomes necessary to employ greater vehemence. Such is the
manner in which we hear Isaiah thundering on the present occasion. After having
exhibited to the king both doctrine and signs, he now resorts to the last
remedy, and sharply and severely reproves an obstinate man; and not him only,
but the whole royal family which was guilty of the same kind of
impiety.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it a small thing
for you to weary men?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He makes a comparison
between <i>God</i> and <i>men</i>; not that it is possible to make an actual
separation between <i>God</i> and the prophets and holy teachers of whom he
speaks, who are nothing else than God's instruments, and make common cause with
him, when they discharge their duty; for of them the Lord
testifies,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He who despiseth you
despiseth me.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He who heareth you
heareth me.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
10:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore adapts his discourse to the
impiety of Ahaz, and of those who resembled him; for they thought that they had
to deal with <i>men</i>. Those very words were undoubtedly spoken in ancient
times which we hear at the present day from the mouths of the ungodly: "Are they
not men that speak to us?" And thus they endeavor to disparage the doctrine
which comes from God. As it was customary at that time for irreligious despisers
of doctrine to use the same kind of language, the Prophet, by way of admission,
says that those who performed the sacred office of teaching the word were
<i>men</i>. "Be it so. You tell me that I am a mortal man. That is the light in
which you view the prophets of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But is it a small thing to
weary</i></font><font face="Palatino"> us, if you do not also <i>weary God</i>?
Now, you despise God, by rejecting the sign of his astonishing power which he
was willing to give to you. In vain therefore do you boast that you do not
despise him, and that you have to do with <i>men</i>, and not with <i>God</i>."
This then is the reason why the Prophet was so greatly enraged. Hence we see
more clearly what I mentioned a little before, that the proper season for giving
reproofs is, when we have attempted everything that God enjoined, and have
neglected no part of our duty. We ought then to break out with greater
vehemence, and to expose the ungodliness which lurked under those cloaks of
hypocrisy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He formerly said, <i>Ask a sign for thee
from the </i>Lord thy God; for at that time his obstinacy and rebellion had not
been manifestly proved. But now he claims it as peculiar to himself; for
<i>Ahaz</i>, and those who resembled him, had no right to boast of the name of
God. He therefore intimates that God is on his side, and is not on the side of
those hypocrites: and in this way he testifies his confidence; for he shows how
conscientiously he promised deliverance to the king; as if he had said, that he
did not come but when God sent him, and that he said nothing but what he was
commanded to say. With the same boldness ought all ministers to be endued, not
only so as to profess it, but to have it deeply rooted in their hearts. The
false prophets also boast of it loudly, but it is empty and unmeaning talk, or a
blind confidence arising from rashness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore the </i>Lord<i>
himself shall give you a sign.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Ahaz had already
refused the sign which the Lord offered to him, when the Prophet remonstrated
against his rebellion and ingratitude; yet the Prophet declares that this will
not prevent God from <i>giving the sign</i> which he had promised and appointed
for the Jews. But what
sign?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, a virgin shall
conceive.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage is obscure; but the
blame lies partly on the Jews, who, by much cavilling, have labored, as far as
lay in their power, to pervert the true exposition. They are hard pressed by
this passage; for it contains an illustrious prediction concerning the Messiah,
who is here called <i>Immanuel</i>; and therefore they have labored, by all
possible means, to torture the Prophet's meaning to another sense. Some allege
that the person here mentioned is Hezekiah; and others, that it is the son of
Isaiah.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those who apply this passage to Hezekiah
are excessively impudent; for he must have been a full-grown man when Jerusalem
was besieged. Thus they show that they are grossly ignorant of history. But it
is a just reward of their malice, that God hath blinded them in such a manner as
to be deprived of all judgment. This happens in the present day to the papists,
who often expose themselves to ridicule by their mad eagerness to pervert the
Scriptures.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to those who think that it was
Isaiah's son, it is an utterly frivolous conjecture; for we do not read that a
deliverer would be raised up from the seed of Isaiah, who should be called
<i>Immanuel</i>; for this title is far too illustrious to admit of being applied
to any man.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others think, or, at least, (being
unwilling to contend with the Jews more than was necessary,) admit that the
Prophet spoke of some child who was born at that time, by whom, as by an obscure
picture, Christ was foreshadowed. But they produce no strong arguments, and do
not show who that child was, or bring forward any proofs. Now, it is certain, as
we have already said, that this name <i>Immanuel</i> could not be literally
applied to a mere man; and, therefore, there can be no doubt that the Prophet
referred to Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But all writers, both Greek
and Latin, are too much at their ease in handling this passage; for, as if there
were no difficulty in it, they merely assert that Christ is here promised from
the Virgin Mary. Now, there is no small difficulty in the objection which the
Jews bring against us, that Christ is here mentioned without any sufficient
reason; for thus they argue, and demand that the scope of the passage be
examined: "Jerusalem was besieged. The Prophet was about to give them a sign of
deliverance. Why should he promise the Messiah, who was to be born five hundred
years afterwards?" By this argument they think that they have gained the
victory, because the promise concerning Christ had nothing to do with assuring
Ahaz of the deliverance of Jerusalem. And then they boast as if they had gained
the day, chiefly because scarcely any one replies to them. That is the reason
why I said that commentators have been too much at their ease in this matter;
for it is of no small importance to show why the Redeemer is here
mentioned.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, the matter stands thus. King
Ahaz having rejected the sign which God had offered to him, the Prophet reminds
him of the foundation of the covenant, which even the ungodly did not venture
openly to reject. The Messiah must be born; and this was expected by all,
because the salvation of the whole nation depended on it. The Prophet,
therefore, after having expressed his indignation against the king, again argues
in this manner: "By rejecting the promise, thou wouldest endeavor to overturn
the decree of God; but it shall remain inviolable, and thy treachery and
ingratitude will not hinder God from being, continually the Deliverer of his
people; for he will at length raise up his
Messiah."</font><br><font face="Palatino">To make these things more plain, we
must attend to the custom of the Prophets, who, in establishing special
promises, lay down this as the foundation, that God will send a Redeemer. On
this general foundation God everywhere builds all the special promises which he
makes to his people; and certainly every one who expects aid and assistance from
him must be convinced of his fatherly love. And how could he be reconciled to us
but through Christ, in whom he has freely adopted the elect, and continues to
pardon them to the end? Hence comes that saying of Paul, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">all the promises of God
in Christ are Yea and
Amen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 1:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whenever, therefore, God assisted his ancient people,
he at the same time reconciled them to himself through Christ; and accordingly,
whenever famine, pestilence, and war are mentioned, in order to hold out a hope
of deliverance, he places the Messiah before their eyes. This being exceedingly
clear, the Jews have no right to make a noise, as if the Prophet made an
unseasonable transition to a very remote subject. For on what did the
deliverance of Jerusalem depend, but on the manifestation of Christ? This was,
indeed, the only foundation on which the salvation of the Church always
rested.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Most appropriately, therefore, did
Isaiah say, "True, thou dost not believe the promises of God, but yet God will
fulfill them; for he will at length send his Christ, for whose sake he
determines to preserve this city. Though thou art unworthy, yet God will have
regard to his own honor." King Ahaz is therefore deprived of that sign which he
formerly rejected, and loses the benefit of which he proved himself to be
unworthy; but still God's inviolable promise is still held out to him. This is
plainly enough intimated by the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kl</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lachen</i>,) <i>therefore</i>; that is, because thou disdainest that
particular sign which God offered to thee,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hu</i>,) <i>He</i>, that is, God himself, who was so gracious as to offer it
freely to thee, he whom thou <i>weariest</i> will not fail to hold out <i>a
sign</i>. When I say that the coming of Christ is promised to Ahaz, I do not
mean that God includes him among the chosen people, to whom he had appointed his
Son to be the Author of salvation; but because the discourse is directed to the
whole body of the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will
give you a sign.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;kl</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lachem</i>,) <i>to you</i>, is interpreted by some as meaning <i>to your
children</i>; but this is forced. So far as relates to the persons addressed,
the Prophet leaves the wicked king and looks to the nation, so far as it had
been adopted by God. He will therefore give, not <i>to thee</i> a wicked king,
and to those who are like thee, but <i>to you</i> whom he has adopted; for the
covenant which he made with Abraham continues to be firm and inviolable. And the
Lord always has some remnant to whom the advantage of the covenant belongs;
though the rulers and governors of his people may be
hypocrites.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, a virgin
shall conceive. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The word <i>Behold</i> is used
emphatically, to denote the greatness of the event; for this is the manner in
which the Spirit usually speaks of great and remarkable events, in order to
elevate the minds of men. The Prophet, therefore, enjoins his hearers to be
attentive, and to consider this extraordinary work of God; as if he had said,
"Be not slothful, but consider this singular grace of God, which ought of itself
to have drawn your attention, but is concealed from you on account of your
stupidity."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hml[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnalmah</i>,) <i>a virgin</i>, is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnalam</i>,) which signifies <i>to hide</i>, because the shame and modesty
of <i>virgins</i> does not allow them to appear in public; yet as the Jews
dispute much about that word, and assert that it does not signify <i>virgin</i>,
because Solomon used it to denote a young woman who was betrothed, it is
unnecessary to contend about the word. Though we should admit what they say,
that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hml[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnalmah</i>) sometimes denotes <i>a young woman</i>, and that the name
refers, as they would have it, to the age, (yet it is frequently used in
Scripture when the subject relates to <i>a virgin</i>,) the nature of the case
sufficiently refutes all their slanders. For what wonderful thing did the
Prophet say, if he spoke of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> a
young woman</i></font><font face="Palatino"> who <i>conceived</i> through
intercourse with a man? It would certainly have been absurd to hold out this as
a <i>sign</i> or a miracle. Let us suppose that it denotes a young woman who
should become pregnant in the ordinary course of
nature;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> everybody sees that it would have been
silly and contemptible for the Prophet, after having said that he was about to
speak of something strange and uncommon, to add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A young woman shall
conceive</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is, therefore, plain enough that
he speaks of <i>a virgin</i> who should conceive, not by the ordinary course of
nature, but by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit. And this is the
mystery which Paul extolls in lofty terms, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God was manifested in the
flesh.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall
call.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew verb is in the feminine
gender, <i>She</i> <i>shall call</i>; for as to those who read it in the
masculine gender, I know not on what they found their opinion. The copies which
we use certainly do not differ. If you apply it to the mother, it certainly
expresses something different from the ordinary custom. We know that to the
father is always assigned the right of giving a name to a child; for it is a
sign of the power and authority of fathers over children; and the same authority
does not belong to women. But here it is conveyed to the mother; and therefore
it follows that he is conceived by the mother in such a manner as not to have a
father on earth; otherwise the Prophet would pervert the ordinary custom of
Scripture, which ascribes this office to men only. Yet it ought to be observed
that the name was not given to Christ at the suggestion of his mother, and in
such a case it would have had no weight; but the Prophet means that, in
publishing the name, <i>the virgin</i> will occupy the place of a herald,
because there will be no earthly father to perform that
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Immanuel.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
This name was unquestionably bestowed on Christ on account of the actual fact;
for the only-begotten Son of God clothed himself with our flesh, and united
himself to us by partaking of our nature. He is, therefore, called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God with
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or <i>united to us</i>; which cannot apply
to a man who is not God. The Jews in their sophistry tell us that this name was
given to Hezekiah; because by the hand of Hezekiah God delivered his people; and
they add, "He who is the servant of God represents his person." But neither
Moses nor Joshua, who were deliverers of the nation, were so denominated; and
therefore this <i>Immanuel</i> is preferred to Moses and Joshua, and all the
others; for by this name he excels all that ever were before, and all that shall
come after him; and it is a title expressive of some extraordinary excellence
and authority which he possesses above others. It is therefore evident that it
denotes not only the power of God, such as he usually displays by his servant,
but a union of person, by which Christ became God-man. Hence it is also evident
that Isaiah here relates no common event, but points out that unparalleled
mystery which the Jews labor in vain to
conceal.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Butter and honey shall he
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet proves the true human
nature of Christ; for it was altogether incredible that he who was God should be
born of <i>a virgin</i>. Such a prodigy was revolting to the ordinary judgment
of men. To hinder us from thinking that his fancy now presents to us some
apparition, he describes the marks of human nature, in order to show, by means
of them, that Christ will actually appear in flesh, or in the nature of man;
that is, that he will be reared in the same manner that children commonly are.
The Jews had a different way of rearing children from what is followed by us;
for they used <i>honey</i>, which is not so customary among us; and to this day
they still retain the custom of causing a child to taste <i>butter and
honey</i>, as soon as it is born, before receiving
suck.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may know.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">That is, until he arrive at that age when he can
distinguish between good and evil, or, as we commonly say,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lamed</i>) denotes the term and period up to which he shall be reared after
the manner of a child; and this contributes still more to prove the reality of
his nature. He therefore means <i>understanding</i> and <i>judgment</i>, such as
is obtained when the period of childhood is past. Thus we see how far the Son of
God condescended on our account, so that he not only was willing to be fed on
our food, but also, for a time, to be deprived of <i>understanding</i>, and to
endure all our weaknesses.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:14.) This relates to his human nature, for it cannot apply to his Divinity. Of
this state of ignorance, in which Christ was for a time, Luke testifies when he
says,</font><br></div>

for the purpose of giving greater definiteness. This is very customary in
Scripture. If he had pointed out a particular child, he would have added
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hzh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hazzeh</i>,) as is frequently done in other passages. It is not probable
that this promise of the overturn of the kingdoms of Syria and Samaria, which
immediately followed, would be deferred for five hundred years, that is, till
the coming of Christ; and, indeed, it would have been altogether absurd. The
meaning therefore is, "Before the children, who shall be born hereafter, can
distinguish between good and evil, the land which thou hatest shall be
forsaken."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the land</i> I understand Israel
and Syria; for though they were two, yet on account of the league which had been
formed between the two kings, they are accounted one. Some understand by it
Judea; but that cannot agree on account of the plural noun which follows,
<i>her</i> <i>kings</i>. That these things happened as they are written may be
easily inferred from the sacred history; for when Ahaz called the Assyrians to
aid him, <i>Rezin</i> was slain by them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:9.) Not long afterwards, Pekah, king of Israel, died, in the twelfth
year of King Ahaz, and was succeeded by Hoshea, the son of Elah.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121530&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:30; 17:1.) Thus, before the children who should afterwards be born were
grown up, both countries would be deprived of their kings; for before that time
both Rezin and Pekah were removed out of the land of the living. Now the
discourse is addressed to Ahaz, and God promises to him, by way of consolation,
that he will inflict punishment on the enemies of Ahaz, but for no other purpose
than to render him more
inexcusable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which thou
hatest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to the word <i>hatest</i>, Syria and
the land of Israel are said to be <i>hated</i> or <i>abhorred</i> by King Ahaz,
because from that quarter he was attacked by invading armies. He therefore
promises that those kings will soon perish. Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynpm</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>mippenei</i>,) <i>on account of</i>;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and I admit that this word is generally used in this sense. But I adopt here a
more natural rendering, as if he had said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be forsaken from the
face or from the presence of the two kings,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
shall be left by them, so that they shall no more be seen. And by these words it
is sufficiently evident that this must be understood as referring to both
kingdoms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The </i>Lord<i> shall bring
upon thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet, on the other hand,
threatens the wicked hypocrite, who pretended that he was unwilling <i>to tempt
God</i>, and yet called for those whom the Lord had forbidden him to call to his
aid.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022332&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
23:32.) That he might not indulge in undue exultation and insolence on account
of the former promise, he likewise threatens his destruction, and declares that
what he hopes to be his preservation, that is, the aid of the Assyrians, will be
utterly destructive to him.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:7;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 28:16.) As if he had said, "Thou promisest everything to thyself from
the king of Assyria, and thinkest that he will be faithful to thee, because thou
hast entered into a league and covenant with him, which God had forbidden; but
thou shalt quickly understand of what advantage it will be to thee to have
<i>tempted God</i>. Thou mightest have remained at home and at ease, and
mightest have received the assistance of God; but thou choosest rather to call
in the Assyrians. Thou shalt find them to be worse than thine own
enemies;"</font><br><font face="Palatino">This discourse, therefore, agrees with
what goes before; for he presses more closely the treachery and ingratitude of
the king, who had rejected both the word of God and the sign, and had rendered
himself unworthy of every promise. And as it is customary with hypocrites, when
they have escaped from any danger and fear, immediately to return to their
natural disposition, he affirms that nothing shall protect the Jews from being
likewise involved in just punishments. He expressly declares that <i>the family
of David</i>, which might have claimed exemption on the ground of its peculiar
privilege, will be exposed to the same kind of calamities; for God regulates his
judgments in such a manner, that while he spares his Church and provides for her
permanent existence, he does not permit the wicked, who are mingled with the
good, to escape
unpunished.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the day that
Ephraim departed from Judah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this manner
does Scripture speak when it describes any serious calamity; for the Jews could
not have received a severer chastisement than when, by the withdrawing of the
ten tribes,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;111216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 12:16,) not only was the kingdom wretchedly divided, but the body of the
nation was rent and torn. The revolt of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim from
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"> was, therefore, an indication of the
worst kind of calamity; for the resources of the kingdom of Judah being more
seriously affected by that division than it could have been by any defeat by a
foreign enemy, he says that since that time the Jews had not sustained a greater
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence, as I have already said, we see
how God, while he punishes hypocrites, at the same time remembers believers, and
opens the way for his mercy. We ought to observe this wonderful arrangement,
that amidst the most dreadful deaths still the Church remains safe. Who would
ever have thought that Jerusalem would be delivered from the vast army of the
two kings? Or, that the kingdom of Syria, which was then in a flourishing
condition, would quickly be overturned? Or, that Samaria was not far from
destruction? And in the mean time, that the Assyrians, on whom the Jews relied,
would do them more injury than the Israelites and Syrians had ever done? All
these things the Lord did for the sake of preserving his Church, but at the same
time in such a manner that he likewise took vengeance on the wickedness of King
Ahaz.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Jews thought that the Assyrians were
bound by their league with them; but the Prophet ridicules this folly, and
declares that they will be ready at God's bidding to drive them in any direction
that he thinks fit. Yet instead of command he employs the metaphor <i>hiss</i>,
in allusion to the climate of those kingdoms of which he speaks; for Egypt
abounds in flies, because the country is hot and marshy; and when the air is
both hot and moist, there must be produced a great abundance of flies. Assyria,
on the other hand, abounded in bees; and when he says that he will bring them by
a <i>hiss</i>, he alludes to the natural habits of bees and flies, but he means
that he will find no difficulty in sending them. As if he had said, "There will
be no need of great exertion; for as soon as I shall give the sign, they will
instantly run." In this manner he shows what efficacy belongs to his secret
operation or design, that by a <i>hiss</i> he compels the most powerful nations
to yield obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He follows out the same metaphor; for
bees commonly seek nests for themselves in caverns, or valleys and bushes, and
such like places; as if he had said that there would not be a corner in which
the enemy would not settle down and dwell. It is unnecessary to give ourselves
much trouble in explaining why he speaks of <i>bushes</i> and <i>thorns</i>
rather than of other things, for the language is figurative. And yet I have no
doubt that he intended to state, that whether they hide themselves in caverns,
or seek concealment in valleys, there will be no escape; for the enemy will take
possession of the whole country.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we again
infer what has been formerly observed, that nothing takes place at random or by
chance, but that everything is governed by the hand of God. Again, though wicked
men may rage and may be hurried forward in blind attack, still God puts a bridle
on them that they may promote his glory. Therefore, when we see that wicked men
throw everything into disorder, let us not think that God has laid the bridle on
their neck, that they may rush forward wherever they please; but let us be fully
convinced that their violent attacks are under control. From this we ought to
derive wonderful consolation amidst those disturbances in which the Christian
world is so deeply involved, and by the violence of which it is so powerfully
shaken, that almost everything appears to be in a state of confusion. We should
consider that the Lord has a concealed bridle by which he restrains furious
beasts, so that they cannot break through wherever the madness of their rage
drives them, or go beyond the limits which the Lord prescribes to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The </i>Lord<i> will shave with a
hired razor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now employs a different
metaphor, and compares those enemies by whom the Lord had determined to afflict
Judea at the appointed time, to <i>a razor</i>, by which the <i>beard</i> and
<i>hair</i> are shaved, and other excrescences of the same kind are removed.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>beth</i>) is here superfluous, and is only employed in accordance with the
Hebrew idiom, to denote an instrument, and, therefore, I have merely rendered it
<i>he will shave</i> <i>with a razor</i>. What he means he immediately explains;
namely, that <i>the Assyrians</i> will serve for <i>a razor</i> in the hand of
God, and that they will come from a distant
country.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who are beyond the
river.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This means that Euphrates will not
hinder them from passing over to execute the commands of God. He likewise adds,
that it will not be some portion of that nation rushing forward of its own
accord into foreign territories, or wandering without a settled leader; but that
the king himself will lead them, so that the nation and the king at the same
time will overwhelm Judea, and it will sink under such a
burden.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A hired
razor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not without reason that he says
that this <i>razor</i> is <i>hired</i>; for he expresses by it the dreadful
nature of the calamity which would be brought upon them by the Assyrians. If a
man make use of a <i>hired</i> horse or a <i>hired</i> sword, he will use it the
more freely, and will not spare or take care of it as he would do with his own,
for men wish to gain advantage from what they have <i>hired</i> to the full
value of the <i>hire</i>. Thus the Lord threatens that he will not at all spare
the <i>razor</i>, though he should be under the necessity of blunting it, which
means, that he will send the Assyrians with mad violence and rage. If the Lord
took such dreadful vengeance on the Jews for those reasons which the Prophet
formerly enumerated, we ought to fear lest we be punished in the same manner; or
rather, we ought to dread the <i>razor</i> with which he has already begun to
shave us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The head and the
hair of the feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hair of the
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means the lower parts; for by <i>the
feet</i> is meant all that is below the belly, and it is a figure of speech, by
which a part is taken for the whole.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, he means that the whole body,
and even the beard, must be shaved. Now, if we set aside the figures, and wish
to get at the plain and natural meaning, it is as if he had said, that this
<i>shaving</i> will reach from the top of the head down to the feet, and that
kings and princes will not be exempted from that calamity, but that they also
must feel the edge of the
<i>razor</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass on that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In these verses, down to the end of the
chapter, the Prophet describes the state of a country torn and wasted; for he
intends to present a striking and lively picture of such overwhelming distress
that, wherever you turn your eyes, nothing is to be seen but the traces of
frightful desolation. Some think that a mitigation of punishment is here
promised, but we shall soon see that this does not agree with the context.
Though he employs the appellation, <i>a man</i>, without any limitation, yet
strictly it is of the richest men that he speaks; for he does not say that every
one will have so many; but they who formerly were accustomed to rear a large
number of <i>oxen</i> and <i>sheep</i> will be satisfied with having a few. He
means, therefore, that all will be reduced to very deep poverty. Some think that
the Hebrew word which the Prophet employs,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyjy</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>yechaiyeh</i>,) <i>he shall</i> <i>quicken</i>, means "to deliver from
death;" but the meaning which I have adopted is more natural and more generally
approved.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the abundance of
milk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain it thus: "there will
scarcely be as much obtained from one cow as would be required for the food of a
family;" for those who rear cattle do not feed on milk alone, but likewise make
cheeses, and have butter to sell. When, therefore, he says, that out of all
their abundance nothing more would be produced than what was necessary for the
use of the family, in the opinion of those commentators it denotes poverty.
Others think that this is a promise of fertility, that however small may be the
number of their cows and sheep, still they will have abundant means of support.
A third exposition is preferable; for it appears as if the Prophet intended to
show that the <i>men</i> will be so few in number that a small quantity of milk
will be sufficient for them all; and it is a far heavier affliction that a
country should want inhabitants than that it should have a small supply of herds
and flocks.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the preceding verse Isaiah
declared, that Judea would be so impoverished, that very few herds and flocks
would be left; but now he adds that the men will be still fewer, for a very
little milk will be sufficient for the inhabitants of the land. I adopt this
exposition the more readily, because here a promise would be inappropriate. The
former sense is forced; and he does not speak only of cattle-feeders who had
cows, but of all the inhabitants; for he expressly says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one that shall be
left,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and by that expression he again denotes
the smallness of their number. His statement, therefore, is intended to show,
that the country will be so generally forsaken and so miserably wasted, that no
great supply of <i>milk</i> and <i>butter</i> will be needed; for, when the
devastation has taken place, there will be few men
left.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A thousand
vines.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to the opinion of those who think
that Isaiah here comforts believers, I pass it by without refutation; for it is
sufficiently refuted by the context, and the words plainly declare that Isaiah
continues to threaten destruction, and to describe the desolation of the land.
Others think that the meaning is this, "Where a thousand vines were, which were
sold for a thousand pieces of silver, there briers and thorns will be found."
But it is plain that this would be far too low a price, if the statement were
applied to the whole country; for who would think of reckoning a shekel to be
the price of <i>a vine</i>, which is the most precious of all possessions? It is
of the same import with a common expression, "to sell for a trifle,"
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to give away for a piece of
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when anything is sold at a very low
price. Any field, however barren or uncultivated, might be sold at a higher
price, if due attention were paid to the cultivation of land, as is usually done
where there is a crowded
population.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of
briers and thorns.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He assigns a reason for the
alteration of the price, which makes it evident that he speaks of desolation.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of briers and
thorns</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says he; for there will be none to
cultivate the land, which usually happens when a heavy calamity has been
sustained.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lamed</i>,) which some render <i>to</i> or <i>for</i>, means, I think, <i>on
account of</i>; for, everything having been thrown into confusion by the fury of
the invading army, there are no vinedressers or laborers, and the most highly
cultivated lands must have been covered over and choked up by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>briers and
thorns.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning therefore is, that the
inhabitants will be so few, that you will scarcely find and one that would give
the smallest coin to buy the most valuable
estates.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With arrows and bow shall
they come thither.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aby</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>yabo</i>,) <i>he shall come</i>, is in the singular number; but it ought to
be explained by the plural, that the archers will march through Judea. Some
think that Isaiah speaks of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bows
and arrows</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because such would be the dread of
enemies, that no man unarmed would venture to approach his possessions. But I
consider it to be more probable that the Prophet means that, where the richest
cultivation formerly existed, opportunity for hunting will be found; for there
the wild beasts have their dens. Now, it is a most wretched change, when fields
formerly cultivated and fertile are turned into woods and thickets. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bow and
arrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"> here, therefore, I understand
<i>hunting</i>, in this sense: "it shall not be approached by husbandmen but by
hunters, and they shall not plant or dress vines, but chase wild beasts." In
short, it means nothing else than frightful desolation, which shall change the
aspect of the land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on all the hills that are dug
with the hoe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet appears to
contradict himself; for, having hitherto spoken of the desolation of the land,
he now describes what may be called a new condition, when he says that, where
<i>thorns and briers</i> were, there oxen will feed. The consequence has been,
that some have applied these words to the consolation of the people. But the
intention of the Prophet is totally different; for he means that <i>hills</i>,
which were at a great distance from a crowded population, and which could not be
approached without much difficulty, will be fit for pasturage, on account of the
great number of men who go thither; that is, because men will betake themselves
to desert mountains, which formerly were inaccessible, there will be no need to
be afraid of <i>briers</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for there will be abundance of
inhabitants. Now, this is a most wretched state of things, when men cannot
escape death but by resorting to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thorns and
briers</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he means <i>hills</i> formerly
desolate and uncultivated, in which men shall seek a residence and abode,
because no part of the country will be safe. Thus he describes a distressful and
melanchol condition of the whole country, and destruction so awful that the
aspect of the country shall be altogether different from what it had formerly
been.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he foretold these things to King
Ahaz, there can be no doubt that Ahaz despised them; for that wicked king,
relying on his forces and on his league with the Assyrians, settled, as it were,
on his lees, as soon as the siege of the city was raised. But Isaiah was bound
to persevere in the discharge of his office, in order to show that there was no
help but from God, and to inform the wretched hypocrite, that his destruction
would come from that quarter from which he expected his
preservation.</font><br></div>

is a confirmation of the preceding one, in which Isaiah predicted the
approaching desolation of the kingdom of Israel and Syria. He had foretold that
both countries would be deprived of their kings, before the children who should
soon afterwards be born could distinguish between good and evil, that is, before
they were grown up.

This concise brevity is more emphatic than if he had made a long discourse; for
any one could carry home four words, and perceive in them the swiftness of the
wrath of God, and be truly and deeply affected by the judgment of God, as if it
had been pointed out with the finger. In short, God determined that he should
not waste words, because there was no time for controversy, but that he should
represent the matter by an outward sign. The Prophets having so frequently, and
without any good effect, threatened vengeance, he gave a striking exhibition of
it by an example, that it might make a deeper impression on their minds, and be
engraven on their memory. As often as these words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ll&ccedil; rhm zb

mentioned, they would recall to their remembrance the destruction of Israel and

it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah having prophesied about the coming of
Christ in the former chapter,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

but cannot at all harmonize with the text; for the true and natural view of the
context shows that in this passage the Prophet brings forward nothing that is
new, but supports what he had formerly

is, true and worthy of credit; and yet one of them was an ungodly and worthless
apostate, who, wishing to flatter his king, erected an altar resembling the
altar at Damascus, and openly defended ungodliness and unlawful modes of
worship. Some commentators, I am aware, are of opinion that it was a different
person; but a careful examination of the circumstances will convince any one,
that this was the same <i>Urijah</i>, of whom the sacred history declares that
he was slavishly devoted to the ungodliness and lawless desires of the king.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:11.) As to those who think that it was a different person, because
Isaiah here calls this man <i>faithful</i>, such an argument carries little
weight; for the Prophet did not look at the man, but at the office which he
held, and which rendered him a fit person for bearing testimony. Accordingly, he
does not mean that he was a good and excellent man, but that his office gave him
such influence that nobody could reject him, and that his testimony was, as they
say, free from every
objection.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Uriah the priest,

might be repeated by every person.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I approached to the

Prophet, I have no doubt, by a vision, for the purpose of sealing the former
prediction. The vision given to Isaiah was, that he had a child by his wife, and
was enjoined to give him this name. There would, indeed, be no absurdity in
admitting that the Prophet actually had a son by his wife, and gave him this
name; and I shall not eagerly dispute with any one who is of that opinion. But
as it is not probable that this name was given to any man, and as there is no
evidence to prove it, I am more disposed to think that this was a vision
exhibited to the Prophet, in order to confirm the former prediction. He calls
his wife a <i>prophetess</i>, not in the same sense in which the wives of kings,
for the sake of showing them respect, are called queens, but because in this
vision she sustained a public
character.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Truly before the child have
knowledge to cry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an interpretation
both of the dark saying and of the vision which was added to it; for although
God did not intend to speak in direct language, still it was proper that
obscurity should be removed. I interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[nh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hannagnar</i>,) <i>the child</i>, to mean not the Prophet's son, but rather
all who should be born soon afterwards. He declares that, before they are grown

will be destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before the

disposal, or at the will, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
king of Assyria</i></font><font face="Palatino">; alluding perhaps to an ancient
custom of carrying the spoils of the enemies <i>before</i> the chariot of those
who received a public triumph. In like manner shall the spoils of Samaria and
Damascus be carried </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before the
king of Assyria.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">This makes it still more
evident that the Prophet intended nothing else than to foretell the desolation
of the kingdom of Israel and of Syria. He does this for the purpose of
comforting the godly, and likewise of holding up to scorn the foolish dread of
the wicked king, who could not endure that the Lord should assist him; for he
rejected not only the promises, but likewise the sign which was offered. In
consequence of this, the Prophet goes farther and farther in reproving his
wickedness, and that of the whole nation. "Thou dost, indeed, believe nothing,
but the Lord will assist his own; and thou shalt quickly see sudden and
unexpected changes, by which the Lord will deliver his people." And yet these
words were spoken not so much to the king as to godly men; and hence we ought to
infer that the servants of God do not always speak so as to be believed by their
hearers; for Isaiah here addresses wicked men, in whom he produces no
conviction. Why, then, does he speak to them? To convict them more and more of
their unbelief, and to reprove them for it; and next, to render the goodness of
God more manifest: for who would not have thought that such aggravated
wickedness would entirely shut the door against the mercy of God? And yet the
Lord, by his goodness, rises superior to the wickedness both of the king and of
the people. The object of the Prophet therefore is, to reprove the ungodly for
their rebelliousness, and at the same time show that God is always like
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the waters of
Shiloah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> That Ahaz may not slumber in
unfounded expectation, the Prophet all at once breaks off his discourse about
the general safety of the godly, and next threatens punishment on unbelievers.
Sorme think that he speaks against those who wished for revolutions; as it
frequently happens that the multitude are not satisfied with their present
condition, and desire to have a new king. Those who are diseased often expect
that, by a change of place, they will be in better health. So perverse is the
will of men, that when matters do not go to their wish, they look for a change
of their condition, snatch at it eagerly, and hope to obtain from it some
relief.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I think that the Prophet's meaning
is more extensive, and does not apply to those only who desired a change; but
that the discourse is general, and includes all ranks; for impiety and contempt
of God almost universally prevailed, and he does not speak of a few persons, or
of a particular party, but of the great body of the nation. I confess, indeed,
that he excepts a few persons, servants of God, who will afterwards be
mentioned; but that does not prevent the remonstrances of Isaiah from being
directed against the whole nation; for since almost all were corrupted, he
justly reproves them all. The offense is, that the people, distrusting their own
weakness, sought increased wealth and increased forces. He says, therefore, that
they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despised the waters of
Shiloah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because the Jews <i>despised</i> and
<i>disdained</i> their
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their joy was
to Rezin and Remaliah's son.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some render it with <i>Rezin</i>, but
the preposition <i>to</i> expresses more fully the perverse desire. He means
that the Jews, perceiving that they had not strong fortresses, looked in another
direction, and longed for the wealth of the kingdom of Israel. Beholding their
small number and their poverty, they trembled, and placed no confidence in God,
but only in outward assistance, and thought that they would be perfectly safe,
if they had as powerful a king as the Israelites had. Thus they <i>rejoiced
in</i> the riches of others, and in longing for
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore,
behold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks in the present tense, that
all may attend more closely: <i>Behold, the </i>Lord<i> bringeth violent
waters</i>. We must attend to the metaphors which the Prophet employs, for the
style is much more elegant than if it had been naked and unadorned. "It is as if
he had said, Because the people are not satisfied with their condition, and
desire the riches of others, I will show them what it is to have a powerful
king." For instance, if a small nation, whose king was mean and little esteemed,
had powerful neighbors over whom an illustrious king reigned, and said, "How
delightful would it be to serve that prosperous king, to be the subjects of the
emperor, or of the kings of France; for their power is irresistible!" would not
God justly punish such an unlawful desire? The more powerful that kings are, the
more grievously do they oppress their people; there is nothing which they will
not attempt, they do everything according to their caprice. Besides, they know
no limit to their power, and in proportion to their strength they indulge with
less restraint. The Lord reproves that mad desire of the Jews, in not being
satisfied with their condition, and in looking, not to the Lord, but to the
resources of powerful kings; and this reproof is far more graceful under these
metaphors than if he had spoken in plain and direct
language.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shiloah,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as Jerome tells us, was a small fountain, from which flowed a little river that
ran gently through the midst of Jerusalem. That narrow river yielding them
little protection, they therefore distrusted it, and desired to have those great
rivers by which cities are usually defended and greatly enriched; for there is
nothing by which a country is more enlarged or more rapidly enriched, than by
those large and navigable rivers, which render it easy to import and export
merchandise of every description. He therefore compares Euphrates, which was the
most celebrated river in all the East, to <i>Shiloah</i>, and pursues the same
metaphor, meaning by those rapid waters of the river the Assyrians, who would
destroy the whole of Judea, and would waste it like a deluge.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:13, 17.) "I will show," saith the Lord, "what it is to desire those
rapid and violent waters."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
he shall come up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage ought to be
carefully observed; for we all have a distrust that may be called natural to us,
so that, when we see ourselves deprived of human assistance, we lose courage.
Whatever God may promise, we cannot at all recover ourselves, but keep our eyes
fixed on our nakedness, and sit like bewildered persons in our fear; and
therefore we ought to seek a cure for this fault. <i>Shiloah</i>, therefore,
that is, the calling or lot which God has assigned to us accompanied by a
promise, though we do not see it with our eyes, ought to be our defense, and we
should prefer it to the highest power of all the kings in the world. For if we
rely on human aid, and place our strength in large forces and abundance of
wealth, we must look for the punishment which is here threatened by the
Prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The sacred history assures us that
these things were fulfilled, so that any one who shall read the history will not
need a lengthened exposition of this passage; for the Assyrians, whom the Jews
called to their assistance, destroyed them. This was the just punishment of
their distrust; and we see in it a striking instance of the wicked greediness of
men, who cannot be satisfied with the promise and assistance of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this destruction of the Jews let us
learn to attend to our own interests. The Church is almost always in such a
condition as to be destitute of human aid, lest, if we were too largely
furnished, we should be dazzled by our wealth and resources, and forget our God.
We ought to be so well satisfied and so highly delighted with our weakness as to
depend wholly on God. The small and gentle waters should be more highly valued
by us than the large and rapid rivers of all the nations, and we ought not to
envy the great power of the ungodly. Such is the import of what is written in
the Psalms:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The streams of the
river shall make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the
Most High. God is in the midst of her; God will help her before the dawn. Let
the heathen rage, let the kingdoms be moved, and let the earth melt when the
sound is uttered. Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our
fortress."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
46:4-7.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be objected that we ought not to
reject human aid, the answer is easy. The Prophet does not condemn human aid,
but he condemns that wicked fear by which we are thrown into distrust, and
tremble, so that no promise of God can keep us within reasonable bounds. Now, we
ought to render to God this honor, that though all things else should fail, we
shall be satisfied with him alone, and shall be convinced that he is at hand.
And in that case it matters little whether we have or have not outward
assistance; if we have it, we are at liberty to use it; if we have it not, let
us bear the want of it with patience, and let God alone suffice us for all that
we need; for he will be able to execute his promises, since he has no need of
any outward aid. Only let us trust entirely to his power and
defense.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And crossing over into Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">plj</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chalaph</i>,) which sometimes signifies <i>to pass through</i>, here means
to <i>attack</i> and <i>cut off</i>: that is, it will not only water Judea, but
will overflow it, so as utterly to drown it; for it will spread far and wide on
every part. He adds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even to the
neck.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The comparison is taken from a man who,
entering a river, dips into it gradually, till the water reaches <i>to the
neck</i>. In this manner shall Judea be overflowed by that rapid river, that is,
by the Assyrian, till he be plunged up <i>to the neck</i>. He means Jerusalem,
which was the metropolis of the country; and when the Assyrian came to it, Judea
was at no great distance from
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The breadth of
thy land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is, in all directions; for he
pursues his metaphor in his prophecy, and shows how violent the Assyrian will
be, and enlarges the representation of his strength and violence by the same
comparison; that is, by comparing him to an impetuous river, which bursting
through its barriers and overflowing its banks, spreads far and wide, and
overturns and destroys everything by its violence. He proceeds in his discourse
against the Jews, as he had begun to do in the two former verses; for, having
foretold the destruction of the Israelites and Syrians, he likewise threatens
that the Jews, in their turn, shall be punished for their
unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To understand this better, Isaiah's
highly beautiful and closely connected discourse must be examined. First, he
turned aside to address others; for Ahaz was unworthy of being addressed.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will give</i> <i>you a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino">; which was declared in the former chapter.
Next, he adds the manner of preserving Jerusalem, by the sudden changes which
should take place in Syria and Samaria. This was confirmed, in the beginning of
this chapter, both by a commandment and by a vision. He now comes to the Jews
themselves, that they may not hope to escape without being punished, or be too
highly elated by the destruction of their enemies; for he declares that for them
also a reward is prepared, and that they, too, will be punished for their
wickedness and treachery, because they despised the Lord, and would not rest
satisfied with his promises, and signs, and acts of kindness largely and
bountifully offered.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
Immanuel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be asked, Why does the Prophet
direct his discourse to Christ, instead of simply calling the land "God's holy
land?" For there can be no doubt that by the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Immanuel</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he means Christ. It might be thought that this expression was used in order to
express the disgrace more strongly; for, since Judea not only was set apart to
God, but in the person of the Mediator had God as the guardian of its safety, it
was disgraceful that it should be destroyed by a heathen king. But I rather
think that the Prophet added this name, in order to hold out to good men some
remnant of hope, and to comfort them in so great a calamity; for, when the
country was wasted and cruelly torn, they might have lost courage. He therefore
means, that that desolation would not prevent the coming of the Redeemer, of
whom he had formerly spoken. As if he had said, "Nevertheless, the land shall be
thine, O Immanuel; in it shalt thou have thy residence and abode." This was,
therefore, added instead of a consolation, in order to intimate that the land,
though torn and wasted, belongs to God and not to men. The sudden change too a
direct address
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpostrofh&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">)
is emphatic; for in this way the Prophet solemnly declares his belief in
redemption, that the Lord may set a limit to the frightful
calamities.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Associate

Judah, or, <i>bruise</i> the Assyrians; but this appears to be unnatural or
far-fetched. That it describes the plans and undertakings by which they
endeavored to crush the Church of God, is evident from its being immediately
added, and a second time repeated, by the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gird
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, "Form a plan." The word
<i>associate</i>, therefore, is the most suitable, unless, perhaps, it be
thought preferable to take the verb

it mean <i>to heap up</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
f118</font></sup><font face="Palatino">; for those things which are
<i>bruised</i> must of necessity be violently pressed and squeezed together. He
therefore means not only <i>gathering together</i>, but likewise <i>pressing
closely together</i>; as if he had said, "Draw close to one another, as if you
were a dense mass." This meaning agrees beautifully, I think, with the scope of
this passage; for to the same purpose is what he immediately adds, "Arm
yourselves, <i>Gird you</i>."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet rises
into confidence after having mentioned <i>Immanuel</i>, that is, God, who would
assist his people; and at the same time cherishes increased hope in opposition
to enemies, that though it might be thought that they had gained their object
when they had depopulated the country, still the Lord would be victorious, and
would preserve his people against the cruelty of their enemies. Withdrawing his
mind, therefore, from the sight of that calamity, he turns to Christ, and, by
contemplating him, acquires such courage that he ventures to taunt his enemies
as if he had vanquished them. We must view the Prophet as on a watch-tower, from
which he beholds the distressed condition of the people, and the victorious
Assyrians proudly exulting over them. Refreshed by the name and the sight of
Christ, he forgets all his distresses, as if he had suffered nothing; and, freed
from all his wretchedness, rises against the enemies whom the Lord would
immediately destroy. This ought to be carefully observed; that, as we have still
to contend against the same temptations amidst those afflictions which the
Church endures, and by the weight of which it is almost overwhelmed, we may
direct our eyes to Christ, by the sight of whom we shall be able to triumph over
Satan and over enemies of every
description.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye

waste Judea? I reply, the army of the Assyrian was composed of various
<i>peoples</i>; for he had subdued not only the Chaldeans, but many other
<i>peoples</i>; and, accordingly, that monarchy consisted of various nations.
Yet the Prophet might refer to the Israelites, the Syrians, and the Egyptians,
and to all others who were enemies of the Church of God; for he does not speak
of one stroke inflicted on the Church, but of the incessant contests which the
chosen people had continually to endure. But in order to understand this better,
we must join with it the following verse, at the end of which we find the words

<div><font face="Palatino">First, then, we ought to make sure that <i>God is
with</i> <i>us</i>, which cannot be unless we embrace the promises by faith; and
if we have faith, we do not glory in vain. As to his addressing a nation so
distant, to whom that word could not reach, the reason is obvious, that the
efficacy of the word might be made known to unbelievers, and that they might
know that he would restrain the Assyrians with all their warlike accoutrements,
though they were at a great distance; as if he had said, "You do indeed despise
God, but it will be easy for him to keep you at a distance, and to repress all
your rage."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gird
yourselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is not a superfluous
repetition; for it is far more difficult to expect the assistance of God a
second time, when we have once been delivered, than to embrace the promise of
one single deliverance. Besides, although the first attacks of enemies do not so
greatly alarm us, yet when we see them hardened in their malice, their obstinacy
reduces us to weakness. We have experience of this every day; for if any danger
threatens us, we may expect assistance from the Lord; but if we are again in
danger, we give way; and so great is our ingratitude, that we scarcely think
that God will help us a second time. In consequence of this, we faint if we are
frequently brought into danger, and do not consider that God is never wearied by
doing us good, and by continually assisting
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah, therefore, intended to oppose this
frailty of men, that when armed foes had once and again attacked us, we may
stand firm. If, after being vanquished or weakened, they again muster their
forces, and do not cease to annoy us, let us not be discouraged; for to-morrow,
and the next day, and as often as they league together, God will be able to
frustrate and destroy them. Hence, also, we are reminded of our condition, that
we may be always prepared for enduring additional conflicts, and may not think
that we have done all that was required from us, when we have once resisted; for
Satan is unwearied in his efforts, and continually labors to accomplish our
destruction; he animates his soldiers, and inflames them with new eagerness. But
although the contests must be often maintained, we are certain of victory, and
therefore we ought to fight boldly, and to remain constantly on the
field.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take
counsel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having spoken of the forces of
the enemies, he now comes to their <i>counsels</i>; as if he had said, "Although
the enemies may abound not only in armor and in strength, but, in <i>counsel</i>
and wisdom, still they will accomplish nothing." And this warning was very
necessary; for it often happens that we despise enemies, though powerful and
well armed, because they want <i>counsel</i>, and are guided by blind violence
rather than by reason. He therefore forewarns them that the craftiness of the
enemies, and all the arts by which they endeavor to gain advantage over the
people of God, will in the end be unsuccessful; and, therefore, that they will
accomplish nothing, though they be in want of nothing, and though they may have
a great abundance of everything, of forces, and <i>counsels</i>, and crafty
designs. He adds &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak
the word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To make the meaning more clear, I
have rendered it <i>decree a decree</i>. This relates to their insolence, or it
is the conclusion of the consultation; for after deliberation a <i>decree</i>
usually follows. He declares that all these things will vanish into smoke. It
is, therefore, sufficiently evident what the Prophet means, and to what purpose
this passage ought to be applied; for it may be regarded as a shield by which we
can drive away all the terrors of enemies, whether they excel, on the one hand,
in forces, wealth, power, influence, and rank; or, on the other, in wisdom,
counsel, craftiness, sagacity, and invention, or, in a word, in insolence. For
we are well armed and very powerful, if <i>God is with us</i>; and, therefore,
all the contrivances or decrees of adversaries will immediately vanish
away.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God is with
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">La wnm[

argument.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For my own part, I have no doubt that he
alludes to the name which he formerly gave to Christ; for although he means that
God assists his people, yet as the majesty of God is not of itself sufficient to
support us, he contemplates God himself in the person of the Mediator, in whom
alone he has promised to assist us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus Jehovah spake to me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet contends against another kind
of temptations, that is, against the unbelief of the people; and in order to
make that more manifest, it ought to be observed that there were two remarkable
temptations, the one external, and the other internal. The external temptation
came from professed enemies, such as from the Assyrian; and when the people saw
his plundering and cruelty, they thought that all was over with them, because he
had brought them almost to utter ruin. The other temptation was internal; for
that sacred people, which boasted of having been chosen by God, relied on the
assistance of man rather than of God. Now, this was a most dangerous temptation;
for it appeared as if that nation, by its unbelief, refused admission to the
promises of God, which were daily offered, and which were continually sounded in
their ears. And what could the Prophet think, amidst so great perplexity, but
that the destruction of this wicked people, which did not cease wickedly to
reject the grace of God, was close at hand? The Lord, therefore, determined that
both the Prophet and his disciples should be armed against a temptation of this
kind.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if by taking hold of
my hand.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F121</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is a beautiful metaphor, which the
commentators, I think, have not understood. He alludes to fathers or teachers,
who, when their words have not sufficient effect, seize the hand of their
children or scholars, and hold them so as to compel them to obey. Thus the
servants of the Lord are sometimes disposed to throw everything away, because
they think that they are laboring to no purpose; but the Lord <i>lays</i> as it
were, <i>his hand</i> on them, and holds them fast, that they may go forward in
the discharge of their duty. This is well understood to be very necessary, and
is actually experienced by all who faithfully serve the Lord; for no temptation
is more severe than when they in whom faith ought to dwell revolt; and, in a
word, when faith appears to be banished from the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taking hold of the
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is, therefore, highly necessary, because
not only are we fickle and liable to unsteadiness, but we are also by nature too
much inclined to what is evil, though no one entice us. But if the force of
custom be added, we are scarcely master of ourselves. Undoubtedly, we would
every moment be driven up and down, were it not that we are held by the powerful
government of God, and fix the anchor of constancy in firm ground. Every one of
us ought to meditate earnestly on this thought; for though we may be convinced,
yet when it comes to the trial we fail, and look at men rather than God. We
should, therefore, attend more carefully to this doctrine, and pray to God to
hold us, not only by his word but by <i>laying his hand</i> on
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, it ought to be observed that we are
exceedingly disposed to wicked imitation. When we see bad examples, we are drawn
to them with great force, and take the example for a law; for when others go
before us, we think that we have a right to act in the same manner, and
especially when it is not only one or a few persons who have led the way, but
the custom has become universal. What is in itself manifestly wrong is concealed
by the plausible cloak of public opinion; and not only so, but all are carried,
as it were, by the violence of a whirlwind, to adopt an established custom, as
if the will of the people had the force of a law to authorize their corruptions.
This has not been the fault of a single age, but at the present day it abounds
as much or even more than before; for it is an evil deeply seated in all by the
corruption of nature, to reckon a prevailing error as a law. Hence arise the
superstitions of all ages, and those which at the present day exist in Popery,
the origin of which, if it be investigated, will be found to be nothing else
than that some persons have drawn others into the same error; and thus almost
all have been foolishly caught by the snares of Satan, and the general agreement
of men is still the chief foundation of those superstitions. All defend
themselves by this weapon. "We are not alone," say they; "we follow an immense
multitude."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say not, a
conspiracy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> First, we must consider what was
the condition of that people, for they saw that they were not provided with
numerous forces, and were not able to contend in battle against such powerful
enemies. They longed for outward assistance, and eagerly desired to obtain it,
for they thought that they were utterly ruined if they did not obtain the
assistance of others. In this sense I understand the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conspiracy</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that they thought it necessary to have the assistance of allies. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conspiracy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
being employed by the Hebrews in different acceptations, and sometimes denoting
a <i>bond</i>, I take it in a good sense. But some take it in a bad sense:
"Behold thy enemies, the king of Israel and the king of Syria, have
<i>conspired</i> together." But I rather agree with those who apply it to the
league and friendship which many unbelievers were desirous to contract with the
Assyrian. The Lord therefore admonishes Isaiah not to regard the counsels of
wicked men, though the whole of the people should vie with each other in
attending to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither
fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There may
also be a twofold meaning; for some read it separately, as if in this second
clause the Prophet condemned in general terms the wicked customs of the people.
But these two clauses ought rather to be joined together. "Let it not distress
you, if your countrymen in the present day plot about unlawful confederacies,
and do not consent to them." Now, though the Prophet belonged to the number of
those who needed to be admonished not foolishly to dissuade others from
following by faith, yet the plural number, <i>say ye not</i>, shows that all the
godly were taught in his
person.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their
fear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence we perceive what is the source of
those wavering <i>counsels</i> by which men are agitated; it is, because their
minds are overwhemled by <i>terror</i>, so that they are violently hurried along
without any moderation. He describes the cause of all this, why the Jews so
eagerly desired to have the Assyrians for allies. It was because they were
terrified beyond measure, and did not expect to be preserved in any other way,
and because their blind <i>fear</i> did not permit them to look to the
assistance of the Lord. This was the reason why they so eagerly desired a
league. The same cause of fear was alleged both against the godly and against
the ungodly; but all did not fear in the same manner, for the godly composed
their minds, because they knew that God took care of their preservation, and,
armed by the promise of God, cheered their hearts whenever they mentioned the
name of <i>Immanuel</i>. But the ungodly, overcome by terror, thought of nothing
but the assistance of the Assyrians, did not consider that there is help in God,
and did not betake themselves to him. The Lord certainly does not forbid the
godly to <i>fear</i>, for they cannot avoid that; but he bids them overcome that
excessive terror by which the ungodly are swallowed up. Let us not, therefore,
by their example, gaze around in every direction, and rush headlong to seek
unlawful aid; and especially we must beware lest <i>fear</i> take away our
judgment. There is but one remedy for this evil, to restrain ourselves by the
word of God, from which proceeds real tranquillity of mind. Comparing the
condition of that people with our own, let us learn to betake ourselves to
<i>the name of God</i>, which will be to us an impregnable fortress.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
18:10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">That the Lord did not speak to the
Prophet alone, is also evident from the words being in the plural number,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">al
waryt</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>lo thireu</i>,) <i>fear ye not</i>.
Peter also has drawn from it a general doctrine,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 3:14,) warning us not to <i>fear</i> with the <i>fear</i> of the ungodly,
but to place all our confidence in God, and to keep our eyes continually fixed
on him, that we may remain steadfast, though heaven and earth should be mingled.
If that warning of Peter was ever necessary, it is especially so in the present
day, for we see all things tossed up and down and mingled in frightful
confusion. That we may not be disturbed, the Lord withdraws us from beholding
men, that we may, by attending to his word, keep our position firmly. Peter,
indeed, understands this <i>fear</i> passively, while Isaiah understands it
actively; for Peter exhorts believers to perseverance, so as not to waver on
account of the threats and terrors of the ungodly; but Isaiah condemns the
<i>trembling</i>, which induced the Jews to seek heathen alliances. But as it
was not the intention of Peter to explain this passage, or even to quote the
exact words, and as he meant only to allude to that statement, we need not
wonder at this diversity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sanctify Jehovah of hosts
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have said that the reason why
dangers lead to immoderate alarm is, that wretched men do not raise their eyes
and minds to heaven. The Prophet now, therefore, proposes a suitable remedy for
allaying terrors, that they who dread the evils which threaten them may learn to
give to God the honor due to him. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctify the God of
armies</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means to exalt his power highly; so as
to remember that he holds the government of the world, and that the beginning
and the end of good and evil actions are at his disposal. Hence it follows that,
in some respects, God is robbed of his holiness, when we do not immediately
betake ourselves to him in cases of perplexity. This mode of expression,
therefore, is highly emphatic; for it shows us that no higher affront can be
offered to God than to give way to <i>fear</i>, as if he were not exalted above
all creatures, so as to control all events. On the other hand, when we rely on
his aid, and, through victorious steadfastness of faith, despise dangers, then
do we actually ascribe to him lawful government; for if we are not convinced
that innumerable methods, though unknown to us, are in his power for our
deliverance, we conceive of him as a dead
idol.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let him be your
fear, and let him be your dread. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He properly
adds, that <i>God himself</i> should be the <i>fear</i> and the <i>dread</i> of
the people, in order to inform them that there awaits them a just and lawful
reward of their crimes and of their contempt of God, when they thus in
wretchedness and alarm tremble at dangers. Though he speaks not only of
<i>fear</i> but of <i>dread</i>, yet he does not mean that the Jews should be
filled with horror at the name of God, so as to desire to flee from him, but
merely demands from them reverence for God, and uses both words in order to
express continuance. He therefore means that they will be free and exempted from
solicitude of mind, if a sincere fear of God be deeply engraven on their hearts,
and never pass away from them; and indeed every person who freely devotes
himself to God, and undertakes to fear him alone, so as to lay this restraint on
himself, will find that no haven is more safe than his protection. But as the
ungodly do not cease to provoke his anger by shameless transgression, he
harasses their minds by continual uneasiness, and thus inflicts the most
appropriate revenge for their careless
indifference.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall be for a
sanctuary.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He promises that the true
worshippers of God will enjoy tranquillity of mind, because the Lord, covering
them, as it were, under his wings, will quickly dispel all their fears. There is
an allusion to the word <i>sanctify</i> which he had lately used; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dqm</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>mikdash</i>,) which means sometimes <i>a</i> <i>sanctuary</i>, and sometimes
<i>a place of refuge</i>, is derived from the same
root.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The meaning therefore is, that God
demands nothing for which he does not offer mutual recompense, because every one
that <i>sanctifies</i> him will undoubtedly find him to be <i>a place of
refuge</i>. Now, although in this sanctification there is a mutual relation
between us and God, yet there is a difference, for we <i>sanctify</i> him by
ascribing all praise and glory to him, and by relying entirely upon him; but he
<i>sanctifies</i> us, by guarding and preserving us from all evils. As there
were few who believed and relied on his promises, the Prophet wished that the
godly should be fortified against this kind of temptation; for there was a
danger lest they should be carried away by such bad examples as by a kind of
tempest.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore meant, "The Lord
will be your best and most faithful guardian. Though others stumble against him,
yet be not you terrified; remain steadfastly in your calling." And here a
contrast is implied, though not expressed; for a <i>sanctuary</i> may be said to
be a citadel situated in a lofty position, and a bulwark for defending and
guarding the godly, but for destroying and overwhelming the ungodly, because
they rashly stumble against it. We shall afterwards see more clearly how this
was fulfilled, partly during the reign of Hezekiah, and partly at the time of
the captivity into Babylon; and yet at the same time Christ was prefigured, who
was to be not a place of refuge, but rather
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a stone of
stumbling</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to the Israelites. Isaiah forewarns
them of this <i>stumbling</i>, that the godly may be aware of
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the two houses of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Jews ignorantly and improperly tear
asunder this verse, instead of dividing it. "God will be," say they, "partly a
<i>sanctuary</i> and partly a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stone of
stumbling</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as if by the two families he
distinguished between the godly and the unbelievers. On the contrary, he enjoins
believers, though nearly the whole multitude of both kinodoms should dissuade
them from obedience to God, not to be discouraged, but to disregard everything
else, and break through all opposition. The Prophet might have simply said,
<i>he will</i> <i>be for an offense to Israel</i>; but he intended to express
more, for he includes the whole nation, and declares that God will be their
destruction. The nation was divided into two kingdoms, Ephraim and Judah; and,
therefore, he mentioned both. There were, indeed, some exceptions, but he speaks
here of the whole body.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable
passage and cannot be sufficiently called to remembrance, especially at the
present time, when we see the state of religion throughout the whole Christian
world brought nearly to ruin. Many boast that they are Christians who are
strongly alienated from God, and to whom Christ is a <i>stone of stumbling</i>.
The papists insolently and proudly boast of his name, though they profane the
whole of his worship by superstitions, and bring upon it dishonor and reproach.
Among those to whom a purer worship of God has been restored, there are very few
who embrace the Gospel of God with sincere regard. Wherever we turn our eyes,
very sore temptations meet us in every direction; and, therefore, we ought to
remember this highly useful instruction, that it is no new thing, if a great
multitude of persons, and almost all who boast that they belong to the Church,
<i>stumble against</i> God. Yet let us constantly adhere to him, however small
may be our numbers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a
snare to the inhabitant of Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is
the second circumstance introduced for heightening the picture; for, after
having mentioned the two kingdoms, he names the metropolis itself. Although the
whole country was crippled, yet it seemed that the Lord kept his abode there. He
therefore means that God became <i>a snare</i>, not only to the common people
who were scattered throughout the fields and villages, but to the nobles
themselves, and to the priests who dwelt in <i>Jerusalem</i>, who dwelt in that
holy habitation in which God intended that the remembrance of his name should be
chiefly preserved. That was testified also by David, that <i>those builders</i>
whom the Lord appointed <i>rejected the chief corner-stone</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:22.) Christ quotes this passage against the Jews, and shows that it applies
to himself.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402142&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:42;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
12:10.) This happened, indeed, in the time of Isaiah, but still more in the time
of Christ; for ungodliness and rebellion gradually increased till they came to a
height. Accordingly, both the highest and the lowest, who always had obstinately
disobeyed God, at that time broke out against him still more with unrestrained
indulgence, and therefore their destruction also reached its height; for they
were altogether rejected by God, whose Son they had refused. Hence also we infer
the eternal divinity of Christ, for Paul shows that it is God of whom the
Prophet here speaks.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450933&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:33.) Now, he speaks not of a pretended God, but of that God by whom heaven and
earth were created, and who revealed himself to Moses.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
3:6.) It is, therefore, the same God by whom the Church has been always
governed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And many among them shall
stumble.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He goes on to threaten the ungodly, as
he had formerly begun, and declares that those who refuse to trust in God will
not escape without being punished. The threatening runs thus: "when they have
<i>stumbled</i>, they will then <i>fall</i>, and afterwards they will <i>be
bruised</i>." This agrees with the former metaphor, in which he compared God to
a stone. Christ has alluded to that metaphor, including both
clauses.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He who shall fall on
this stone will be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will bruise
him."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402144&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
21:44.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall be snared and
taken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This agrees with the latter metaphor, in
which he compared God to a <i>snare</i> and <i>gin</i>. Let not the ungodly,
therefore, imagine that they are stronger or wiser than God; for they will find
that he excels them in strength and wisdom, and that to their destruction. They
must, therefore, unavoidably be ruined; for either they will be utterly
<i>bruised</i>, or they will be <i>snared</i> in such a manner, that they can
never extricate themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This threatening
also regards the godly, that they may not hesitate to withdraw from holding
fellowship with the multitude, and that they may not resolutely disregard the
sinfulness of revolt. Now, this does not strictly belong to God, but is rather,
as we would say, accidental; for it belongs to God to receive men into his
favor, and to give them a firm security for their salvation. That was more
clearly manifested in Christ, and is still manifested; and, therefore, Peter
reminds us that, though many unbelievers <i>stumble</i>, this is no reason why
their <i>stumbling</i> should obstruct the progress of our faith; for Christ is
notwithstanding <i>a chosen and precious stone</i>.

the Prophet, and encourages him, while he must contend against apostates and
rebels, to discharge his office with boldness and perseverance. This was highly
necessary, for Isaiah had met with great obstinacy in the people; so that if he
had only looked at their present condition, that is, at the unbelief of the
people, and his fruitless and unsuccessful exertions, he must have altogether
given way. On this account the Lord determined to confirm and <i>seal</i> his
calling, not only on his account, but for the sake of all who should obey his
doctrine; and if very few persons believed the words of the Prophet, still the
Lord testifies that his doctrine has been sealed to them, and that, therefore,
neither must he desist from his office of teaching, nor must they cease to yield
the obedience of faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seal
the law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He compares the doctrine of the word
to a <i>sealed</i> letter, which may indeed be felt and handled by many persons,
but yet is read and understood by few, that is, by those to whom it is sent and
addressed. Thus the word of God is received by few, that is, by the elect,
though it is held out indiscriminately to all. The word is therefore
<i>sealed</i> to those who derive no advantage from it, and is <i>sealed</i> in
such a manner that the Lord unseals and opens it to his own people by the
Spirit. Some derive the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tzor</i>) from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rxn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>natzar</i>,) and translate it <i>keep</i>. But though this does not greatly
affect the general meaning, still the superiority of the rendering which I have
followed</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F123</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> may be proved from the other verb
<i>seal</i>; for the custom in ancient times was, first, to tie a thread around
a letter, and then to <i>seal</i> it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We draw
from it this highly useful doctrine, namely, that teachers and ministers of the
word ought constantly to persevere in discharging their office, though it may
seem that all men revolt, and give no evidence of anything but obstinacy and
rebellion; for the Lord will reserve for himself some disciples, by whom his
letter will be read with advantage, though it be closed to others. The Prophet
afterwards employs the same metaphor, when he says, that <i>the word is like a
closed book</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:11;) but there he only mentions wicked men, and here he mentions disciples,
to whom the doctrine of the word is not without
advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be objected, Was it then the
duty of the Prophet to disregard the people, and to withdraw and shut himself up
with the disciples, among whom some good effect was produced? I reply, this was
not the Prophet's meaning; for it was the will of the Lord that Isaiah should
appear in public, and cry aloud, and reveal his will to all. But as he spoke to
the deaf, and might be discouraged by seeing no evidence of the fruit of his
labors, the Lord determined to excite and encourage him to go forward, even when
matters were in a desperate condition, and, satisfied with his disciples, though
their number was small, to become every day more and more
courageous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I will wait for the
Lord.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have chosen to render the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) by <i>therefore</i>; for the Prophet recovers himself, after having
received from the Lord the consolation which we have just now seen. "Seeing that
the Lord is pleased to have disciples to whom his doctrine is sealed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will wait for
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">, though
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath hid his face from
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, hath rejected and cast off his
people." This is a remarkable passage, and, by meditating continually on it, we
must be greatly encouraged; for though it may seem as if the whole world had
revolted, still we ought boldly to persevere; and even though God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath hid his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"> from his people, and they who professed
his name have been cast off, still we ought to <i>wait for him</i> with unshaken
hope. This is the only remedy that is left to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word <i>wait</i> is exceedingly
emphatic; as if he had said, "Still I will not turn aside from God, I will
persevere in faith." He increases the force of it by adding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will look for
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the occurrence of any offense is wont
to make our faith waver and faint, and it is most grievously shaken when we see
that we are deprived of allies, and that there are open enemies who boldly take
to themselves the name of the Church. Offenses commonly turn us aside from God,
and perplex us in such a manner that we call in question the truth of the word.
This consolation is therefore highly necessary, whether the Church is oppressed
by outward calamities, or thrown into confusion by the treachery of the
multitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold,
I.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet not only testifies that he
will wait patiently, but also gives an evidence of courage, by appearing in
public along with the disciples whom he had gained to God, and who still
remained. As if he had said, "Though others may withdraw, yet I am ready to obey
thee, and I bring along with me those whom thou hast been pleased to preserve in
a wonderful manner through my agency." He therefore declares by these words his
unshaken courage, and promises that he will persevere in faith and obedience to
the Lord, though all should
revolt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
children.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>children</i> are meant the
various classes of servants, agreeably to the ordinary custom of the Hebrew, and
also of the Latin language.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F125</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He speaks of the disciples whom he had
formerly mentioned. Hence we see what is demanded from those who wish to be
reckoned among the true disciples of the Lord. It is, to declare with Isaiah
that they are submissive and ready to hear, and that, as soon as the Lord has
spoken, they will yield immediate obedience. Now, teachers ought to bring
disciples with them, and not merely to send them before; they ought, I say, to
go before them, and by their example to point out the way, as was formerly
explained,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F126</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:3;) otherwise they will have no authority in teaching. The apostle to the
Hebrews applies this passage to Christ,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:13,) and draws from it an instruction which ought to be a very powerful
excitement to us, that considering ourselves to be followers not only of Isaiah,
but of Christ himself, as our leader and instructor, we may press forward with
greater alacrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom the
</i>Lord<i> hath given me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this the Prophet
shows to whom our faith ought to be ascribed. It is to God, and to his
undeserved election; for Isaiah taught publicly, admonished every person, and
invited all without exception to come to God; but his doctrine is of advantage
to those only who have been given to him by God. By <i>given</i> he means those
whom God drew by an inward and secret operation of his Spirit, when the sound of
the external voice fell on the ears of the multitude without producing any good
effect. In like manner Christ declares that the elect were <i>given to him by
the Father</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:6.) Thus we see that readiness to believe does not depend on the will of men;
but that some of the multitude believe, because, as Luke tells us, <i>they had
been foreordained</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441348&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:48.) Now, <i>whom he foreordained he likewise calls</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:30,) and efficaciously seals in them the proof of their adoption, that they
may become obedient and submissive. Such, therefore, is the <i>giving</i> of
which Isaiah now speaks. This applies strictly to Christ, to whom the Father
presents and gives disciples, as it is said in the Gospel by
John,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For signs and wonders.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some consider this passage to refer to
miracles, but that is inapplicable, for the meaning is totally different,
namely, that all the godly will be regarded not only with hatred, but even with
abhorrence, as if they had been monsters; and that not only by strangers or by
professed enemies, but even by <i>Israel</i>. We have experience of this at the
present day; for papists look upon us with greater abhorrence than they look
upon Mahometans or Jews, or even dogs or monsters. Though this is exceedingly
base, we need not greatly wonder at it; for it was necessary that this prophecy
should even now be fulfilled. It was experienced by Isaiah from his countrymen,
and has been experienced by all others who have followed his
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor is it only in papists that we
discover it, but in those who wish to be regarded as very closely connected with
the Church, the greater part of whom either view us with strong dislike, or
ridicule us, or, in a word, hold us to be monsters, because we are so anxious,
and give ourselves so much uneasiness, about the salvation of the Church, the
honor of God, and eternal life; and because we do not scruple to undergo so many
dangers, such hatred, censure, reproach, banishment, poverty, hunger, nakedness,
and, in a word, death itself. These things appear monstrous to them; for when
they are so careful to protect their skin, how could they have a relish for the
highest blessings? But that we may not be disturbed by their reproaches, we must
arm ourselves with this exhortation of the
Prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the </i>Lord<i>
of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To show how trifling and worthless is
the conspiracy of the wicked multitude, he contrasts the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God of
armies</i></font><font face="Palatino"> with the pride of the whole world, and
raises a lofty defiance; as if he had said, that he cared not though he were
universally abhorred by men, because he knew that God was on his
side.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who dwelleth in Mount
Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The addition of these words carries great
weight; for although the people abounded in every kind of crimes and enormities,
still they boasted that they were devoted to God, and, abusing his promises,
condemned the true servants of God who reproved them. On the other hand, the
Prophets, in order to shake off their false confidence and pride, declared that
they were the servants of the only and true God, whom the people falsely boasted
of worshipping <i>in Mount</i> <i>Zion</i>. God had not chosen it for his
habitation as if, because he was bound to the spot, he would accept of false and
spurious worship, but he wished to be sought and worshipped according to the
rule of his word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, when Isaiah
claims for himself God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who
dwelleth in Mount Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he sharply reproves
hypocrites, because through false boasting they indulge in foolish pride
whenever they say, <i>The temple</i> <i>of the Lord</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4,) for it was rather an idol in which they boasted contrary to the word.
Though they snatched at the promises, yet they falsely tortured them against the
true servants of God, as the papists at the present day are wont to torture them
against us. The Prophets, therefore, distinguish God by this title, in order to
tear the mask from hypocrites, who were accustomed to quote the mere name of
<i>the temple</i> in opposition to the plain word of God. For this reason Isaiah
now says, "Take us, if you choose, for monsters, yet God acknowledges us to be
his own; and you cannot detest us without at the same time abhorring the God of
Abraham and David, whose servants we
are."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they shall say to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah continues the former subject, which
is, that all the godly should not only use the authority of God as a shield, but
should fortify themselves with it as a brazen wall, to contend against all
ungodliness. He therefore entreats them to resist courageously if any one shall
tempt them to superstition and unlawful modes of worship. The plural number is
employed by him in order to signify that it was a vice which pervaded all ranks,
and which abounded everywhere; as if he had said, "I see what will happen; you
will be placed in great danger; for your countrymen will endeavor to draw you
away from the true God; for, being themselves ungodly, they will wish you to
resemble them." At the same time he shows how wickedly they had departed from
God's law and covenant, by shamelessly pushing forward diviners and soothsayers
whose name ought to have been held by them in
abhorrence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Should not a
people ask counsel of their God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some read
these words in connection with what goes before, applying them to the ungodly,
as if this were a pretense which they abused in order to deceive the simple;
because there is no nation that has not oracles and revelations, but every
nation <i>consults its gods</i>, or, in place of them, magicians and
soothsayers. But what I reckon to be the more correct view is, that Isaiah
advises his disciples to give this answer if they shall happen to be tempted to
wicked modes of worship. Still the meaning is not fully cleared up; for this
passage is commonly expounded as if it were a comparison drawn from the less to
the greater. "What! seeing that the Gentiles consult their gods, and yet these
gods are false, shall we not more highly esteem him whom we know to be the true
God, and who hath revealed himself to us by so many proofs? What a shame will it
be if their idols are more highly valued by the Gentiles than God is by
us!"</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I interpret this as referring to the
Jews themselves, who were called by way of eminence
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">) <i>the people</i>, because God had
adopted them. Nor is it of any importance that the Prophet employs the plural
form
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wyhla</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (<i>elohaiv</i>;) for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>elohim</i>) is used as in the singular number. This is a shield by which all
the superstitions which come imperceptibly upon us ought to be repelled. While
some ponder and hesitate whether or not it be proper to consult diviners, let us
have this answer in readiness, that God alone ought to be consulted. The Prophet
alludes to that passage in Deuteronomy in which the Lord forbade them to go to
magicians and soothsayers; and lest they should excuse themselves on the
pretense that every nation had its interpreters or fortune-tellers, added, that
they would not cease to have a <i>Prophet</i>, or be deprived of necessary
instruction
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:10-15.) It was therefore the will of the Lord that they should depend
entirely on his word, and should learn from it alone whatever was useful for
them to know, and should render obedience to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the living to the
dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[b</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>begnad</i>) is variously rendered: frequently it is translated <i>for</i>;
and in that case the meaning will be, "Shall
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"> be consulted <i>for</i> the business of
<i>the living</i>?" But as that meaning is forced, it would perhaps be better to
explain it thus: "The Lord desires to be our teacher, and for that purpose hath
appointed prophets, that we may learn from them his will, for a prophet is the
mouth of the Lord. It is therefore unlawful to
go</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">, who have not been appointed for that end;
for God did not intend to make use of <i>the dead</i> for instructing
us."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But when I examine the whole matter more
closely, I choose rather to consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[b</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>begnad</i>) to mean <i>from</i>, that is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the living to the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as if he had said, "One God is sufficient
for us for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the living and the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If you search through heaven, earth, and
hell, you will find that one God is sufficient for us." This is, I think, the
best sense, and flows naturally. Accordingly, the Prophet arms the godly against
the schemes and contrivances of wicked men by whom they might otherwise have
been tempted to revolt, with the exhortation to be satisfied with God alone as
their teacher, and not to offer him such an insult as to disregard his
instruction and seek other teachers, but to cast away everything else, and
depend on his truth alone, which immediately afterwards he again repeats and
confirms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>To the law and testimony.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are
indeed various ways of explaining this passage. Some think that it is the form
of an oath, as if the Prophet were swearing
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that they were apostates, and would entice
others to a similar apostasy. But I take a different view of it, which is, that
he directs our attention </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
law and the testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lamed</i>,) <i>to</i>, plainly shows that this is the meaning. Now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is joined with the <i>law</i>, not as if it were different, but for the sake of
explanation, "<i>to the law</i>," which contains
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or <i>declaration</i> of the will of
God toward us. In short, we ought to take the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as describing a quality, in order to inform us what advantage we derive from
<i>the law</i>; namely, that God reveals himself to us in <i>the law</i>, and
declares what is that relation to us which he chooses to hold, and lays down
what he demands from us, and in short everything necessary to be
known.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is therefore a very high commendation
of <i>the law</i> that it contains the doctrine of salvation, and the rule of a
good and happy life. For this reason also he justly forbids us to turn aside
from it in the smallest degree; as if he should say, "Forsake all the
superstitions on which they are so madly bent; for they are not satisfied with
having God alone, and call to their aid innumerable inventions." In this manner
also Christ speaks,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">They have Moses and the
prophets, let them hear them,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421629&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
16:29;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for though Abraham is there brought forward as the
speaker, still it is a permanent oracle which is uttered by the mouth of God. We
are therefore enjoined to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hear
the law and the prophets, </i></font><font face="Palatino">that we may not be
under the influence of eager curiosity, or seek to learn anything from <i>the
dead</i>. If </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law and the
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"> had not been sufficient, the Lord
would not have refused to allow us other
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn that everything which
is added to the word must be condemned and rejected. It is the will of the Lord
that we shall depend wholly on his word, and that our knowledge shall be
confined within its limits; and therefore, if we lend our ears to others, we
take a liberty which he has forbidden, and offer to him a gross insult.
Everything that is introduced by men on their own authority will be nothing else
than a corruption of the word; and consequently, if we wish to obey God, we must
reject all other instructors. He likewise warns us that, if we abide by <i>the
law</i> of the Lord, we shall be protected against superstitions and wicked
modes of worship; for, as Paul calls</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the word of God is the

6:17,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so by the word, Satan and all his contrivances are
put to flight. We ought therefore to flee to him whenever we shall be attacked
by enemies, that, being armed with it, we may contend valiantly, and at length
put them to flight.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they
shall not speak.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not relate all the
expositions of this passage, for that would be too tedious; and I consider the
true exposition to be so well supported that it will easily refute all others.
It is usually explained to mean that wicked men trifle with their inventions,
and expose their impostures to sale,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because there is no</i> <i>light
in them</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, because they have not
ordinary understanding. For my own part, I consider this to be a reason for
encouraging believers to perseverance; that if wicked men depart from the true
doctrine, they will evince nothing else than their own blindness and darkness.
We ought to despise their folly, that it may not be an obstruction to us; as
Christ also teaches us that we should boldly set aside such persons, so as not
to be in any degree affected by their blindness or obstinacy. "<i>They are
blind</i>," says he, "<i>and leaders of the blind</i>. Do you wish of your own
accord to perish with them?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore enjoins us to
ascribe to the word such high authority, that we shall venture boldly to despise
the whole world, if the word be opposed by them; for if even angels should do
this, we might condemn them also by the authority of the word.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If an angel from heaven,

<div><font face="Palatino">How much more boldly, therefore, shall we condemn men
who set themselves in opposition to God? The mode of expression is emphatic,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they shall not speak according
to this word</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He brings an accusation of
blindness against every man who does not instantly and without dispute adopt
this sentiment, that we ought not to be wise beyond <i>the law</i> of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then they shall pass through that
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not to permit believers to be ensnared by
the common errors, he adds how dreadful is the punishment which awaits the
ungodly when they have revolted from God, and have labored to induce others to
join in the same revolt. The passage is somewhat obscure; but the obscurity
arises from the want of proper attention in examining the words. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnabar</i>) is emphatic; for by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passing
through</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means that <i>uncertainty</i> in
which men wander up and down, and are not able to find a resting-place, or any
permanent abode. To the indefinite verb we must supply a noun,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Jews shall
pass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hb</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>bahh</i>,) <i>in it</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he means Judea, which the Lord had
preferred to all other countries; and therefore it is easily understood, though
the Prophet does not express it. As if he had said, "I promised indeed that that
country would be the perpetual inheritance of my people,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
13:15; 17:8;) but they shall lead a wandering and restless life, as is the case
with those who, driven from their habitations, and afflicted with hunger and
pestilence and every kind of calamities, seek, but nowhere find, a better
condition and abode." These words are therefore contrasted with the
extraordinary kindness of God, which is so frequently mentioned by Moses,
namely, that they will have a fixed residence in Judea; for here he threatens
that they will be stragglers and wanderers, not in their own, but in a foreign
country; so that, wherever they come, they will be attacked and hunted down by
innumerable vexations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When
they shall be hungry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet appears to
point out the conversion of the Jews, as if he had said, "When they have been
weighed down by afflictions they will at length repent;" and undoubtedly this is
the remedy by which the Lord generally cures the disease of obstinacy. Yet if
any one suppose that the word <i>hunger</i> describes the indignation and
roaring of the wicked without repentance, it may be stated that it includes not
only hunger and thirst, but, by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for
the whole,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
every other kind of
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall fret
themselves.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They will begin to be displeased with
themselves, and to loathe all the supports on which they had formerly relied;
and this is the beginning of repentance; for in prosperity we flatter ourselves,
but in sore adversity we loathe everything that is around us. But if it be
thought preferable to refer it to the reprobate, this word denotes the
bitterness, which is so far from leading them to humility that it rather
aggravates their rage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
curse their king and their God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>King</i>
some suppose that he means <i>God</i>. In this sense Zephaniah used the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;klm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>malcham</i>), that is, <i>their King</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;360105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
1:5.) But here I draw a distinction between <i>King</i> and <i>God</i>; for
wicked men are first blinded by a false confidence in idols, and afterwards they
place their defense in earthly things. When the Jews had a <i>king</i>, they
were proud of his glory and power; and when Isaiah preached, wicked men enraged
<i>the king</i> against him, and even aroused the whole of the nation to follow
<i>the king</i> as their standard-bearer. Since, therefore, their false boasting
had been partly in the idols and partly in <i>the king</i>, he threatens that
they will be afflicted with so many calamities, that they will be constrained to
abhor both </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their gods and the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And this is the beginning of repentance,
to loathe and drive far from us everything that kept us back or led us away from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And look
upward</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He describes the trembling and
agitation of mind by which wretched men are tormented until they have learned
steadfastly to look up. There is, indeed, some proficiency, as I lately hinted,
when, in consequence of having been taught by afflictions and chastisements, we
throw away our indifference and endeavor to find out remedies. But we must
advance farther. Fixing our eye on God alone we must not gaze on all sides, or
through fickleness be <i>tossed to and</i> <i>fro</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:14.) However that may be, Isaiah threatens the utter destruction of the Jews;
for so thoroughly were they hardened, that their rebellion could not be subdued
by a light and moderate chastisement from the hand of God. Yet it might be taken
in a good sense, that the Jews will at length raise their eyes to heaven; but in
that case we must read separately what follows:
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they shall look to
the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning will then be, that the
Jews will be converted to God, because they will be deprived of every assistance
on <i>the earth</i>, and will see nothing but frightful calamities, to whatever
side they turn their
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, trouble and
darkness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words are partly figurative and
partly literal; for by <i>dimness</i> and <i>darkness</i> he means nothing else
than adversity, according to the custom of Scripture. But he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>driven to
darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This aggravates the calamity to an
amazing degree; for if one who is in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>driven</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or <i>pushed</i> <i>forward</i>, he is far more in danger of stumbling than
before. Thus he intimates, that to a heavy calamity another still heavier will
be added, that they may be more completely ruined; for he means nothing else
than that the judgments of God will be so dreadful, and the punishments so
severe, that, whether they will or not, they shall be constrained to look up to
heaven.</font><br></div>

hope of alleviation, that they may not be swallowed up by the huge mass of
distresses. Many take these words in quite an opposite meaning, that is, as a
threatening which denounces against the Jews a heavier affliction than that with
which Tiglath-pileser
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:29) and Shalmanezer
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 17:6) afflicted them. The former inflicted a heavy calamity, the latter
inflicted one still heavier, for he carried the twelve tribes into captivity,
and blotted out the name of the nation. Some think that he now foretells the
heaviest calamity of all, for if it be compared with the former two, it exceeds
both of them. Though I am not prepared to reject this view, for it does not want
plausibility, yet I rather favor a different opinion. The other interpretation
is indeed more plausible, that the Prophet intended to deprive hypocrites of
every enjoyment, that they might not imagine that this calamity would quickly
pass away like a storm as the others had done, for it would be utterly
destructive; and so we shall take the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>) in its literal meaning.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F130</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">But in my opinion it is most
appropriate to view it as a consolation, in which he begins to mitigate what he
had said about that frightful <i>darkness</i> and <i>driving</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:22,) and, by allaying the bitterness of those punishments, encourages them to
expect the favor of God. As if he had said, "<i>and yet</i>, amidst that
shocking calamity which the Jews shall endure,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the darkness will not be such as
when</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the land of Israel was afflicted, first,
by Tiglath-pileser,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 15:29,) and afterwards more grievously by Shalmanezer,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 17:6.) Amidst so great extremities believers might otherwise have fainted,
if their hearts had not been cheered by some consolation. Isaiah therefore
directs his discourse to them lest they should think that they were ruined, for
he intimates that the chastisements which are now to be inflicted will be
lighter than those which came before. That this is the natural interpretation
will quickly appear from what immediately
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But why does the Prophet say that this
calamity, which was far more dreadful, would be more mild and gentle? For
Jerusalem was to be razed, the temple thrown down, and the sacrifices abolished,
which had remained untouched during the former calamities. It might be thought
that these were the severest of all, and that the former, in comparison of them,
were light. But it ought to be observed, that while in the former instances
there was no promise, an explicit promise was added to this threatening. By this
alone can temptations be overcome and chastisements be rendered light. By this
seasoning alone, I say, are our afflictions alleviated; and all who are
destitute of it must despair. But if, by means of it, the Lord strengthen us by
holding out the hope of assistance, there is no affliction so heavy that we
shall not reckon it to be light.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This may be
made plain by a comparison. A man may happen to be drowned in a small stream,
and yet, though he had fallen into the open sea, if he had got hold of a plank
he might have been rescued and brought on shore. In like manner the slightest
calamities will overwhelm us if we are deprived of God's favor; but if we relied
on the word of God, we might come out of the heaviest calamity safe and
uninjured.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the words, some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;[wm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mugnaph</i>) for an adjective, as if the Prophet
said,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> It shall not be
darkened</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but the feminine pronoun which
immediately follows,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bahh</i>), <i>in her</i>, does not allow us to refer this to men. It is more
accurately described by others to be a substantive noun; and, therefore, I have
resolved to render it literally, <i>there shall not be darkness</i> in Judea
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the affliction of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>relieved of a

been carried into captivity; but this is altogether at variance with the
Prophet's meaning, and does not agree with what follows; for it is immediately
added that the seacoast has been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>more grievously
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by a second calamity. There can be no

Tyre and Sidon, but because it contained a great multitude of <i>Gentiles</i>,
who were mingled with the Jews; for from the time that Solomon granted this
country to King Hiram,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 9:11,) it could never be subdued in such a manner as not to have some part

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The people walking in darkness

events in the past tense, and thus brings them before the immediate view of the
people, that in the destruction of the city, in their captivity, and in what
appeared to be their utter destruction, they may behold the <i>light</i> of God.
It may therefore be summed up in this manner: "Even <i>in darkness</i>, nay, in
<i>death</i> itself, there is nevertheless good ground of hope; for the power of
God is sufficient to restore life to his people, when they appear to be already
dead." Matthew, who quotes this passage, appears to torture it to a different
meaning; for he says that this prediction was fulfilled when Christ preached
along the sea-coast.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
4:16.) But if we take a just view of the comparison, it will be found that
Matthew has applied this passage to Christ correctly, and in its true meaning.
Yet it does not appear that the view generally given by our commentators is a
successful elucidation of the passage; for they merely assert that it belongs to
the kingdom of Christ, but do not assign a reason, or show how it accords with
this passage. If, therefore, we wish to ascertain the true meaning of this
passage, we must bring to our recollection what has been already stated, that
the Prophet, when he speaks of bringing back the people from Babylon, does not
look to a single age, but includes all the rest, till Christ came and brought
the most complete deliverance to his people. The deliverance from Babylon was
but a prelude to the restoration of the Church, and was intended to last, not
for a few years only, but till Christ should come and bring true salvation, not
only to their bodies, but likewise to their souls. When we shall have made a
little progress in reading Isaiah, we shall find that this was his ordinary
custom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Having spoken of the captivity in
Babylon, which held out the prospect of a very heavy calamity, he shows that
this calamity will be <i>lighter</i> than that which Israel formerly endured;
because the Lord had fixed a term and limit to that calamity, namely, <i>seventy
years</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:11, 12; 29:10,) after the expiration of which the <i>light</i> of the Lord
would shine on them. By this confident hope of deliverance, therefore, he
encourages their hearts when overpowered by fear, that they might not be
distressed beyond measure; and thus he made a distinction between the Jews and
the Israelites, to whom the expectation of a deliverance so near was not
promised. Though the Prophets had given to the elect remnant some taste of the
mercy of God, yet, in consequence of the redemption of Israel being, as it were,
an addition to the redemption of Judah, and dependent on it, justly does the
Prophet now declare that a new <i>light</i> has been exhibited; because God hath
determined to redeem his people. Appropriately and skilfully, too, does Matthew
extend the rays of <i>light</i> to <i>Galilee</i> and <i>the land of
Zebulun</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
4:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the land of the
shadow of death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now compares the captivity
in Babylon to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>death</i>; for those who were kept there, were wretched and miserable,
and altogether like dead men; as Ezekiel also relates their
speech,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Dead men shall arise out
of the graves.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;263711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
37:11, 12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Their condition, therefore, was such as if no
brightness, no ray of <i>light</i>, had shone on them. Yet he shows that this
will not prevent them from enjoying <i>light</i>, and recovering their former
liberty; and that liberty he extends, not to a short period, but, as we have
already said, to the time of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus it is
customary with the Apostles to borrow arguments from the Prophets, and to show
their real use and design. In this manner Paul quotes
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450925&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:25) that passage from Hosea,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I will call them my
people which were not my
people,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
2:23,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and applies it to the calling of the Gentiles, though
strictly it was spoken of the Jews; and he shows that it was fulfilled when the
Lord brought the Gentiles into the Church. Thus, when the people might be said
to be buried in that captivity, they differed in no respect from the Gentiles;
and since both were in the same condition, it is reasonable to believe that this
passage relates, not only to the Jews, but to the Gentiles also. Nor must it be
viewed as referring to outward misery only, but to the <i>darkness</i> of
eternal <i>death</i>, in which souls are plunged, till they come forth to
spiritual light; for unquestionably we lie buried in <i>darkness</i>, till
Christ shine on us by the doctrine of his word. Hence also Paul
exhorts,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Awake thou that sleepest,
and arise from the dead,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and Christ
shall give thee light.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
5:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If therefore we extend the commencement of the
deliverance from the return from Babylon down to the coming of Christ, on whom
all liberty and all bestowal of blessings depends, we shall understand the true
meaning of this passage, which otherwise has not been satisfactorily explained
by
commentators.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thou hast multiplied.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage is somewhat
obscure, both in itself, and on account of the diversity of interpretations; for
it appears to be absurd to say that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the joy was not

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
21:8.) The Jews do this, because they cannot reconcile the words of the Prophet
with their opinion. Again, some view these words as referring to Sennacherib,
because his army, though it was large, brought him no ground of <i>joy</i>, but
rather of grief.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35.) Others explain it as relating to the Church, and justly, but
mistake the method of applying it; for they think that the Prophet said this
because believers, as long as they live, are subject to numerous and diversified
afflictions. Others go still farther from the point, by saying that the
conversion of the Gentiles, which will enlarge the Church,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will not</i> <i>bring
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to the Jews and the ancient
synagogue.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I cannot approve of any of those
interpretations, and therefore I interpret it in this manner. As the Prophet, in
the beginning of the chapter, had made a preliminary statement, that this
blessing of redemption was greater than all other blessings, though it might
appear to be unworthy of being so highly extolled, on account of the small
number of those who were redeemed; so now he repeats the same comparison, or one
not very different from it, namely, that this favor of God would be more
remarkable than when he had formerly <i>multiplied</i> his people. This might at
first sight be thought to be highly inappropriate; for if we compare the
condition of the Jewish kingdom, before the Babylonish captivity, with its
condition after the return from it, we may be led to think that the period
during which its ancient possession remained unimpaired was a season of greater
prosperity. It was but a small remnant that returned in comparison of that
multitude which had been carried away. Besides, they had not the free possession
of their land, but might be said to be tenants at will; and they had to pay
tribute to the Persians, and retained hardly any semblance of their former rank.
Who, therefore, would not have preferred that prosperous reign which had been
enjoyed by the family of David to that
condition?</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet declares that this
latter condition, though it may appear to be greatly inferior, and even more
wretched, ought to be preferred to that which was prosperous and splendid, and
shows that it will yield greater <i>joy</i> than when they had an abundant share
of wealth and of all kinds of possessions. This was also testified by
Haggai,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that the glory of the
latter temple would be greater</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">than
the glory of the former,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;370209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Haggai
2:9,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">though at first sight it might appear to be far
otherwise. It is as if Isaiah had said, "There never was greater joy, though the
multitude of the people was greater. Though we are few and contemptible in
number, yet by the light with which thou shinest on us thou hast cheered us to
such a degree that no joy of our former condition can be compared with the
present." For that redemption might be regarded as a prelude to the full and
perfect salvation which was at length obtained through
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the <i>joy</i> was true and
complete, not slight or temporary. Men often rejoice, but with a deceitful and
transitory <i>joy</i>, which is followed by mourning and tears. He affirms that
this <i>joy</i> has its roots so deeply laid, that it can never perish or be
destroyed. Such is also the import of the phrase <i>before thee</i>; for nothing
cheers the godly so much as when the face of God shines sweetly on them. They
are not like irreligious men, who are carried hither and thither by a blind and
uncertain <i>joy</i>, but they have that which alone gives ground for full joy,
their reliance on God's fatherly kindness. Perhaps also the Prophet intended to
allude to those words which frequently occur in the writings of Moses: <i>Thou
shalt rejoice</i> <i>before the Lord thy God</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032340&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
23:40;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:12,18.) For though the subject there spoken of is the Tabernacle, still the
mode of expression is fitly applied to the present occasion, that the <i>joy</i>
of a believing people will not be irreligious, but will arise from acknowledging
God, and beholding him by the eyes of faith to be <i>the</i> <i>author of
salvation</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others explain it more ingeniously, that
inwardly believers rejoice <i>before God</i> in their consciences, because in
the world grief and sighing continually awaits them. Though this is true, yet a
more natural meaning is drawn from the connection of the passage, namely, that
believers whom God shall redeem will possess true <i>joy</i>; because they will
have been instructed by undoubted proof that he is their Father, so that they
may freely boast that they will always be safe under his guidance; and,
therefore, as I lately mentioned, it denotes
continuance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the
spoils.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The comparisons of <i>Harvest</i> and
<i>Victory</i>, by which he heightens the amount of the joy, are sufficiently
plain. Now, hence it is evident what Christ brings to us, namely, a full and
perfect joy, of which we cannot in any way be robbed or deprived, though various
storms and tempests should arise, and though we should be weighed down by every
kind of afflictions. However weak and feeble we may be, still we ought to be
glad and joyful; for the ground of our joy does not lie in numbers, or wealth,
or outward splendor, but in spiritual happiness, which we obtain through the
word of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast
broken his burdensome yoke.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He explains the
cause of <i>the joy</i>, that believers, when they have been delivered from a
frightful and cruel tyranny, will feel as if they had been rescued from death.
In order to illustrate the grace of God, he reminds them how shameful and
burdensome was the slavery with which the Jews had been oppressed and afflicted;
and this is his object in heaping up the expressions,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the yoke of the shoulder, the
staff of the shoulder, the rod of the oppressor</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or <i>overseer</i>. Whatever may be our excessive effeminacy or cowardice, while
we actually feel afflictions, yet as soon as they are gone, we easily come to
forget them. That the redeemed people may not think lightly of the favor of God,
the Prophet bids them consider how bitter and mournful was the slavery, when
they groaned under a heavy <i>yoke</i> or triumphal car, when the <i>staff</i>
was laid on their shoulders, and they were oppressed by tyrannical rule; and
therefore their deliverance ought justly to make them more glad and
joyful.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next, he extolls the excellence of this
favor on another ground, that God has openly displayed his hand from heaven. For
this purpose he adduces an ancient and memorable instance. As God had formerly
overthrown the Midianites, without the help of men, by a wonderful and amazing
method,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;070702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
7:21,) so now there will be a similar and illustrious display of power; for God
will deliver his people from a cruel tyranny, when not one of the wretched Jews
will venture to lift a finger. Now, it ought to be observed that God sometimes
assists his people in such a manner as to make use of ordinary methods; but when
he sees that this hinders men from beholding his hand, which may be said to be
concealed, he sometimes works alone, and by evident miracles, that nothing may
prevent or obscure the manifestation of his power. Thus in this victory of
Gideon, when the enemies were routed without any agency of men, the arm of God
openly appeared. For what had Gideon but the noise of pitchers, which could
scarcely have driven away mice, and a small band of men, against a vast army,
and, instead of weapons, a useless scarecrow? To this deliverance, therefore, he
compares the future deliverance of the people, in which the hand of God will be
not less openly and illustriously
displayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some explain this passage as relating
merely to the law, which might not inappropriately have been called <i>a
burdensome yoke</i>, and <i>a rod</i> lying on the shoulders. But that
interpretation is unsuitable; for it would give to the Prophet the appearance of
having suddenly broken off from his subject, and would be a violent torture of
this passage. We must therefore attend to that arrangement which I formerly
noticed, namely, that when God brought his people out of Babylon, he continued
that blessing of deliverance till Christ. The meaning therefore is, "Thou hast
broken those burdens by which thy people were unjustly and cruelly
oppressed."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others apply it to the destruction
of Jerusalem during the reign of Vespasian, but they have no argument on their
side. Almost all the Jews refer it to Hezekiah, when in this manner the Lord
delivered the city from the siege of Sennacherib, and cut off his army.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) But that interpretation could not be admitted, for Hezekiah did not
reign tyrannically over the Jews. Besides, at that time the Lord rescued the
people from fear and danger, and not from slavery. Hence it is evident that this
prediction had a more distant object, and that the interpretation which I have
given to this passage is just and
reasonable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For every
battle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here commentators are nearly agreed
that Isaiah intended to contrast the victory which God was about to give to his
people with other victories. Others conquer by making a great slaughter of the
enemies, but here the Lord will conquer by his own hand alone. He expresses more
fully what he had said, <i>As in the day of</i> <i>Midian</i>. (Verse 4.) The
Lord therefore, he says, will not employ the agency of a great multitude, but
will achieve a victory for himself from heaven. When the Lord acts by himself,
every covering is removed, and we perceive more clearly that he is the Author of
our life and salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, since there is a
contrast which expresses the difference between the ordinary mode of warfare and
the miracle of redemption, the copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>vau</i>,) in the middle of the verse, ought to be rendered <i>but</i>; as if
he had said, that it is usually amidst the confusion of the battle that enemies
are hewn down: but God will act in a very different manner; for he will destroy
the enemies of the Church, as if he sent down lightning from heaven, or suddenly
struck them by thunderbolts. It may perhaps be thought better to adopt the
opinion of those who explain the second clause as a continuation of the first,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all warriors will be with
trembling and with burning fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But the former
meaning is more appropriate, and is likewise supported by the words of the
Prophet. Hence it is evident that the present subject is not merely the
deliverance which the people obtained from Cyrus, permitting them to return to
their native country, but that these words must be viewed as extending to the
kingdom of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For unto us a child is
born.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now argues from the design, to
show why this deliverance ought to be preferred to the rest of God's benefits,
namely, because not only will God bring back the people from captivity, but he
will place Christ on his royal throne, that under him supreme and everlasting
happiness may be enjoyed. Thus he affirms that the kindness of God will not be
temporary, for it includes the whole of that intermediate period during which
the Church was preserved till the coming of Christ. Nor is it wonderful if the
Prophet makes a sudden transition from the return of the ancient people to the
full restoration of the Church, which took place many centuries afterwards; for
in our observations on Isaiah 7:14,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we have remarked, that there being no
other way that God is reconciled to us than through the Mediator, all the
promises are founded on him; and that on this account it is customary with the
Prophets, whenever they wish to encourage the hearts of believers by good hope,
to bring this forward as a pledge or earnest. To this must be added, that the
return from the captivity in Babylon was the commencement of the renovation of
the Church, which was completed when Christ appeared; and consequently there is
no absurdity in an uninterrupted succession. Justly, therefore, does Isaiah
teach that they ought not to confine their attention to the present benefit, but
should consider the end, and refer everything to it. "This is your highest
happiness, that you have been rescued from death, not only that you may live in
the land of Canaan, but that you may arrive at the kingdom of
God."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn that we ought not to
swallow up the benefits which we receive from God, so as instantly to forget
them, but should raise our minds to Christ, otherwise the advantage will be
small, and the joy will be transitory; because they will not lead us to taste
the sweetness of a Father's love, unless we keep in remembrance the free
election of God, which is ratified in Christ. In short, the Prophet does not
wish that this people should be wholly occupied with the joy occasioned by the
outward and short-lived freedom which they had obtained, but that they should
look at the end, that is, at the preservation of the Church, till Christ, the
only Redeemer, should appear; for he ought to be the ground and perfection of
all our joy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A child is
born.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Jews impudently torture this passage,
for they interpret it as relating to Hezekiah, though he had been born before
this prediction was uttered. But he speaks of it as something new and
unexpected; and it is even a promise, intended to arouse believers to the
expectation of a future event; and therefore there can be no hesitation in
concluding that he describes <i>a child</i> that was afterwards to be
<i>born</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He is called the <i>Son</i> of God.
Although in the Hebrew language the word <i>son</i>, I admit, has a wide
acceptation, yet that is when something is added to it. Every man is the
<i>son</i> of his father: those who are a hundred years old are called
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:20) <i>the sons of a hundred</i> <i>years</i>; wicked men are called <i>the
sons of wickedness</i>; those who are blessed are called <i>the sons of
blessing</i>; and Isaiah called a fruitful hill <i>the son of fatness</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:1.) But <i>son</i>, without any addition, can mean none else than <i>the Son
of God</i>; and it is now ascribed to Christ, by way of eminence,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,) in order to inform us, that by this
striking mark he is distinguished from the rest of mankind. Nor can it be
doubted that Isaiah referred to that well-known prediction, which was in the
mouth of every person,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I will be his Father, and
he shall be my
Son,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Samuel 7:14,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">as it is afterwards repeated,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Thou art my Son; this day
have I begotten
thee.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
2:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Had it not been commonly and generally known that the
Messiah would be the <i>Son</i> of God, it would have been foolish and unmeaning
for Isaiah simply to call him <i>the Son</i>. Accordingly, this title is derived
from the former prediction, from which the Apostle reasons, that the excellence
of Christ exalts him above all the angels.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:5.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, though in the person of <i>a
child</i> Christ might have a mean appearance, still the designation of
<i>Son</i> points out his high rank. Yet I do not deny that he might have been
called the <i>Son</i> of David, but it is more natural to apply it to him as
God. The titles which follow are still less applicable to Hezakiah. I shall soon
give an ample refutation of the sophistry by which the Jews attempt to evade
this passage. Let them slander as they may, the matter is sufficient plain to
all who will calmly and soberly examine
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A Son hath been given to
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is weight in what he now adds, that
this <i>Son</i> was <i>given</i> to the people, in order to inform the Jews that
their salvation and that of the whole Church is contained in the person of
Christ. And this <i>giving</i> is one of the chief articles of our faith; for it
would have been of little avail to us, that Christ was <i>born</i>, if he had
not likewise been our own. What this <i>child</i> will be, and what is his rank,
he declares in the following
statements.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the government
hath been laid upon his shoulder.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To suppose,
as some do, that this is an allusion to the cross of Christ is manifestly
childish. Christ <i>carried the cross</i> on his shoulders,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:17,) and by the cross he gained a splendid triumph over <i>the prince of this
world</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:30.) But as <i>the</i> <i>government</i> is here said to have been <i>laid on
his shoulders</i> in the same sense in which we shall see that <i>the key of the
house of David</i> <i>was laid on the shoulders</i> of Eliakim,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
22:22,) we need not go far to seek ingenious expositions. Yet I agree with those
who think that there is an indirect contrast between
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
government</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which the Redeemer
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bore on his
shoulders</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and <i>the staff of the shoulder</i>
which was just now mentioned; for it agrees well, and is not liable to any
objections. He therefore shows that the Messiah will be different from indolent
kings, who leave off business and cares, and live at their ease; for he will be
able to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear the
burden</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> Thus he asserts the superiority and
grandeur of his government, because by his own power Christ will obtain homage
to himself, and he will discharge his office, not only with the tips of his
fingers, but with his full
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his name shall
be called.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arqy</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>yikra</i>,) <i>he</i> <i>shall call</i>, be an active verb, I have not
hesitated to translate it in a passive sense; for the meaning is the same as if
he had made use of the plural number, <i>they shall call</i>. We have a French
idiom that resembles it, <i>on appellera</i>, literally, <i>one shall call</i>,
that is, <i>he shall be called</i>. The Jews apply it to God, and read it
continously, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall call his
name Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince
of Peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But it is very evident that this
proceeds from a desire, or rather from a licentious eagerness, to obscure the
glory of Christ; for if they had not labored with excessive keenness to rob him
of his Godhead, the passage would run on very smoothly as interpreted by our
divines. Besides, what necessity was there for ascribing to God those
attributes, if the Prophet meant nothing more than that God gave a name to
Messiah? For the attributes which are usually ascribed to God are either
perpetual or accommodated to the case in hand, neither of which suppositions can
here be admitted. Again, it would have been an interruption of the regular order
to insert the name of God in the midst of various titles, but it ought to have
run thus, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mighty God,
Wonderful, Counsellor, shall call.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now, I do
not see how the name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">x[wy</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yognetz</i>) can be applied absolutely to God, for it belongs to
<i>counsellors</i> who attend kings or other persons. If any obstinate wrangler
shall contend for the notion of the Rabbins, he will show nothing but his own
impudence. Let us follow the plain and natural
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wonderful.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
It ought to be observed that those titles are not foreign to the subject, but
are adapted to the case in hand, for the Prophet describes what Christ will show
himself to be towards believers. He does not speak of Christ's mysterious
essence, but applauds his excellencies, which we perceive and experience by
faith. This ought to be the more carefully considered, because the greater part
of men are satisfied with his mere name, and do not observe his power and
energy, though that ought to be chiefly
regarded.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the first title he arouses the
minds of the godly to earnest attention, that they may expect from Christ
something more excellent than what we see in the ordinary course of God's works,
as if he had said, that <i>in Christ are hidden</i> the invaluable
<i>treasures</i> of <i>wonderful</i> things.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3.) And, indeed, the redemption which he has brought surpasses even the
creation of the world. It amounts to this, that the grace of God, which will be
exhibited in Christ, exceeds all
miracles.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Counselor.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
The reason of this second title is, that the Redeemer will come endowed with
absolute wisdom. Now, let us remember what I have just noticed, that the Prophet
does not here reason about the hidden essence of Christ, but about the power
which he displays towards us. It is not, therefore, because he knows all his
Father's secrets that the Prophet calls him <i>Counsellor</i>, but rather
because, <i>proceeding from</i> <i>the bosom of the Father</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:18,) he is in every respect the highest and most perfect teacher. In like
manner we are not permitted to get wisdom but from his Gospel, and this
contributes also to the praise of the Gospel, for it contains the perfect wisdom
of God, as Paul frequently shows.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:24, 30;

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:9.) All that is necessary for salvation is opened up by Christ in such a
manner, and explained with such familiarity, that he addresses the disciples
<i>no</i> <i>longer as servants but as friends</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>El</i>) is one of the names of God, though derived from <i>strength</i>, so
that it is sometimes added as an attribute. But here it is evidently a proper
name, because Isaiah is not satisfied with it, and in addition to it employs the
adjective
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwbg</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gibbor</i>,) which means <i>strong</i>. And indeed if Christ had not been
<i>God</i>, it would have been unlawful to glory in him; for it is
written,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Cursed be he that

<div><font face="Palatino">We must, therefore, meet with the majesty of God in

attributed to a creature.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He is, therefore,

called <i>Immanuel</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:14.) For if we find in Christ nothing but the flesh and nature of man, our
glorying will be foolish and vain, and our hope will rest on au uncertain and
insecure foundation; but if he shows himself to be to us <i>God</i> and
<i>the</i> <i>mighty God</i>, we may now rely on him with safety. With good
reason does he call him <i>strong</i> or <i>mighty</i>, because our contest is
with the devil, death, and sin,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:12,) enemies too powerful and strong, by whom we would be immediately
vanquished, if the <i>strength</i> of Christ had not rendered us invincible.
Thus we learn from this title that there is in Christ abundance of protection
for defending our salvation, so that we desire nothing beyond him; for he is
<i>God</i>, who is pleased to show himself <i>strong</i> on our behalf. This
application may be regarded as the key to this and similar passages, leading us
to distinguish between Christ's mysterious essence and the power by which he
hath revealed himself to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The father of the

F134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, in my opinion, the translation is
correct, for it denotes <i>eternity</i>, unless it be thought better to view it
as denoting "perpetual duration," or "an endless succession of ages," lest any
one should improperly limit it to the heavenly life, which is still
<i>hidden</i> from us.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

order to bestow immortality on his people; but as believers, even in this world,
<i>pass</i> <i>from death to life</i>,

Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The name <i>Father</i> is put for
<i>Author</i>, because Christ preserves the existence of his Church through all
ages, and bestows immortality on the body and on the individual members. Hence
we conclude how transitory our condition is, apart from him; for, granting that
we were to live for a very long period after the ordinary manner of men, what
after all will be the value of our long life? We ought, therefore, to elevate
our minds to that blessed and everlasting life, <i>which as yet we see not</i>,
but which we possess <i>by hope and faith</i>.

Peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the last title, and the Prophet
declares by it that the coming of Christ will be the cause of full and perfect
happiness, or, at least, of calm and blessed safety. In the Hebrew language
<i>peace</i> often signifies <i>prosperity</i>, for of all blessings not one is
better or more desirable than <i>peace</i>. The general meaning is, that all who
submit to the dominion of Christ will lead a quiet and blessed life in obedience
to him. Hence it follows that life, without this King, is restless and
miserable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we must also take into
consideration the nature of this <i>peace</i>. It is the same with that of the
kingdom, for it resides chiefly in the consciences; otherwise we must be engaged
in incessant conflicts and liable to daily attacks. Not only, therefore, does he
promise outward <i>peace</i>, but that peace by which we return to a state of
favor with God, who were formerly at enmity with him. <i>Justified by faith</i>,
says Paul, <i>we have peace with God</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

3:15,) so that we will patiently endure every kind of adversity, and from the
same fountain will likewise flow outward prosperity, which is nothing else than
the effect of the blessing of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, to apply
this for our own instruction, whenever any distrust arises, and all means of
escape are taken away from us, whenever, in short, it appears to us that
everything is in a ruinous condition, let us recall to our remembrance that
Christ is called <i>Wonderful</i>, because he has inconceivable methods of
assisting us, and because his power is far beyond what we are able to conceive.
When we need counsel, let us remember that he is the <i>Counsellor</i>. When we
need strength, let us remember that he is <i>Mighty</i> and <i>Strong</i>. When
new terrors spring up suddenly every instant, and when many deaths threaten us
from various quarters, let us rely on that <i>eternity</i> of which he is with
good reason called the Father, and by the same comfort let us learn to soothe
all temporal distresses. When we are inwardly tossed by various tempests, and
when Satan attempts to disturb our consciences, let us remember that Christ is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Prince of
Peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that it is easy for him quickly to
allay all our uneasy feelings. Thus will these titles confirm us more and more
in the faith of Christ, and fortify us against Satan and against hell
itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>

now speaks, consists of two parts. It belongs both to time and to quality.
Though the kingdom of Christ is in such a condition that it appears as if it
were about to perish at every moment, yet God not only protects and defends it,
but also extends its boundaries far and wide, and then preserves and carries it
forward in uninterrupted progression to <i>eternity</i>. We ought firmly to
believe this, that the frequency of those shocks by which the Church is shaken
may not weaken our faith, when we learn that, amidst the mad outcry and violent
attacks of enemies, the <i>kingdom</i> of Christ stands firm through the
invincible power of God, so that, though the whole world should oppose and
resist, it will remain through all ages. We must not judge of its stability from
the present appearances of things, but from the promise, which assures us of its

increase.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to the

is impossible that Christ should be <i>King</i> without also keeping his people
in calm and blessed <i>peace</i>, and enriching them with every blessing. But as
they are daily exposed to innumerable vexations, endure fierce attacks, and are
tossed and perplexed by fears and anxieties, they ought to cultivate that

by which the Jewish people should be oppressed till the coming of Christ. Others
think that that nation, on account of its treachery, was escluded by this mark
from having any share in this <i>kingdom</i>. I do not find fault with these
views. Indeed, we can hardly assert that the Prophet wrote it in this manner;
but yet, since this is the form in which it has come into our hands, and since
the Rabbins were so close observers of the minutest portion of a letter, we
cannot avoid thinking that this was not rashly done. And if we admit that the
Prophet intentionally wrote it in this manner, I think that it conveyed this
useful instruction, that believers should not imagine that the splendor of
Christ's kingdom would consist in outward pomp, or cherish vain hopes of worldly
triumphs, but should only expect, amidst various calamities, an unseen extension
of the kingdom, because it had been
promised.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon the throne of

<i>David</i> that the Redeemer would spring from his seed,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:12,13,) and his kingdom having been nothing else than an image or faint
shadow of that more perfect and truly blessed state which God had determined to
establish by the hand of his Son, the Prophets, in order to remind the people of
that remarkable miracle, usually call Christ <i>the Son of</i> <i>David</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:5, 33:15.) Though the name of such a holy and upright king was justly beloved
and revered, yet believers esteemed more highly the promised restoration to full
salvation, and even among the most ignorant persons that prediction was
universally remembered, and its truth and authenticity were considered to be
clear and undoubted. I shall collect but a few of the passages in which the
Prophets promise to an afflicted people restoration in the person of
<i>David</i> or of <i>his</i> <i>Son</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243009&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

3:5.) Sometimes they foretell that <i>David</i>, who was already dead, would be
king. In like manner Isaiah, in this passage, intimates that he brings forward
nothing that is new, but only reminds them of that which God had formerly
promised about the perpetuity of <i>the kingdom</i>. Indirectly also he
insinuates what Amoz more plainly states, that Christ will</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">again raise up the throne
which for some time had been fallen.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To order it, and to establish it
with judgment and with righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He
describes the quality of <i>the kingdom</i>, but by a comparison drawn from
earthly governments; for he says that Christ will be a King,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to order and establish his
kingdom with judgment and with righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
These are the means by which earthly governments prosper and take deep roots;
but those which are only administered by fear and violence cannot be lasting.
Since, therefore, <i>justice</i> is the best guardian of <i>kingdoms</i> and
<i>governments</i>, and since the happiness of the whole of the people depends
on it, by this clause Isaiah shows that the <i>kingdom</i> of Christ will be the
model of the best kind of
<i>government</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">

do not here relate to outward affairs of state. We must observe the analogy
between the kingdom of Christ and its qualities; for, being spiritual, it is
established by the power of the Holy Spirit. In a word, all these things must be
viewed as referring to the inner man, that is, when we are regenerated by God to
true <i>righteousness</i>. Outward <i>righteousness</i> indeed follows
afterwards, but it must be preceded by that renovation of the mind and heart. We
are not Christ's, therefore, unless we follow what is good and just, and bear on
our hearts the impress of that <i>righteousness</i> which hath been sealed by
the Holy Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Henceforth

think, to refer to the perpetuity of

and doctrine rather than of <i>the kingdom</i>, lest we should imagine that his
laws resemble the statutes of kings and princes, which are in force for three
days, or for a short period, and are continually renewed, and soon become old
again, but that we may know that their obligation is everlasting; for they have
been established, as Zecharias says,</font><br></div>

hindered its redemption. When we engage in any difficult undertaking, our
earnestness, and the warmth of our feelings, overcome the difficulties which
present themselves to baffle or retard our attempts. In like manner Isaiah shows
that God is inflamed with an uncommon and extraordinary desire to promote the
salvation of the Church, so that if believers cannot measure by their own
capacity what he has just now promised, still they ought not to cease to
entertain confident hope, for the manner of it is wonderful and inconceivable.
In short, he intimates that God will come with no light or slow arm to redeem
his Church, for he will be all on flame with amazing love of believers, and
anxiety about their
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The Lord hath sent a word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he relates a
new prediction, for I think that this discourse is separated from the former,
because the Prophet now returns to speak of the future condition of the kingdom
of <i>Israel</i>, which was at that time hostile to the Jews. Now, we know that
the Jews had good reason for being alarmed at the forces and power of that
kingdom, especially when it had made a league with the Syrians, because they saw
that they had not sufficient strength to oppose them. In order, therefore, to
yield comfort to the godly, he shows what will be the future condition of the
kingdom of <i>Israel</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By <i>Jacob</i> and
<i>Israel</i> he means the same thing; but the diversity of expression is
elegant, and is intended to show that the wicked gain nothing by their
opposition, when they endeavor either to turn away from them, or to alter the
judgment of God. He alludes to the speech of those who think that they can
escape by means of their witticisms, and who turn into jest and sport all that
is threatened by the Prophets; just as if one were to attempt to drive away a
storm by the breath of his mouth. It is, therefore, an ironical admission, as if
he had said, "In your opinion, what God pronounces against you will fall on
others; but all the threatenings which he utters against <i>Jacob</i> will
<i>light upon</i> <i>Israel</i>."</font><br><font face="Palatino">To <i>send</i>
means to appoint. The preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>beth</i>) means in <i>Jacob himself</i>. The word of God must dwell and rest
<i>in him</i>, for it cannot vanish away without producing any effect. This is
what he afterwards lays down in other words,
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My word shall not return to me
void</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, because it is an effectual
publication of that which I have once decreed."

55:11.) By the word, <i>it hath
fallen</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he points out the certainty of the
effect and result; as if he had said, "I do not conjecture these things, nor do
I contrive them out of my own head; but God hath spoken, who cannot be deceived,
and cannot change."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the people shall
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word <i>people</i> I understand,
not the Jews, but rather the Israelites; and, indeed, the Prophet removes doubt
by expressly naming <i>Ephraim</i>. He likewise adds <i>Samaria</i>, which was
the metropolis of that <i>people</i>, or of the ten tribes; for fortified
cities, conceiving themselves to be placed beyond the reach of danger, are much
more insolent in their pretensions. They think that they will always have the
remedy in their hands by capitulating with the enemy, though the whole country
were laid waste. On this account Isaiah threatens that they will not be exempted
from the general calamity. He says that all will feel that the predictions which
were uttered by the mouth of God will not be without effect. By the word
<i>know</i>, which relates to actual experience, he indirectly reproves their
unbelief; as if he had said, "Since I speak to the deaf, and you set no value on
the warnings which I now address to you, the actual event will teach you, but
too late."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet attacks the obstinacy and
rebellion of that people, because, though they had once and again been chastised
by God's scourges, and that sharply, they were so far from repentance that they
reckoned their losses to be gain, and became more hardened. Assuredly they who
thus insolently mock at God are not brought to obedience without being reduced
to utter weakness. Now, such an insult openly and avowedly provokes God's anger,
and therefore the Prophet says that it proceeds from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the haughtiness and pride of the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence it follows that it is right to
apply to knotty timber chisels that are harder
still.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The bricks are fallen
down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These are the words of men who were
obstinate, and who despised the calamity which they had sustained, as if it had
been of advantage to them, because it afforded them an opportunity of adorning
with greater splendor both their houses and their fields. "<i>We shall
build</i>," they say, "<i>more magnificently</i>. The brick houses have been
thrown down that we may dwell in splendid palaces; and since the trees have been
cut down, we shall plant more fruitful ones." This was not the fault of a single
age, for at this day we see the same obstinacy in the world. How many are the
distresses with which Europe has been afflicted for thirty or forty years? How
many are the chastisements by which she has been called to repentance? And yet
it does not appear that those numerous chastisements have done any good. On the
contrary, luxury increases every day, lawless passions are inflamed, and men go
on in crimes and profligacy more shamelessly than ever. In short, those very
calamities appear to have been so many excitements to luxury and splendor. What
then should we expect but to be bruised with heavier
blows?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord will set up the
adversaries of Rezin against him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
Israelites having been proud of their alliance with the king of Syria, and
hoping that everything would succeed to their wish, Isaiah threatens a new
change which will take away all their hope and utterly frustrate their designs,
for the Assyrians afterwards took arms and waged war with the Syrians.
Accordingly, when <i>Rezin</i> had been slain,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:9,) that country was entirely ruined. Still more does he heighten this,
by adding, <i>he shall mingle</i>;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he means that the Lord will gather
together and <i>mingle</i> various enemies whom he will commission to destroy
the king of Syria, as the soldiers who composed the army of that vast monarchy
were collected out of various
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Syria in front.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet shows what will be the
nature of this change, and what will happen after the death of <i>Rezin</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:9,) who had allied himself with Israel against Judah; namely, that
<i>the Syrians</i>, after the death of their king, from being allies will
suddenly become enemies, and will make war against Israel, which took place.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 17:3.) This is what he means when he says that <i>Syria</i> will be <i>in
front</i>; for I do not agree with those expositors who make <i>Syria</i> to
mean "those on the East," and <i>the</i> <i>Philistines</i> "those on the West."
A more natural meaning is, that the enemies will invade them on every side;
because on all sides they who had been regarded as faithful friends will rise up
to destroy them. The phrases <i>in front</i> and <i>behind</i> agree with the
ordinary modes of speaking, so that we ought not to seek an interpretation that
is new and foreign to the purpose.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this
example we ought to learn what it is to rely on human power and the alliances of
kings, and especially when, in consequence of being entangled by unlawful
covenants, we become careless and fall asleep; for as soon as the Lord pleases,
they who were formerly on our side will, in the smallest portion of time, be
turned against us to our ruin; and remedies, which we thought would be useful to
us will prove to be our destruction, and will assist us both <i>before</i> and
<i>behind</i>. We ought also to observe that God does not all at once expend all
his scourges, but when we proceed obstinately, and provoke him more and more, he
increases and multiplies the chastisements, and still inflicts a new kind of
punishment, till at length he subdues our obstinacy and
rebellion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will devour

is equivalent to an ordinary idiom of our own, (<i>a pleine bouche</i>,) <i>with
full mouth</i>. As if he had said, "Israel will be exposed as a prey to her
enemies, so that on every hand she will be devoured <i>with open mouth</i>, both
by the Syrians and by the
Philistines."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His anger is not
turned away. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the severest of all, and
beyond everything else ought to have terrified the ungodly, that if they had
suffered much, they have more to endure; that new punishments continually await
them, because by going on in their obstinacy they inflame still more the wrath
of God. Men take this as an incentive to more obstinate and determined
wickedness, that, having suffered some punishment, they think that they have
nothing more to suffer, and become more hardened. They do not even believe that
they are any longer exposed to the judgment of God, who has already spent his
rods; and as if they were altogether out of his power, they give themselves
greater indulgence, and shake off every
yoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But his hand is
stretched out still.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What we have now stated is
the reason why Isaiah threatens that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hand of the Lord is still
stretched out</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they may not think that
they have escaped that <i>hand</i>. Now, this is said not for the purpose of
instructing, but of accusing, though the threatenings have also a tendency to
make doctrine better understood; but as he had to do with obstinate men, on whom
no chastisement produced any good effect, he therefore announces that the
chastisements are not yet at an end; and that, although God has for a time
discontinued those chastisements, still he has not dispensed with them, but has
<i>his hand lifted up</i> to inflict a new
wound.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

(<i>vau</i>) is rendered by some interpreters <i>for</i>, as if the Prophet were
assigning a reason why the Lord does not cease to employ his scourges in the
continual infliction of chastisements; that is, because <i>the people</i> are so
hardened and obstinate that they will not repent. When there is no repentance,
it is unreasonable to expect that God will yield to obstinate men, as if he were
vanquished; and the consequence is, that he prepares himself for inflicting
severer punishment. Since, therefore, no chastisements had produced any
amendment in Israel, he must perish; for when they had been so frequently struck
and punished, and did not at all repent, this was a proof of the most desperate
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is a very severe rebuke, that
although the Lord not only admonishes us by words, but actually pushes us
forward, and constrains us by various chastisements, still we grow hardened, and
do not suffer ourselves to be drawn away from our crimes and our lusts.
Desperate wickedness is thus evinced, and nothing more heinous could be spoken
or conceived. It is a heinous offense, when men do not receive instruction as
soon as it is delivered to them; it is more heinous, when they are not affected
by rebukes; it is the most heinous of all, when, in spite even of chastisements,
they grow hardened, and even kick, or by their headstrong behavior inflame still
more the indignation of the Judge, and do not consider why they were punished,
or what it is to which the Lord calls them. Accordingly, when no remedies
produce any good effect, what must we think but that the disease is incurable
and utterly desperate?</font><br><font face="Palatino">This rebuke applies not
to the Israelites only but to us also. Already hath the Lord chastised the whole
world by various afflictions, so that hardly any part could be exempted from
distresses and calamities. And yet all appear to have obstinately conspired
against God, so that, whatever He does, they cease not to retain their former
character, and to carry on their wicked courses. Justly, therefore, might the
Lord address to us the same expostulation, and assuredly he addresses us by the
mouth of Isaiah; and we ought not to look for another Prophet to threaten new
chastisements, seeing that our case is not different from that of the
Israelites, and we are involved in the same blame with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor have they sought the
Lord of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is immediately added as an
explanation, for the reason why God inflicts punishment is, to bring back the
wanderers to himself. By this method, indeed, he appears to drive men to a
greater distance from him; but as it belongs to him to bring out of the grave
those whom he appeared to have wounded and slain, by terrifying sinners he only
humbles them, in order that they may return to him. And indeed the beginning of
conversion is to <i>seek God</i>, or rather it is the only rule of living well;
if we turn aside from it we have no rest for the sole of our foot. But we must
now inquire what it is to <i>seek God</i>, or in what manner we ought to <i>seek
him</i>; for hypocrites will always be ready to plead, that by prayers and
fastings, and tears, and a sorrowful countenance, they earnestly entreat God and
implore forgiveness. But God chooses to be <i>sought</i> in another manner; that
is, when the sinner truly subdued, willingly takes the yoke which he had shaken
off, and yields obedience to him whom he had
despised.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore the Lord will cut
off from Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He intimates that God's
vengeance will be universal, and will involve all ranks; for the whole nation
was corrupted, and the contagion had spread over the whole country, to such an
extent that no part was left whole or sound. Now, when iniquity thus abounds,
every one flatters himself, and they think that they have concealed themselves
by an admirable veil, because they have many who are like them; and when they
compare themselves with others, they think that they have pleaded their excuse.
This is the reason why he threatens that vengeance generally against all; for
not one was free from the general
disease.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Head and tail, branch

F142</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By <i>branch</i> he means the stronger
and more powerful; by <i>reed</i> or <i>rush</i> he means the feebler, that is,
men of the lowest rank, and who had scarcely any wealth. He therefore means that
the vengeance of God hangs over them, and spares neither the strong nor the
weak, neither the highest nor the lowest, because no part is sound or uninfected
by the general disease.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>

head</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
tail</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he explains more plainly and without a
figure. He says that the <i>heads</i> are the princes and nobles who had the
charge of public affairs, and sat at the helm of the commonwealth. To these he
adds the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>false
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and says that they are meant by
<i>the tail</i>. But he explains only the first part of the verse, and says
nothing about the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>branch and
reed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reason why he omitted them is easily
explained. It is, because he intended to press hardest on those who were more
heinous transgressors, and who led others to commit sin, in consequence of the
influence which they obtained from their high rank. He gives to the prophets the
name of <i>the tail</i>, not because they were mean and contemptible, as some
think; but he intended to denote the lowest parts of the whole body. By <i>the
head</i> he means magistrates and judges, and by <i>the tail</i> he means
<i>false</i> <i>prophets</i>, because they deceive and impose upon men by
falsehoods and hypocrisy, as if he had compared the one to lions or bears, and
the other to foxes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage warns us that
we ought not to slumber in our sins, because wickedness and profligacy abound in
all ranks, and no class of men is sound or uninfected; for the more that vices
abound, so much the more will the wrath of God be kindled against the highest
and the lowest. We ought, especially in the present day, amidst that pestilence
of every kind of evils, to fear lest, when the wrath of God hath begun to burn,
it may consume everything, high and
low.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

nothing was more hurtful or destructive to a nation than flatteries, which gave
encouragement to unbounded licentiousness. But I shall follow the reading which
I approved on a former occasion, when the same word occurred.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F144</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
3:12.) He means that the rulers and magistrates, whose duty it was to restrain
the people within the limits of decent behavior, allowed all to indulge freely
in crimes and wickedness. On this account they ought justly to be reckoned
<i>seducers</i> and corrupters, for corruption flows from them to the whole body
of the people, as from the head to the members. Magistrates and pastors are
appointed in order to restrain the waywardness of the people, to enjoin what is
good and right, and especially to defend the honor of God. If they neglect these
duties they ought to be reckoned impostors and not <i>rulers</i>, for they give
rise to miserable confusion. Now, when every one does what he pleases, and the
reins of government are nowhere to be found, can there be anything but the most
terrible result? When the common people are thus punished on account of their
faults, no lighter vengeance awaits the <i>rulers</i>, because they have
neglected the duty entrusted to them, and have occasioned so many
evils.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they who are
governed are destroyed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this clause he means
that wicked princes, and those who rule according to their own caprice, are
destructive; and in like manner teachers who rather deceive and impose on men
than point out the way of salvation, because through their fault the people are
ruined. But at the same time he shows that this affords no excuse to any one for
seeking to make bad rulers a cloak for their own transgressions, as is commonly
done, for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if the blind lead the
blind,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as Christ says, <i>both will fall into
the ditch</i>. It is certain that none are ruined by wicked and treacherous

astray.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Therefore the LORD will not delight in their young
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah describes more clearly how dreadful
will be that vengeance of God against all ranks; for so far will more flagrant
transgressors be from escaping, that neither boys nor youths, nor widows, will
be exempted, who are usually spared even amidst dreadful slaughter; which was
usually done even among heathens at the sacking of towns, as we learn from
history. But here the Lord threatens that he will pay no regard either to sex or
to age. Yet the following view will not be unsuitable. "Although the carnage
will rob many women of their husbands, and will deprive many children of their
parents, still God will not shrink from punishing women by making them widows,
and children by making them orphans." But as it does not greatly affect the
general meaning, I do not dwell upon it. Again, that they may not accuse God of
cruelty, he at the same time shows that there are good reasons why he is so
severe, because they are all wicked, and therefore that they deserve to be cast
headlong to ruin without any
distinction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all are
hypocrites and evil-doers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to this word, I
was unwilling to depart from the opinion commonly entertained, though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;nj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chaneph</i>) means an ungodly, deceitful, or treacherous and wicked man. He
appears to point out the source of all the evils, that there was no true fear of
God among them. By this he does not mean any slight dissimulation, but inward
contempt seated in the heart, by which consciences are stupified, so that no
instructions produce any effect on them; as if he had said that they were deeply
sunk in their depravity. But as wickedness, when it has taken possession of the
mind, drags the hands and feet, and the rest of the members of the body along
with it, so the Prophet adds, that they are all
<i>evil-doers</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every
mouth speaketh villany.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F145</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thirdly, he adds that they have
proceeded to such a pitch of open wickedness, that they boast of their crimes
without shame. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlbn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>niblah</i>), which is translated <i>folly</i>, has frequently a more
extensive meaning; for it denotes baseness, villany, and madness.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
19:24.) Here, in my opinion, the Prophet means that they are so entirely
abandoned to wicked courses, that we need not seek any other proof of it than
from their tongues.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His anger
will not be turned away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again repeats this
statement, which ought to be frequently repeated; for it is not enough to have
been once informed how dreadful are the judgments of the Lord against the
wicked; so easily and quickly will there steal upon us that forgetfulness of
them which banishes uneasiness, as well as fear, about the future. Besides, we
are led astray and blinded by that deception, for we think that the infliction
of a single punishment has exhausted the power of God. There can be nothing
better, therefore, than to hold by this principle, that whenever God chastises
us he threatens something more dreadful, if we do not quickly repent.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:18, 21, 24, 28.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But his
hand is stretched out still.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> since the Prophet
repeats this warning, let us unceasingly call to our remembrance, that the
indignation of God is not yet appeased, though we may think that he has already
punished us severely for our sins. What then ought we to conclude, when he has
given us but a light chastisement? At the present day, for instance, we have
endured some punishment; but what is it as compared with those dreadfully severe
calamities which that nation had suffered, when Isaiah foretold that new
chastisements were still awaiting them? What then will become of us? The Lord
will undoubtedly continue to perform what belongs to him, and will always be
like himself. If this dread do not arouse us, our insensibility is evidently
beyond endurance. I have translated the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shab</i>) in the future sense, <i>will not be turned away</i>, to make the
meaning more clear; for though he speaks as if it had been a past transaction,
still he threatens a continuance of punishments against the
rebellious.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For wickedness burneth as the
fire. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet attacks the wicked, who are
accustomed to defend themselves by laying the blame on God. Either they practice
evasions, in order to convince themselves that they are innocent, or, when they
have been convicted, they still extenuate their guilt, as if the severity of God
were beyond proper bounds. Never, certainly, do they acknowledge that God is
just in punishing them, till they are compelled to acknowledge it; and even
though they do not venture to excuse themselves publicly, still they fret and
murmur. With the view of repressing such insolence, the Prophet compares the
calamities to <i>burning</i>, but shows that the wickedness of men is the wood
and fuel, by which the anger of God is kindled: as if he had said, "All exclaim
and make loud complaints that the wrath of God <i>burns</i> violently, and yet
they do not consider that their own sins are the fans by which it is inflamed,
and that those sins supply the fuel, and that even themselves are consumed by
the inward fire of their
crimes."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall devour the
briers and thorns.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning is, that this
flame will seize every part of Judea. Two things are here expressed, that the
punishment of sin proceeds from the judgment of God, and yet that the blame lies
with the sinners themselves, that they may not remonstrate with God as if he had
dealt cruelly with them. There is a beautiful gradation; for we perceive that it
usually happens that a fire, kindled in the lowest part of any place, gathers
strength by degrees, spreads wider and wider, and ascends to the higher parts.
Such will the wrath of God be; for Isaiah shows that it does not all at once
seize the wicked, but is gradually kindled, till it utterly destroy them. At
first the Lord proceeds gently, but if a light chastisement produce no good
effect, he increases and doubles the punishment. If he see that we are
obstinate, his wrath burns to the uttermost, so as to destroy us altogether, and
consume us like a thick forest. Lastly, as the Prophets elsewhere declare, we
must be like chaff and straw as soon as the wrath of God is kindled.

After having shown that the cause of all our evils proceeds from ourselves, and
that therefore the blame of it should be laid upon us, he at the same time shows
that God is a most righteous avenger. When men draw down upon themselves
calamities and distresses, God does not suffer them to escape his hand; not that
he is inclined to cruelty, for he is <i>gracious and merciful</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:6,) but because he is just, and cannot endure the wicked. The dreadful nature
of God's vengeance is described by the metaphor of <i>darkness</i>, than which
nothing can be more dismal; for without figures of speech a judgment so
revolting cannot be expressed. And yet he appears to allude to <i>smoke</i>, of
which he spoke in the former verse; for when a conflagration extends, and rages
with such violence, the light must be overpowered by the thick
<i>smoke</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No man shall
spare his brother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this last clause and in
the following verse, the Prophet describes the methods and means, as they are
called, by which the Lord will execute his vengeance, when his wrath has been
thus kindled. When no enemies shall be seen whom we have cause to dread, he will
arm ourselves for our destruction. As if he had said, "The Lord will find no
difficulty in executing the vengeance which he threatens; for though there be
none to give us any annoyance from without, he will ruin us by intestine broils
and civil wars." It is shocking and monstrous to relate,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No man shall spare his
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">, "every man shall devour his own
flesh;" for <i>no man ever hated his own</i> <i>flesh</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:29.) But when the Lord hath blinded us, what remains but that we mutually
destroy each other? And though it is monstrous, yet it happens almost every
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We are not restrained by any relationship
either of blood, or of religion, or of the image of God, which we all bear;
though even the heathen, on the contrary, were prevented, by sharing in this
common nature, from injuring each other, because they perceived that the beasts
themselves are restrained by similarity of nature from cruelty against their own
kind; for a wolf does not devour a wolf, and a bear does not devour a bear. That
<i>human</i> beings, from whom the name of <i>humanity</i> is derived, should
fight with such cruelty and fierceness against one another as to exceed the rage
of wild beasts, is monstrous; and this evil can arise from no other source than
that God hath blinded them, and <i>given them up to a reprobate sense</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.) Justly hath Isaiah described this kind of revenge; for when men enjoy
peace, they think that they are placed beyond the reach of danger, and dread
nothing. But the Lord laughs at this indifference, and shows that he will
execute his vengeance by their own hand, which he will arm and direct against
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall snatch on the
right hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is equivalent to a phrase in
common use, <i>prendre et ravir a toutes mains</i>, <i>to take</i> <i>and seize
at all hands</i>. This mode of expression denotes either insatiable covetousness
or insatiable cruelty; for the eagerness to <i>snatch</i> excites to savage
cruelty. That they will be insatiable he expresses more emphatically, by saying
that, in consequence of being impelled by blind fierceness and inconceivable
rage, they will suck their brother's blood as freely as they would devour the
flesh which was their own property. The bitterness of the vengeance is greatly
heightened by this circumstance, that the children of Abraham, and the holy
posterity of the chosen race, break out into such beastly fury. Let us therefore
remember that it is a dreadful proof of heavenly punishment, when brothers are
hurried on, with irreconcilable eagerness, to inflict mutual
wounds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Manasseh, Ephraim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These tribes were closely
related to each other; for besides their being descended from the same ancestor,
Abraham, a close relationship arose out of their being descended from one
patriarch, his grandson, Joseph.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014150&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
41:50-52.) But though they were closely allied, still God threatens that he will
cause them to destroy themselves by mutual conflict, as if they were devouring
the flesh of their own arm, and, consequently, that there will be no need of
foreign enemies. He likewise adds that, after having wearied themselves out by
mutual wounds, both will unite against Judah, in order to destroy
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And for all this his anger
shall not be turned away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If any one take into
consideration those calamities which Isaiah threatened, he will be amazed and
greatly astonished that still more severe chastisements are foretold. But in
this manner God acts towards the wicked, and does not cease to afflict till he
utterly overwhelm and destroy them, when, after having been frequently invited,
they refuse to be reconciled to him. We need not wonder, therefore, that he
inflicts stroke after stroke, as he also foretold by Moses that he would
<i>punish seven times more</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus

again.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But his hand is

justly afflicted; for men never acknowledge that they are justly punished till
they have been manifestly convicted and constrained. Though they were
sufficiently convicted by former proofs, still he found it necessary to come to
particulars, that by means of them their hypocrisy might be exposed; for men are
so brazen-faced as to think that any excuse shields them, and openly to accuse
God. When they had become so shameless, it was impossible for him to rebuke them

of the vexation, that is, the oppression inflicted by the stronger on the

the wickedness originated from the governors themselves,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:10,23,) he places them in the first rank, that they may undergo the punishment
of the crimes which they had occasioned. This ought to be carefully observed,
for they who are elevated to the highest rank imagine that they are exempted
from the ordinary lot of other men, and that they are not bound to give account
to God; and therefore he threatens that they will have this privilege, that they
will be the first that are punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some think

turn</i> <i>aside</i>; but the true meaning is, <i>to keep back the poor
from</i> <i>judgment</i>, or make them lose their cause. This is the iniquity
and oppression which he had mentioned in the former verse, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the poor are deprived of their
rights</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and are robbed for the sake of the
rich, and go away mocked from the judgment-seat, while everything is laid open
to plunder. He chiefly mentions <i>the poor</i>, because for the most part they
are destitute of help and assistance. While magistrates and judges ought to have
assisted them more than others, they allow themselves greater liberty, and
indulge more contemptuously in oppressing them. Those who have wealth, or
friends, or favor, are less liable to be oppressed; for they have arms in their
hands to defend, and even to revenge themselves. But the Lord says that he takes
peculiar care of the poor,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
22:23;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
15:9, 24:15,) though they are commonly despised; and that he takes such care of
them that he does not allow oppression inflicted on them to pass unpunished; for
it is not without good ground that he calls himself the protector and defender
of such persons.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:5.) From this consideration, therefore, the poor and weak ought to derive
consolation, and more calmly to endure distresses and afflictions, because they
learn that God takes care of them, and will not permit any injustice done to
them to pass unpunished. The powerful and wealthy are at the same time warned
not to take it as an incentive to sin that they have not been punished; for
though no avenger be now seen, still the Lord will avenge, and will undertake
the cause of those whom they imagined to be destitute of all
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And what will you
do?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet severely threatens
princes, who were careless and indolent amidst their distresses, as men
intoxicated by prosperity are wont to despise haughtily every danger. He
therefore warns them that, though God delay, still he has fixed a time for
judgment, and already it is close at hand. In consequence of having vanquished
the neighboring nations in war, and fortified themselves by an alliance with a
very powerful nation, they had no longer any fear; and therefore he expressly
declares that their calamity will <i>come from</i>
<i>afar</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the day of
visitation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>visitation</i> is here meant
<i>judgment</i>, for God <i>visits</i> us in two ways, that is, in mercy and in
judgment. In both ways he reveals himself and his power to us, both when, in
compassion on us, he rescues us from dangers, and when he punishes those who are
ungodly and who despise the word. Both kinds of <i>visitation</i> have the same
object in view, for we do not see the Lord but in his works; and we think that
he is absent unless he give us a token of his presence. This <i>visitation</i>,
therefore, the Scripture accommodates to our capacity; for when we are pressed
down by afflictions, and when the ungodly freely give themselves up to
wickedness, we suppose that God is at a great distance, and takes no interest in
our affairs.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, <i>visitation</i> must
here be understood to mean the <i>judgment</i> by which God, in opposition to
the waywardness and insolence of the ungodly, will bring them back like
deserters. But if the judgments of God be so dreadful in this life, how dreadful
will he be when he shall come at last to judge the world! All the instances of
punishment that now produce fear or terror, are nothing more than preparations
for that final vengeance with which he will thunder against the reprobate, and
many things which he appears to pass by, he purposely reserves and delays till
that last day. And if the ungodly are not able to bear these chastisements, how
much less will they be capable of enduring his glorious and inconceivable
majesty, when he shall ascend that awful tribunal, before which the angels
themselves tremble!</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when
the desolation shall come from afar.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he
says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
afar</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is proper to observe that we must not
allow the prosperity which we now enjoy to bereave us of our senses; for they
who carelessly sleep amidst their vices, and by this wicked indifference call in
question the power of God, will quickly feel that in a moment, whenever he
pleases, he can shake heaven and earth from east to
west.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom will you
flee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He declares that it is in vain for them
to rely on their resources, for, in opposition to the hand of God, they will be
fruitless and of no avail whatever. At the same time he likewise shows that this
will be a most righteous reward; for when they are cruel towards others, they
will justly be made to feel that they have now no help either from God or from
men.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This applies especially to the judges, who ought to
have been a protection to the whole people; for they have been appointed for the
purpose of defending the poor and wretched. But if they shall neglect and
betray, and even plunder them, it is right that they should be made to feel, by
their own destitute condition, how greatly this cruelty offends
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where will you deposit
your glory?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is understood by commentators
to mean that they will be thrown down from their high rank. They suppose it to
be an ironical and contemptuous question put by the Prophet, "What will become
of that illustrious rank of which the nobles cruelly and foolishly vaunt,
whenever God spares them for a little?" But as this was a forced rendering, I
rather think that Isaiah asks, "Where will they find a safe hiding-place in
which they may </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deposit their
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">?" Thus I consider the meaning to be,
<i>to leave</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the sake of being preserved; and the
two clauses correspond to each other,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom will you
flee</i></font><font face="Palatino">? and, "Where will you find a refuge for
your glory in order to preserve it?" But perhaps a preference will be given to a
different view, which I have noted in the margin;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bz[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnazab</i>) signifies also to <i>strengthen</i>. Again, if God thus devotes
to destruction princes who are thrown down from an elevated position, what will
become of the lowest? No one, therefore, has any reason to flatter himself; for
we shall all be <i>like stubble</i> when the wrath of the Lord has been kindled
against us.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they shall not fall
down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the meaning of the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytlb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bilti</i>) is ambiguous, various interpretations of it have been given by
commentators. Some take it in an exclusive sense, as in many other passages of
Scripture; as if he had said, <i>Only he shall</i> <i>fall down among the bound
and slain</i>; that is, because all will be condemned and given up either to
captivity or to death. Others render it, <i>Without me they shall fall</i>. If
this rendering be preferred, the Prophet shows that the cause of their
destruction is, that they have revolted from God; and unquestionably the cause
of all our distresses is, to forsake the fountain of life and of salvation, and
of all blessings. In this manner he sharply reproves the madness of the ungodly,
who vaunt of having been forsaken by God, as if nothing were more desirable or
pleasant than to withdraw to the greatest distance from him; and thus it will be
an ironical reproof, that their calamity will arise from no other source than
from the absence of God, in whom, without any good ground, they had
rejoiced.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others consider it to be an elliptical
expression, that they will have no hiding-place but by throwing themselves down
under the captives and the slain. It might also be a form of an oath,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they shall
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the meaning would be highly
appropriate, that God swears in wrath that he will spare none of them, but will
abandon some to captivity, and will deliver up others to be put to death. In a
word, this declaration shows what are the consequences that await all those who,
after having been warned by the word of God, do not repent. From what
immediately follows, we learn that a dreadful and alarming destruction is
threatened; for he repeats what he had already said frequently, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wrath of the Lord is not yet
apparent,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that he will find out more frightful
punishments for avenging himself. This teaches us that nothing is more truly
desirable than to be moved by a sincere feeling of repentance, and to
acknowledge our fault, that we may obtain pardon from the
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
Assyrian.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What now follows relates to the
threatening of punishment, but at the same time mingles some consolation for
alleviating the distresses of the godly. Indeed, the greater part of the
discourse is occupied with this doctrine, that all the afflictions which shall
be brought upon them by the <i>Assyrians</i> are a temporary scourge inflicted
by God, but that unbelievers, after having too freely indulged themselves, will
at length be brought to submission.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywh</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>hoi</i>) is sometimes an interjection expressive of lamentation, <i>Ah!</i>
Sometimes it denotes addressing, <i>O!</i> Sometimes it means, as the old
translator rendered it, <i>Wo to</i>. But here it cannot be explained in any
other way than that God calls the <i>Assyrians</i>, or assumes the character of
one who sighs, because he is compelled to inflict punishment on his people by
means of the <i>Assyrians</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But when I more
closely examine the whole matter, I rather come to this opinion, that here the
Lord calls on the <i>Assyrians</i>, as if he armed them by his authority to
carry on war. He had formerly said that they would come; but hypocrites are so
careless that they are never moved by the fear of God, till his scourges are not
only seen but felt. This is the reason why he now addresses them, <i>Come</i>;
as if a judge called an officer and ordered him to put a malefactor in chains,
or delivered him to the hangman to inflict capital punishment upon him. Thus the
Lord calls the Assyrians to execute his vengeance by their
hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the staff in their
hand is mine indignation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may be viewed as
referring to the <i>Assyrian</i>, and may be explained so as to be a repetition
of the same statement, with a slight change of the words. But I distinguish
between them in this manner, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assyrians</i></font><font face="Palatino">
are called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rod of God's
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and next, that the swords and
weapons with which they are furnished are nothing else than <i>God's</i>
<i>anger</i>; as if the Prophet had said, that God, according to his pleasure,
made use of the Assyrians in the same manner as swords for the execution of
<i>his anger</i>; and further, that although they bear swords, still there will
be no reason to be afraid of them, except so far as the wrath of God shall be
displayed against the Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The general meaning
is, "All the strength which the enemy shall possess proceeds from the wrath of
God, and they are moved by his secret impulse to destroy the people, for
otherwise he would not move a finger." God declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
staff</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which is carried
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in their
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>anger</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
in order to inform the Jews that the blind attacks of the enemies are regulated
by a heavenly providence. The phrase
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;dyb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>beyadam</i>)</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F151</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is rendered by some, <i>in place of
them</i>, or, <i>into</i> <i>their country</i>; but I do not approve of this,
and it is too far-fetched. In a word, the Lord calls the Assyrians, as the
ministers of his wrath, to punish the sins of his people by their hand, and
declares that everything that is in their hand is <i>his
wrath</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This doctrine has two objects in
view; first, to terrify the ungodly, and to inform them that not in vain does
the Lord threaten their destruction; next, he points out the reason why he
punishes them. This was of the greatest importance for shaking off the
sluggishness of the ungodly, who laughed to scorn all the discourses and
threatenings of the Prophet. Secondly, this doctrine was of great importance
when the people themselves began to be afflicted by the Assyrians; for then they
actually saw that what the Prophets had foretold was not without foundation, and
that these things did not happen by chance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
will be objected, Why does he afterwards call <i>the staff</i> his <i>anger</i>,
since he formerly said that the Assyrian is <i>the rod of his</i>
<i>indignation</i>; for he ought rather to have spoken thus: "The Assyrian is my
wrath, and the staff which he carries is the staff of my indignation." But we
need not solicitously detain ourselves with the words, when we understand the
Prophet's meaning. He calls men
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the staff of his
anger</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because he uses them like a
<i>staff</i>. He calls men's weapons
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wrath of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because they are not regulated by their
own choice, but are proofs of the wrath of God. The Prophet therefore spoke
appropriately, that we might not think that the wicked rush forward, without
control, wherever their lawless passions lead them; but, on the contrary, that a
bridle restrains and keeps them back from doing anything without the will of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought to learn that the Lord acts
even by the hand of the wicked. But here we must think and speak soberly; for it
is proper to make a wise and judicious distinction between the work of God and
the work of men. There are three ways in which God acts by men. First, <i>all of
us move and exist by him</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441728&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:28.) Hence it follows that all actions proceed from his power. Secondly, in a
peculiar manner he impells and directs the wicked according as he thinks fit;
and although nothing is farther from their thoughts, still he makes use of their
agency that they may kill and destroy one another, or that by their hand he may
chastise his people. Of this method the Prophet speaks in this passage. Thirdly,
when he guides by his Spirit of sanctification, which is peculiar to the elect.
Whether, therefore, we are attacked by tyrants or robbers, or any other person,
or foreign nations rise up against us, let us always plainly see the hand of God
amidst the greatest agitation and confusion, and let us not suppose that
anything happens by chance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To a hypocritical
nation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with the former statement,
by which he called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Assyrian
the rod of God's indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for as the father
does not in vain take up the <i>rod</i>, but has this object in view, to
chastise his son, so he declares that the Lord's <i>rod</i> has no uncertain
destination, but is appointed for the chastisement of the unthankful and wicked.
He calls it a <i>hypocritical</i> or wicked nation, because it has no
uprightness or sincerity. Uprightness is contrasted with hypocritical conduct,
because uprightness is the chief of all the virtues; and in like manner
hypocrisy is the mother of all the vices. It is therefore no light accusation
which he brings against the Israelites; but he charges them with what is most of
all to be abhorred, and therefore immediately afterwards he calls

<div><font face="Palatino">Though he means that he is displeased with the Jews,
yet the Hebrew phraseology is much more emphatic; for it conveys the idea that
the reason why this nation is devoted to destruction is, that nothing is to be
found in it but grounds of anger. Indeed, God is never angry with us unless we
have provoked him by our sins; but when wickedness has come to its greatest
height, his indignation is kindled, and cannot be appeased. Thus he cuts off the
hope of reconciliation from hypocrites and wicked men, who ceased not
continually to add sin to
sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will command him to
take the spoil and to take the prey. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He says
that he has given a loose rein to the fierceness of enemies, that they may
indulge without control in every kind of violence and injustice. Now, this must
not be understood as if the Assyrians had a <i>command</i> from God by which
they could excuse themselves. There are two ways in which God <i>commands</i>;
by his secret decree, of which men are not conscious; and by his law, in which
he demands from us voluntary obedience. This must be carefully observed, that we
may reply to fanatics, who argue in an irreligious manner about the decree of
God, when they wish to excuse their own wickedness and that of others. It is of
importance, I say, to make a judicious distinction between these two ways of
<i>commanding</i>. When the Lord reveals his will in the law, I must not ascend
to his secret decree, which he intended should not be known to me, but must
yield implicit obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one allege
that he obeys God, when he complies with his sinful passions, he is guilty of
falsehood, by vainly attempting to involve God in the guilt of his crimes, to
which he knows that he is led by the failings of his own heart; for on this
point no other witness or judge is needed but a man's own conscience. God does
indeed make use of the agency of a wicked man, but the man has no such
intention. It is therefore accidental, so far as relates to men, that he acts by
the wicked and reprobate; for they neither know that they serve God, nor wish to
do so. Accordingly if they seize on this pretext, it is easy to prove that, when
they yield obedience to their own sinful passion, they are at the greatest
possible distance from obeying God. They have the will of God declared in his
law, so that it is in vain for them to seek it anywhere else. So far as they are
concerned, they do not perform the work of God, but the work of the devil; for
they serve their own lusts.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:2.) Nothing certainly was farther from the intention of the Assyrians than to
give their services to God, but they were hurried along by their lust and
ambition and covetousness. Yet the Lord directed their exertions and plans to an
object which was totally different, and which was unknown to
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage may be thus summed up.
"It will be an uncommon and extraordinary instance of God's vengeance, when the
Assyrians shall attack them with unrestrained liberty of action; for they will
be sent by God, not to treat them with gentleness and moderation, but to plunder
them in the manner of an invading army." He likewise adds, <i>to tread them
down</i>. Nothing can go beyond this, for it means that the vanquished are not
spared, but that every possible species of abuse has been heaped upon
then.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet he will not think
so.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When wicked men vomit out their rage,
they disturb weak minds, as if it were not in the power of God to restrain their
pride and fury. The Prophet therefore steps forth beforehand to meet them, and
exhorts believers, whatever may be the excess to which wicked men indulge their
insolence, still to feel that they are justly chastised by a secret judgment of
God. He shows, as we lately noticed, that nothing will be farther from the
intention of the Assyrians than to give their services to God, and to be the
ministers of his wrath; but we must also consider what is their own motive of
action.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Many would be ready to object, "Why dost
thou, being God's herald, threaten us with the Assyrian; as if that savage beast
would submit to execute the commandments of God?" He therefore replies, that God
works with such amazing skill that he brings men to yield obedience to him, even
without their knowledge or will. "Although," says he, "their attempts and plans
are totally different, yet this will not prevent God from performing and
carrying into execution, by means of them, whatever he has
decreed."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Many might likewise object, that it
was a strange subversion of order, that God should place the elect people in
subjection to the heathen nations; and that it was not just, however much the
Jews had sinned, that their condition should be worse than that of those robbers
who, on account of their wickedness and crimes, deserved the severest
punishment. The Prophet therefore threatens that the Assyrians also will have
their turn, and in due time will receive just punishment; and yet that it is not
unreasonable that they should distress, plunder, devour, and slay other nations,
because their own reward is reserved for them. Besides, the Prophet soothes the
grief of the godly, and alleviates their solicitude and uneasiness, by declaring
that God restrains the presumption of wicked men from carrying into effect
whatever they think fit. He therefore shows that, however madly wicked men may
rage, God mitigates his own judgments from heaven, so as to provide for the
salvation of his Church. And thus, though the Assyrian, like a wild beast, may
be eager to seize his prey, he bids them lift up their eyes to God, whose decree
is far removed beyond the reach of that blind
fury.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he will
say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He explains the reason why the Assyrian
will not think that he is the <i>rod</i> of God. It is because, being blinded by
pride, he acknowledges no authority superior to his own; for it is impossible
for those who rely on their own superiority, and claim ability to do this or
that, to submit to the providence of God. The authority which we ought justly to
ascribe to God is, to believe that we cannot move even the smallest finger
without his permission. On the other hand, whoever imagines that he can do
anything, however small, assumes to himself, with blasphemous pride, the power
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are not my princes
altogether kings?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet here gives a
lively picture of the presumption of a heathen king in boasting that he had
everything in his power. This is especially the case with eminent <i>Princes</i>
who, abounding in wealth, resources, and power, are blinded in such a manner as
hardly to know that they are men. The opportunities of learning this are too
abundant; for what <i>Prince</i> is there at the present day, who knows or
remembers that he is a man, and liable to the ordinary calamities of life? Their
minds are so entirely intoxicated and deranged, that they believe that whatever
they have undertaken they will at once accomplish, and will surmount every
obstacle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Is not Calno as Carchemish?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he mentions by
name certain cities, though others think that they were countries; but it is
more probable that they were cities, or some fortified places. "Shall it not
happen," says he, "to those places which I have not yet subdued as it has
happened to others that opposed me?" He therefore compares <i>Calno</i>,
<i>Arpad</i>, and <i>Samaria</i>, which he afterwards subdued, to
<i>Carchemish</i>, <i>Hamath</i>, and <i>Damascus</i>, which he had formerly
subdued, and says that those will not be stronger than these. Thus wicked men
are wont to boast and talk proudly of their former actions, so as to imagine
that they will break through every obstruction, and that nothing can stand in
the way of their plans and exertions, and even think that they will accomplish
everything without the will or knowledge of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When we read this history, let us learn
that we ought not to be proud of having been strong, or of having succeeded to
our wish; for he who hath exalted us will be able to cast us down. And if he
reproves the Assyrian for that haughtiness, how much more ought they to be
reproved who ascribe to themselves the praise of righteousness and holiness, as
if they could be regenerated by their own power; for it cannot be doubted that
they rob God of his honor, and claim for themselves what belongs to
him!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As my hand hath found the
kingdoms of the idols.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Assyrian now breaks
out into far more outrageous language; for not only does he insult men, but he
insults God himself, and even the very gods whom he worshipped. He boasts that
the gods, whose protection the other nations enjoyed, could not prevent him from
subduing them; and that the God of Israel, in whom Jerusalem and Samaria
trusted, would not prevent him any more than they. Wicked men are so proud that
they attribute to their own strength the victories which they achieve, and do
not hesitate to exalt themselves against God and all that is worshipped. They
allege, indeed, that they pay homage to the objects of their own worship, that
is, to the idols which they have contrived for themselves, and bow before them,
and offer sacrifices to them, by which they give some indication that they
ascribe their victories to the gods; but afterwards, as Habakkuk says of
Nebuchadnezzar,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">they burn incense to
their own net, and sacrifice to their drag,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Habakkuk
1:16;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, by boasting of their exploits, wisdom,
sagacity, and perseverance. Their hypocrisy is exposed, and their secret
thoughts, which lay concealed under those folds of hypocrisy, are revealed, when
they immediately claim for themselves what they appeared to ascribe to the
objects of their worship. We need not wonder, therefore, that Sennacherib
exalted himself against all that is worshipped, for that is the result of
ungodliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There are two ways in which his
blasphemy is expressed. First, he exalts himself above God, and thinks that he
will be stronger than God; and, secondly, he makes no distinction between God
and the false gods. He sufficiently displayed his ungodliness, when he exalted
himself alone even above idols; for although they are nothing but idols, yet as
their worshippers ascribe to them some power and divinity, if they scoff at
idols, they show that they despise every object of worship; for they treat idols
with the same contempt as if they had had to do with God himself. Their own
conscience testifies, therefore, that they carry on war against God, and they
have no excuse arising from ignorance; for they think that God dwells in graven
images. If that tyrant despised Apollo or Jupiter, he undoubtedly despised them,
not as idols, but as having in them something divine. The second blasphemy of
the tyrant was, that he placed the living God on the same level with the false
gods of the heathen, and dared to scoff at him as well as at the others, and to
ridicule the confidence of Israel, as if no greater power belonged to God than
to idols.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But it shall come to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hitherto the Prophet had explained what
would be the pride of the Assyrian, after having obtained a victory over Israel;
but now he foretells what will happen to the Assyrian himself, and what will be
the purpose of God against him. Wicked men do everything in the same manner as
if God were not in heaven, and could not frustrate their designs. What else is
the meaning of those haughty words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My hand hath found the kingdoms
of the idols</i></font><font face="Palatino">, than this, that he thought that
he would vanquish all the gods? But God opposes his designs, and, after having
made use of his agency, punishes himself
also.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This verse contains two clauses. First, he
declares that God will punish a wicked king. Secondly, he suggests that the time
is not yet come, in order to encourage believers to the exercise of patience. He
foretells that the time which God regards as fit for doing it will be, when he
shall have chastised the sins of his Church; in the same manner as if the master
of a house were to settle the disturbances of his own family. The object which
he has in view is, that believers may not give way to despondency, when they
behold a wicked tyrant in such a state of exultation, and may not abandon the
hope of salvation, as if it were impossible to restrain
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit upon the
fruit of the stout heart of the king of
Assyria.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God promises, in a word, that after
having permitted the Assyrian to plume himself beyond measure, he will in his
turn be an avenger; for it belongs to him to repress the pride of the flesh,
which is connected with sacrilege. Accordingly, the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnal</i>)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is emphatic, as if it declared that the Assyrian will not be protected by his
loftiness from undergoing punishment. <i>Fruit</i> is here taken in a
metaphorical sense, for wicked men think that they are happy and prosperous when
they swell with pride, as if they gathered some <i>fruit</i>. He places in the
foreground <i>the heart</i>, which is the seat of pride, and which, when it
swells with haughtiness, pours out fierceness and cruelty. Afterwards, he adds
<i>the eyes</i>, by which the inward feelings of the heart are manifested, and
which, by being lifted up, are the heralds of secret vice. To whatever extent
the Assyrian, in his pride, may elevate himself, God testifies that he has in
his own power the means of suddenly changing his glory into dishonor and
reproach. Accordingly, he includes contempt, scorn, disdain, and haughty looks,
indicative of excessive confidence, which are usually beheld in proud
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
visit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He introduces God as speaking, because
that which God utters with his own mouth is more impressive,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejmfatikw&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">,)
than if he spoke by the mouth of the Prophet. Hence draw a general doctrine. God
cannot endure the arrogance of proud men, without suppressing it; for he wages
incessant war with the haughty and disdainful.

how, in order to repress immoderate haste, the Prophet added this by way of
limitation; for as soon as we see a proud man, we wonder that the Lord endures
him. Isaiah here shows that God endures that proud tyrant, whatever may be the
insolence with which he vaunts and exalts himself, because he chose to make use
of his agency, and that the seasonable time for the Lord's destruction of the
wicked is not always at hand, but that we ought to wait patiently for it. When
he shall have chastised the kingdom of Judah, as if he were bringing the members
of the family into a state of submission, he will not be slow or sluggish in
punishing a foreign enemy; as a father commonly throws away or breaks the rod
with which he chastised his
son.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His whole work on Mount

<i>Mount Zion</i> is here put for the Church, and <i>Jerusalem</i> is employed
in the same sense, in order that by means of the Temple and the royal city, as
the head, he might describe the whole body, and by means of the most important
part might describe the whole kingdom. He calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because through our foolish haste we
would draw away God from his <i>work</i>, though it were only begun. More
especially, our wrath against wicked men rages so strongly, that it is difficult
to restrain our impatience, if God do not instantly comply with our wish in
punishing them. To mitigate this fervor, he bids them allow full and ample time
for God's fatherly
chastisements.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The whole
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes a proper measure. This is a useful
and highly consolatory doctrine; for we see wicked men, in a wonderfully
arrogant and seemingly triumphant manner, mocking God, and uttering reproaches
and slanders against his doctrine, so that hardly any words can express their
insolence. If the Lord would comply with our wish, he would immediately hasten
to subdue and destroy them. But he wishes first to humble his Church by means of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On Mount Zion and on
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not now speak of Syrians or
Egyptians, but of the Jews, of <i>Zion</i>, of the Temple and the habitation
which he was pleased to consecrate to himself. Thus, at the present day, there
are various diseases of the Church, which the Lord determines to heal and
remove. He has indeed begun to do so; but we are mistaken if we think that the
<i>work</i> is finished; and he will not cease till he has subdued us, so that
we may be moved by the true fear of him, and may submit to his yoke with
becoming modesty and gentleness. We need not wonder, therefore, that he gives a
loose rein to tyrants, and hitherto permits them to rage against the Church. But
the consolation is at hand. When he shall have made use of their agency in
chastising the Church, <i>he will visit</i> their pride and arrogance. And we
need not wonder if God, by striking his elect first of all, expresses in this
manner his peculiar regard for their salvation.

again repeats the highly blasphemous words which the Assyrian uttered; for he
ascribes to his <i>power</i> and <i>wisdom</i> all the victories which he
obtained. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strength of
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means vast armies collected out of
various nations. Yet at the same time he boasts of being a warlike king, as
those blusterers are wont to claim the praise of everything that was done under
their direction, though they were enjoying the luxury and ease of a retired
life. Afterwards he boasts that he was <i>cautious</i> and <i>wary</i>, to use
an ordinary phrase of our own, (<i>J'ay este bien entendu et expert</i>,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was very skillful and
clever</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But there can be no doubt whatever that
he bestows this honorable appellation on the tricks and dishonest cunning by
which he had gained advantage over his neighbors. For what are the stratagems of
kings and princes? To disturb the peace by indirect methods, to invent pretences
for quarrels, to sow the seeds of discord, and, in a word, by their artifices to
level all distinctions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have

that the King of France </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>removed
the boundaries</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of Brittany, Burgundy,
Aquitaine, Provence, and other countries, when he united them to his own
kingdom. He likewise adds, "that nothing was so secret or concealed as not to
become his prey;" as if he had said that by his sagacity he drew the neighboring
countries into his nets, fished their treasures, and brought into his possession
all that lay concealed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my hand hath found as a

As if one were to seek </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a nest and

consequently to take the eggs without difficulty; for if the parent birds were
sitting on the eggs, having an instinctive desire to protect their <i>nest</i>,
they would either fly at the robber, and attack him with their bill, or by loud
and unpleasant noises endeavor to drive him away. But this tyrant boasts that
there was no one who ventured so much as <i>to open the mouth</i> against him,
and therefore that he had no difficulty in bringing all the kingdoms under his
dominion. Accordingly, he lays claim to all these things, and attributes them to
his wisdom, and makes no acknowledgment of the providence of God. These boastful
pretensions the Prophet has purposely related as coming from the despot's own
mouth, in order to show that they were so many bellows to kindle the judgment of
God; for among men this haughtiness could not be endured, and how would not God
restrain it?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall the axe

fully, I shall touch briefly on the
words.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Like the rising up of a
rod against him that raiseth it.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This second class of the verse is
somewhat obscure. The matter is plain enough, but in the form of expression
there is some ambiguity, in consequence of which commentators greatly differ.
Yet, when I examine the matter closely, the rendering which I have given appears
to flow more naturally than the others. "What is this? If a staff rise against
the hand of him that raiseth it, and forget that it is wood, what a shocking
exhibition will it be!" For it is not uncommon that the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>eth</i>) which is the sign of the accusative, should mean <i>against</i>;
and the copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) is often superfluous. We shall thus have a meaning which is not
ambiguous, and which agrees with the words of the Prophet. He formerly
reproached the Assyrian for ascribing to his schemes and his army the victories
which he had gained. He now says, that in this manner he boasts against God,
just as if <i>an axe</i>, reckoning as nothing the hand of him that cuts,
claimed the praise of a workman, or a staff, as if it were not dead wood and
without any strength of its own, rose up against him that wielded
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn that men rise up against God,
whenever they ascribe to themselves more than is proper, and that in such cases
they war not with men but with God himself. Away, then, with those proud and
blasphemous expressions, "By my power and wisdom and perseverance I have done
and contrived and accomplished these things;"</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We must attend to those comparisons by which he
likens men to instruments; and we must not view it as referring to the universal
providence by which all creatures are governed, as some do, who acknowledge that
all the creatures are moved by God, because they cannot deny it, but add, that
each of them is driven according to its nature, as the sun, the moon, the
heavens, and such like. Thus they imagine that man is driven hither and thither
by his own choice and by free-will; because God does nothing more than continue
that power which he once bestowed at the beginning. Their false explanation
amounts to this, that the whole machinery of the world is upheld by the hand of
God, but that his providence is not interposed to regulate particular movements.
Thus they ascribe to God the rain and the fair weather because he is the Author
of nature, but contend that, strictly speaking, God commands nothing, that the
rain is produced by vapours, and that fair weather also is produced by its
natural causes. But this confused direction, which they leave to God, is hardly
the thousandth part of that government which he claims for himself. Justly
therefore, does Isaiah show that God presides over individual acts, as they call
them, so as to move men, like rods, in whatever way he pleases, to guide their
plans, to direct their efforts; and, in a word, to regulate their
determinations, in order to inform us that everything depends on his providence,
and not on the caprice of wicked men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is
objected, that it would be absurd to call men <i>axes</i> and <i>swords</i>, so
as to take away from them will and judgment, and everything that distinguishes
them from inanimate creatures, and to make them, not men, but stocks and stones.
But the answer is at hand. Though God compares men to stones, it does not follow
that they resemble them in all respects. No one thing is exactly like another,
but they agree in some points; for as a staff cannot move itself in any
direction, and yet is fit for inflicting blows, so wicked men have something
which belongs to them by nature, and yet they cannot be moved hither and
thither, without being directed by the providence and secret decree of God. This
fitness of things, if we may so call it, is no reason why the action should not
be ascribed entirely to God alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the
question about the will of man is unseasonably introduced on the present
occasion. If God controls the purposes of men, and turns their thoughts and
exertions to whatever purpose he pleases, men do not therefore cease to form
plans and to engage in this or the other undertaking. We must not suppose that
there is a violent compulsion, as if God dragged them against their will; but in
a wonderful and inconceivable manner he regulates all the movements of men, so
that they still have the exercise of their
will.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this passage Isaiah chiefly shows that
all the efforts of men are fruitless, if God do not grant them success; and
therefore that the Assyrian, even if he had attempted everything, would not have
succeeded, if the Lord had not bestowed the victories; and, consequently, that
he had no reason for laying claim to the praise of those things in which his
success was owing solely to God. This is confirmed by another metaphor, that the
lifting up of a staff proceeds from the will of him who moves it, and not from
the nature of the wood.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones
leanness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with the former doctrine,
declaring that the Lord will show to the Assyrian how undeservedly he exalts
himself, and will throw down his arrogance, in which he foolishly takes delight.
As he trusted in his wealth and his forces, Isaiah declares that the Lord will
take them away; and he does so under the metaphor of <i>fatness</i> and
<i>leanness</i>. By the word <i>fatness</i> he means both riches and warlike
power, in which he placed too much confidence; as if he had said, "Everything
<i>fat</i> and <i>rich</i> that he possesses, the Lord will make the whole of it
<i>lean</i>." It is not uncommon to compare prosperity to <i>fatness</i>; for as
horses which are too <i>fat</i> become refractory, so as to throw the rider or
kick when any one comes near them, so among men abundance produces fierceness of
disposition, which is subdued by
<i>leanness</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And under his
glory he shall kindle a burning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is great
beauty in the comparison, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
fire will be laid under his glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for it
means, that the greater the splendor of his prosperity, so much the more
abundant will be the fuel for the conflagration. Yet it likewise shows that he
will be utterly reduced to nothing; as if one were to cut down a tree from the
roots, or overturn a house from the foundation. If nothing more than the
branches of a tree be cut down, it quickly sprouts again; or if the roof of a
house be consumed by fire, the other parts of it remain uninjured. He therefore
leaves him nothing, but asserts that he will be brought down by utter
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the burning of
a fire.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F157</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The particle <i>as</i>, which points out
the comparison, does not mean that the language is metaphorical, but rather that
the burning will be such as to consume utterly the glory of the
Assyrian.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the light of Israel shall
be for a fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is an elegant allusion to
that burning by which he threatened that he would consume the Assyrians. In
<i>fire</i> there are two things, light and heat. As the Lord consumes the
enemies by his heat, so he enlightens the godly by his light. It is very
customary that God is sometimes called <i>a</i> <i>devouring fire</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
4:24, 9:3;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581229&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:29,) and sometimes, in a different point of view, he is called <i>light</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236020&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
60:20;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
7:8,) because his power produces contrary effects on the godly and the ungodly.
When he shines on the godly, he imparts life and nourishment to them, but he
consumes and destroys the ungodly. In a word, while he threatens destruction to
the Assyrians, he likewise brings comfort to the godly; and he does so in two
ways, first, because they will see that God revenges the injuries which they
have received, and, secondly, that they will be cheered by his light, and will
thus receive a new life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
his Holy One for a flame.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What that
<i>light</i> is he states plainly, and without a metaphor, when he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his Holy
One,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> so that it is unnecessary to make a more
lengthened exposition. The meaning is, that he determines to protect that people
which he hath chosen, and which he hath separated from the rest of the nations
to be a peculiar people to
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall devour
its thorns and briers in one day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now shows
that the favor of God, which shines in Israel, will be like a fire to consume
enemies. <i>In one day</i> means, that he will burn them with a sudden and
unexpected conflagration. It denotes an uncommon and dreadful burning, which
usually overtakes the wicked suddenly, when they think that all is well with
them, and that danger is at a great distance. He next shows that, whatever
defences they may put forth, they will be like <i>tow</i>, which, as soon as it
is set on fire, will instantly be
consumed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall consume the glory of
his forest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He goes on with the same comparison
of a <i>burning</i>, and declares that the fire will consume both the highest
and the lowest, and will leave nothing uninjured. It is possible that a fire
might destroy the higher parts of a building, and might leave the lower parts
unaffected.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of his
fruitful field.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lmrk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Carmel</i>) is here a proper name, but rather an appellative, denoting a
rich and fertile soil; for to say that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Carmel</i></font><font face="Palatino">
was held as belonging to the dominion of the king of Assyria, would have been
inadmissible. The meaning therefore is, that not only will destruction overtake
his <i>forests</i>, but the corn will be consumed by the same fire; for it will
not only range over the heights, but will penetrate into the lowest
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the soul even to
the flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This comparison is taken from man.
As man consists of a <i>body</i> and a <i>soul</i>, so each part of him is
liable to separate diseases. It frequently happens that, when the <i>soul</i> is
healthy, the <i>body</i> is diseased; and often the reverse takes place; but
when both are unhealthy at the same time, the case is most dangerous. By this
comparison, therefore, he threatens that the Assyrians will have nothing safe or
sound, but that they will be devoted to utter destruction, because they will
perish from <i>the flesh</i> even to the <i>soul</i>; not that <i>souls</i> are
mortal, but because the vengeance of God will fall upon them also. This is truly
dreadful; for the design of chastisements is,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that the spirit may be
saved, though the flesh be
destroyed,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 5:5;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but when the <i>spirit</i> also is involved in the
destruction, what can be said or imagined that is more miserable? The flame only
scorches the godly, but does not consume them as it consumes the ungodly, in
whom it finds nothing but fuel fit for
burning.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be as
the fainting of a standard-bearer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is an
allusion in the words of the Prophet, which cannot be conveyed in another
language. The meaning is the same as in the other comparisons, that there will
be utter destruction, like the complete rout of an army when the standard has
been taken. When the ensigns have been taken, it is commonly followed by a great
slaughter; and when historians describe a fearful carnage, they tell us that the
ensigns were taken. He does not threaten these things against the Assyrians on
their own account, that they may receive advantage from the warning or may be
led to repentance, but to yield consolation to the godly, that they may not
think that the Assyrians will pass unpunished when they raged so fiercely
against the people of God, or entertain fears either that the Lord has forgotten
his promise, or that he cannot frustrate their designs. If the Prophet had not
put them on their guard, many scruples of this kind might have arisen in their
minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>

F158</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant of them will be a
number</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he employs a Hebrew idiom to express
that <i>they will be few</i>; and thus he only confirms the former statement,
that the devastation produced, after the calamity which God will bring on the
Assyrians, will be so great that there will be no difficulty in counting
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That a child may number
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He goes so far as to say, that they will
be so few that those who are left of them may be counted even by <i>a child</i>;
for <i>children</i> have difficulty in counting as far as three or four.
Accordingly, the kingdom of the Assyrians was formerly like some vast
<i>forest</i>; but when <i>the trees</i> have been hewn and thrown down, those
which are left are few, and scattered at great distances from each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i>
It shall be in that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Returning now to the
elect people, he describes the result of the chastisement which was at hand. As
it is painful and disagreeable to us to endure calamities and afflictions, and
as we refuse them so far as lies in our power, the Lord points out to us the
result of them, that we may be taught to consider the design of them, and may
thus bear more patiently: as if he had said, "You would wish that the Assyrians
were driven to a great distance from you, and that you could live in comfort and
safety. But consider, that this chastisement is as necessary as medicine would
be for curing your diseases; for you do not acknowledge the power of God, and
you withdraw your confidence from him to give it to wicked men. It is truly
wretched to place the hope of salvation in enemies, and to rely on those who aim
at nothing but your destruction." In like manner, Israel relied sometimes on the
Assyrians and sometimes on the
Egyptians.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But shall stay upon
the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We ought not to despise this
compensation made for the diminished numbers of the people, that the small
portion which survived the calamity learned to place their hope in God. Hence we
see more clearly how necessary it was that God should chastise Israel. The
mitigation which he holds out, that still a remnant is left, among whom the true
worship of God is maintained, is fitted to yield very high
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This phrase is not superfluous; for
until the Lord had afflicted them, all wished to be accounted the children of
Abraham &#8212; all made profession of the faith, and indiscriminately
worshipped God; but it was mere pretense. Isaiah therefore reproves this
hypocrisy, and says that their hope will afterwards be true and sincere when
they shall have been cleansed from impostures; for although they very haughtily
boasted of their confidence in God, still they continued to place their
confidence in the assistance of the Assyrians. Consequently, when they shall be
chastised by their hand, they will learn to trust in God alone, and will
withdraw their heart from the assistance of men. Hence infer that we cannot
place our confidence in God unless we altogether withhold our heart from
creatures; for we ought to rely on God alone in such a manner as not to think it
a hardship to renounce all other grounds of confidence. Where this perfect
confidence does not exist, there is no room for <i>truth</i>; for <i>the heart
is divided and double</i>.

in reference to the event, that it might be regarded as a pledge of the future
deliverance concerning which his father prophesied. It was necessary that the
Jews should be confirmed in various ways, that they might be convinced that the
Lord would at length bring them back. This is also the design of what he
immediately adds &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To

people, after having returned from their former apostasy, will acknowledge to be

themselves to the Assyrians and Egyptians, but because they did not think that
God was sufficient for them? This is the source of all evils, when we are not
fully convinced that in God is everything that can be desired for our
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>

confidence; for they reckoned it enough to be the descendants of holy Abraham
according to the flesh, and, therefore, on the sole ground of their birth, they
wished to be accounted holy. Yet he exhorts the godly to patience, that they may
learn to await calmly that calamity and diminution of their number, lest, when
it took place, it should be unexpected, and give them uneasiness. He therefore
comforts them, that they may not be grieved at so great desolation; for the Lord
will at least collect <i>a remnant</i> of

latter is more appropriate. He calls this diminution of the people a

language, the import of which is, that they were not far from utter
extermination, there being very few that were
saved.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word <i>Israel</i> may be taken

importance, for the meaning is the same, in whichsoever of these ways it be
taken; and therefore it may be read in the genitive case, <i>of Israel</i>. Yet
I am more inclined to view it as a proper name, to denote the true, and not the
spurious Israelite. The bold address to the patriarch has a striking effect; for
God, addressing a dead man, declares to the living that what he had formerly
promised,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
13:16, 22:17,) that the posterity of Abraham would be <i>like</i> <i>the sand of

distressed by such heavy calamities, that we think that it cannot be far from
destruction, we are in danger of giving way to despondency, and of entertaining
doubts about the mercy of God. Those whose minds are impressed with just views
of the judgment of God, feel that this is the severest of all temptations. It
was therefore necessary that godly minds should be fortified against it, that
they might soothe their grief by pondering the benefit which would result from
this calamity. The benefit was, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness would overflow</i>

that the Jews, to whom so many promises had been given, and with whom God had
made <i>an everlasting</i> <i>covenant</i>, should perish, as it were, in an
instant; and it appeared to be even inconsistent with the unchangeable nature of
God. The Prophet therefore declares that <i>the Lord</i> is the author of this

in order to repress the pride of wicked men, who, relying on their present
prosperity, thought that they were beyond all danger, and, swelling with that

follows the ordinary translation which at that time was generally used. Though
Paul wrote correctly and faithfully, and in accordance with the Prophet's real
meaning, yet the words which he quotes from the Greek translation have led many
to depart from what the Prophet actually meant. The Greek translator having used
the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gov</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>logos</i>,) that is, <i>a discourse</i>, many have entered into discussions
about the Gospel, and have said that it denotes the repeal of the law, because
it puts an end to ceremonies and figures, and therefore that it is a short and
concise <i>discourse</i>, by which we are freed from the burden of the law under
which the people groaned. But that has nothing to do with the Prophet's meaning;
for here he says that the <i>consumption</i> is a <i>diminution</i>, by which
the people will be almost ruined. Paul's design is not different, and the Greek
translators meant nothing else; for by
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gov
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>logos</i>) they meant what is expressed by the
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>dabar</i>.) Though the Prophet does not make use of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>dabar</i>,) yet the word which he uses means <i>a thing consumed</i>, that
is, <i>consumption</i>, and the meaning of both words is the same. In short,
Paul there repeats
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450928&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:28) what Isaiah had said in this passage about the future <i>consumption</i>
of the people, and shows that this prediction was chiefly fulfilled in his own
time, when the Jews were cut off from the kingdom of God on account of their
ingratitude, and but <i>a small remnant</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

consolation, which belongs to the godly alone, who at that time, undoubtedly,
were few in number. A great number of persons gloried in the name of God, and
wished to be accounted his people; but there were few who actually performed
what they professed in words; and, therefore, he does not address all without
reserve, but only those who needed consolation. The kingdom having been
destroyed, they might entertain fears about themselves and their affairs, and
might judge of their own condition from that of others, and therefore it was
necessary to comfort them. This distinction ought to be observed, for otherwise
it would be inconsistent to address to the same persons statements so
different.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall lift up

F162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He adds a ground of consolation, namely,
that that calamity will be nothing else than <i>the lifting up of a rod</i> to
chastise, but not to destroy them. The preposition

(<i>beth</i>) denotes resemblance.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;rd</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>derech</i>) means <i>a pattern</i>, and therefore I render it, <i>after the
pattern of Egypt</i>. As if he had said, "Though the Assyrian be cruel, and in
many ways aim at thy destruction, yet he shall only wound, he shall not slay
thee." He therefore mentioned the pattern of the Egyptian bondage, which was
indeed very wretched, but yet was not deadly.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
1:14, 12:51.) It is customary with the Prophets, amidst perplexity or disorder,
to remind the people to contemplate that deliverance by which God miraculously
rescued them from the hands of Pharaoh, who was a most cruel tyrant. The meaning
therefore is, "As the Lord was at that time victorious, and destroyed the
Egyptians who had leagued for your destruction, so now he will quickly vanquish
the Assyrians."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others render it, <i>in the way
of Eqypt</i>, because the Assyrians made war against the Jews on account of the
Egyptians. But that exposition cannot be admitted; and if we carefully examine
the matter, it will be found that there is none more appropriate than that which
I have proposed, and which is also approved by the most learned commentators.
There are two clauses which form a contrast; the oppression which the Egyptians
laid upon them, and the calamity which should be inflicted soon afterwards by
the Assyrians. "As the oppression of the Egyptians was not deadly, so neither
will the oppression of the Assyrians be. You have had experience of my strength
and power against Pharaoh, and so will you find it on Sennacherib." If we did
not explain the clauses in this way, they would not agree with each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>

those dreadful calamities it was necessary that the godly should be fortified by
these promises. This ought to be carefully observed; for if we neglect it, as
other commentators do, we shall not be able to see how the statements agree.
Accordingly, the captivity of the people might be called a <i>consumption</i>;
for Babylon was like a grave, and banishment was like death. But when the danger
was immediate and urgent, and Sennacherib attacked them with his army, and
various straits were felt by them in that siege, this consolation was needful;
for Judea seemed to be utterly ruined, and to outward appearance no hope of
safety was left.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My fury and

<i>he spends his anger</i>, in the same way that we speak of <i>spending</i>
years and our whole life; that is, "I will cherish my anger until I completely
destroy the Assyrians." But the word <i>finish</i> brings out the meaning more
fully; as if he had said, "until I have discharged all my anger." This is the
destruction which he also threatens elsewhere

up a scourge for him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here Isaiah makes use of
the word <i>scourge</i>, and not <i>rod</i>, meaning that the Lord will treat
the enemies much more harshly and severely than they had treated the Jews. He
threatens them with extermination, and makes it more evident by two examples;
first, that of the Midianites,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;070725&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
7:25,) who were cut off by a dreadful slaughter in the valley of <i>Oreb</i>,
which was so named from their leader, and, secondly, that of the Egyptians, whom
the Lord, when they pursued after his people, sank in the Red Sea.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021427&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:27, 28.) In the former passage, he refers to a narrative which was somewhat
more recent, and in the latter to one that was more
ancient.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we infer that the Lord hath
displayed his power in defending his Church, in order that, when our affairs are
in the most desperate state, we may remain steadfastly in the faith, and,
relying on his grace, we still may cherish a pleasing hope. By means and in ways
that are unexpected he often delivers his Church, as he did by the hands of
Gideon and Moses. We ought always, therefore, to call to remembrance those
benefits, that we may be excited more and more to confidence and
perseverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought also to infer that
all the afflictions which we endure are the Lord's rods with which he chastises
us; and yet he does not permit Satan or his agents to inflict deadly
chastisements upon us. On the other hand, an awful destruction awaits our
enemies, as we see in the Midianites and Egyptians. It is therefore no small
consolation that, when we compare our condition with theirs, we see them, for a
time indeed, in all the madness of joy and of wickedness insulting the children
of God, but at the same time learn what a dreadful sentence has been pronounced
against them; for they are devoted to deadly and everlasting
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35,) when he besieged Jerusalem with a huge army. This latter opinion
is almost universally preferred; and indeed it appears to be supported by what
follows, for immediately afterwards he gives a description of the country, and
enumerates the chief places through which Sennacherib should conduct his army,
till he arrived at Jerusalem itself, so that there appeared to be nothing at all
to hinder him from taking possession of the city. With this opinion I partly
agree, but I extend the prediction
farther.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah intends to comfort the godly who
were involved in the present distress. It might be thought that the promise
failed, and that the calamities which immediately followed were utterly at
variance with it. For instance, if the Lord promise to give me food for next
year, and yet leave me altogether destitute of it, what faith can I have in a
promise so distant, if the Lord do not rescue me from the present distress?
Thus, the Lord's promise, in which he had said that he would deliver his people
from Babylon, and would continually assist them, may be thought to have failed,
when it was exposed to the jaws of that huge wild beast. With the view of
meeting this objection, the Prophet includes both promises, that the Lord will
be the guardian of his people, till at length he deliver them from death. Some
limit it to the slaughter
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35) of Sennacherib's army; but as Isaiah promises <i>the</i>
<i>loosing</i>, or <i>breaking of the yoke</i>, I have no doubt that he
describes deliverance from captivity. Yet he confirms the promise, that God will
not only rescue them from Babylon, but will also aid them against the besieging
army of the tyrant, whom he will not suffer to go beyond what has been
threatened.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That his burden
shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
neck,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He describes that tyranny in two ways, in
order to illustrate more fully how great was the blessing of deliverance. If it
be thought best to refer it to Sennacherib, he had not laid on the Jews so
grievous a yoke. The people paid only some tribute, as we learn from sacred
history.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 36:3.) Why then has he employed two names in describing this tyranny?
It may be pleaded that he had in his eye the approaching danger; for that
tyrant, like a huge beast of prey, had devoured the whole of Judea by his
voraciousness, and had oppressed them to such an extent, that it appeared to be
almost impossible that his <i>yoke</i> could ever be taken off. But I have
already explained the view which I prefer, that he describes the uninterrupted
course of the favor of God down to the time of
redemption.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the yoke shall

is the name given to that kingdom which the Lord had set apart for himself, and
which he therefore wished to keep unspotted and undiminished. When the Prophets
intend to applaud the majesty of that kingdom, they speak of the
<i>anointing</i> which the Lord had bestowed on it as a distinguishing mark,
because it was a type of Christ.

respects profane; this ranked above them as holy and sacred, because the Lord
reigned over Judea in a peculiar manner, and because under this figure of a
kingdom he held up Christ to their view. For this reason, also, it was promised
to Solomon that his throne would be everlasting.

(<i>shamen</i>) denotes the king himself, not only is it too farfetched, but it
conveys no solid instruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet
therefore points out the means of overthrowing that tyranny; for it appeared as
if there were no reason to believe that the yoke of so powerful a tyrant would
be broken. He shows that this will arise from the heavenly anointing of that
kingdom, that all may perceive that this benefit depends on the power of Christ,
and not on the ability of man or on
chance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>

that the Assyrians did not move a step but by the appointment of God; for by the
mouth of the Prophet he had given a lively description of the whole of that
march.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

the implements of war, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in

He describes how great will be the terror when they hear of the approach of the
Assyrian, that the whole country will be struck with terror and alarm, so that
the Assyrian will subdue it without any difficulty. When such dread has seized
their hearts, they will freely surrender at the first attack of the enemy, so
that the conquerors will be allowed to ravage at their pleasure. He passes from
the singular to the plural number, because he speaks sometimes of the king and
sometimes of the whole
army.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ramah is afraid; Gibeah
of Saul is fled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions <i>Ramah</i> in
preference to the rest, because it was the nearest town; and he describes the

them to such a degree that they gave up their country into the enemy's hand.
After having spoken of so great dismay, he adds.

that city to have been shaken to such a degree, as if it had been <i>removed</i>
to another place. This relates to the disorderly movements of a people in
flight; as if he had said that the inhabitants of that city were thrown into as
great a commotion as if the city had been razed to its
foundations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The inhabitants
of Gebim have gathered themselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may be

were not room for a free passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet a
day.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F169</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some interpret this, that the Assyrian
will yet remain <i>one day in Nob</i>, which was a village contiguous to
Jerusalem, as Jerome and others declare. But I rather agree with those who think
that it means, that he will have a great part of the day before him when he
halts there, in order to make preparations for besieging Jerusalem on the
following day. He intends to describe the rapid march of the Assyrian, and how
near Jerusalem was to utter destruction; as if he had said, that he had but a
small part of the journey to perform, and that before <i>the day</i> was ended,
he would arrive at that
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall shake the
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This contributes still more to show their
terror; for Sennacherib, having conquered the whole country, will threaten
Jerusalem, as if he could storm it by the slightest expression of his
will.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against the mountain of
the daughter of Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a figure of speech, in
which a part is taken for the whole,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
he includes the whole city under the name of <i>the mountain</i>, because that
part was higher, and commanded a view of the other quarters of the city. From
this confidence of the tyrant, he shows that Jerusalem was not far from utter
destruction; for the whole country, and even the city, was struck with such
terror that none ventured to oppose him. By these details, therefore, the
Prophet intended to give a more impressive view of the kindness of God, that it
ought to be ascribed to the extraordinary favor and goodness of God, and not to
human aid, of which there was none, that Jerusalem was preserved, as if a sheep
had been rescued from the jaws of a
lion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the Lord Jehovah
of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Almost all explain this passage as
referring to the Assyrians.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35.) They think that the Prophet threatens against them that slaughter
with which the Lord destroyed them, after that they had besieged Jerusalem. As
if he had spoken in this manner: The Assyrian will indeed be elated with such
pride, that as soon as he has seen Jerusalem, he will think that it is in his
power. All being struck with such dismay at his approach, that some shall flee
and others shall freely surrender themselves, he will imagine that all are
subdued under him; but the Lord will quickly reverse his condition, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lop off those lofty
branches</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
for my own part, when I examine closely the whole passage, and especially what
he adds soon afterwards about <i>Lebanon</i>, and the consolation which
immediately follows, I think that this passage ought to be referred to the Jews
themselves. Isaiah therefore proceeds, in my opinion, to threaten the calamities
which awaited the people. As if he had said, "Not only will he come to
<i>Nob</i>, but he will spread devastation far and wide over the whole country.
Everything in it that is excellent and lofty, he will completely waste and
destroy, in the same manner as if one should cut off branches from a tree or cut
down a tree from the root."</font><br><font face="Palatino">This interpretation
is confirmed by the following chapter, in which the Prophet offers consolation
against that calamity, for the consolation agrees with this verse, and is added
as an appropriate remedy for soothing grief. Nor do I attach any importance to
the division of the chapter, which is often very absurd, and which perplexes the
whole of the Prophet's meaning. I think, therefore, that we ought to connect
that consolation with these verses, as if there had been no such
division.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And he will cut down the thick places of the forest with
iron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is no difficulty in explaining this
metaphor, for it is plain enough that by tall and high trees is denoted all that
is powerful, excellent, or lofty. Thus he foretells the destruction and ruin of
Judea, which he compares to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cutting down of a
forest</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which he means that there is nothing
so valuable that the enemies will not destroy it, till they have stripped the
whole land of its
ornaments.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Lebanon will
fall violently.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions <i>Lebanon</i>,
because that mountain, as we all know, was highly celebrated for fruitful and
highly valuable trees. Now, if he had been speaking of the Assyrians, it would
not have been appropriate to introduce the destruction of <i>Lebanon</i>. Hence
we infer that the Prophet, in this passage, again threatens the Jews; and this
agrees well with the introduction of the discourse, for it begins with a word
which calls attention, <i>Behold.</i></font><br></div>

nothing left but grief and lamentation; and therefore they might have tottered
and fallen, or been greatly discouraged, if the Lord had not provided for them
this consolation. He therefore declares what the Lord will afterwards do, and in
what manner he will restore that kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He
pursues the metaphor which he employed towards the conclusion of the former
chapter; for he had said that Jerusalem would be destroyed, as if <i>a forest
were</i> consumed by a single conflagration.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231033&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:33,34.) Its future desolation would be like that of a country formerly
covered with forests, when the trees had been cut down, and nothing could be
seen but ashes. That those things which are contrasted may answer to each other,
he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of the stock
will come forth a branch,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which will grow into
a tree, and spread its branches and fruits far and wide. I have therefore
preferred translating
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[zg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gezang</i>) <i>a dry stock</i>, rather than <i>a root</i>, though it makes
little difference as to the meaning, but the former expresses more fully what
the Prophet meant, namely, that though <i>the stock</i> be dry,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the branch which shall
spring</i></font><font face="Palatino"> from it shall be more excellent than all
the forests.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we infer that this prediction
applies solely to the person of Christ; for till he came no such <i>branch</i>
arose. It certainly cannot be applied to Hezekiah or Josiah, who, from their
very infancy, were brought up in the expectation of occupying a throne.
Zerubbabel
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
3:8) did not attain the thousandth part of that elevated rank which the Prophet
extols. We see, therefore, that to the wretched and almost ruined Jews,
consolation was held out in the Messiah alone, and that their hope was held in
suspense till he appeared. At the time of his appearance, there would have been
no hope that the kingdom would be erected and restored, if this promise had not
been added; for the family of David appeared to be completely extinct. On this
account he does not call him <i>David</i>, but <i>Jesse</i>; because the rank of
that family had sunk so low, that it appeared to be not a royal family, but that
of a mean peasant, such as the family of <i>Jesse</i> was, when David was
unexpectedly called to the government of the kingdom.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:8.) So then, having sustained this calamity and lost its ancient
renown, it is denominated by the Prophet the family of <i>Jesse</i>, because
that family had no superiority above any other. Accordingly, I think that here,
and not towards the conclusion of the former chapter, the consolation
begins.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Amidst such frightful desolation they
might doubt who should be their deliverer. He therefore promises that one
<i>will spring</i> even out of a <i>dry trunk</i>; and he continues, as I
mentioned a little before, the same metaphor of <i>a forest</i>, because it is
far more beautiful than if he had said in plain language that the Messiah would
come. Having threatened that the forest would be entirely cut down, he adds,
that still <i>a</i> <i>branch</i> will arise out of it, to restore the abundance
and magnificence of the consumed forest; that is, Christ, who should be the
deliverer of the people. How low his beginning was, it is unnecessary to
explain. Undoubtedly, he was so far from having anything splendid or attractive,
that with the exception of his birth, everything, to the view of the flesh, was
inconsistent with the character of the Redeemer. Even his birth was almost
obscured; for who would have thought that a poor <i>carpenter</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;410603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
6:3) was descended from a royal family? Again, where was Christ born, and how
had he been brought up? In short, his whole life having been mean and even
contemptible, he suffered a most disgraceful death, with which he had to begin
his kingdom. Yet he grew to an immeasurable height, like a large tree from a
small and feeble seed, as he himself shows,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401331&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:31, 32;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;410432&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
4:32,) and as we see by daily examples; for in the uninterrupted progress of his
kingdom the same things must happen as were seen in his
person.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Spirit of the
Lord shall rest upon him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now begins to
speak of Christ plainly and without a figure; for it was enough to have
represented the consolation under that figure, in order that the full contrast
between the burning of the wood and its springing up anew might be made
manifest. Two states of the people are described by him; for, after having
explained the calamity, he next added the hope of restoration, though the
commencement of it was from a slender <i>branch</i>. But now he plainly shows
what will be the nature of the redemption, and what will be the condition of
Christ and of his kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some think that this
should rather be viewed as referring to Hezekiah; but how groundless that
opinion is we have already shown;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F170</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for when he was born, David had still a
flourishing reputation, and the rank of royalty belonged to his descendants; and
Hezekiah was very far from attaining that greatness which is shortly afterwards
described. Now, hence we infer that the spiritual kingdom of Christ was formerly
promised to the ancient people, because his whole strength, power, and majesty,
is here made to consist in the gifts of <i>the Spirit</i>. Although Christ was
not deficient in gifts of this kind, yet as he took upon him our flesh, it was
necessary that he should be enriched with them, that we might afterwards be made
partakers of all blessings of which otherwise we are destitute; for <i>out of
his fullness</i>, as John says, <i>we must draw as</i> <i>from a fountain</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

mentioned a little ago, that this refers to Christ's human nature; because he
could not be enriched with the gift and grace of the Father, except so far as he
became man. Besides, as he came down to us, so he received the gifts of <i>the
Spirit</i>, that he might bestow them upon us. And this is the <i>anointing</i>
from which he receives the name of <i>Christ</i>, which he imparts to us; for
why are we called <i>Christians</i>, but because he admits us to his fellowship,
by distributing to us out of his fullness <i>according to the measure</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:7) of undeserved liberality? And undoubtedly this passage does not so much as
teach us what Christ is in himself, as what he received from the Father, that he
might enrich us with his
wealth.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The spirit of wisdom

gifts of the Holy Spirit, as some have thought. Out of this passage the Papists
have foolishly and ignorantly drawn their sevenfold grace, and some of the
ancients fell into a similar blunder. He enumerates only six kinds; but they
have added a seventh out of their own head. But as one error commonly follows
another, they have chosen to limit the gifts of <i>the Spirit</i> to the number
seven, although in other parts of Scripture
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:17;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:7) he receives numerous and lofty commendations drawn from the variety
of the effects which he produces. Besides, it is very evident that it is through
the kindness of Christ
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:22, 23) that we are partakers of other blessings than those which are here
enumerated, of meekness, chastity, sobriety, truth, and holiness; for these
proceed from none else than from Christ. He does not mention, therefore, all the
gifts which were bestowed on Christ, for that was unnecessary; but only shows
briefly that Christ came not empty-handed, but well supplied with all gifts,
that he might enrich us with them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If these
things had not been added, we might have supposed, as the Jews commonly do, that
the restoration of this kingdom was carnal, and might have imagined that Christ
was poor and destitute of all blessings. Accordingly, the Prophet afterwards
shows that the gifts of the Spirit are laid up in him, first, generally, and
next, particularly; that we may go to him to obtain whatever we want. He will
enlighten us with the light of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>understanding</i>, will
impart to us <i>counsel</i> in difficulties, will make us strong and courageous
in battles, will bestow on us the true fear of God, that is, godliness, and, in
a word, will communicate to us all that is necessary for our life and salvation.
All gifts are here included by the Prophet, so that it is excessively foolish to
attempt to conceal those which do not belong to the present
enumeration.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He shows that they dwell in Christ,
in order that they may be communicated to us. We are also called his
<i>fellows</i>, (Psalms 45:7,) because strength proceeds from him as the head to
the individual members, and in like manner Christ causes his heavenly anointing
to flow over the whole body of his Church. Hence it follows that those who are
altogether barren and dry have no interest in Christ, and falsely glory in his
name. Whenever therefore we feel that we are in want of any of these gifts, let
us blame our unbelief; for true faith makes us partakers of all Christ's
benefits. We ought therefore to pray to the Lord not to permit the lusts of the
flesh to rule in us, that Christ may wholly unite us to himself. It should also
be observed, that we ought to ask all blessings from Christ alone; for we are
mistaken if we imagine that anything can be obtained from the Father in any
other way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will make him

f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jyr</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>riach</i>,) which is here put in the Hiphil conjugation, signifies literally
<i>to</i> <i>smell</i>; but may also be explained in an active sense, as meaning
<i>to give a keen smell</i>; which agrees better, I think, with this passage, so
that this sagacity may be also included among the gifts of the Spirit. And this
effect is peculiarly applicable to the person of Christ, namely, that far beyond
what the godly are able to conceive, he is endowed with shrewd discernment for
governing his people. We ought to attend, first of all, to the metaphor in the
verb <i>smell</i>, which means that Christ will be so shrewd that he will not
need to learn from what he hears, or from what he sees; for by <i>smelling</i>
alone he will perceive what would otherwise be
unknown.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F172</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the fear of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This phrase is viewed by the greater part
of commentators as meaning that all the feelings of the heart will be manifest
to Christ, so that he will easily judge who are the sincere worshippers of God.
But let the reader inquire if it be not a more appropriate meaning, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fear of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes a fixed rule of judging. He
expressly distinguishes between the heavenly judgment of Christ and earthly
judgments, in order to inform us, that the outward mask of holiness or
uprightness is of no avail in his
presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall not
judge after the sight of his eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning
is, "When we come to the judgment-seat of Christ, not only will outward actions
be brought to trial after the manner of human governments, but the life of men
will be examined by the standard of true godliness. It does not belong to man to
penetrate into the hearts; and those whom we suppose to be very excellent men
have frequently nothing but a hollow mask; but Christ judges not from outward
appearance,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
11:17;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
2:25,) for he thoroughly knows and searches our inmost thoughts. His
<i>judgment</i>, therefore, is quite different from that of men, who, with all
their acuteness and quick sagacity, fall into the most shameful mistakes." Hence
it follows that none can be the true worshippers of God but those whom Christ
approves. They cannot obtain his approbation, unless they offer a pure and
upright mind; for a false and hollow mask cannot deceive
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he will judge the poor in
righteousness.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here he shows that Christ will be the
guardian of <i>the poor</i>, or, he points out the persons to whom the grace of
Christ strictly belongs, namely, to the <i>poor</i> or <i>meek</i>; that is, to
those who, humbled by a conviction of their poverty, have laid aside those proud
and lofty dispositions which commonly swell the minds of men, till they have
learned to be meek through the subduing influence of the word of God. He
therefore declares that he will be the protector and guardian, not of all men
whatsoever, but of those who know that they are <i>poor</i>, and destitute of
everything good. This was also declared by Christ to John's disciples, when he
said that <i>the gospel is preached to the poor</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:5.) Who are they that are capable of receiving this doctrine? Not all men
without exception, but those who, having laid aside the glory of the flesh,
betake themselves to that heavenly
protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is, therefore, an implied
contrast, namely, that Christ does not rule over the rich, that is, over those
who are swelled with a false opinion of themselves. Though he invites all men to
come to him, still the greater part refuse to submit to his government. The
<i>poor</i> alone allow themselves to be governed by him. This passage teaches
us, that if we are desirous to be protected by the power of Christ, we must lay
aside all pride, and put on the spirit of <i>meekness</i> and modesty. That
spiritual poverty which the Prophet recommends to all the members of Christ is,
to have no lofty views, but to be truly humbled by a conviction of our poverty
and nakedness, so as to depend on Christ alone. When we have been brought to
this state of mind, the faithful King and Guardian will undertake to secure our
salvation, and will defend us to the last against all our enemies. We also learn
whom Christ invites to come to him: <i>Come to me, all ye that labor and are
burdened</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:28.) We must, therefore, <i>labor</i> and be pressed down by the weight of
our <i>burden</i>, if we wish to feel and know his
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will reprove
with equity for the meek of the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must
attend to the order which is here observed by the Prophet. He places
<i>poverty</i> first, and then <i>meekness</i>; because we must first be
<i>poor</i> before we become <i>meek</i>. So long as we think <i>that we are</i>
<i>somebody</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440536&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
5:36,) and are carried away by a vain confidence in ourselves, our heart is
filled with pride and self-conceit, and cannot yield or submit; but when we are
convinced of our poverty, we lose courage, and, subdued and overpowered, begin
to groan under the burden. The condition of Christ's people, therefore, is here
described, as he had formerly illustrated the nature of the king himself. Hence
also we ought to learn, that those precious gifts of the Spirit with which we
saw a little before that Christ was furnished,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F174</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
are not bestowed by him on all men whatsoever, but on the <i>poor</i> and the
<i>meek</i>; for the word <i>judge</i> denotes government, a very important part
of which is, that Christ imparts to us the gifts which he received from the
Father, that he may live in us, and that we may live in
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall smite the
earth with the rod of his mouth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet
here extols the efficacy of the word, which is Christ's royal scepter. By <i>the
rod of his mouth</i> is meant a scepter which consists in words, and in the
second clause he repeats the same idea by the phrase, <i>the</i> <i>breath of
his lips</i>; as if he had said, that Christ will have no need to borrow aid
from others to cast down his enemies, and to strike down everything that opposes
his government; for a mere <i>breath</i> or a <i>word</i> will be enough. The
statement may be general, since believers also must die, so as to be renewed to
a spiritual life; and in this sense the gospel is called a sword appropriated
for the slaying of sacrifices.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16.) But the latter part of the verse calls for a different interpretation.
If any one choose to make a distinction, <i>the</i> <i>striking of the earth</i>
will apply equally to the reprobate and the elect; as the gospel
is</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a two-edged sword, piercing even
to the most hidden and secret feelings of the heart, and discerning the thoughts
and affections.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
4:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it wounds the former in a very
different manner from that in which it wounds the latter. By mortifying in the
elect a sinful nature, it kills their lusts, that they may become a living
sacrifice, and a sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor; but it <i>strikes</i> the
wicked in a manner altogether destructive, for they rot and die, and to them it
is even, as Paul says, <i>a savor of death to</i> <i>death.</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16.) I should be willing enough to consider both effects as
described here at the same time, were it not that it is opposed by the custom of
the Hebrew language; for the Hebrew writers often repeat the same sentiment in
different words.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with the
breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Christ is armed </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the breath
of his lips to slay the wicked.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But perhaps
this second clause was added by Isaiah for the purpose of amplification; and,
indeed, <i>to slay</i> is much more than <i>to strike</i>. As it belongs to the
gospel to cast down all men without exception, its effect on the reprobate may
be said to be accidental, <i>to slay</i> them with a deadly stroke. In this way
the Prophet would add a particular case to the general statement, intimating
that the wicked fall under the sword of Christ to their everlasting destruction,
because they are not set apart to be sacrifices.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F175</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
However this may be, this latter clause must undoubtedly be limited to the
wicked alone; and it is added, because that efficacy does not immediately appear
in the preaching of the gospel, but, on the contrary, many ridicule, and jeer,
and treat as a fable all that is said about Christ and his word. But though they
do not immediately feel its power, yet they will not be able to escape it, and
will at length be slain by a deadly wound.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
the Prophet's meaning, I think, is not yet fully explained; for he does not
speak only of the inward feeling by which wicked men are moved, whether they
will or not, but of the wickedness itself, which will be removed and driven away
by the power and efficacy of this scepter, as Paul also explains; for he
undoubtedly alludes to this passage when he speaks of the destruction of
Antichrist.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And then shall that
Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of his mouth,
and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Thessalonians 2:7,8.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus he explains to us the
meaning of the Prophet; for he shows that Christ will never be without enemies,
who will endeavor to overturn his kingdom, and to hinder or retard the course of
the gospel; otherwise these words of the Prophet would have been spoken in vain.
But Christ will drive away some of their number, and the whole of them together,
and their very head and leader, by the sound of his
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus also Paul recommends a twofold
use of doctrine, demanding from a pastor that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he shall be qualified not
only to teach, but likewise</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to
refute those who oppose.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;560109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Titus
1:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A pastor ought not only to feed his flock, but also
to protect and guard them against every injury. This is what Christ performs,
and therefore he is provided with necessary armor, that he may contend
successfully against the falsehoods of Satan, and the cruelty of tyrants, and
every kind of enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it is evident that
wicked doctrines cannot be driven away by any other method than by the gospel.
In vain will the magistrate employ the sword, which undoubtedly he must employ,
to restrain wicked teachers and false prophets; in vain, I say, will he attempt
all these things, unless this sword of the word go before.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:5.) This ought to be carefully observed in opposition to the Papists, who,
when the word fails them, betake themselves to new weapons, by the aid of which
they think that they will gain the victory. They are even so impudent as to
boast that heretics cannot be refuted by the <i>word</i>, though both the
Prophet and Paul lay down no other method.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When
the Prophet says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> <i>by the breath
of his lips</i></font><font face="Palatino">, this must not be limited to the
person of Christ; for it refers to the word which is preached by his ministers.
Christ acts by them in such a manner that he wishes their <i>mouth</i> to be
reckoned as his <i>mouth</i>, and their <i>lips</i> as his <i>lips</i>; that is,
when they speak from his mouth, and faithfully declare his word.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
10:16.) The Prophet does not now send us to secret revelations, that Christ may
reign in us, but openly recommends the outward preaching of doctrine, and shows
that the gospel serves the purpose of a scepter in the hand of Christ, so far as
it is preached, and so far as it is <i>oral</i>, if we may use the expression;
otherwise it would have been to no purpose to mention the <i>mouth</i> and the
<i>lips</i>. Hence it follows that all those who reject the outward preaching of
the gospel shake off this scepter, as far as lies in their power, or pull it out
of the hand of Christ; not that the efficacy which he mentions depends on the
voice of men, but so far as Christ acts by his ministers; for he does not wish
that their labor should be fruitless, without sacrificing the elect to
obedience,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16,) and slaying the reprobate; as Paul in another passage boasts that there
will be speedy vengeance against all unbelievers and
rebels.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we must again call to remembrance
what is the nature of Christ's kingdom. As he does not wear a golden crown or
employ earthly armor, so he does not rule over the world by the power of arms,
or gain authority by gaudy and ostentatious display, or constrain his people by
terror and dread; but the doctrine of the gospel is his royal banner, which
assembles believers under his dominion. Wherever, therefore, the doctrine of the
Gospel is preached in purity, there we are certain that Christ reigns; and where
it is rejected, his government is also set aside. Hence it is evident how
foolishly the Papists boast that the Church belongs to them, when they order
Christ himself to be silent, and cannot endure the sound of his voice, but
proclaim aloud, with distended cheeks, their own edicts, laws, decrees, and

F176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some translate it <i>girdle</i>; but as
the Prophet represents Christ to us wearing, as it were, the emblems of royalty,
I have rather translated it <i>belt</i>, which is also a royal emblem, in the
same manner as the scepter, which he had assigned to him a little before. When
Job speaks of taking away the authority of kings, he says that the Lord will
ungird their <i>belt</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;181218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
12:18.) To be <i>girded</i> with a <i>belt</i>, therefore, is nothing else than
to be exalted to royal authority, as we shall afterwards see in another passage.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
14:5.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet describes two ornaments
belonging to the <i>belt</i>. These are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
unless it be thought that there is a change in the order of construction, as if
he had said that Christ will be girded <i>with true
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is not added as if it were different from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
but in order to point out the nature of that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
with which Christ is <i>girded</i>. Some think that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
here denotes that which Christ imparts to us, that it may dwell, not only in
himself, but in his members. <i>Faith</i> or <i>truth</i> they understand to be
that by which we embrace the salvation which he offers to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Chaldee paraphrast explains it thus;
"and the righteous shall be round about him, believing worshippers shall
approach to him."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F177</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But I adopt a more simple interpretation, as if he had said, "He shall not
appear like kings, clothed with purple and a crown, or girded with a
<i>belt</i>; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
shall shine forth in him." I acknowledge, indeed, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is not confined to Chlist, but belongs to his members; but we must attend to the
mode of expression, that Christ comes forth to govern his people
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>girded with
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which he afterwards imparts to
them by the secret influence of the Spirit. If we distinguish between the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwma</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>emunah</i>) and <i>righteousness</i>, I consider it to mean
<i>faithfulness</i> or <i>steadfastness</i>; as if he had said that Christ never
disappoints his followers, for he continues always to be like
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wolf shall dwell with the
lamb.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again returns to describe the
character and habits of those who have submitted to Christ. As there is a mutual
relation between the king and the people, he sometimes ascends from the body to
the head, and sometimes descends from the head to the body; and we have already
seen that Christ reigns, not for himself, but for those who believe in him.
Hence it follows that he forms their minds by his heavenly Spirit. But the
Prophet's discourse looks beyond this; for it amounts to a promise that there
will be a blessed restoration of the world. He describes the order which was at
the beginning, before man's apostasy produced the unhappy and melancholy change
under which we groan. Whence comes the cruelty of brutes, which prompts the
stronger to seize and rend and devour with dreadful violence the weaker animals?
There would certainly have been no discord among the creatures of God, if they
had remained in their first and original condition. When they exercise cruelty
towards each other, and the weak need to be protected against the strong, it is
an evidence of the disorder
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">)
which has sprung from the sinfulness of man. Christ having come, in order to
reconcile the world to God by the removal of the curse, it is not without reason
that the restoration of a perfect state is ascribed to him; as if the Prophets
had said that that golden age will return in which perfect happiness existed,
before the fall of man and the shock and ruin of the world which followed it.
Thus, God speaks by Hosea:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I will make a covenant
with the beast of the field, with the fowl of the heaven, and with the creeping
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
2:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As if he had said, "When God shall have been
reconciled to the world in Christ, he will also give tokens of fatherly
kindness, so that all the corruptions which have arisen from the sinfulness of
man will cease."</font><br><font face="Palatino">In a word, under these figures
the Prophets teach the same truth which Paul plainly affirms, that Christ came
<i>to gather together</i> out of a state of disorder <i>those things which are
in heaven and which are on</i> <i>earth</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:10;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:20.) It may be thus summed up: "Christ will come to drive away everything
hurtful out of the world, and to restore to its former beauty the world which
lay under the curse." For this reason, he says, that <i>straw</i> will be the
food of <i>the lion</i> as well as of <i>the ox</i>; for if the stain of sin had
not polluted the world, no animal would have been addicted to prey on blood, but
the fruits of the earth would have sufficed for all, according to the method
which God had appointed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:30.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Though Isaiah says that the wild and the
tame beasts will live in harmony, that the blessing of God may be clearly and
fully manifested, yet he chiefly means what I have said, that the people of
Christ will have no disposition to do injury, no fierceness or cruelty. They
were formerly like <i>lions</i> or <i>leopards</i>, but will now be like
<i>sheep</i> or <i>lambs</i>; for they will have laid aside every cruel and
brutish disposition. By these modes of expression he means nothing else than
that those who formerly were like savage beasts will be mild and gentle; for he
compares violent and ravenous men to <i>wolves</i> and <i>bears</i> which live
on prey and plunder, and declares that they will be tame and gentle, so that
they will be satisfied with ordinary food, and will abstain from doing any
injury or harm. On this subject it is proper to argue from the less to the
greater. "If Christ shall bring brute animals into a state of peace, much more
will brotherly harmony exist among men, who will be governed by the same spirit
of meekness." And yet Isaiah does not mean that any are mild and peaceful by
nature before they are renewed, but yet he promises, that whatever may have been
their natural disposition, they will lay aside or conquer their fierceness, and
will be like <i>lambs</i> and
<i>sheep</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a little
child shall lead them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This means that beasts
which formerly were cruel and untameable, will be ready to yield cheerful
obedience, so that there will be no need of violence to restrain their
fierceness. Yet we must attend to the spiritual meaning which I noticed, that
all who become Christ's followers will obey Christ, though they may formerly
have been savage wild beasts, and will obey him in such a manner, that as soon
as he lifts his finger, they will follow his footsteps, as it is said that
<i>his people shall be willing</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:3.) Those who are not endued with this meekness do not deserve to be ranked
among the sheep. Let us, therefore, permit ourselves to be ruled and governed by
him, and let us willingly submit to those whom he has appointed over us, though
they appear to be like <i>little children</i>. Besides, I think that the
ministers of the word are compared to children, because they have no external
power, and exercise no civil government over
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question arises, Do we find any persons
who are meek, though they have not been tamed by the gospel? The Prophet appears
to insinuate this, when he compares some men to <i>sheep</i>, and others to
<i>wolves</i> and <i>bears</i>; and certainly among men who follow the bent of
their natural disposition, we shall perceive an astonishing diversity. Some are
mild and gentle, others are fierce and violent; but it is certain that all men
are untamed till Christ subdues them by the gospel; all are swelled with
ambition and pride before they are cured by this medicine. Many will be able to
make a false and hollow profession of modesty and humility, but they will swell
with inward pride. In short, where the Spirit of Christ is not, there will be no
true meekness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the child shall play on the
hole of the asp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues to illustrate the
same sentiment, that when men have been brought into a state of favor with God,
and have been cleansed from their depravity by the Spirit of regeneration, they
will likewise be free from every hurtful disposition. There is no reason why men
dread the danger or poison arising from the bite of serpents, but because they
do not deserve that God should place every part of the world under their
control. And, indeed, since animals are permitted to do injury even to
<i>children</i>, this shows that the whole race of Adam has been stained with
pollution from the very womb.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must again
observe the comparison which we stated, that those men whom a concealed poison
led to deeds of violence will have their disposition changed, and will do no
harm even to <i>little children</i>. Some men are openly fierce and cruel,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
140:3,) and others inwardly carry and cherish their malice like poison,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
55:21,) as David also describes them; for some men are more quick, and others
are more slow, to manifest the desire of doing injury. Whatever they may have
formerly been, he means that all of them must be cleansed from wickedness, both
open and concealed, after having submitted to Christ. He means, also, that
henceforth safety, which will reign everywhere, will be enjoyed even by those
who have no kind of protection; so that they will freely venture to expose
themselves to imminent dangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not
hurt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now declares plainly, that men
themselves, having laid aside the depravity which naturally dwells in them, will
be inclined, of their own accord, to do what is right. He speaks of believers
who have been truly regenerated <i>to a new life</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4;) for though in the Church many hypocrites full of wickedness were mixed
with the elect of God, yet they are like the Ishmaelites, whom God will cast out
at the proper time. We ought also to observe, as we are taught in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
15:1, 24:3, that those only who follow <i>righteousness</i> have a settled
residence in the temple of God, that they may dwell there for ever. It is,
therefore, a distinguishing mark of the genuine members of the Church, that they
are free from all desire of doing injury to others. Hence, also, we infer, that
it is a remarkable gift of the Spirit of Christ, that men abstain from being
evil-doers; for by nature, ambition, pride, cruelty, and avarice, always prompt
them freely and voluntarily to commit acts of
injustice.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the earth shall
be filled with the knowledge of the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> With
good reason does the Prophet add, that this invaluable blessing flows from
<i>the knowledge of God</i>; for it abases all flesh, and teaches men to commit
themselves to his trust and guardianship, and brings them into a state of
brotherly harmony, when they learn that they have the same Father.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:10.) Although many, who have not yet been renewed by the Spirit of Christ,
profess to have humanity, yet it is certain that self-love
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">filauti&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
reigns in them; for in all it is natural and so deeply-rooted, that they seek
their own advantage and not that of others, think that they are born for
themselves and not for others, and would wish to make the whole world subject to
them, if they could, as Plato has judiciously observed. Hence arise fraud,
perjury, theft, robbery, and innumerable crimes of this sort; and therefore
there is no other remedy for subduing this lawless desire than <i>the knowledge
of God</i>. We see how the Prophet again makes the government of Christ to rest
on faith and the doctrine of the gospel, as indeed he does not gather us to
himself
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:10) in another way than by enlightening our minds to reveal the heavenly life,
which is nothing else, as he himself declares, than</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to know the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
17:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As with waters that cover the
sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is an implied comparison between the
abundance of knowledge and that slender taste which God gave to the ancient
people under the law. The Jews having been kept in the rudiments of childhood,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:23,4:3,) the perfect light of wisdom hath fully shone on us by the gospel, as
was also foretold by Jeremiah:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">They
shall not every one teach his neighbor, and a man his brother, to know God; for
all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:34.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">If this fullness of knowledge take
possession of our minds, it will free us from all
malice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage also instructs us what is
the character of the Church under Popery, where the light of doctrine is choked
and almost extinguished, and the highest religion is made to consist in the
benumbing influence of brutish stupidity. If we do not immediately possess full
knowledge, we must advance from day to day, and make continual progress,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;610318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 3:18,) and in such a manner that fruit may spring from that root. Hence it
is evident how little progress the greater part have made in the school of
Christ, seeing that fraud and robbery and acts of violence abound
everywhere.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in that day
the root of Jesse.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again returns to the
person of Christ, and repeats the same comparison which he had introduced at the
beginning of the chapter, that of a <i>root</i> or a <i>branch</i> springing
from a decayed trunk, of which no trace appeared; and he foretells that the
Gentiles, who formerly abhorred the Jews, will henceforth bow before their King
with lowly homage. This might be thought to be altogether incredible, and
unquestionably the promise was ridiculed for many centuries, because such a
gathering together was to be expected rather when the kingdom remained and
flourished than when it had been cut down. But it was necessary that it should
be cut down, so that it might afterwards sprout again, and that the glory and
power of God might shine in it more brighter than in its flourishing condition.
Who would have seen with the eyes of men that the <i>branch</i> would rise to
such a height as to be seen by all nations, and to direct the eyes of all men
towards it?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which shall stand
for an ensign of the peoples.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He compares it to
a banner stretched aloft; and we know that this was fulfilled by the preaching
of the gospel, and indeed was more illustrious than if Christ had soared above
the clouds. To the same purpose is what he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">As Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
3:14;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Numbers
21:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall be sought by the
Gentiles. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Christ is said to be <i>sought</i>,
when men flee to him for the purpose of asking salvation, as to <i>seek</i> God
means, in every part of Scripture, to cast all our hopes upon him. Accordingly,
the Greek translators have rendered it
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejlpiou~si</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>they shall hope</i>, looking rather at the meaning than at the
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his rest shall be
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words are commonly explained as
referring to the burial of Christ, and that by a figure of speech in which a
part is taken for the whole; for afterwards they apply it also to his death; and
indeed the burial of Christ was nothing else than an appendage to his death.
They think that the meaning is this, "The death of Christ, which was disgraceful
in the eyes of the world, will be <i>glorious</i> and splendid." But when I take
a closer view of the whole, by <i>rest</i> the Prophet means in this passage the
Church; as it is also said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">This is my everlasting
rest; here will I
dwell.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bestows an honorable appellation on the assembly
of the godly, because he chooses to have a continual habitation among them.
Accordingly, the Church having been at that time exposed to reproaches and
disgrace, he promises that it will be again raised to a more prosperous
condition, and will recover its ancient <i>glory</i>. Here, therefore, we have a
remarkable proof that God is pleased to dwell continually in his Church, though
this may not always be seen by men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in that day,
the Lord will again set his hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
prediction about the future glory of the Church having been incredible, he
explains the method of restoring it, namely, that God will display the power of
<i>his hand</i>, as if for performing a memorable and uncommon exploit. Now, to
confirm the hope of the elect people, he recalls to their minds the remembrance
of a past deliverance, that they may not doubt that God is as able to deliver
them now as their fathers found him to be in Egypt.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021251&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:51.) Such is the import of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyn&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>shenith</i>,) that is, <i>the second time</i>, or <i>again</i>; as if he had
said, "<i>Now also</i> will God be the deliverer of his
Church."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To possess the
remnant of his people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what he has
said by another argument; for though it appeared as if God had disregarded his
people, yet he will not allow himself to be deprived of his inheritance. We may
sum it up by saying, that God will take care of the salvation of his Church, so
as not to be robbed of his right. He expressly calls them a <i>remnant</i>,
because this deliverance belonged only to a small seed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9,10:22.) In short, he repeats what he formerly said, "Though God disperse and
scatter his Church, yet it is impossible that he can ever cast it away
altogether; for it is as dear to him as our inheritance is to any of
us."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which shall be left from
Assyria and from Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks not only of
the <i>Assyrians</i>, who had led the people captive, but also of other nations
among whom the Jews were scattered; for though the greater part of the people
was carried to Babylon, some fled into <i>Egypt</i>, some into Ethiopia, and
some into other countries. They were afraid lest they should endure the same
bondage as had been endured by others. Some think that by <i>Pathros</i> is
meant <i>Parthia</i>, which is highly probable; others think that it is Arabia
the Rocky. Under the name <i>Elam</i> he includes the Medes, Zocdians,
Bactrians, and other eastern nations. <i>Shinar</i> belongs to Chaldea. By
<i>Hamath</i> they mean Cilicia, and the other countries which lie towards Mount
Taurus. By the word <i>islands</i> the Jews mean all countries that lie beyond
the sea; for to them Greece, and Italy, and Spain, were islands, because they
were separated from them by the sea.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F178</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">We see that the Prophet speaks here
not only of the deliverance which took place under Zerubbabel,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
2:2,) but that he looks beyond this; for at that time the Israelites were not
brought back from Egypt, Ethiopia, and other countries. These words, therefore,
cannot be understood to relate to the deliverance from Babylon, but must be
viewed as referring to the kingdom of Christ, under whom this deliverance was
obtained through the preaching of the gospel. Besides, it is proper to observe
that this work belongs to God, and not to men; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall stretch out his
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino">; thus ascribing to his heavenly power this
work, which could not have been accomplished by human
ability.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It ought also to be observed, that from
God's past benefits we ought always to entertain good hopes for the future; so
that whenever we call to remembrance the deliverances from Babylon and from
<i>Egypt</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
2:2;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021251&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:51,) we may be convinced that God is equally able, and will equally assist us
at the present day, that he may restore the Church to her ancient glory. What he
did once and again, he is able to do a third time, and a fourth, and many times.
When the Prophet calls those whom he rescues <i>a remnant</i>, let us learn that
we ought not to desire a vast multitude, and let us be satisfied, though we be
few, and let us not be terrified by the smallness of our numbers; for, provided
that the righteousness of God abound, we have true and abundant ground of
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will lift up an ensign to
the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This verse contains nothing more
than the explanation of the former verse. The language is metaphorical, and
admits of two meanings; either that,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by giving an

they will not dare to prevent his people from returning, or that he will

hesitate to make preparations for their return. But even at the present day this
doctrine is highly useful among us; for as an <i>ensign</i> is lifted up in the
army, that the soldiers may assemble, and that every one may follow and may keep
his proper place, so a <i>banner</i> is here held out to us, that we may
assemble to it, namely, the gospel, which the Lord has lifted up among the
Gentiles, by which Christ is preached to
us.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

other way in which he acknowledges us to be <i>his sheep</i>, than when, after
having been <i>scattered</i>, we are

people. <i>Dispersion</i> is a collective noun, for it means the Jews
<i>scattered</i> in all directions; and he appears to allude, as he often does
elsewhere, to similar passages in the writings of Moses, in which the Lord
promises that he will gather the people, though they were scattered to the
farthest parts of the world, and to the four winds of heaven. (Deuteronomy 30:3,
4.) Now, this was done under the direction of Christ. Under the same leader we
ought at the present day to expect the restoration of a wretched and
<i>scattered</i> Church; for there is no hope of <i>gathering the remnant</i>
but by the elect looking to this <i>ensign</i>. We ought frequently, therefore,
to call to remembrance those promises, that by relying on them we may more and
more strengthen our hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the envy of Ephraim shall
depart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he promises that the Church will
be in such a state of peace, that neither will the Israelites and the Jews
contend in civil broils, nor will they suffer any annoyance from their enemies,
and that they will not be liable to hatred or <i>envy</i>, as they formerly
were. Not that there will be no wicked men, but the Lord will at length cut off
and destroy them. But we ought chiefly to observe what he adds about allaying
domestic quarrels, that henceforth the children of Abraham may not harass each
other, but unite in the same religion, and in the pure worship of God; for it
was a disgraceful and shocking spectacle that their mutual strife and
hostilities had been so long maintained.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With
good reason does he point out the source of quarrels, namely, <i>envy</i>, in
consequence of which the descendants of Abraham have torn each other, while the
tribes of <i>Judah</i> and <i>Ephraim</i> strive with each other for renown.
This horrible torch has always kindled wars in the world, while every man is
unwilling to yield. In short, the Lord here promises outward and inward peace,
which is a very great and most desirable
blessing.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be objected that this was
never accomplished, and that the very opposite of this took place; for as soon
as the gospel began, it was followed by various wars, commotions, and dreadful
persecutions, and nearly the whole world was disturbed and shaken. And inwardly
what peace did the Church enjoy? Among Christians themselves, Satan, by his
<i>tares</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401325&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:25,) has raised up dreadful disturbances, so that no enemies were more
ferocious and destructive than those which were brought up in the bosom of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I reply, the Prophet here includes the
whole of Christ's kingdom, and not merely a single age or century. In this world
we taste but the beginning of Christ's kingdom; and while the Church is harassed
by enemies both within and without, still the Lord defends and preserves her,
and conquers all her enemies. Besides, this prediction properly belongs to the
true and lawful children of Abraham, whom the Lord has purified by the cross and
by banishment, and has constrained to lay aside ambition and <i>envy</i>; as
those who have been tamed in the school of Christ cease to be desirous of
renown. Thus the promise which Isaiah makes in this passage has already been in
part fulfilled, and is fulfilled every day. But we must proceed in these
exercises, and must fight earnestly within and without, till we obtain that
everlasting peace which it will be our happiness to enjoy in the kingdom of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

there is also another way in which the Lord will assist his people; which is,
that he will conquer their enemies, and subdue them under his dominion. Having
spoken of the safety of the Church, he now declares that she will be victorious
over her enemies. He mentions those nations with which the Jews incessantly
carried on wars; for on the one hand the <i>Philistines</i>, and on the other
the <i>Ammonites</i> and <i>Moabites</i>, to whom they were bound by the tie of
relationship and kindred, were continually molesting and attacking them. On one
side also were the <i>Edomites</i>, who were not restrained by
blood-relationship from being most determined enemies; for they were descended
from Esau,

25:25, 26, 36:1,8, 9,) the brother of Jacob; and the remembrance of this ought
to have dissuaded them from enmity and hatred. The Lord, therefore, promises
that the Church, though she is not absolutely without enemies, will gain
advantage over them by suffering, and in the end be
victorious.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Edom and

<i>The </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stretching out of the

obtained over her enemies; for by the word <i>hand</i> is usually meant power;
and the Hebrews use the phrase,

Jews, who dream of an earthly kingdom of Christ, interpret all this in a carnal
sense, and apply it to I know not what external power; but they ought rather to
judge of it according to the nature of Christ's kingdom. Partly, no doubt, the
accomplishment of this prediction was seen, when the Jews returned from
captivity, and God brought them into moderate prosperity, contrary to the wish,
and in spite of the opposition, of all the neighboring nations; but believers
were led to expect a more splendid victory, which they at length obtained
through the preaching of the gospel. Although we must continually fight under
the cross, yet we vanquish our enemies, when we are rescued from the tyranny of
the devil and of wicked men, and are restored to liberty by Christ, that the
flesh may be subdued, and our lusts laid low, and that thus we may live to him,
and <i>in patience may possess our souls</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke

subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord will utterly
destroy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this verse he means nothing else
than that the Lord, by his amazing power, will open for his people a way, which
formerly appeared to be shut up. He speaks figuratively. What he calls a
<i>tongue</i> is "a bay of the sea;" for when the sea penetrates into the land,
and occupies a part of it, there is a resemblance to a person putting out his
<i>tongue</i>. He therefore means <i>the Egyptian sea</i> and <i>Egypt</i>
itself, as he afterwards more fully explains. But he chiefly mentions <i>the
sea</i> and the <i>rivers</i>, because they protect the countries and shut up
every entrance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will
stretch out the hand over the river in the strength of his

waters the whole of Egypt, and divides it into many parts, and might thus
interrupt the march of the people when returning to their native country. I have
no doubt that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ruach</i>) here denotes <i>wind</i>, though he adds <i>the</i>
<i>Lord's</i>; for all the <i>winds</i> are <i>the Lord's</i>, because he
regulates and guides according to his pleasure; and more especially this phrase
is employed when it is miraculously agitated by a violent whirlwind. He alludes
to the former deliverance of his people, by which he brought them out of
<i>Egypt</i>; for when the Lord was pleased to open up a way for them, he dried
up the sea by the force and violence of <i>the winds</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:21.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">True, the Lord did not need the
assistance of <i>the winds</i>, for he might have done it by an immediate
exertion of his power. But when he makes use of outward means, let us learn,
first, that all creatures are ready to yield obedience to him; for though they
have a natural course, yet they are in his power, so that he can direct their
force and violence in whatever way he pleases. For instance, when a wind arises,
its beginning proceeds from a natural cause, and each of the winds has its
properties. The south wind is moist, and the north wind is cold, and completely
similar are the effects which proceed from them; for the south wind moistens
bodies, and the north wind dries them. By extraordinary miracles the Lord shows
that he possesses an authority far above these natural causes, so that they are
governed, not by nature, (that is, by that succession of events or chain of
causes which irreligious men imagine to exist,) but by God
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Secondly, he shows that he changes the
nature and order of events whenever he pleases, that he may be acknowledged to
be their only Lord; because such a change exhibits more clearly his authority
and dominion. On this account Isaiah called it not simply <i>the wind</i>, but
<i>the</i> <i>wind of the Lord</i>, that we may perceive that it is not directed
or moved by chance, but by the power <i>of the
Lord</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall smite it
in the seven streams.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render it
<i>torrents</i>, and explain it thus: "he will divide the Nile into <i>seven</i>
parts." Though this exposition has been universally adopted, yet I do not
approve of it; and I think that it has arisen from forgetfulness, rather than
from ignorance, on the part of its authors, who are learned men notwithstanding,
and deeply skilled in the perusal of the ancient writers. It is well known from
history that the Nile had <i>seven</i> mouths. There are others which are little
mentioned, because they had no names, and are therefore called false mouths.
Whatever, then, is the number of the mouths or branches, it appears to form that
number of <i>streams</i> or rivers; and these might have been so many
hinderances to retard their journey. The Prophet expressly mentions them,
because the river was highly
celebrated.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall make
them be shod with shoes.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F182</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The river being deep, he says that he
will dry it up, so that it will not be necessary to pull off their <i>shoes</i>
in crossing it, though this would have been necessary if only a small portion of
water had remained.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By these metaphors,
therefore, the Prophet means nothing else than that nothing will stand in God's
way, when it shall be his pleasure to rescue his people from captivity. He
glances at the history of a former deliverance, that they may learn that it will
be the same with that which they formerly enjoyed. On this account he wished to
place it, as it were, before their eyes; for the means of this deliverance was
not seen. If this promise had been stated in plain terms, it might not have
produced so deep an impression on their minds as by holding out this remarkable
example.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there shall be a
path.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This verse contains nothing new, but
explains the former verse. The people would perceive the same power of God in
the deliverance from Babylon as they had perceived in the deliverance from
Egypt. He had opened up a way through seas,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021429&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:29;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;060316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
3:16, 17.) In like manner, Isaiah says, that by an unexpected and astonishing
method he will again open up a way for his people to go out. Accordingly, what
the Lord has once performed let us also expect for the future; and for that
purpose let us ponder the ancient histories. This ought also to direct our
thoughts to the final deliverance of the Church, by which we shall all be
delivered from all troubles and distresses; so that, though what we are told
about a resurrection and immortal life may appear to be incredible, and the
means of accomplishing them are not seen by us, still the Lord will easily find
a way.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt say in that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now exhorts all the godly to
thanksgiving. Yet the exhortation has also this object, that the promise may be
more fully believed; for he seals it with that exhortation, that they may be
convinced that it is certain, and may not think that they are deluded by
unfounded hope, when a form of thanksgiving is now given, and, as it were, put
into their mouth; and this would not have been the case, if there had not been
just and solid grounds. At the same time, he points out the purpose which the
Lord has in view in doing good in his Church. It is, that the remembrance of his
name may be extolled; not that he needs our praise, but it is profitable to
ourselves. We ought also to consider the honor which he bestows upon us, when he
condescends to make use of our services for extolling and spreading the glory of
his name, though we are altogether useless and of no
value.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt
say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He addresses the whole people as if he
were addressing one man, because it was their duty to be so united as to be one.
We also are taught by the same example that we ought to be united together, that
there may be <i>one soul and one mouth</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though thou wast angry
with me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The leading thought of this song is,
that God, though he was justly offended at his people, yet was satisfied with
inflicting a moderate chastisement, and showed that he was willing to be
pacified. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>) being sometimes expressive of a cause, some render it, <i>I will
praise thee, O Lord,</i> <i>because, having been angry with me, still thou art
immediately</i> <i>reconciled</i>; but as it sometimes signifies
<i>though</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F184</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have adopted the rendering which I
considered to agree best with this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Believers, therefore, first acknowledge
their guilt, and next ascribe it to the mercy of God that they have been freed
from their distresses. The words being in the future tense, the following
interpretation might also be adopted: &#8212; "The temporal chastisement will
not prevent thee from having at length compassion on me, and from giving me
ground of joy and comfort." Whichsoever of these views be taken, this sentiment
ought to be carefully observed; for as soon as a conviction of God's anger
seizes our minds, it prompts us to despair, and if it be not seasonably
counteracted, it will speedily overwhelm us. Satan also tempts us by all
methods, and employs every expedient to compel us to despair. We ought,
therefore, to be fortified by this doctrine, that, though we feel the anger of
the Lord, we may know that it is of short duration,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
30:5,) and that we shall be comforted as soon as he has chastened
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When we have been relieved from distresses,
let us call to remembrance that our punishment is ended, not because we have
paid to the justice of God what we had deserved, but because through his
fatherly love he spares our weakness. This confession belongs properly to the
godly and elect; for though the chastisements of the godly and ungodly appear to
be the same, yet the reasons of them are exceedingly different. The wrath of the
Lord against the ungodly is perpetual, and the chastisements which are inflicted
on them are forerunners of everlasting destruction: no alleviation or
consolation is promised to them. But the godly feel that the wrath of God is of
short duration, and encourage their hearts by hope and confidence; for they know
that God will be gracious to them, since he has declared that he punishes their
sins for no other reason than to train them to repentance, <i>that they may not
perish along with the</i> <i>world</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:32.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, God is my
salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though it is proper to behold by
faith the salvation of God in the midst of our afflictions, yet here Isaiah
speaks of knowledge derived from experience; for he lays down a form of a joyful
song, in which God shows by outward signs that he is pacified towards his
Church. Such is also the import of the phrase
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hinneh</i>,) <i>Behold</i>; for now the brightness of God's countenance,
which had been hidden for a time, shines forth, so that they can point to it as
with the finger. Since, therefore, our punishments fill us with dread, and it is
impossible for our minds not to be overclouded by our sins, as if we had no
interest in God's salvation, or as if it were withdrawn from us, the Prophet
describes here a change of feeling, when God is reconciled to us. But this
prediction relates chiefly to the coming of Christ, which first exhibited fully
the salvation of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
trust and not be afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds, that when we
are fully convinced that salvation is laid up for us in God, this is a solid
foundation of full confidence, and the best remedy for allaying fears. But for
this we must have trembled, and been uneasy and distressed, and tortured by
painful emotions. Hence, we conclude, that confidence proceeds from faith, as an
effect from its cause. By faith we perceive that salvation is laid up for us in
God, and a calm and peaceful state of mind arises from it; but when faith is
wanting there can be no peace of conscience. Let us therefore know that we have
made good progress in faith, when we have been endued with such confidence as
the Prophet describes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, this confidence
ought to have <i>the chief place in our</i> <i>hearts</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:15,) so as to banish all fear and dread; not that we are free from all
distress and uneasiness, but that assurance will at length be victorious. Yet we
must keep in mind what I said, that the Prophet here speaks of the cheerfulness
which believers, who had formerly been almost overwhelmed under the load of
temptations, obtain, when God is reconciled to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord
</i>JEHOVAH<i> is my strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He states more
clearly and more expressly that believers will have good reason to sing, because
they will have known by experience that they are <i>strong</i> in their God, as
indeed redemption was an illustrious display of the power of God. Since Isaiah
does not describe the benefit of a single day, but that which God had determined
to carry forward till the coming of Christ, it follows that there are none who
sincerely and heartily sing the praises of God, but those who, convinced of
their weakness, seek to obtain strength from God alone in answer to prayer. Nor
is he here called a part or an aid of our strength, but our complete
<i>strength</i>; for we are strong, so far as he supplies us with
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my
song.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The reason why he is called <i>The song
of the godly</i> is, that he bestows on them so much kindness for the purpose of
exciting them to perform the duty of thankfulness. Hence we conclude that the
beginning of joy springs from the favor of God, and that the end of it is <i>the
sacrifice of praise</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
50:23; Hebrew 14:2; Hebrew 13:15.) Thus, the hearts of the godly ought to be
trained to patience, that they may not cease to bless God; but in a state of joy
and prosperity their mouth is opened, so that they loudly proclaim God's
benefits. But since the ungodly freely indulge in despising God, and, having
laid their consciences asleep, riot like brutes in drunken mirth, and never
awake to praise God, Christ justly curses their joy.</font><br></div>

favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You shall draw waters with
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this verse he confirms what we have
already noticed, that this chapter may be regarded as a seal to confirm the
promise which he gave about the redemption of his people. As if he had said,
"The salvation of God hath been set before you, as if it were a constant running
<i>fountain</i>, from which you can
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>draw
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in abundance." This is a very beautiful
metaphor; for in this life nothing is more necessary than <i>water</i>, so that
there is no kind of scarcity that gives us more uneasiness or more distress than
a scarcity of <i>water</i>. Thus, by a figure of speech, in which a part is
taken for the whole, he declares that everything necessary for supporting life
flows to us from the undeserved goodness of God. And since we are empty and
destitute of everything good, he appropriately compares the mercy of God to a
<i>fountain</i>, which satisfies those who are thirsty and dry, refreshes those
who are parched with heat, and revives those who are worn out with
fatigue.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the fountains of

consolation when we know that he is the author of our salvation, and therefore
the Prophet has skilfully adapted this term to the situation in which it is
placed. Now, if this promise includes the whole of Christ's reign, we ought
constantly to apply it to our use. Let us therefore know that the goodness of
God is held out to us, that we may be satisfied with it; for we ought to be like

143:6,) that we may desire the waters of the Lord. This goodness of God is
wonderful and beyond what could have been believed, that he does not suffer us
to burn with unsatisfied desire, but presents <i>a fountain</i> from which we
may <i>draw</i> abundantly. That <i>fountain</i> is Christ, in whom all God's
benefits are imparted to us; <i>for out of his fullness</i>, as John says, <i>we
all draw</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

worship of God; so after having enjoined them individually to be thankful to

life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Call upon his

(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
Scripture frequently describes the whole of worship under the designation of
<i>calling upon God</i>. In this way we show that our confidence is placed in
God; and this is also what he chiefly demands from us. In like manner, I think
that here the Prophet connects <i>calling upon</i> God with praises, in order to
include the whole of the worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make known his works

He means that the work of this deliverance will be so excellent, that it ought
to be proclaimed, not in one corner only, but throughout the whole world. He
wished, indeed, that it should be first <i>made known</i> to the Jews, but that
it should afterwards spread abroad to all men. This exhortation, by which the
Jews testified their gratitude, might be regarded as a forerunner of the
preaching of the gospel, which afterwards followed in the proper order. As the
Jews proclaimed among the Medes and Persians, and other neighboring nations, the
favor which had been showed to them, so, when Christ was manifested, they ought
to have been heralds to sound aloud the name of God through every country in the
world. Hence it is evident what is the desire which ought to be cherished among
all the godly. It is, that the goodness of God may be <i>made known</i> to all,
that all may join in the same worship of God. We ought especially to be inflamed
with this desire, after having been delivered from some alarming danger, and
most of all after having been delivered from the tyranny of the devil and from
everlasting death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sing unto the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues his exhortation, showing
what is the feeling from which this thanksgiving ought to proceed; for he shows
that it is our duty to proclaim the goodness of God to every nation. While we
exhort and encourage others, we must not at the same time sit down in indolence,
but it is proper that we set an example before others; for nothing can be more
absurd than to see lazy and slothful men who are exciting other men to praise
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he hath done glorious
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he asserts that God <i>hath</i>
<i>done gloriously</i>, he means that there is abundant ground for singing. The
Lord does not wish that his praises should be proclaimed without any reason, but
holds out a very rich and very abundant subject of praise, when he frees his
people from very hard bondage. We have said that this song is not limited to a
short period, but, on the contrary, extends to the whole of Christ's reign. This
work therefore is truly glorious, that <i>God sent his Son</i> to reconcile us
to himself,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:16, 17,) and to destroy the dominion of death and the devil.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews

we shall have very abundant ground for praising
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this hath been made
known through all the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he says that
this <i>hath been made known</i>, he glances at the calling of the Gentiles, and
confirms what has been already stated, that the work is such as ought not to be
concealed in a corner, but to be everywhere
proclaimed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shout and

the Lord, at the same time reminding them what is the nature of true joy, and on
what it is founded. We have no other happiness than to have God dwelling <i>in
the midst of us</i>. But for this, our life would be wretched and unhappy,
though we should have abundance of other blessings and of every kind of riches.
Now, if our heart be set on our <i>treasure</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Holy

prove himself to be to us, while he dwells with us; that is, that not only his
majesty may fill our minds with reverence towards him, for it would at the same
time overwhelm us with terror; but that he may vouchsafe to make us the objects
of his peculiar care, though separated from the rest of the world. He calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Holy

gathering us to himself,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:10,) and saving us by his grace, he may be said to <i>sanctify</i> us to be
his own property. Accordingly, if God is with us, the conviction of his presence
will fill us with inconceivable joy. Hence it follows that, when he is absent,
we continue to be exposed to grief and
sadness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shout and

power </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the midst of

Again, by directly addressing </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
inhabitants of Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates that all are
not capable of so great a blessing, and at the same time indirectly exhorts them
to maintain unity of faith, that, by being united to the Church, we may partake
of this blessed joy.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The burden of Babylon<u>.</u></i></font><font face="Palatino"> From this chapter
down to the twenty-fourth, the Prophet foretells what dreadful and shocking
calamities awaited the Gentiles and those countries which were best known to the
Jews, either on account of their being contiguous to them, or on account of the
transactions of commerce and alliances; and he does so not without weighty
reasons. When various changes are taking place, some think that God sports with
the affairs of men, and others, that everything is directed by the blind
violence of fortune, as profane history sufficiently testifies; very few are
aware that these things are appointed and regulated by the purpose of God. There
is nothing of which it is more difficult to convince men than that the
providence of God governs this world. Many indeed acknowledge it in words, but
very few have it actually engraven on their heart. We tremble and shudder at the
very smallest change, and we inquire into the causes, as if it depended on the
decision of men. What then shall be done, when the whole world is thrown into
commotion, and the face of affairs is so completely changed in various places,
that it appears as if everything were going to
ruin?</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was therefore highly useful that Isaiah
and other prophets should discourse about calamities of this nature, that all
might understand that those calamities did not take place but by the secret and
wonderful purpose of God. If they had uttered no prediction on those subjects,
such a disordered state of affairs might have shaken and disturbed the minds of
the godly; but when they knew long beforehand that this would happen, they had
in the event itself a mirror of the providence of God. When <i>Babylon</i> was
taken, which they had previously learned from the mouth of the Prophet, their
own experience taught them that the prediction had not been made in vain, or
without solid grounds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But there was also
another reason why the Lord commanded that the destruction of <i>Babylon</i> and
other nations should be foretold. These predictions were of no advantage to
<i>Babylon</i> or the other nations, and these writings did not reach them; but
by this consolation he intended to alleviate the grief of the godly, that they
might not be discouraged, as if their condition were worse than that of the
Gentiles; which they would have had good reason to conclude, if they had seen
them unpunished escape the hand of God. If the monarchy of Babylon had remained
unshaken, the Jews would not only have thought that it was in vain for them to
worship God, and that his covenant which he had made with Abraham had not been
fulfilled, since it fared better with strangers and wicked men than with the
elect people; but a worse suspicion might have crept into their minds, that God
showed favor to accursed robbers, who gave themselves up to deeds of dishonesty
and violence, and despised all law both human and divine. Indeed, they might
soon have come to think that God did not care for his people, or could not
assist them, or that everything was directed by the blind violence of fortune.
Accordingly, that they might not faint or be thrown into despair, the Prophet
meets them with the consoling influence of this prediction, showing that the
<i>Babylonians</i> also will be
punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, the comparison taught them
how severe was the punishment that awaited them, which they had knowingly and
willingly brought upon themselves. For if God pronounces such dreadful
threatenings against the unbelieving and irreligious Gentiles, who wandered in
darkness, how much greater will be his rigour and severity against a rebellious
people who have intentionally sinned against him!</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The servant who knoweth
his master's will, and doeth it not, is justly beaten with many stripes.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421247&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
12:47.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus when God threatened such dreadful punishment
against the blind Gentiles, the Jews, who had been instructed in the law, might
behold as in a mirror what they had
deserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the chief design which Isaiah had
in view in these predictions was, to point out to the Jews how dear and valuable
their salvation was in the sight of God, when they saw that he undertook their
cause and revenged the injuries which had been done to them. He spoke first of
the desolation and ruin that would befall the kingdom of Judah and of Israel,
because <i>judgment must begin</i> at the house of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:17.) God takes a peculiar care of his own people, and gives his chief
attention to them. Whenever therefore we read these predictions, let us learn to
apply them to our use. The Lord does not indeed, at the present day, foretell
the precise nature of those events which shall befall kingdoms and nations; but
yet the government of the world, which he undertook, is not abandoned by him.
Whenever therefore we behold the destruction of cities, the calamities of
nations, and the overturning of kingdoms, let us call those predictions to
remembrance, that we may be humbled under God's chastisements, may learn to
gather wisdom from the affliction of others, and may pray for an alleviation of
our own grief.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
burden.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to the word <i>burden</i>, which
frequently occurs, I shall state briefly in what sense it ought to be
understood. It was generally employed by the prophets of God, whenever they
threatened any afflictive event, in order to inform the people that no
afflictive event happened which the Lord himself did not lay as a burden on
men's shoulders. The wickedness and obstinacy of the people having constrained
the prophets to preach incessantly about God's chastisements, the consequence
was, that as a matter of ordinary jesting they called all the prophecies by the
name of <i>a burden</i>; as is evident from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242336&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:36, where the Lord kindles into fierce indignation, because they not only
spoke of his word contemptuously, but also held it up to dislike. This word
makes known to the godly, that the Lord appoints all calamities and afflictions,
that every one may suffer the punishment of his own
sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which Isaiah, the son of
Amoz, saw.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expressly states that what he is
about to utter was revealed to him by a heavenly <i>vision</i>, that the weight
which is thus given to it may render it victorious over all the judgments
pronounced by the flesh. It was difficult to believe that a monarchy so
flourishing, and so prodigiously rich, could be overturned in any way. Their
eyes being dazzled by beholding such vast power, the Prophet draws away their
attention from it to believe the heavenly revelation, that they may expect by
faith the judgment of God which they could not comprehend by the unaided
exercise of their own
minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
word <i>mountain</i> contains a metaphor; for the discourse relates to
<i>Babylon</i>, which, we know, was situated on a plain; but with a view to its
extensive dominion, he has assigned to it an elevated situation, like a fortress
set on high above all nations. But perhaps it will be thought better to take the
word <i>mountain</i> as used indefinitely; as if he had said, "When a signal is
given these will be a vast assemblage from very distant countries, because all
men will be attracted towards it by the wide and extensive influence of the
sight;" and, indeed, I consider this opinion to be more probable, but I chose to
mention at first the opinion which had been commonly received. Yet it might be
thought absurd that the Prophet here enjoins the creatures to yield, as it were,
obedience to him, if God had not fortified the Prophet by his instructions and
authority. A private man here commands the Medes and Persians, assembles armies,
orders </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a banner to be lifted
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and sounds the trumpet for
battle.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This should therefore lead us to
consider the majesty of God, in whose name he spoke, and likewise the power and
efficacy which is always joined with the word. Such modes of expression are
frequently found in the Prophets, that, by placing the events as it were before
our eyes, he may enable us to see that God threatens nothing by his servants
which he is not ready immediately to execute. Isaiah might indeed have
threatened in plain and direct terms, "The Persians and Medes will come, and
will burst through the gates of <i>Babylon</i>, notwithstanding the prodigious
strength of its fortifications." But those exclamations are far more energetic,
when he not only assumes the character of a herald and proclaims war, but, as if
he exercised the highest authority, orders the Medes and Persians to assemble
like hired soldiers. Not only does he show that they will be ready at the
bidding of God, because they are moved by his secret influence; but, having been
sent by God to announce the ruin of Babylon, he claims for his own voice the
accomplishment of what appeared to be beyond belief. It amounts to this, "When
God hath spoken about what shall happen, we ought to entertain no doubt
concerning it." It deserves our notice also, that he describes the Persians and
Medes, without mentioning their names; for that threatening is more emphatic,
when he points them out, as it were, with the finger, as when we say, "This and
that man." This contributes to the certainty of the prophecy, when he points out
such distant events as if they were at
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shake the hand, that
they may enter within the gates of the nobles.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shake the hand, and
they shall enter</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that the Persians
and Medes shall no sooner begin to advance at the command of God than their road
shall be plain and easy in spite of every obstruction. Though the Hebrews call
Princes
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybydn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>Nedibim</i>,) that is, <i>generous and bountiful</i>, on which is also

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
22:25,) yet I think that the Prophet draws our attention to the splendor of
power in which the Babylonians gloried. They were furnished above others with
forces and warlike armaments, so that it appeared to be incredible that they
could ever be vanquished. But the Prophet threatens that nothing shall hinder
God from opening up a way and entrance to the
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have commanded my sanctified

F189</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet introduces the Lord as
speaking and issuing his commands. He calls the Medes and Persians
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctified
ones</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, those whom he has
<i>prepared</i>. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kadash</i>) is used in various senses; for sometimes it refers to the spirit
of regeneration, and this belongs peculiarly to the elect of God. But sometimes
it means to <i>wish</i> or <i>prepare</i>, and that meaning is more appropriate
to this passage. All who are created by the Lord are likewise <i>appointed</i>
by him for a fixed purpose. He does not throw down men at random on the earth,
to go wherever they please, but guides all by his secret purpose, and regulates
and controls the violent passions of the reprobate, so as to drive them in
whatever manner he thinks fit, and to check and restrain them according to his
pleasure. He therefore calls them <i>sanctified ones</i>, "set apart and
prepared to execute his will," though they had no such intention. Hence also we
are taught to ascribe to the secret judgment of God all violent commotions, and
this yields wonderful consolation; for whatever attempts may be made by wicked
men, yet they will accomplish nothing but what the Lord has
decreed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have also called my
mighty ones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
called</i></font><font face="Palatino">, conveys more than the phrase, <i>I have
commanded</i>, which he had used in the former clause. It means that they will
be roused to action, not only at the bidding of God, but by the very sound of
his voice; as if I were to <i>call</i> a person to me, and he were immediately
to follow. He threatens, therefore, that <i>Babylon</i> shall be destroyed by
the Medes and Persians, in the same manner as if they obeyed the call of God;
for though they were prompted to battle by their own ambition, pride, and
cruelty, yet God directed them, without knowing it, to execute his
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The noise of a multitude in the
mountains.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds a still more lively
representation,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpotu&gt;pwson</font><font face="Palatino">,)
that is, a description by which he places the event as it were before our eyes.
The prophets are not satisfied with speaking, without also giving a bold picture
of the events themselves. Words uttered plainly, and in the ordinary manner, do
not strike us so powerfully or move our hearts so much as those figures which
delineate a lively resemblance of the events. As if he had said, "Now, indeed,
you hear a man speaking, but know that this voice will be so powerful that at
the sound of it <i>nations</i> shall be roused, <i>peoples</i> shall make a
<i>noise</i>, and in vast crowds shall shout and roar to bring destruction on
the inhabitants of <i>Babylon</i>. This proclamation, therefore, will be as
efficacious, even after that I am dead, as if you now saw what I foretell to
you."</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this event, therefore, we see how great
is the efficacy of the word, which all the creatures both in heaven and in earth
obey. We ought to be more strongly confirmed in the belief of this doctrine, by
perceiving that every one of the events which had been predicted many centuries
before has taken place. For this reason he declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the </i>Lord<i> of hosts
mustereth the host of the battle,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that the
various nations are moved by God's direction, and that, although nothing was
farther from their intention than to inflict the punishment which he had
appointed, still they do nothing but according to his command, as if some
earthly general were to draw up his
forces.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Coming from a distant
country.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He repeats and confirms more fully
what I stated a little before, that the operations of war do not spring up at
random from the earth; for though everything disorderly is vomited out by the
passions of men, yet God rules on high; and therefore Isaiah justly ascribes
sovereignty to God. Next, he adds, that armed men are nothing else than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the weapons of his
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He says that they will come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from a distant
country</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to overturn the monarchy of
<i>Babylon</i>, because we are not afraid of dangers unless when they are close
at hand. <i>Babylon</i> was so strongly fortified, and was surrounded by so many
kingdoms and provinces which were subject to it, that it seemed as if there were
no way by which an enemy could approach. In short, as if she had been situated
in the clouds, she dreaded no
danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the end of
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There being no trouble all around that
threatened them, he gives warning that the calamity will come from a distance.
Though everything appears to be calm and peaceful, and though we are not at
variance with our neighbors, God can bring enemies
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the end of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no reason, therefore, why we
should promise to ourselves a lasting and prosperous condition, though we are
not threatened with any immediate danger. If this prediction had reached the
inhabitants of <i>Babylon</i>, they would undoubtedly have laughed at it as a
fable. Even if we should suppose that they paid some respect to the Prophet,
yet, having so strong a conviction of their safety, they would have despised
those threatenings as idle and groundless. An example may be easily found. When
we preach at the present day about the Turk, all think that it is a fable,
because they think that he is still at a great distance from us. But we see how
quickly he overtook those who were at a greater distance and more powerful. So
great is the insensibility of men that they cannot be aroused, unless they are
chastised and made to feel the blows. Let the inhabitants of Babylon, therefore,
be a warning to us, to dread, before it is too late, the threatenings which the
prophets utter, that the same thing may not happen to us as happens to those
wicked men, who, relying on their prosperous condition, are so terrified when
the hand of God attacks and strikes them, that they can no longer stand, but
sink down bewildered.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To

he looks to the extent of the kingdom; that they may not think that the great
number of provinces, by which they were surrounded on all sides, could ward off
the attacks of enemies. But at the same time he intimates that it will be no
slight calamity affecting a single spot, but will be like a deluge overwhelming
a large portion of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah and the vessels

F190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Persians and Medes are called
<i>vessels of anger</i> in a different sense from that in which Paul gives that

wrath</i> with <i>the vessels of mercy</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450922&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:22,23,) he shows that the undeserved goodness of God shines in the elect, but
that the reprobate are monuments of severe judgment. But Isaiah means that the
Medes and Persians may be regarded as darts in the hand of God, that by means of
them he may execute his vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl

the inhabitants of Babylon <i>howl</i>. Not that he directs instruction to them,
as if he hoped that it would be of any advantage, but, in foretelling what shall
be their condition, he emphatically employs this form of direct
address.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the day of the
Lord is at hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls it <i>the day of
the</i> Lord, according to the usual custom of Scripture, because when the Lord
delays his judgment, he appears to cease from the discharge of his office, like
judges when they do not ascend the judgment-seat. This mode of expression
deserves notice, for we would gladly subject God to our disposal, that he might
immediately pass sentence against the wicked. But he has his own appointed time,
and knows the seasons when it is proper both to punish the bad and to assist the
good.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall come as

There is therefore an elegant allusion to the derivation of the word; as if he

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore all hands shall be

to destroy the inhabitants of Babylon will be so great, that they shall have no
means of withstanding his anger. Though they stood high in wealth and in power,
yet their <i>hearts</i> would be so <i>faint</i>, and their <i>hands</i> so
<i>weak</i>, that they would have neither disposition nor ability to resist. And
thus he indirectly ridicules the cruelty which boiled in the hearts of the
Babylonians; for it is in the power of God to soften <i>hearts</i>, and to
crush, loosen, or enfeeble <i>hands</i> or <i>arms</i>, so that suddenly all
their courage shall fall down, and all their strength shall vanish away. When
the heart quakes, what will be the use of fortifications, or armies, or wealth,
or bulwarks? What avails a well-stocked workshop without a workman? We see this
every day exemplified in those to whom in other respects the Lord had
communicated large resources. Hence we see how vain is that confidence which we
place in outward resources; for they would be of no use to us, if the Lord
should strike our hearts with any
alarm.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

(<i>tzirim</i>) being ambiguous, the Greek translators render it
<i>ambassadors</i>. But the comparison of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a woman that
travaileth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which is added immediately
afterwards, sufficiently proves that it denotes <i>pangs</i>; for here, as if by
a single word, he explains what he had previously said, that their <i>hearts</i>
shall be <i>melted</i> and their <i>hands</i> shall be <i>weakened</i>; because,
he says, they shall be struck with terror and dismay. Whence comes this terror?
From God. This kind of terror, for which there was no apparent cause, the
ancients called a <i>panic</i>;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F193</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for they gave the name <i>panes</i> to
apparitions and objects of this sort, by which men were terrified, even when
there was no outward object that ought to have excited the terror. It was not
without reason that they did so; but still they erred through gross ignorance,
because they did not understand that it proceeded from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a woman that
travaileth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So far as relates to the
inhabitants of Babylon, there was, indeed, just ground of fear, when they saw
that they were attacked by valiant and warlike nations; but yet the Prophet
threatens that, though they were able to resist, still they would be like men
who were half dead, because through the secret operation of God they fainted and
fell down. To the same purpose is what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall be amazed at his
neighbor;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as when men are agitated and stare
around them in every direction; and not only so, but when no hope of safety is

to indolence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Faces of flames
their faces.</i></font><font face="Palatino">

This clause, in which he attributes to them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faces of
flames</i></font><font face="Palatino">, expresses still more strongly the
violence of the terror. Some think that it denotes <i>shame</i>, as if he had
said in a single word, <i>They shall blush</i>; but this is too feeble. Isaiah
intended to express something greater and more dreadful; for when we are in
agony the <i>face</i> glows, and the pressure of grief makes us burn. And,
indeed, it would be treating the matter too lightly, when the calamity was so
severe, to interpret these words as denoting <i>shame</i>; for he describes a
calamity so distressing, that, on account of its severity, <i>flames</i> burst
forth from the countenance, which usually happens when men are agonized by
intense grief.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The comparison of <i>a
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>travailing
woman</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes not only the intensity of the
grief, but likewise the suddenness with which it seized them. As the calamity
would be severe and violent, so Isaiah threatens that it will be sudden, and not
without good reason; for the inhabitants of Babylon, protected by such strong
defences, would never have thought that it was possible for any annoyance to
reach or distress
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Behold the day of the Lord will come cruel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
repeats what he had slightly noticed a little before, that though the
inhabitants of Babylon are now at ease, and rely on their wealth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day of the Lord

desirable than to have God present with us; for his presence alone makes us
truly happy? I answer, we ought always to consider who they are that are
addressed by the Prophet; for it is customary with the prophets to give various
descriptions of God corresponding to the diversity of the hearers. In like
manner, David also declares that God is</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">merciful to the merciful,
and cruel and severe to the ungodly.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">What could wicked men imagine to be in God but the
utmost severity? And therefore the slightest mention of God fills them with
terror.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The godly, on the other hand, whenever
the name of God is mentioned, derive the greatest delight and joy from hearing
it; so that nothing can be more highly gratifying. Thus, when the prophets
address the godly, as soon as they have mentioned God, they speak of joy and
gladness, because the godly will feel that he is gracious and merciful to them;
but when they address the ungodly, they hold out the judgment of God, and speak
of grief and mourning. As the godly are cheered by the presence of God, because
by faith they behold his goodness; so the ungodly are terrified, because the
testimony of their conscience reproves and convinces them that he comes as a
severe Judge. Since even hypocrites pretend that they eagerly long for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day of the
Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and boast that he will assist them, the
prophets tear off from them this disguise, and show that to them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day of the

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:18,20.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah applies the usual description
to this prophecy, in order to show more fully how much we ought to dread the
wrath of God; for, being by nature slow, or rather stupid, we would not be
powerfully affected if the Lord spoke in plain terms about his judgments. Since,
therefore, an unadorned style would be too cold, he contrived new modes of
expression, that by means of them he might shake off our sluggishness. When he
says<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he shall destroy
the sinners thereof out of it,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means by
<i>sinners</i> not all men without distinction but the ungodly and wicked men
who inhabited Babylon.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the stars of

stronger and more distressing fear of the judgment of God, the prophets are
accustomed to add to their threatenings extravagant modes of speaking, which
place the anger of God, as it were, before their eyes, and affect all our
senses, as if all the elements were now arising to execute his vengeance. And
yet the expressions, though unusually strong, do not go beyond the dreadful
nature of what took place; for it is impossible to exhibit an image of the
judgment of God so alarming that the reality shall not be felt to be more
revolting and terrible.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sun</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
moon</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and <i>the stars</i> are mentioned,
because they are striking proofs of God's fatherly kindness towards us. Hence
also Christ shows that it is an eminent proof of the goodness of God
that</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, when the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> and
<i>stars</i> shine in heaven, God may be said to cheer us by his bright and
gracious countenance. Since therefore in the brightness of heaven God shows a
cheerful and friendly countenance, as if he might be said to smile upon us, the
darkness which the Prophet describes conveys the thought, that God, by hiding
his face, cast the men with whom he was angry into the darkness of
sorrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A similar description is given by the
Prophet Joel.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The sun shall be turned

<div><font face="Palatino">We have already said that this mode of expression is
frequently employed by the prophets, in order to inform us that everything will
tend to our destruction, when God is against us. Sometimes indeed God gives
tokens of his anger by means of <i>the stars</i>; but that is out of the usual
course of events, and the <i>darkness</i> which the Prophet now describes will
not take place till the second coming of Christ. But we ought to be satisfied
with knowing that all the creatures, which by discharging their duties to us are
proofs and instruments of God's fatherly kindness, not only cease to be useful
to us, when God arises to judgment, but in some measure are armed for
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will visit upon the
world wickedness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet does not
speak of the whole <i>world</i>; but as Babylon was the seat of the most
powerful of all monarchies, he gives to it on that account the name of <i>the
world</i>, and he does so emphatically,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejmfatikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
for Babylon was a kind of <i>world</i>, because it appeared to occupy nearly the
whole earth. And yet he means that there is nothing in this world so lofty that
Good cannot easily seize it with one of his fingers. At the same time he gives
warning that God will punish the cruelty which was exercised by the Chaldeans.
Yet we ought also to learn that the wickedness and crimes of Babylon are brought
forward, in order to inform us that the Lord will not be cruel in punishing her
so severely, because he inflicts the punishment which that people deserved on
account of their transgressions and crimes. Every ground of calumny is therefore
taken away, that we may not think that God delights in the afflictions of men;
for when he thus deals with men according as they deserve, <i>the mouths</i>
<i>of all must be stopped</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:19,) since the severity of the afflictions does not proceed from God, but
finds its cause in men
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will cause the
arrogancy of the proud to cease.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must keep
in mind what I have already noticed, that the Prophet yields no small
consolation to the godly by assuring them that God, though he spares the
inhabitants of Babylon for a time, will at length punish them for their
injustice and cruelty. He expresses this still more clearly by taking notice of
a particular vice, namely, <i>pride</i>, in consequence of which they loosed the
reins, and gave unbounded freedom to their lawless desires to oppress the
wretched. For this reason also he reproves their <i>tyranny</i>. But we ought
also to draw from it a profitable doctrine, that it is impossible for us to
escape punishment from the Lord, if we are puffed up with vain confidence and
flatter ourselves. The Prophet here includes every kind of <i>pride</i>; whether
men think that they are something, or admire their riches, and despise others in
comparison of themselves. God cannot endure any arrogancy, or suffer it to pass
unpunished. Seeing therefore, that among a great variety of other crimes with
which Babylon abounded, this was the greatest and most remarkable, it was
chiefly by their pride that the wrath of God was
kindled.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will lay low the
loftiness of tyrants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>Arrogance</i> was
joined, as it usually is, to violence and cruelty; and therefore he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the loftiness of
tyrants</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for when men despise others, this is
followed by deeds of violence and injustice and oppression; and it is impossible
for men to abstain from doing harm to others, if they do not lay aside all
conceit and high estimation of themselves. Let us willingly, therefore, bring
down our minds to true humility, if we do not wish to be cast down and laid low
to our destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make a man more precious
than pure gold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he describes in a
particular manner how cruel and savage will be the war that is carried on
against Babylon. In like manner believers, instructed by these predictions,
implore in the spirit of prophecy what is the utmost exertion of the cruelty
exercised in wars, that the Persians and Medes may tear the infants from their
mothers' breasts, <i>and dash them</i> <i>against the stones</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:9.) The general meaning is, that Babylon will not only be destroyed, but
will be devoted to utter extermination; for when he says that the life of <i>a
man shall be more</i> <i>precious than gold</i>, he asserts that the enemies
will be so eager to shed blood, that it will be impossible to rescue a man out
of their hands at any price, because they will choose rather to kill than to
accept a ransom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, Was this
destruction as cruel as Isaiah here describes it to be? For history gives a
different account, and Daniel himself, who was an eye-witness of this
destruction, relates that the city was only taken, for the Medes and Persians
spared the citizens and inhabitants. This argument has constrained some
commentators to apply allegorically to all the reprobate what is here related of
Babylon; but in doing so they have overstrained the passage, for shortly
afterwards (verse. 17) the Prophet names the Medes and Persians. Besides, those
threatenings which will afterwards follow in their proper order, against the
Edomites, Moabites, the inhabitants of Tyre and of Egypt, and other nations,
sufficiently show that the present discourse is directed literally against the
Chaldeans, to whom the Prophet assigns the first rank; not that their
destruction was as close at hand as that of other nations, but because none of
the enemies of the Church were more
dangerous.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It ought to be observed that Isaiah
did not utter this prediction while the monarchy of Nineveh was still
flourishing; but all that he predicted against heathen nations, during the whole
course of his ministry, was collected into one book. Thus the order of events
was not observed, but a similarity of subject was the reason why all these
prophecies were put into one place. How comes it that Isaiah takes no notice of
Nineveh, since he afterwards mentions that the Assyrians alone attacked the
Jews, (for the Babylonians lived at peace with them,) but because he does not
relate the history of his own time till the twenty-third chapter, but prophesies
about the judgments of God which happened after his
death?</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, when he declares that Babylon will
be utterly destroyed, it is certain that he does not merely describe a single
calamity, but includes the destruction which followed long afterwards. After
having been subdued by the Persians, Babylon continued to flourish, and held the
name and rank of a very celebrated city. And although the city Ctesiphon was
founded for the purpose of attracting a portion of its splendor and wealth, yet
the convenience of its situation, the costly buildings, and the fortifications
of the city, rendered it, with the exception of royal rank, not inferior to
Persis. Even after the death of Alexander the Great, when Seleucia was built at
no great distance, still it could not obliterate the name and reputation of the
ancient city. Hence we conclude that those events which are here foretold cannot
be limited to a single period.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not without
reason, however, that the Prophet pronounces such fearful threatening against
them, since the revolution of the empire was the forerunner of the various
calamities which followed afterwards. Though the people were not entirely slain,
yet as the city was taken by storm, and by a sudden assault at the hour of
midnight, while the whole court was carousing in drunken revels, it was
impossible but that the Medes and Persians must have slain all that came in
their way. There can be no doubt, therefore, that there was a great slaughter
before the conquerors extended their protection to the whole of the people as
having surrendered at discretion. Who can doubt that this haughty nation was
roughly handled by barbarian conquerors, for in no other way could it have been
reduced to obedience?</font><br><font face="Palatino">Having been gradually
weakened, not long afterwards, Babylon again changed its master, and, after
having been ooverned for a short period by Alexander, king of Macedon,
immediately passed under the dominion of Seleucus, who endeavored by every
method to degrade it till it was completely ruined. Thus, so long as God
permitted the city to remain in existence, it presented a shameful and revolting
spectacle to the whole world, that the accomplishment of the prophecy might be
more evident and more impressive. Hence the Prophet Isaiah has good reason for
asserting that the anger of God will not be appeased till that den of robbers be
utterly destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A mortal
and a man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So far as relates to the words, some
translators render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wna</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>enosh</i>) a <i>warlike</i> or <i>eminent</i> man, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;da</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>adam</i>) an <i>ordinary</i> man. But as the etymology does not correspond
to this view, and as I do not think that it occurred to the Prophet's mind, I
consider it to be rather a repetition of the same sentiment, such as we know to
have been customary among the Hebrews. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zp</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>paz</i>,) which, in common with other translators, I have rendered <i>pure
gold</i>, is supposed by some to mean <i>a pearl</i>; but from many passages of
Scripture we conclude that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the purest and finest
gold.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I will shake the
heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is another figure of speech which
contributes in a similar manner to heighten the picture. God cannot too
earnestly urge this doctrine, not only to terrify the wicked, but to afford
consolation to the godly, who are often distressed when it is well with the
wicked, and when everything succeeds to their wish. David acknowledges that this
happened to himself; for he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Surely in vain have I
purified my heart,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and washed any
hands in innocency.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
73:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Properly, therefore, are these pictures set before
our eyes, that they may plainly declare to us the destruction of the wicked.
Thus it is as if Isaiah had said, "Though
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>moved</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that the ungodly may be <i>shaken</i> and destroyed, nevertheless this will take
place." They think that they are out of all danger, and that they have struck
their roots so deep that they cannot be rooted out; but he shows that they are
greatly deceived, for the Lord will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>move both heaven and
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> rather than not cast them down headlong.
Hence it follows that, though the world present to us a thousand supports both
above and below, still there will be no permanency but through the favor of God.
And if this is made known in judgments of God relating to particular cases, how
much more in the universal judgment, when Christ will ascend his magnificent
judgment-seat, to destroy the
ungodly!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be as the chased
roe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shows that auxiliary troops will be of
no avail to the Babylonians, and by these comparisons he describes the fear
which shall seize the soldiers. Babylon employed not only her own soldiers, but
likewise foreign and hired soldiers. He says that they will all be like
<i>roes</i>, which are timorous creatures, and like scattered <i>sheep</i>, so
that they will neither repair to their <i>standards</i> or their <i>post</i>,
nor preserve any order.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every
one to his own land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence it is easily seen
that the Prophet speaks, not only of the natives, or even of the strangers who
had formerly dwelt there, but of foreigners who had been brought for the
protection of the city. We have formerly said that the hearts of men are in the
hand of God in such a manner that, according to his pleasure, either those who
formerly were timid or cowardly persons suddenly acquire fresh courage, or those
who formerly boasted loudly of being bold and daring lose their fierceness and
become effeminate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one that is found shall be
thrust through.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he confirms what he had
formerly said, that none shall escape from Babylon, and that all who shall be
there shall perish. Xenophon also relates that, by the command of Cyrus, they
slew every one that they met in the beginning of the night, and next day all
that had not laid down their arms.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But we have already said that the
prediction extends farther; for that slaughter was only the forerunner of
others, for which Babylon was purposely preserved, that it might frequently be
ruined.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every one that is
joined to them shall fall by the sword.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some
translators render this clause differently from what I have done; because the
Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hps</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>saphah</i>) signifies to <i>destroy</i> or <i>consume</i>, they read it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever shall be
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and explain it as relating to the
old men, who were already worn out with age, and could not otherwise live
longer; as if he had said, "Not even the men of advanced age, who are sinking
into the grave, shall be spared, even though they are half-dead, and appear to
be already giving up the ghost." But because that is a feeble interpretation,
and the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hps</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>saphah</i>) signifies likewise <i>to add</i>, I rather agree with
Jonathan</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and others, who think that it denotes
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>companies of
soldiers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as in taking a city the soldiers are
collected together in the form of a wedge, to ward off the attacks of the enemy.
But it will perhaps be thought better to understand by it the
<i>confederates</i> or <i>allies</i> who were <i>joined</i> to Babylon, and
might be said to be united in the same body, in order to show more fully the
shocking nature of this
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Their children shall be dashed in pieces.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
draws a picture of extreme cruelty. It is the utmost pitch of ferocity exercised
by an invading army, when no age is spared, and infants, whose age makes it
impossible for them to defend themselves, are slain. He represents it as still
more shocking, when he adds, "<i>in the sight of</i> their parents." To the same
purpose is what follows about <i>plundering houses</i> and <i>ravishing
wives</i>; for these things happen when the enemies have forgotten all humanity,
and are inflamed to cruelty, and wish that those whom they have subdued, and
even their very name, should be rooted
out.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Behold I raise up against them the
Medes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, having predicted the
destruction of the Babylonians, describes also the authors, or says that God
will be the author; and at the same time he explains in what manner, and by
means of whom, it will be accomplished; for he says that <i>he will raise up the
Medes</i>. He certainly could not have conjectured this by human reason, for
there were no jealousies and no quarrels between the Babylonians and the Medes;
and if there had been any such, what power did the Medes at that time possess
that they could do the Babylonians any harm? Seeing, therefore, that no
preparations had been made for the Medes carrying on war against them, it is
very certain that this was spoken by divine inspiration, and more especially
since he foretold these events more than a hundred years before they took
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall not think of
silver, nor desire gold.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F197</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he says that they shall not be
covetous of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>silver and
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he does not mean that the Medes were not
guilty of plundering and covetousness, as if they were so generous that they
despised </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gold and
silver</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but, on the contrary, he means that the
battle will be cruel and bloody, that they will aim at nothing but a general
slaughter. For example, the Spaniards of the present day, making it their chief
object in war to plunder, more readily spare the life of men, and are not so
bloodthirsty as the Germans or the English, who think of nothing but slaying the
enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought not to think it strange that the
Lord, though he is not cruel, yet makes use of agents who are so cruel, for he
acts righteously even by the agency of wicked men, and is not stained with their
wickedness. It would therefore be improper to form our judgment of the work of
God from the executioners of it, for they are prompted either by ambition, or by
covetousness, or by cruelty; but we ought to consider God's righteous punishment
which the Babylonians deserved on account of their
transgressions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with bows they shall dash in
pieces the children.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some render it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
cut</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They think that the language is
exaggerated, as if they made use of the children of the Babylonians in place of
<i>arrows</i>, and afterwards dashed them to the ground, that they might be
broken with greater violence. But I choose rather to take a more simple view of
the words, that the cruelty of the Medes will be so great, that they will not
spare even infant children, on whom men do not commonly lay hands unless where
there is the utmost barbarity; and, in short, that no allowance will be made for
age, as we have formerly said.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we do not
read that the Medes exercised so great cruelty, and Babylon stood and flourished
for a very long period after that calamity; and although the seat of the empire
was removed from it, still it retained its name and reputation. Besides, after
the dawn of the following day, no cruelty was exercised but against those who
bore arms. Though it was the Prophet's design to include other judgments of God
which awaited the Babylonians, and by which the first calamity was followed long
afterwards, yet it is not improperly or unseasonably that he describes the
barbarous manners of the nation, that the Jews may be more fully aware that a
just reward is prepared for the tyranny of Babylon. Nor can it be doubted that
it was in reliance on this promise that believers afterwards presented that
prayer;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Babylon, the glory of
kingdoms.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet intended to give a
brief summary of his prophecy about the Babylonians, but enlarges it by some
additions tending to show more fully that it will be completely destroyed. In
this manner do the prophets speak of the punishment of the wicked, so as to
leave no room for compassion by which they may relieve their minds. But the
godly, though they may sometimes think that they are severely chastised, are yet
supported by the confident hope that the Lord will have compassion on them, and
will not altogether destroy them. Hence we may conclude that we ought not always
to judge from outward appearances; for we would often think that the children of
God are ruined when their salvation is at hand even in the midst of
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of Sodom and Gomorrah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This example is frequently employed by the
Prophets, in order to inform us that, though the mode of punishment be not the
same, yet, since the judgment of God is impartial, that memorable display which
he gave in <i>Sodom</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
19:24) has a reference to all the reprobate, and that not less dreadful
punishment awaits those who are hardened by similar obstinacy in their sins.
They distinguish between the punishment of the elect people and the punishment
of the wicked by this circumstance, that God reserves some <i>seed</i> for the
Israelites, but none for the ungodly, which agrees with the words which we
formerly met with,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Unless the Lord of hosts

<div><font face="Palatino">But he pursues the wicked with vengeance that cannot
be appeased, and therefore he threatens against them the same destruction which
was executed against the inhabitants of <i>Sodom</i>, that is, utter perdition
without any hope of
escape.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall be like God's

that we may not think that it happens by chance, or that it has proceeded from
the will of men. As it was not at random that the thunderbolt fell from heaven
on <i>Sodom</i>, so it was not at random that <i>Babylon</i> fell down, but by
the righteous vengeance <i>of God</i>, who, being always like himself, executed
righteous judgment on them; and in like manner will execute the same judgment on
all the reprobate till the end.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When

splendor can hinder God from bringing the wicked to nought; for that overturn,
having been incredible, afforded a more remarkable proof of Divine
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall never be inhabited any

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;t</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>thesheb</i>,) <i>shall sit</i>, he means continuance; as if he had said,
"There is no hope of restoring Babylon." All these forms of expression have
precisely the same object, that the Babylonians will be destroyed with such a
destruction that their ruin shall be perpetual. The picture is still further
heightened by adding, that the desolation will be so great that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in that place neither will the
Arabians pitch their tents, nor the shepherds their
folds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> That place must have been
marvellously forsaken and uncultivated, when it was disregarded by those roving
tribes; for the <i>Arabians</i> were a wandering and unsettled nation, and had
no fixed abode. Having left their native country, because it was barren, and is
therefore called Arabia <i>Deserta</i>, (for it is of that country that we
speak,) they devoted themselves to feeding flocks and to hunting, and wandered
without any fixed residence; for which reason also the Greeks called them
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">skhnh&gt;tai</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>skenetai</i>,) <i>dwellers in tents</i>. Now the country around Babylon was
exceedingly fertile before that calamity, which rendered this change the more
astonishing and almost miraculous, either because the place lost its former
fertility, or because the constant slaughter made all men abhor the sight of it.
Undoubtedly the Prophet means that not only will the buildings be thrown down,
but the very soil will be accursed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.

(<i>tziim</i>) ought to be translated I cannot easily say, on account of the
diversity in the opinions of translators, who differ in this, as in various
names of animals and herbs. The use of these things did not continue among them;
and the Jews, who are themselves ignorant and unskilful, do not retain the
knowledge of these things, though there are some of them who know nothing about
either herbs or animals, and yet have the impudence to boast of being
physicians. Of those who think that

(<i>tziim</i>) is the name of a wild animal, some will have it to be a
quadruped, and others, a bird; but that is a matter of little importance. For my
own part, I have no doubt that the Prophet means either wild beasts which cannot
be tamed, or birds which build their nests in distant
forests.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will not be amiss to explain what
follows about <i>Satyrs</i> or <i>Pans</i>, who are called by the French,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyx</font><font face="Palatino">,

by means of <i>Fauns</i> and <i>Satyrs</i>, and on that account their names are
given to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The design of the Prophet is to
show that the solitude will be so great, that not only will the place be
deserted by men, but even the devils will there deceive by their tricks; for the
devils avail themselves of the tendency of solitary places to produce terror. As
enemies and robbers, by sallying forth from concealed lurking-places, frighten
men the more, so devils take advantage of the night and the darkness, and of
places distant from the view of men, that they may be able to excite greater
terror in those who are naturally
timorous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>

He expresses the same thing as had been formerly said, and shows how dreadful
that change will be, in order to make it manifest that it proceeds from the
judgment of God, and not from chance. The picture is even heightened by adding
that this will take place, not in ordinary buildings, but in <i>delightful
palaces</i>.

While the shortness of time which is here laid down refers to the approaching
calamity, it was at the same time necessary that the hope of believers should be
held longer in suspense. I have said that Babylon was not so speedily
overturned, and that the Medes did not inflict such a calamity upon it that it
could be compared to a desert. He therefore said that it would quickly happen,
because the beginnings of it were soon afterwards seen; for the Jews ought to
have been satisfied with knowing that the punishment had not been threatened
without good grounds.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And her
time is near.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Holy Spirit also keeps in
view our ardor and rashness. We would choose that God should immediately execute
his judgments, and punish wicked men whenever we wish. But God knows what is the
proper time, for which our eagerness does not allow us to wait. Yet if we would
take into consideration his eternity, we should quickly find that by patience we
laid the bridle on excessive haste; but as our eagerness can hardly be
restrained in any other manner, God sometimes deals with us gently to some
extent, by declaring that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
soon come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Again, let us not judge of the
shortness of time according to our own views, but, disregarding the <i>days</i>

period.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And her days shall not

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the LORD will have compassion
on Jacob.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>ki</i>)
having various significations, we might take it as signifying <i>But</i>, and
might connect this verse with the former verse in the following manner:
<i>But</i> (or, <i>yet</i>) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Lord will have compassion on Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But I
consider it to be better and more appropriate to view the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>), in this as well as in many other passages, as used for assigning a
reason; and thus the meaning will be, "God will destroy Babylon,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he will have compassion
on Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, whom he cannot despise or reject."
Hence we see that the Prophet had hitherto endeavored to soothe the grief of a
wretched people, in order to inform them that they ought to entertain good hopes
in the midst of their afflictions, of which <i>God would be the avenger</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
94:1.) Here, therefore, as in a picture, Babylon is contrasted with the Church
of God; Babylon, I say, elevated to the highest power, which had plunged the
Church into such a miserable and afflicted condition, that it was not probable
that she could ever be raised up again. But the Lord casts down Babylon from her
lofty situation, and thus testifies that he cares for his people, however mean
and despicable they may be. It yields very great consolation to us to learn that
the whole world is governed by God for our salvation. All things are directed to
this object, that those whom he has elected may be saved, and may not be
overwhelmed by any changes, however numerous, that shall befall
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be asked, Was there a period
during which God <i>had no</i> <i>compassion</i>? Undoubtedly, he always <i>had
compassion</i>; but while the people were distressed by heavy calamities, it was
not perceived; for, having their minds previously occupied with a view of God's
anger, and, judging from outward appearances, they could not perceive
<i>God's</i> <i>compassion</i>. Yet the Lord was always like himself, and never
laid aside his nature. Thus it is proper to distinguish between the knowledge
which springs from faith and the knowledge which springs from experience; for
when the tokens of God's anger are visible all around, and when the judgment of
the flesh leads us to believe that he is angry, his favor is concealed from us;
but faith raises our hearts above this darkness, to behold God in heaven as
reconciled towards us. What follows is somewhat more
startling.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will yet choose
Israel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will again choose
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God's election is eternal. He does not
<i>choose</i> us as if this had never before come into his mind; and as we were
<i>chosen before the</i> <i>foundation of the world</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4,) so he never <i>repents of</i> <i>his choice</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29.) But when the Lord chastises his people, this has the appearance of
rejecting them; as we learn from the frequent complaints of the saints, <i>Lord,
why hast thou cast us off</i>?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
74:1.) We look at God's rejection or election according to our weakness, and
judge of his feelings toward us by the outward action. (I speak of the knowledge
which is derived from experience, and which is corrected by the light of faith.)
Accordingly, when the Lord calls us, that is, confirms his election, he is said
to <i>choose</i> us; and when he gives evidence that he is displeased, he is
said to reject us. The meaning, therefore, is, "Though the Lord has treated his
people so severely, as if he had rejected them; yet by the actual event he will
at length show and prove that he has adopted them, by giving abundant evidence
of his election, and by <i>having compassion on them</i> for
ever."</font><br><font face="Palatino">We now may readily conclude what we have
already said, namely, that the chastisements which the godly endure are widely
different from that deadly stroke, however light it may be, which is inflicted
on the ungodly. The godly are immediately led to consider their election, the
confident belief of which cheers their hearts; but the ungodly see nothing but
darkness, bottomless pits, and frightful desolation on all sides. Whenever,
therefore, the Lord chastises us, we ought immediately to call to remembrance
this distinction, that we may strengthen our hearts by the hope of a happier
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall cause
them to rest in their own land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In their return
he holds out an evidence of favor and reconciliation; for to the children of
Abraham the <i>land</i> of Canaan was a pledge of their
adoption.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the stranger
shall be joined to them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet foretells
the calling of the Gentiles; as if he had said, "Not only will the Lord restore
them to the possession of the land of Canaan, but will enlarge them by a great
increase; for he will associate the Gentiles with them, that the two peoples may
become one and the same body." This benefit, therefore, is not limited to a
short period, but extends to the whole Church, which the Lord promises to place
in safety; for he speaks, not of the Church in his own time, but of the Church
which shall be till the kingdom of Christ, and during his kingdom; otherwise
that addition would have been
inappropriate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the peoples shall take
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the foreign nations will be
willing to become their companions, and in such a manner that they will not
scruple to discharge the duties of servants. An instance of this was given,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
1:6,) when the people were brought back from Babylon; but that was only a slight
foretaste of those things which were accomplished by Christ, to whom all these
statements must be referred. The Lord softened the hearts of the nations, who
regarded that people with deadly hatred, so that by their guidance he brought
them back to their native country, and bestowed on them their former liberty.
But so far were many of the nations from assisting the Jews, after their return
from Babylon, that all the neighbors earnestly entered into a league to distress
them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
4:4.) They certainly attempted not only to banish them from the land of Canaan,
but to drive them entirely out of the world. These things therefore were done in
the kingdom of Christ, to whom</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">has been given all power,
not only in earth, but also in heaven,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
28:18,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and by whom the Gentiles, who formerly had been
strangers, were united to the Jews, so as not only to assist them in keeping
their inheritance, but also to submit calmly and willingly to bear the yoke. It
is with this view that he adds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the house of
Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and
handmaids.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Jews being in some sort the
<i>first-born</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
4:22) in the house of God, we who are joined to them appear as if we had
assembled under their roof; for they go before us, and hold the highest rank
above all the nations, and undoubtedly would still hold it, if they did not by
their ingratitude deprive themselves of these great privileges. And yet their
ingratitude did not hinder the Lord from actually performing these things; for
the Apostles, being Jews, subdued foreign nations by the word of God, and even
those very nations <i>by whom they were formerly carried captive</i>, and to
whom they had been tributaries, such as the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Persians,
and finally, the Roman empire; so that all the nations might justly be called
their inheritance, though they did not wish to rule over them, but to gain them
to God, that they might acknowledge the same Lord and Prince as themselves.
These statements must therefore be referred to the dominion and yoke of Christ,
to whom the Jews subdued the Gentiles, not to a government of an outward nature,
such as the Jews falsely imagine.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds a confirmation of the former
promises. In this way the Lord provides for our weakness; for we find it
difficult to render a full belief to his word, especially when the state of our
affairs appears to contradict it. But by this method the Lord chooses to put our
faith to the test, when he still promises the salvation of which all hope has
been taken away.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From thy
sorrow, and from thy trembling, and from thy hard
bondage.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what he has said by a
variety of expressions, that, by removing all doubt, we may not cease to rely on
his promises, even when our affairs are desperate. Yet by the same
considerations he at the same time exhorts the Jews to gratitude, that they may
never bury in forgetfulness a work of God so excellent and so worthy of
remembrance. He expressly intended to mention the <i>yoke and bondage</i>, that
the Jews might be fully aware that the Lord would take away these obstructions
whenever he pleased, and that they could not at all prevent him from immediately
delivering his people, when he thought fit. We ought also to apply this to our
own use, in the present day, with reference to the wretched bondage and wicked
yoke of Antichrist by which Christians are bound. Though they are confined and
bound by snares and chains in every direction, they have God for their
deliverer, who will quickly remove all difficulties and every kind of
annoyances; and this ought to be extended to all sorrows, distresses, and
afflictions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>

or <i>parable</i>, (for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mashal</i>) denotes "sayings that are weighty and remarkable, and worthy of
being observed,") he shows that the ruin of Babylon will be so great that it
will even become <i>a proverb</i>, which usually happens in great and
astonishing events.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How hath
the oppressor ceased?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word <i>How</i>
throws it into the form of a question expressive of astonishment and ridicule.
It might be thought incredible that Babylon, furnished with such abundant wealth
and forces, should be overturned and fall into the hands of the enemy. Justly,
therefore, does he ridicule their foolish and vain confidence, that, being
swelled with haughtiness, they thought that they were invincible, and were
placed beyond the reach of all danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it
may be thought to be inconsistent with the modesty of godly persons to scoff at
the misery of others, for they ought rather to have pitied them. But it is not
inconsistent with compassion, when our zeal is regulated by the justice of the
judgment of God; for in that case we may with human feelings compassionate those
who perish through their folly, and at the same time laugh at their insolence
and madness. As the Lord scoffs at them, laughing at their senselessness, so he
bids us, through zeal for his glory, mock at them; not that we may be swelled
with impudence, but that we may praise his goodness and power. By this example,
therefore, we may scoff at the enemies of God, when they are vanquished or
brought down, as we may scoff at Antichrist, whose power we daily see diminished
and gradually falling into
decay.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How hath the city

<i>Oppressor</i> or <i>Tyrant</i>, it probably denotes covetousness and
insatiable greediness for <i>gold</i>, to which the Babylonians were subject. It
is usually the case with great empires and states and wealthy nations, that the
greater their abundance, the stronger is their greediness to possess more.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord hath broken the staff of
the wicked.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He answers the question which has
just been put; for he did not intend that believers should doubt that it would
happen, but rather that they should be amazed at such wonderful works of God;
for the question had a tendency to arouse their minds to more earnest attention.
It is as if he had said that it did not happen at random or through the blind
violence of fortune that they have not been oppressed by continual bondage, but
that it ought to be ascribed to the providence of God, who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that hard yoke of bondage. Now, the
ungodly are amazed at such works, and remain bewildered, because they do not see
the reason; but the godly know that this ought to be ascribed to God. Let us
therefore learn to admire the works of God, and while we are amazed at them, let
us acknowledge him to be the Author; and let us not think that any of them ought
to be lightly passed over, especially when he displays his power for redeeming
his Church, when by his wonderful power he delivers each of us from the bondage
of the devil, from the tyranny of Antichrist, from eternal death. It is no
ordinary work, of which any part ought to be ascribed to the power of man or to
any other cause.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the staff of the
wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the scepter of the
rulers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and by this repetition he means
that no imperial power can support unjust tyranny. And immediately afterwards he
states more clearly that the monarchy of the Babylonians would be destroyed,
because it was unjust and tyrannical, when he says
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
14:6) that the people had been struck with <i>an incurable
stroke</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that there was no limit to the
violence, because they had rioted with impunity in unbounded licentiousness.
This reminds us that at length God will not spare tyrants, though he may wink at
them for a time. The same destruction awaits them as, we learn, befell Babylon;
for <i>the Lord is</i> <i>righteous</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
11:7,) and is always like himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> and
<b>8.</b> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They break forth into
singing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he shows how greatly tyrants are
hated by the whole world. When they are dead or ruined, all men break forth into
joy, and express the feelings which they formerly entertained towards the
tyrants, and which they dissembled through fear. Then do their hatred and spite
burst forth, and not only do men make known their joy, but even the dumb
creatures, as the Prophet, for the sake of amplification, adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fir-trees and the
cedars</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As tyranny overturns everything, so
when tyranny is done away, everything appears to be restored to its original
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since thou art laid
down, no feller is come up against us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To make
the discoure more energetic, he adds a personification, in which he introduces
the trees as speaking and congratulating themselves that, since the tyrant is
dead, they will now stand gladly and at ease. The design of the Prophet is to
show, that the Heavenly Judge cannot endure tyrants, who are abhorred by the
whole world. Hence, we ought to conclude that, though under the sway of tyrants
unhappy men are silent, and do not venture to open their mouths, yet the Lord
listens to their secret groans. Let us not wonder therefore that tyrants come to
such a dismal end; for God, who is a witness of the injuries which they have
inflicted, must in th exercise of his justice assist the
innocent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>

He arouses them, as it were, from their <i>graves</i>, to mock at the pride of
this tyrant. The whole passage is ironical, and full of keen sarcasm. At the
approach of kings, the people tremble, and come forth to meet and receive them
with pompous display. The Prophet makes a fictitious representation, that when
this tyrant shall die and go down to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the grave, the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"> will go forth to meet and honor him, but
with such honor as he deserves. As if he had said, "Not only the living, but

the tyrant who has joined them, as if they asked him what is the reason why he

pretends that they inquire with astonishment about it as something that could
not be believed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou

their greatness, and do not think that they are mortal, and even make themselves
to be half-gods and adore themselves. On this account it is made known after
their death that they shared in the condition of all mortals, to which they did
not think that they were liable. It is in this sense that the dead, not without
bitter scorn, reproach him for having

serves for a splendid coverlet." In a word, there is here exhibited to us a
lively painting of the foolish confidence of men, who, intoxicated with their
present enjoyments and prosperity, flatter themselves. This doctrine ought to be
carefully pondered; for though men be well aware of their condition, and have
death before their eyes, yet overrun by ambition, and soothed by pleasures, and
even fascinated by empty show, they forget
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.

which he had formerly begun as personating the dead, and concludes that the
tyrant differs in no respect from other men, though his object was to lead men
to believe that he was some god. He employs an elegant metaphor, by comparing
him to <i>Lucifer</i>, and calls him the <i>Son of the
Dawn</i>;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

brightness with which he shone above others. The exposition of this passage,
which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance;
for the context plainly shows that these statements must be understood in
reference to the king of the Babylonians. But when passages of Scripture are
taken up at random, and no attention is paid to the context, we need not wonder
that mistakes of this kind frequently arise. Yet it was an instance of very
gross ignorance, to imagine that <i>Lucifer</i> was the king of devils, and that
the Prophet gave him this name. But as these inventions have no probability
whatever, let us pass by them as useless

of the Babylonian monarch, who, relying on his greatness, ventured to promise to
himself uninterrupted success, as if he had the power of determining the events
of his life. In him there is exhibited to us a mirror of the madness of pride
with which ungodly men are swelled, and which sometimes they even vomit out. Nor
ought we only to behold here the person of a single tyrant, but the blasphemous
rage of all the ungodly, who form their resolutions as if they could dispose of
everything according to their pleasure; as their plans are also beautifully
described by James,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">We shall go

immediately follow, the boasting is so absurd that it is impossible to believe
that they proceeded from the lips of a mortal man; but as the Prophet did not
intend to quote the very words which Nebuchadnezzar employed, let us be
satisfied with examining the subject itself. Undoubtedly, all who claim for
themselves more than human nature will allow, may be said to "attack heaven
itself after the manner of the giants," as the proverb
runs.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

the limits of his calling provokes the wrath of God against himself by his
rashness. Let every one therefore be satisfied with his lot, and learn not to
aim at anything higher, but, on the contrary, to remain in his own rank in which
God has placed him. If God stretch out his hand, and lift us up higher, we ought
to go forward; but no one ought to take it on himself, or to strive for it from
his own choice. And even those who are raised to a higher rank of honor ought to
conduct themselves humbly and submissively, not with any pretended modesty, but
with minds so thoroughly depressed that nothing can lift them
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will sit on the mountain

make himself equal to God. Though he reasoned, after the manner of men, that he
could obtain a victory over the Jews, yet, reckoning as nothing the assistance
of God, by whom he had often heard that they were protected, it was as if he had
endeavored to destroy the very heavens. For Mount Zion he uses the expression

men, as when irreligious persons assemble to their fairs or festivals, but that
the Lord intended to give a token of his presence, and there to ratify his
covenant. This ought to be carefully observed; for the blasphemy of the wicked
king is proved by this, that he attacked heaven itself rather than an earthly
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>

F216</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It might certainly be thought strange
that the Prophet thus accuses the Babylonian monarch, as if he wished to make
himself equal to God, since, as we have said, this thought could scarcely enter
into the mind of a man without making him absolutely shudder. As there is a seed
of religion implanted in us by nature, so we are constrained, even against our
will, to entertain the belief of some superior being who excells all things; and
no man is so mad as to wish to cast down God from his throne; for we are
instructed by nature that we ought to worship and adore God. Hence also the
Gentiles, though they were ignorant of God, rendered worship to their idols; and
therefore it may be thought improbable that the king of Babylon wished to drive
out God, and to reign in heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet the
Prophet does not accuse him falsely. Though the ungodly do not believe that they
ought to reign instead of God, yet, when they exalt themselves more than is
proper, they take away a portion of what belongs to him, and claim it for
themselves, which is the same as if they wished to pull him down from his
throne. And what did Satan say when he deceived our first parent? <i>Ye shall be
as gods</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:5.) Consequently, all who dare to ascribe more to themselves than God allows
are chargeable with exalting themselves against God, as if they declared war
against him; for where pride is, contempt of God must be
there.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought also to observe that argument
which we lately noticed, that the tyrant, by assailing the Church, which was
God's holy heritage, might be said intentionally to attack God. Since,
therefore, he profaned the heavenly sanctuary, the language ought not to be
thought exaggerated. Hence also we obtain a doctrine full of most valuable
consolation, for we are taught that the ungodly exalt themselves against God
whenever they attack his Church. He is not accused of exalting himself above
angels, but of endeavoring to crush the Church of God. The worship of God is not
now confined to one place, but is as extensive as the whole world. Whenever,
therefore, men call on the name of God, if any tyrant rise up to oppress the
godly, let us know that he attacks not men, but God himself, who at length will
not endure to be insulted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We shall afterwards
meet with a similar example in Sennacherib, of whom Isaiah declares that, while
he threatened and reproached Zion, he threatened and reproached God himself. Let
us therefore know that we are under the protection of God in such a manner, that
any one who gives us trouble will also have God for his enemy.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou shalt be brought
down to the grave.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He formerly explained the
intention of the king of Babylon, which was, that he should place his throne
above the clouds; but he now contrasts with it an opposite event, namely, <i>the
sides of the pit</i> or <i>ditch</i>, that is, some corner of a sepulcher into
which he shall be thrown. He had formerly said that the king of Babylon wished
to be carried up </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to Mount Zion,
to the sides of the north</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because that was a
very lofty situation, and widely seen. He now uses the word <i>sides</i> in an
opposite sense, as if he had said that he would have an abode in the most
contemptible part of a sepulcher, as when one is thrust into a mean and
despicable corner. In a wide and large sepulcher they place the dead bodies of
honorable men in the middle; but the Prophet means that he will be thrown into a
corner, or into the outer edges. Thus the Lord from on high laughs at the pride
of the ungodly, so that, when they shall have swallowed up everything by their
covetousness, and shall have burst through the clouds and heaven itself by their
effrontery, he will at length expose them to the mockery of all, after having,
in the twinkling of an eye, overturned their
schemes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They that see
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet again, personating the dead,
mocks at that wicked king. It might also be viewed as relating to the living;
but it is better to apply the whole of this discourse to the dead, if we would
not rather refer it to the grave itself, which amounts nearly to the same thing.
We are wont to stretch out our neck when we meet with anything that is strange,
or that deserves our attention. Thus, when it was thought to be a kind of
prodigy that this king, who possessed so great power, had died, the Prophet says
that the eyes of all men were directed towards him, to look at him earnestly, as
if they scarcely believed their own
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is this the man that
made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms?</i></font><font face="Palatino">
They first ask, if it be possible that he who, by the slightest expression of
his will, <i>made the earth to tremble</i>, should be so quickly and easily laid
low. Next, he mentions that this man was eager, but is unable, to destroy
everything, and shows that tyrants, with all their cruelty, are like clouds,
which pour down a sudden shower of rain or hail, as if they would destroy
everything, but are scattered in a moment. This comparison was also employed by
the good old Athanasius, when some one threatened him with the rage of the
Emperor Julian. Isaiah shows that this change proceeds from the hand of God,
who, by the slightest expression of his will, can overturn the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
He made the world as a wilderness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresses
the cruel and savage disposition of the tyrant, by saying that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought desolation on the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that he <i>overthrew cities</i>, that he
<i>did not release prisoners</i>. It is sometimes the custom of conquerors to
release prisoners, in order to win their hearts by kindness; but tyrants choose
rather to be feared than to be loved. They think that the only way to reign is
to strike terror into all by inexorable cruelty. There is no reason to wonder,
therefore, that their end is so wretched and dismal; for it is impossible that
the Lord should not, after having chastised his Church by their cruelty, give
them like for like, and withhold all compassion from those who failed to
exercise compassion to others. He therefore shows how wretched tyrants are, for
they have God for their enemy, and are hated by
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the kings of the
nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He contrasts the king of Babylon with
other kings, in order to show that, after his death, he will be more wretched
than all the rest. And thus by comparison he gives a more enlarged view of the
judgment of God, by which he would avenge the injuries done to his Church. This
passage is the reason why I do not venture to limit, what Isaiah here foretells
about the king of Babylon, to the person of Nebuchadnezzar alone; because it
does not appear from history that he was denied burial. The Jews, indeed, relate
that Evil-merodach gave orders that he should be dug out of his grave, because
the nobles of the kingdom would not venture to pay homage to him, unless there
were evidence that his father was dead; but Jerome, though otherwise credulous
enough, treats this as a fable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He therefore
describes, not a single man, but a whole dynasty; and, in like manner, when
Scripture speaks of Antichrist, it includes the whole duration of his reign.
Consequently, as if in the person of one man, the Prophet ridicules the pride of
all those tyrants, and threatens what shall be their end, namely this, that they
shall not have a spot of earth to bury them, though formerly they were
insatiable whirlpools, and could not be satisfied with any possessions. They who
have scarcely a foot of earth still retain their right to have a grave, which
was also highly prized by the patriarchs; for it was reckoned disgraceful to be
deprived of it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou art cast out of thy
grave like an abominable branch.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shows that
the kings of Babylon will be loaded with such disgrace, that they will even be
cast out of the sepulcher which they possessed by inheritance, and will exhibit
a disgraceful spectacle. It may be asked, Is it of so great value in the sight
of God to be buried with our fathers, that to be deprived of it should be
reckoned a punishment and a curse? I answer, he does not here speak of the
grave, as if it were necessary for salvation; but it ought justly to be reckoned
disgraceful to be denied burial. And first, we ought to consider why burial has
been so highly valued among all nations. This undoubtedly arose from the
patriarchs, whose bodies the Lord commanded to be buried in the hope of the last
resurrection. The carcases of beasts are cast out, because they are only fit for
rotting; but ours are laid in the earth, that being kept there, they may await
the last day, when they shall rise to enjoy a blessed and immortal life in union
with the soul.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Various superstitions have arisen
as to the interment of bodies. This has undoubtedly been occasioned by the
craftiness of Satan, who usually corrupts and perverts everything that is good
and useful, for he devised innumerable contrivances by which he might dazzle the
eyes of men. We need not wonder that the Jews had a great variety of ceremonies
connected with this subject, and they cannot be blamed on account of it, for
Christ had not yet been revealed, and consequently they had not so clear a
revelation of the resurrection. But in our time the case is very different, for
we plainly see the resurrection in Christ, and, every vail having now been
removed, we behold clear promises which were more obscure to the Jews. If any
one, therefore, were again to introduce and renew those ancient rites, he would
undoubtedly darken the light, and, by putting a vail on Christ who has been
revealed to us, would offer to him a high insult. Yet it is not useless to pay
attention to burial, for it is the symbol of the last resurrection, which we
still look for; but let there be no superstition and ostentatious display in
funerals, which all godly persons ought to
detest.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one has been entirely
deprived of burial, we must examine the cause. Many of the prophets, martyrs,
and holy men have been deprived of it. We hear the Church bewailing
that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the dead bodies of the
servants of God have been thrown down to wild beasts and to the fowls of heaven,
and that there is none to bury them,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
79:2, 3;)</font><br><font face="Palatino">and every day we see the servants of
Christ burned, or drowned, or hanged; and yet their death is glorious and
blessed in the sight of God. As the cross of Christ was blessed, so crosses,
chains, prisons, and deaths, which are endured by his members, share in the same
blessing, and far exceed the prosperity and trappings and splendor and majesty
of kings, so that, following the example of Paul, they boldly venture even to
glory in them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:3;

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But as to those whom the Lord permits to
remain unburied, when we see nothing else than a token of his anger, we must
fall back on this statement and others of the same kind. For example, Jeremiah
threatened Jehoiakim with <i>the burial of an ass</i>, because he deserved to be
ranked with beasts rather than with men, who, even after death, are
distinguished from beasts by being buried. Thus it was proper that the king of
Babylon, who had exalted himself above all men, should be cast down below all
men, so as even to be deprived of ordinary burial. Isaiah, therefore, foretells
that he will not be buried <i>in
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own
house,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, in the sepulcher of his
fathers, which came to him by inheritance; for we must not suppose that
sepulchres were within houses.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F217</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The comparisons which are added express
more strongly the disgrace which was due to that tyrant. As hurtful or useless
trees are rooted out, so he shows that the king of Babylon does not deserve to
have any place among men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
the garments of those who are slain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They who
fall in the field of battle are not buried in the ordinary way, but their bloody
and stinking bodies are trodden down, and are thrown into a ditch along with
their rotten
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>garments</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that they may not infect the air with their offensive smell; and no one deigns
to touch the very
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>garments</i></font><font face="Palatino">
defiled by mire and blood, lest he should be polluted by them. Which of the
kings of Babylon it was that suffered this we cannot tell; but undoubtedly it
was fulfilled.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast laid thy land
desolate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the reason why he says that
the king of Babylon did not deserve burial. He who has laid the <i>earth</i>
desolate does not deserve that <i>the earth</i> shall receive him into its bosom
and cover him. As <i>the earth</i> supports the living, so it covers the dead,
and keeps them till the coming of Christ. It is therefore a just punishment of
cruelty, when the <i>earth</i> refuses to receive into her bosom those who have
dishonored her. There is added a threatening still more severe, that the Lord
will also inflict on posterity the remainder of the
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The seed of the
wicked shall not be continually remembered.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
There are two ways in which we may explain this clause, either that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the</i> <i>remembrance of the
seed of the wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"> will not be of long
duration, or that it will be altogether extinguished. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[l
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">f218</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(<i>legnolam</i>) may be translated in various ways, for it may refer either to
the past or to the future. If we refer it to the past, the meaning will be,
"Although <i>the seed of the wicked</i> be renowned,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[l</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>legnolam</i>,) <i>for a time</i>, yet the remembrance of it will at length
pass away." If we refer it to the future, the meaning will be, "God will
extinguish the seed of the wicked, so that it shall never again be mentioned."
It usually happens that the Lord curses <i>the seed of the</i> <i>wicked</i>,
as, on the other hand, he blesses <i>the seed</i> of the godly,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:7;) and as <i>the righteous shall be held in perpetual</i>
<i>remembrance</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
112:6,) so <i>the remembrance of the wicked</i> must be destroyed and <i>cut
off</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:16.) Though we do not always behold these things with our eyes, yet there are
abundant and clear proofs of the fact, by which it is fully
confirmed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we must attend to the reason of
this vengeance. The Lord punishes the pride of wicked men, who wish to spread
their name, and to leave a perpetual remembrance of them; for all irreligious
men have this for the object of their labors and exertions. On the other hand,
the Lord blots out their name and remembrance, which appeared to be inscribed on
lasting records; and the result is, that they are not only despised but even
abhorred by all men. This happens to all tyrants, that though, while they live,
they are universally applauded and flattered, yet after they are dead, they and
their posterity are universally abhorred. It is therefore evident that they are
detested by God, by angels, and by
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prepare slaughter for his
children.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here Isaiah prophesies more plainly
than before against the king of Babylon. He speaks of the whole of his
descendants, to whom he intimates that this destruction extends. We must keep in
mind what we formerly said, that hitherto the Prophet has spoken not of a single
man, but of a whole dynasty; and now he removes all doubt as to the metaphorical
language. The rendering given by the old translation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prepare his children for the
slaughter,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> does not agree well; for the
preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lamed</i>,) which is prefixed, evidently shows that it ought to be
translated <i>to</i> or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the
children.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">We must see to whom this discourse
relates. It must be understood that reference is made, though not directly
expressed, to some servants as officers or executioners, whom the Lord orders to
be in a state of <i>preparation</i> for executing his judgments. And who were
they? Partly the Medes and Persians, and partly others by whom Babylon was
completely overthrown; for, as we have formerly said, Babylon was not entirely
destroyed when the Persians subdued it. He therefore addresses those whom the
Lord, by his eternal decree, had appointed to destroy Babylon. This mode of
expression is more energetic than if he had merely said that <i>slaughter was
prepared</i>; for he shows that he not only disposes of wicked men according to
his pleasure, but that he has servants at hand to punish their

still more harsh, that the punishment due to the <i>fathers</i> should be

<div><font face="Palatino">God does not punish any innocent person; and this
passage ought not to be understood as if the punishment due to ancestors were
transferred by God to children who in other respects deserved no such
punishment; for the guilt of the children is connected with the guilt of the
fathers. Not to mention the universal curse of the human race, to which all are
subject from the womb, let us take the example of some wicked man. When the Lord
casts away that man and his posterity, we certainly have no right to remonstrate
with him. If his blessing is free and undeserved, we have no right to constrain
him, because he does not bestow it equally on all. His grace is free; and each
of us ought to reflect, that anything good which we have, does not naturally
belong to us, but, on the contrary, comes from another quarter, and has
proceeded from the undeserved goodness of God. If, therefore, he cast off any
one, must not that man's seed also be accursed? When we are destitute of his
grace, what remains but iniquity? And if they are liable to eternal death, much
more to temporal punishments; for he who has been condemned to undergo capital
punishment, deserves much more to endure imprisonment and
scourging.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully observed.
I consider it to be a childish reply that is given by those who think that the
Lord inflicts temporal punishments on the children of wicked men for the sins of
their parents, and who do not look upon it as unworthy of God to inflict
punishments of this nature even on innocent persons; for God never punishes
those who do not deserve it, and he is by nature inclined to compassion; and how
would he spare wicked men if he exercised his wrath against the innocent? We
ought, therefore, to hold it as a settled point, that all who are destitute of
the grace of God are involved in the sentence of eternal death. Hence it
follows, that the children of the reprobate, whom the curse of God pursues, are
liable to the same sentence. Isaiah, therefore, does not speak of innocent
children, but of flagitious and unprincipled children who perhaps even exceeded
their parents in wickedness; in consequence of which they were justly associated
with their parents, and subjected to the same punishment, seeing that they have
followed the same manner of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be
said, that in that case they suffer the punishment of their own sin and not of
their parents. This, I acknowledge, is partly true; but it was with their
parents that the rejection began, on account of which they also have been
forsaken and rejected by God. Their own guilt is not set aside as if they had
been innocent; but, having been involved in the same sins as to reprobation,
they are also liable to the same punishments and miseries. I am aware that this
solution does not satisfy those who never cease to quarrel with God; but I give
myself little concern about them, provided that I satisfy godly persons and
those who are not fond of disputing; and these, I hope and trust, will be well
satisfied with this reply, which is
true.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may not fill
the face of the world with cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render
it, <i>that they may not fill the face of the earth with enemies</i>; as if the
Prophet meant that all wicked men are <i>enemies</i> of the human race, or
rather of the whole earth; and, therefore, that the Lord provides for the safety
of all, when he takes them out of the midst; for the earth would otherwise be
choked by them as by thorns and briers. But this signification appears to
express something more; for the earth receives us into her bosom, if we do our
duty; and if we be despisers of God, the earth, even against her will, nourishes
and supports us as enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I would rather
follow another signification, which is more commonly received. I think that the
Prophet intimates that wicked men have a numerous progeny, and that they surpass
others both in numbers and in display, which we also see taking place every day,
and which has originated the proverb, that "a bad reed grows quickly." The
Prophet, therefore, insinuates, that wicked men would fill the whole earth not
only with men, but also with towns, if the Lord did not beforehand perceive and
guard against this evil, and diminish their number. When we everywhere see a
vast multitude of wicked men, by whom the earth is almost overwhelmed, it is
what we richly deserve; but the Lord never deals so harshly with us as not to
leave some remnant of good seed, however small, and likewise to reserve some
corners of the earth in which godly men shall have a little breathing. And if
the Lord did not cut off a large proportion of wicked men, the earth would
undoubtedly be soon overwhelmed by them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
confirms what we have already said, that the children of the Babylonians who
were slain were not innocent, for here the cause is assigned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may not fill the earth
with cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It follows, therefore, that they
were wicked, and are taken away by a righteous judgment, that provision may be
made for the salvation of men, and that the Lord cannot be accused of harshness
and cruelty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will rise up against
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord now declares that he will do
what he had formerly, by the Prophet, commanded others to do. Both statements
ought to be observed, that it is the work of God, when wicked men are ruined,
though he may employ the agency of men in executing his judgments. He formerly
addressed them, saying, <i>Prepare</i>. (Verse. 21.) This should lead us to
observe not only the power of God, but likewise the efficacy of prophecy, in
consequence of which the prophets, by the appointment of God, command all
nations to do this or that; and next, that men are so far from being able to
hinder the accomplishment that they are even constrained to yield obedience to
God. As we usually rely on men, and, by neglecting God, attribute to them the
power of doing everything, we ought to hold by this principle, that since God
acts by means of them, he is, strictly speaking, the Author of the work, and
that they are only servants or instruments. This is clearly enough shown by the
connection of what immediately follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have
thought it best to view the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) as meaning <i>for</i>. He assigns the reason why he enjoins the
Medes and others to <i>prepare</i> destruction to the Babylonians,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will rise up against
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This mode of expression, by which the
Lord says that he <i>riseth up</i>, is sufficiently common. By means of it, the
Prophet accommodates himself to our capacity, for the majesty of God is so high
that we cannot conceive of it. We think that God is idle and unoccupied, so long
as he winks at men; and therefore he says that he <i>riseth up</i>, when he
exerts his power, and manifests it by some visible
act.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saith the </i>Lord<i> of
hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This title serves to confirm the
statement; as if he had said that he did not, without good grounds, claim the
government over the nations; for God governs all armies by his own hand. Since,
therefore, he has been appointed to make known the purpose of God, it belongs to
him to command men, that they may yield obedience to him. By the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saith the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which he twice repeats in this verse, he
affirms that he utters nothing but what has been commanded by God, that this
prophecy may carry greater
weight.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will cut off
from Babylon the name and remnant, son and
grandson.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It has been often enough mentioned
before, that this destruction did not overtake Babylon till after the death of
Alexander the Great. By the phrase
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sons and
grandsons</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means not only the posterity but
the remembrance, which wicked men are so desirous to obtain, in order that they
may be applauded for many ages after their death. This also the Lord took away
from Babylon, that no remembrance of it might remain, but what was accompanied
by dishonor and reproach.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>

(<i>kippod</i>) is rendered by some <i>a beaver</i>, by some <i>a tortoise</i>,
and by others <i>a hedgehog</i>. From the connection of the passage, it is
probable that the Prophet spoke of an animal that is found near the water; for
he afterwards mentions <i>pools of water</i>. This applies strictly to the
situation of the place, for though Babylon did not lie in a marsh, yet it lay in
a moist place, the country around it being watered on one side by the Euphrates,
and on the other by the Tigris. Hence the Lord threatens to bring a deluge upon
it.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F220</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord of hosts hath
sworn.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For more full confirmation an oath was
necessary. There is nothing of which it is more difficult to convince us than
that wicked men will immediately be ruined, when we see them flourishing, and
furnished with all means of defense, and seemingly placed out of danger, and
free from all fear. We are therefore stunned by beholding them, and are dazzled
by their brightness, so that we can scarcely believe God when he foretells their
ruin and destruction. On this account he employs an oath, that he may leave no
room for doubt. Hence we learn how great is his forbearance towards us, when he
aids our weakness by applying this remedy, for otherwise he might have been
satisfied with simply declaring it. This tends to the consolation of the godly,
as we shall afterwards see.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
22:14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it hath not been as
I thought.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The elliptical form of an oath which
he employs must be well known, for it occurs frequently in Scripture. The Lord
purposely used this guarded language, that we might not be too free in the use
of oaths, which burst from us daringly and at random. He suppresses the greater
part of the oath. "If I shall not do what I have decreed, let men think that I
am a liar, and let them not think that I am God;" or something of this kind
(which we shudder to express) is left to be supplied. Men ought, therefore, to
lay a bridle on themselves, so as not to break out at random into imprecations,
or to pronounce shocking curses against themselves; but let them learn from this
to restrain their insolence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may bruise the Assyrian in
my land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think that this relates to
Sennacherib's army, which the hand of God destroyed by means of an angel, when
he besieged Jerusalem.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) If this interpretation be preferred, the meaning will be, that the Lord
will shortly give some evidence of that destruction which he has threatened
against the Babylonians. Those who heard these predictions might have brought
this objection: "Of what avail will it be to us that Babylon is destroyed, after
Babylon has ruined us? Would it not have been better that both Babylon and we
had remained uninjured? What consolation will be yielded to us by its
destruction, when we, too, shall have been destroyed?" And, indeed, I have no
doubt that he holds out a proof of God's favor in destroying their enemies,
which either had been already manifested, or would be manifested soon
afterwards.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I dare not affirm at what time this
prediction was uttered by the Prophet, but it may be conjectured with some
probability that the slaughter of Sennacherib's army by the angel had already
taken place. In this way, from a striking event which they had known, the
Prophet would lead them to expect a future redemption; as if he had said, "You
have already perceived how wonderfully God assists his people at the very hour
of danger." I am thus prepared to assign a reason for thinking that
Sennacherib's army had been already slain. Undoubtedly this instruction must
have been of some use.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But Babylon did not begin
to give any annoyance to the Jews before she had subdued the Assyrians and
renewed the monarchy. So long, therefore, as the Jews had nothing to do with
Babylon, why did the Prophet speak of the judgment of God, by which he would
avenge his people? There is no absurdity in supposing that the record of a past
event is confounded with a prediction. And yet it will not be inadmissible to
say that the <i>Assyrians</i> are here put for the <i>Chaldeans</i>; for though
they had been deprived of the government, yet it is probable that they were
always first in a state of readiness whenever there was an opportunity of
attacking the Jews, and that, while they fought under foreign leaders, they
formed the greater part of the army. Not only were they nearer than the
Chaldeans, but those who at that time held the sway were aware that their
inveterate hostility against the Jews would make them loyal and obedient in that
war. Besides, it was advantageous to the conquerors to weaken the vanquished by
continual wars, till they had been accustomed to bear the
yoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Most appropriately, therefore, by a figure
of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, Isaiah, though he is speaking
of <i>Babylon</i>, describes the whole of its forces under the name of
<i>Assyria</i>. There will thus be no argument which lays us under the necessity
of explaining this passage as relating to the slaughter effected by the angel in
Sennacherib's army. The Prophet merely affirms, so far as my judgment goes, that
the Lord will put an end to the tyranny of the Assyrians, so that they shall not
always enjoy their present superiority. As if he had said, "Though for a time
God permits wicked men to rule over you, this power will not always last; for
one day he will, as it were, <i>break</i> <i>the yoke</i>, and deliver this
people from this bondage under which they groan." The Assyrians, though they
were vanquished by the Chaldeans, did not on that account, as we have said,
cease to be enemies of the Church; but Babylon, which had succeeded in the room
of Nineveh, began at that time, by a kind of transferred right, to carry on war
with the Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his yoke
shall depart from them, and his burden shall be taken from their shoulder.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says that the Assyrian will be
<i>broken</i> in Judea, this must not be understood as if they would be slain
there, or that they would be instantly crushed by some calamity; but that the
chosen people would be delivered from their tyrant, and that their authority
would thus be taken away. The <i>breaking</i>, therefore, does not refer so much
to persons as to the empire. What he says about the <i>yoke</i> and the
<i>burden</i> would not apply strictly to the Assyrians alone, who at least
never were masters of the city of Jerusalem; and therefore we must attend to the
succession which I mentioned, for the Chaldeans had no right to carry on war
except that right which they boasted of as having been conveyed to them by the
Assyrians. Thus I think that I am justified in extending this prophecy to that
deliverance by which the Lord showed that he would avenge his people against the
Chaldeans and Assyrians; for at that time the <i>yoke</i> was shaken off by
which the Jews were miserably held bound, and it even includes the redemption
obtained through Christ, of which that deliverance was a
forerunner.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And upon my
mountains I will tread him under feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some
think that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is put in the plural number for Mount Zion; but I prefer a different
interpretation. Jerusalem being situated among the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
the whole country around was despised for that reason. The Prophet therefore
speaks contemptuously, as if he admitted that the country was regarded by the
enemies as of little value because it was mountainous. But this very contempt
serves to magnify the power of God; for he shakes off from his <i>mountains</i>
the dominion of this powerful monarchy. This refers to the narrative contained
in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;112023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 20:23, 28.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This purpose which is purposed
upon the whole earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord is not satisfied
with one or two confirmations, and can scarcely refrain from proclaiming it more
and more abundantly, because he knows well that our minds are naturally prone to
distrust. No confirmation suffices for us, even though his promises be frequent
and copious and solemn. God therefore wishes to remedy this disease, and that is
the design of the repetition, so that we must not think that it is superfluous.
They who suppose that the Prophet, or rather the Spirit of God, uses too many
words, are not well acquainted with
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He declares, first, the will and
purpose of God, and, secondly, his power. How comes it that we have any doubts
about the word, but because we do not ascribe to God that power which belongs to
him, or because we are not convinced of his power? These are the only two causes
of our unbelief, with which, on the other hand, we ought to contrast the two
things which Isaiah recommends to our notice, namely, the <i>purpose</i> and the
<i>power</i> of God. We ought to believe, first, that God is <i>true</i>, for he
declares nothing that is not fixed and unchangeable; and, secondly, that he is
<i>powerful</i>, and that nothing can withstand his arm. Again, we must not
inquire about the secret purpose of God: for the Prophet here enjoins us to rest
satisfied with the decree which has been manifested in the word of God. We must
not rise any higher, therefore, so as to penetrate into the secrets of God; but
we ought to be satisfied with undoubted proofs which he declares by the mouth of
the prophets. Let us therefore embrace all the promises of God with our whole
heart, and let us also add to them his power; for his hand ought never to be
separated from his mouth. We must not imagine his power to be, as philosophers
talk, a power that is unemployed, but, as the Scriptures teach us, powerful and
active.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question may here arise, Why does he
mention <i>the whole earth</i> and <i>all the nations</i>, when he is only
speaking about Babylon? But we must keep in remembrance what we formerly said,
that the Babylonian empire, after having swallowed up Nineveh, extended nearly
through the whole of the east, and that various nations were subject to it. The
consequence was, that the devastation of that empire was also the destruction of
the whole world; for such great monarchies cannot fall without involving many in
an extensive ruin. Accordingly, as the extent of that empire might lead men to
call in question this prophecy, Isaiah shows that, though it be spread far and
wide, and includes a boundless multitude of nations, that does not prevent God
from executing his decree.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the </i>Lord<i> of hosts hath
decreed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah here employs what may be
regarded as a concluding exclamation, to confirm more fully the preceding
statement. Having said that it is the purpose of the Lord, in order to show that
it cannot be broken or made void,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
33:11,) he puts a question as if about a thing impossible,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall disannul his
purpose</i></font><font face="Palatino">? or, <i>who shall turn back his
hand</i>? By this exclamation he speaks disdainfully of all the creatures; for
as soon as the Lord has <i>decreed</i>, he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stretches out his
hand,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his hand is
stretched</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> out</i>, the execution of the work
must undoubtedly follow. Nor is it only men whom he declares to be incapable,
but he also declares everything else to be incapable of preventing the decree of
God; at least if there be anything but man and Satan that opposes his will. In
short, he intimates that there can be no repentance or change in God,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
23:19,) but that whatever may happen, even amidst an endless diversity of
events, he continues always to be like himself, and that no occurrence can
thwart his purpose.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be objected that God
sometimes changed his purpose, as when he spared the Ninevites,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;320102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jonah
1:2, 3:10,) Abimelech,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:17,) the answer is easy. When the Lord sent Jonah to the Ninevites, he did
not reveal what had been decreed in his secret purpose, but wished to arouse
their minds by the preaching of Jonah, that he might have compassion on them.
The same thing might be said, when he threatened Abimelech and Pharaoh, because
they wished to lay hands on Abraham's wife; for thus the Lord, by terrifying
them, intended to keep them back, that they might not suffer the punishment of
their obstinacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the year that King Ahaz
died.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the fifteenth chapter ought to have
begun, for the Prophet enters on a new subject; and this plainly shows how
absurdly the chapters are divided, or rather torn asunder. Having spoken of the
Babylonians, he passes to the
Philistines;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F221</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or, perhaps, before speaking of the
Babylonians, he addressed the Philistines, who, being the near neighbors of the
Jews, cherished deadly hostility against them. They were the remainder of those
nations whom the Israelites spared, though the Lord had commanded that they
should be removed out of the midst of them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;043352&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
33:52;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:16.) Their unbelief in this matter was the reason why the Lord left these
nations to be <i>thorns</i>, that they might <i>prick their eyes</i>; as the
Scripture shows that the Lord had formerly threatened against them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;043355&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
33:55.) In consequence of the deadly animosities which existed between these two
nations, whenever the Jews sustained any defeat, the Philistines reckoned it to
be so much gain to themselves; for they wished the ruin of the Jews, and no
occurrence could give them greater delight than when the Jews were reduced to
the deepest adversity and distress. The Prophet therefore prophesies against
them as against the constant enemies of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is proper to attend to the time when
this vision was exhibited to the Prophet. So long as Ahaz lived, the Philistines
were victorious. That wicked hypocrite, who had forsaken God, and eagerly sought
the outward assistance of man, was punished for his treachery. During his reign
the Philistines
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 28:18) recovered those towns which Uzziah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 26:6, 7) had taken out of their hands; but after his death, they
became still more courageous, for they expected that they would then gain all
that they desired, because he who had been left as his heir was still a child;
for Hezekiah, the new king, had neither shrewdness, nor authority, nor wisdom.
These circumstances, therefore, ought to be carefully observed; for Isaiah has
not the Philistines so much in his view, though he speaks to them, as the godly,
whom he wishes to comfort and strengthen with good hope by this prophecy, who
would otherwise have thought that the condition of Judea was entirely ruined,
because they were attacked by enemies on all sides, and no assistance of any
kind could be seen. To those persons, therefore, in their distressed and forlorn
condition, Isaiah stretches out his hand, and bids them be of good courage,
because the Lord would undoubtedly assist
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This
burden.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls this prophecy a <i>burden</i>,
because it would be disagreeable and painful to the Philistines, who thought
that they had got rid of every annoyance, because the Jews were hard pressed,
and had no hope of bettering their condition; and therefore he threatens that
the destruction of the Philistines also is at
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice not, thou whole

groundless confidence with which the <i>Philistines</i> were puffed up, and, by
adding <i>Thou whole</i>, he intimates that all of them would feel a portion of
this calamity; as if he had said that not only would that country be laid waste
in some part, but that there would not be a corner of it exempted from the
stroke, and that, in all its length and breadth, it would immediately and
universally be visited with
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the rod
of him that smote thee is broken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think
that by the <i>broken rod</i> is meant King Ahaz, but that view is unfounded;
for in all his battles with the <i>Philistines</i> he was vanquished.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 28:18.) It must therefore be referred to Uzziah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 26:6,) and yet I would not choose to limit it even to him, but would
at the same time refer it to the whole body of the Jewish people. It is as if he
had said to <i>Palestina</i>, "Thinkest thou that thou art safe, when the Jews,
who formerly distressed thee, have been subdued? Thou art greatly deceived; for
very soon shalt thou be more severely distressed." For this reason, as I have
said, I do not limit it to any one person, but think that in the person of one
man is described the whole body of the
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For out of the adder's
root shall spring a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery
serpent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now assigns the reason why
<i>Palestina ought not to rejoice</i>; namely, that the Jews would have more
power than ever to do injury; that if the Philistines had formerly sustained
damage from them, they would afterwards sustain greater and heavier damage. The
metaphor which he employs is highly appropriate; for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cockatrice</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is more hurtful than the <i>adder</i>, and the <i>fiery</i> <i>serpent</i> is
more hurtful than the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cockatrice</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Through the kindness of God we have no animals so destructive in the countries
which we inhabit. But the Prophet means nothing else than that the power of
doing them injury has been taken away from the Jews; and therefore I differ from
others who view the name of the <i>adder</i> and of the <i>fiery serpent</i> as
applying to Hezekiah only. Though that opinion derives great plausibility from
the circumstance that Hezekiah held all that belonged to <i>the Philistines, as
far as Gaza</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:8,) yet the Prophet intended that this promise should extend farther.
Let us therefore know that the favor of which the Prophet now speaks, though it
began with Hezekiah, belongs to the Jews as to one
body.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought to draw from it a general
statement, that when we are weighed down by adversity, and when the ungodly
<i>rejoice</i> as if we were ruined, and as if they alone were prosperous, God
declares that their <i>joy</i> is without foundation. The Church will always
rise again, and be restored to her former and prosperous condition, though all
conclude that she is ruined. The children of God shall acquire new vigor, that
they may pierce the eyes of the ungodly; not that they wish this, or have any
such intention, but because the decree of God makes it necessary that this shall
take place.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The names of <i>cockatrice</i> and
<i>fiery serpent</i> do not imply reproach. In their own nature the godly are
not such, but they are so called, because they are hurtful to the wicked, though
in themselves harmless; for it is through the fault and the malice of the wicked
that what ought to have been useful and profitable is hurtful to them. Such is
also the nature of God himself,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:26,) and of the gospel,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the first-born of the poor
shall feed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, as has been already
said, has not so much in view the Philistines, to whom his threatenings were of
no avail, as the Jews, whom he wished to comfort in their affliction; for they
were so grievously afflicted that they were not far from despair. He therefore
calls them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the first-born of the
poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as being eminent for their wretchedness;
for, being reduced to extremities, they held the first rank among the wretched.
Now, he promises that the Lord will deliver them from such misery, and will
again <i>feed</i> and nourish them. Hence we perceive that the Philistines were
cut down and destroyed for the benefit of the people of God. In like manner,
also, the Lord promised to Abraham and his posterity, <i>I will</i> <i>bless
them that bless thee, and I will curse them that curse thee</i>; for those who
are hostile to the children of God must find that God is hostile to them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:3.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the needy shall lie
down in safety.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet compares his people
to sheep, whom we must resemble, if we wish to have God for our keeper. No
metaphor is more frequently employed in Scripture than this. When the Lord
chastises us, we are like sheep that are scattered, and exposed to wolves and
robbers; but when he punishes our enemies, he intends to gather us together
again, that we may dwell in a safe and quiet place. This is what Isaiah means
when he says, <i>in safety</i>. There are therefore two things which the Lord
here promises; first, pastures, that is, everything that is necessary for food
and raiment; and, secondly, safety and protection, that we may be protected and
defended from every injury. These two things belong to the duty of a shepherd,
and they include all that is necessary for our
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will kill thy
root with famine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now turns to the
Philistines, whom he compares to a tree which strikes its <i>roots</i> so deep
that we would be apt to think that it cannot in any way be rooted out. But if
the <i>root</i> be dried up, the tree also, however deeply laid, must decay.
Hence we ought to infer that the condition of the wicked is never so firmly
established that the Lord cannot easily overturn it; for not only will he cut
off branches, but he will also dry up and destroy the root which is hidden under
ground.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will slay thy
remnant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is commonly viewed as referring
to Hezekiah; but I prefer, as I have already explained, to extend it to the
whole body, of which he speaks as of one man, and of which the king was the
head, and represented Christ himself. We might also refer it to the Assyrians,
and to any others, whose agency the Lord employed in destroying the Philistines;
for it is customary with the Jews to employ indefinite language when they speak
of the agents by means of whom God executes his
judgments.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl, O
gate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet makes use of
amplifications, that by means of them he may seal his predictions on the hearts
of the godly, and may press with greater earnestness those things of which they
might otherwise have entertained doubts. In explaining another passage, where it
is said that <i>her gates shall mourn and lament</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230326&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
3:26,) we have stated that <i>the gates</i> mean crowded places, in which public
meetings were held.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He threatens that there will be
<i>mourning</i> in each of the cities, and mourning of no ordinary kind, for it
will be spread through every one of the most crowded
assemblies.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a smoke cometh
from the north.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We may understand <i>Smoke</i>
to mean <i>Fire</i>, so that the sign will denote the thing signified; for the
<i>smoke</i> appears before the <i>fire</i> burns. By <i>the north</i> we may
understand the Assyrians as well as the Jews, for both of them lay to <i>the
north</i> with respect to the land of the Philistines. Yet I prefer to interpret
it as referring to the Jews themselves, though I would not argue against the
opposite exposition. The Philistines thought, as we have already said, that they
were gainers by what the Jews suffered, as, for instance, when they sustained
any defeat from the Assyrians; but they at length found that they suffered along
with the Jews in such a defeat. Something of this kind happened, not long ago,
to many nations who had taken great delight in seeing their enemies vanquished
by the Turk: they found that such victories were destructive and <i>mournful</i>
to themselves; for, after the defeat of those whom they wished to see destroyed,
the road to themselves was likewise thrown open, and they also were
defeated.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And no one shall be
alone on his appointed day.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F224</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he adds, that at that time

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F225</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
this relates to the enemies; and he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on an appointed
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, when God shall have determined to
ruin the land of the Philistines, the enemies shall be endued with such power
and authority, that no one will remain unemployed at home, but all will be ready
for battle; as if one who intended to applaud the authority of some prince
should say that his subjects, if he but lift up his finger, assemble and give
their attendance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And what shall be answered to the
messengers of the nation?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I choose to interpret
this of any <i>nations</i> whatever, and not of a single <i>nation</i>; for
strangers, as soon as they enter into any city, are wont to ask what is done,
that they may hear some news. It is as if he had said, "<i>What shall be
answered</i> to strangers when they shall inquire? And what report shall be
spread when the Philistines shall have been
vanquished?"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the
</i>Lord<i> hath founded Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this he means
that the destruction of the land of the Philistines will be a signal proof of
God's compassion towards his people, that all may understand <i>that the</i>
Lord is the guardian and protector of Judea, which he had chosen to be his own.
The <i>foundation</i> is nothing else than God's gracious adoption, by which he
promised to Abraham
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7) and his posterity that <i>he would be a God to them</i>; and next, when he
determined that a temple should be built on <i>Zion</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;140301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 3:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
65:1, 84:7,) that the remembrance of his name might there be preserved. That
<i>foundation</i> does not consist of lime or stones, but of the gracious
promises of eternal life, by which his grace was always known to all the godly.
The Prophet therefore shows that this destruction of the Philistines will be a
signal proof, by means of which the most distant nations will learn that God
preserves and guards his people whom he hath
chosen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the poor of his
people will have confidence in it.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F226</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He does not mean that the hope of
believers will be placed in <i>Zion</i>, as when we say that we ought to hope in
God, but that the inhabitants of <i>Zion</i> shall dwell in a safe and quiet
place, as the prophets often teach, in other passages, that <i>salvation is in
Zion</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:32.) Isaiah, therefore, does not mean that the <i>confidence</i> of the godly
is placed in the Church, but he shows that the godly are preserved in it,
because the Lord defends it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet the Lord
intends to make trial of our faith, that we may not think that we are in every
respect happy; and therefore he calls them <i>poor</i>, that we may not think
that we are exempted from ordinary calamities, though we are under God's
protection. Can any higher consolation be brought to us, than to learn that the
inhabitants of the Church of God, though they are liable to a great variety of
afflictions, are out of all danger? Let us therefore apply that consolation to
our calamities, and not faint through impatience, when we are informed that God
takes care of us, and when we absolutely know that we are in
safety.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of
Moab.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet prophesies against the
<i>Moabites</i>, who were neighbors to the Jews and related to them by blood;
for we know that the <i>Moabites</i> were descended from Lot, who was Abraham's
nephew.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:31, 19:37.) Those nations being so closely related, humanity at least
demanded that they should maintain some friendly intercourse with each other.
But no relationship prevented the <i>Moabites</i> from cherishing hostility
towards the Jews, or even from harassing them whenever it was in their power;
which is an evidence of a savage and barbarous disposition. To them also, on
account of their cruelty towards the people of God, to whom they ought to have
conducted themselves with brotherly love, the Prophet therefore threatens
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought to remember the design of
these predictions. It cannot be believed that they were of any advantage to the
<i>Moabites</i>, even though they had heard from the mouth of the Prophet
himself the words which we read; but he neither addressed them with his voice,
nor sent to them a written communication. It was therefore to believers, rather
than to them, that the Prophet looked, and for two reasons. The first reason
was, that when they saw so many changes taking place, cities overturned,
kingdoms destroyed and succeeding one another, they might not think that this
world is governed by the blind violence of fortune, but might acknowledge the
providence of God. If nothing had been foretold, the minds of men, having a
strong tendency to foolishness, and being strangely blind to the works of God,
might have been disposed to attribute all this to chance; but when they had been
forewarned by the Prophets, they beheld the judgments of God as from a lofty
watch-tower. To us also in the present day Isaiah has, as it were, pointed out
with the finger what was then hidden. In his predictions we behold God sitting
on his judgment-seat, and regulating everything according to his pleasure; and
although the wicked in various ways vented their mad rage, still the Lord made
use of their agency to execute his judgments. The second design which the
prophets had in view was, that while the whole world was shaken, the Jews might
know that God took care of their safety, and that he testified the warmth of his
affection for the Church, by taking vengeance on her enemies by whom she had
been barbarously
treated.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ar-Moab.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Ar</i>) means <i>a city</i>; as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kir</i>) means <i>a wall</i>; but as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bawm
r[</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>Ar-Moab</i>) was one of the chief cities of
the <i>Moabites</i>, it is supposed to be here a proper name. We might indeed
explain both words as appellatives, to convey a threatening of the overthrow of
the fortified towns of which the <i>Moabites</i> are proud; but I rather adopt
the ordinary interpretation. Here therefore Isaiah has given a description, that
we may behold in it the overthrow of the Moabites, when their chief cities are
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the night</i> he means a sudden
and unexpected occurrence, which the Moabites did not dread. <i>Night</i> being
appropriated to rest, if anything happen at that time, it is viewed as sudden
and unlooked for, and therefore excites violent alarm. Besides, he intended to
rebuke the Moabites for being free from anxiety, considering themselves to be
fortified by defences on every hand, and placed beyond the reach of all
danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is brought to
silence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is, <i>is destroyed</i>, and
hence also <i>Silence</i> sometimes means Death. Others disregard the metaphor,
and choose to render it, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She is
cut off</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but I leave that point undecided. What
Isaiah declares as to the <i>Moabites</i>, Scripture pronounces as to the
reprobate, that destruction is at hand, and, when they are looking for nothing
of that kind, will fearfully overwhelm them.

the high places.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This makes it still more
evident that he is speaking of the Temple; and it is beyond a doubt that the
Moabites had a fortress remarkable and celebrated above the rest, in which they
had built <i>high places</i> in honor of their idol. Being ignorant of the true
God, to whom they might betake themselves in adversity, we need not wonder that
they betake themselves to an idol, in conformity to their ordinary custom. By
doing this they increased their misery, and brought upon themselves an
accumulation of all distresses; for they inflamed the wrath of God still more by
those very means which they considered to be fitted for appeasing his wrath. He
therefore wished to state more plainly the condition of the ungodly, who have no
refuge in adversity; for as to those remedies which they think will be adapted
to their diseases, nothing can be more destructive to them, since they excite
more and more the Lord's
indignation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moab shall howl
over Nebo and over Medeba.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>Nebo</i> also was
one of the cities of the <i>Moabites</i>. The Prophet has already named two of
them, <i>Ar</i> and <i>Kir</i>; he now adds a third, <i>Nebo</i>; and lastly he
mentions a fourth, <i>Medeba</i>; as if he had said that this destruction would
not only seize the extremities of that country, but would reach its inmost
recesses, so that not one corner could be
exempted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On every
head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Every nation has its peculiar ceremonies
to denote mourning or joy. The Italians and other western nations allowed the
hair and beard to grow when they were in mourning; and hence arose the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to lengthen the
beard</i></font><font face="Palatino">. On the other hand, the eastern nations
shaved the head and beard, which they reckoned to be ornamental; and when they
reversed their ordinary custom, that was a token of
mourning.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F229</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nothing else therefore is meant than
that the condition of the whole kingdom will be so mournful, that the

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F230</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He proceeds with the same subject, describing more fully the tokens of mourning,
in which the eastern nations abound more than others; for, having quicker
understandings and keener feelings, they express their emotions by outward signs
more than others do, who, being slower in apprehension, are likelvise slower in
movement and gesture. It was no doubt faulty in them that they indulged in so
many ceremonies and gesticulations; but the Prophet spoke of them as what was
known and common, only for the purpose of describing the grief which would
follow the desolation of that
country.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall howl
and descend to weeping.</i></font><font face="Palatino">

It was with good reason that he added this description; for we are never moved
by predictions, unless the Lord place them, as it were, before our eyes. Lest
the Jews should think that these matters might be lightly passed by, when he
described that destruction, he determined to mention also <i>mourning, weeping,
and howling</i>, that they might see almost with their own eyes those events
which appear to be incredible, for the Moabites were at that time in a state of
profound peace, and believers had the more need of being confirmed, that they
might not call this prophecy in question. By the same means he points out the
despair to which unbelievers are liable in adversity, for the support on which
they rely is insecure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k
l[</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>gnal ken</i>) literally signifies
<i>therefore</i>, yet some think that a reason is not here assigned; but that is
of little importance. The Prophet shows that there will be none that does not

adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the soul of every one shall

assumes the character of a mourner. But it may be thought to be strange and
inconsistent in him to bewail the calamity of the Moabites; for he ought rather
to have lamented the destruction of the Church, and to have rejoiced at the ruin
of her enemies. It is customary with the prophets, however, to assume in this
manner the character of those whose calamities they foretell, and thus to
exhibit their condition, as it were, on a stage; by which means they produce a
stronger impression than if they delivered their instruction in a direct form.
Yet there can be no doubt that the prophets shuddered at the judgments of God,
even against the wicked; though the meaning which I have stated is simpler and
more appropriate, and may easily be inferred from frequent
usage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His fugitives to

Now, he compares <i>Zoar</i> to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
heifer of three years old</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"> which is in full
vigor, and has not felt the pangs of birth, or toil, or the yoke, but revels in
the buoyancy of mirth and wantonness. When men are hard pressed by an invading
army, they flee to cities which have not been attacked, and which appear to be
the farthest removed from danger. Such was <i>Zoar</i>, for it had never been
attacked by enemies. Yet, if it be thought better to view it as applying to the
whole country, I have no objection; for Jeremiah appears to speak in general
terms, though he borrows many statements from Isaiah.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244834&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:34.) But perhaps in that passage also he names both <i>Zoar</i> and
<i>Horonaim</i>, or rather the whole of the country between
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If you extend it to the whole nation, the
meaning will be, "The Moabites have enjoyed the highest luxury, and every kind
of abundance, and hitherto have suffered no distress. Hence has arisen their
stubbornness, and, in order to subdue them, they must be banished and driven
even to <i>Zoar</i>." Now <i>Zoar</i> was a town very far removed from the
Moabites; and, therefore, he means that they cannot provide for their safety but
by <i>fleeing</i> to a distance. Here all with whom the Lord deals tenderly are
taught not to exalt themselves, or to provoke God by their wantonness, but to be
modest even amidst the highest prosperity, and likewise to be prepared for every
change, when the Lord shall be pleased to throw them down from their
prosperity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the going up of

I have adhered to the commonly received opinion, that

arm."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The waters of
Nimrim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By an exaggerated form of expression he
gives a more enlarged view of this desolation. He says that <i>the</i> <i>grass
is withered</i>, which takes place when God leaves any soil destitute of all
nourishment. <i>The waters</i> will be taken away, which probably were highly
necessary for that dry and parched country; for soils of that kind produce
nothing without irrigation. Though the style is exaggerated, yet nothing is
stated but what is strictly true; for the Prophet did not go beyond proper
bounds, but found it necessary to use bold expressions to suit the ignorance of
the people, in order to inform them that a land which is deprived of the
blessing of God will be like a desert without any
beauty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore what every one hath

F235</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This corresponds to the ordinary
expression, (<i>Ce qu'il aura espargne</i>,) <i>Whatever he shall</i> <i>have

happens in countries which are invaded by an enemy. All the inhabitants are wont
to convey their riches elsewhere, and to lay them up in some safe place, that
they may afterwards bring them back when peace has been
restored.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the brook of the
willows.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that they will have no
storehouse, no fortress in which they can lay them up with safety; so that they
will be compelled to hide them among <i>the willows</i>. This certainly is the
lowest wretchedness, when the enemy is attacking us, and we can find no
storehouse for laying up those things which we have collected with great
industry. These <i>willows</i> were probably situated in some remote and
sequestered place. Others explain it as referring to enemies, that they will
bring the fruits of their robbery <i>to the</i> <i>brook</i>, to divide among
themselves the general plunder.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

part of that country all around shall be full of <i>crying</i> and
<i>howling</i>; because that destruction reaches from one extremity to another.
Besides the <i>crying</i> he twice mentions the <i>howling</i>, to denote the
excess of grief, as men who are in despair surrender themselves entirely to
lamentation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>

F237</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here he describes not only <i>grief</i>
and <i>howling</i>, flight or trembling, or the covetousness of enemies in
plundering their wealth, but the slaughter of men. How great must this have
been, when large and magnificent rivers, such as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dimon</i></font><font face="Palatino">
was, are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>filled with

F238</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By <i>additions</i> he means that the
Lord, in whose name he speaks, will multiply the murders; so that the dead
bodies shall be heaped up, and there shall be no end to cruelty and slaying.
Now, though the Assyrians were cruel in this slaughter, yet the Lord was not
cruel; for he justly punished the barbarity of the Moabites which they basely
exercised towards the Jews, on whom they ought to have had compassion. It was
right that they should suffer the same punishment which they had inflicted on
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To those who have
escqped of Moab lions.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These also are the
<i>additions</i> of which he spake, or, at least, a part of them. This may be
regarded as the copestone of that calamity; so that if any detachments of the
enemy attempted to escape, and to rescue themselves from the slaughter, they had
to encounter <i>lions</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F239</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and wild beasts, by which they were devoured. "They will, indeed," says he,
"rescue themselves from the slaughter, but they will not on that account be
safe, nor will they escape the hand of God." And this is the true meaning of the
Prophet, if we carefully examine the scope of the whole passage; for he intended
to deepen the picture of that distressing calamity by adding, that even the
small remnant which shall be rescued from the slaughter will fall into the jaws
of <i>lions</i>. The hand of the Lord pursues the wicked in such a manner that
they cannot in any way escape; for if they avoid one danger, they immediately
meet with another. Let us remember that these things are spoken by the Prophet
for the consolation of the godly, that they may fortify their minds by some
promise against the cruelty of their enemies, who shall at length be destroyed,
and shall nowhere find a refuge either in their gods, or in fortresses, or in
lurking-places or in flight.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Send ye a
lamb.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet scoffs at the Moabites
for not acknowledging God at the proper time, but recklessly waiting for the
stroke of his hand, till they were completely destroyed. It is, therefore, a
condemnation of late repentance, when men cannot be brought to obedience by any
warnings, and continue in obstinate opposition to God. Where the disease is
incurable, an exhortation of this kind is appropriate; and this ought to be
carefully observed, for both Jews and Christians misinterpret this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Jerome explains it as referring to
Christ, because he drew his birth from the Moabites,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;080104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ruth
1:4;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
1:5,) from whom Ruth was descended; and that opinion has been adopted by almost
all Christians; as if the Prophet had said, "O Lord, though a judgment so severe
as this awaits the Moabites, still thou wilt not utterly destroy them; for they
will send thee </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a Lamb, the ruler
of the world."</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But that interpretation, being
destitute of plausibility, need not be
refuted.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, the Jews think that
these words were spoken because, while the Jews were in a depressed condition,
the Moabites ceased to pay the tribute which they owed them, but that, after
having prophesied about the restoration of the kingdom of Judah, Isaiah likewise
added an exhortation to remind them to acknowledge their king. They even go so
far as to say that it serves the purpose of a royal edict, taking them to task
for their disloyalty, "Send the tribute which you owe." But we nowhere read that
the Moabites were subjects or tributaries to the Jews, and there is no
probability in the conjecture. Nor does the passage which they quote
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;120301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 3:5, 6) give them any support; for that passage relates to <i>the king of
Israel</i>, and expressly mentions <i>Ahab</i> and <i>Samaria</i>, who
cherished, as we are aware, the utmost hatred against the
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I therefore adhere to the interpretation
which I first noticed, as the true and natural interpretation; for the design of
the Prophet is to condemn the Moabites for not having repented in due season,
and to tell them that they will now in vain do what they might easily have done
formerly, and with great advantage to themselves. We ought, therefore, to view
it as spoken ironically,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijrwnikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
<i>Send</i>; as if he had said that there is no hope of pardon, that they will
<i>send</i> in vain. When the wicked are warned, they indolently disregard all
exhortation; when they are punished, they gaze around them with distressful
looks, seeking assistance in every direction, and trying every method of relief,
but unsuccessfully, for they gain no advantage. Isaiah, therefore, reproaches
them for obstinacy and rebellion, and shows that there will be no time for
repentance, when they meet with the destruction which they
deserve.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the ruler of the

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">xra</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>eretz</i>) does not here denote a particular country, but rather the whole
<i>world</i>, of which he speaks in general terms. The appellation <i>Ruler</i>
must therefore be viewed as referring to God himself. By <i>a</i> <i>lamb</i>,
he means what was to be offered in sacrifice; for even the Gentiles acknowledged
that they worshipped God when they offered
sacrifices.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the

It shall be as a bird let loose.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F242</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now shows what he meant by
the former mockery, that the Moabites ought not at that time to think of
<i>sending</i> sacrifices, because they will not be able to provide for their
safety in any other way than by leaving their native country. By the metaphor of
<i>birds</i> he describes the terror with which they shall be struck, so that
they will flee even at the rustling of a leaf. He threatens that the Moabites,
who had abused their tranquillity, shall have a trembling and wearisome
flight.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assemble a
council.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with the same subject; for
if we wish rightly to understand this passage, we must set before our minds the
dreadful ruin of the Moabites. Their crimes are brought to remembrance, that all
may see more clearly how deservedly they are punished. When everything was in
their power, they freely indulged in licentiousness, and would not listen to any
reproofs; but now, when they are deprived of everything, they groan, and seek
remedies which are nowhere to be found. The Lord deals with the reprobate in
such a manner that, in order to leave them without excuse, he bestows upon them,
and places in their hands, everything that they need; but when, through their
wicked passion, they have abused and turned everything to a wicked purpose, he
deprives them of all aid and support, and utterly destroys
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Execute
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> While the Moabites enjoyed
prosperity, they cared little about what was good and right; while it was in
their power to rule, and to have their kingdom established, in a just manner,
they abused their power for the purpose of tyranny. Now that they were stripped
of all authority, and were exiles and fugitives, Isaiah ironically advises them
to <i>assemble councils</i> and <i>execute</i> <i>judgments</i>, which they had
formerly overturned through fraud and injustice. Isaiah has in view that time
when all power and authority was taken out of the hands of the Moabites. The
upbraiding is similar to that with which the Lord addresses Adam,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:22,) <i>Behold, Adam</i> <i>is become as one of us</i>, ridiculing him with
the biting taunt, that he was not satisfied with his exalted attainments, and
wished to rival God himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In like manner, the
Moabites, not satisfied with their ornaments and wealth, wretchedly harassed and
plundered the Israelites and Jews, and formed wicked plans against them. Having
abused the excellent gift of God, they therefore deserved to have this reproof
addressed to them, which is equally applicable to all the reprobate, who proudly
vaunt in prosperity and barbarously abuse it for harassing the godly. Seeing
that they basely pollute those things which the Lord had set apart to their
proper use, it is right that they should be deprived of them and reduced to the
lowest poverty. We have instances of this every day. How comes it that those who
were raised to the highest rank of honor fall down headlong, but because the
Lord punishes their tyrannical rule and their crimes? The Lord also ridicules
their upbraiding and reproachful language, their wailings, and even their
complaints; as when they exclaim, "O that I had the wealth which I once enjoyed!
O that I were restored to my former condition!" For then repentance will be too
late.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thy
shadow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Moabites might, as I have already
hinted, have given some relief to the wretched Jews, when they were harassed by
the Assyrians; or, at least, if they had had a spark of humanity, they ought to
have protected the fugitives; but, on the contrary, they persecuted them, and
added to the weight of their afflictions, which were already oppressive. It was
highly proper that the Moabites should be the subjects of that cruelty which
they had exercised towards others; that, when they had been driven from their
dwellings, and were exiles and wanderers, they should nowhere find any solace,
any <i>shadow</i> to shelter them from the heat; for why should they enjoy the
consolations which they had barbarously refused to
others?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the night in the
midst of noon-day.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F244</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By <i>noon-day</i> is here meant the
most scorching heat. This metaphor is frequently employed in Scripture, that the
Lord was <i>like a cloud at noon, and like a pillar</i> <i>of fire by night</i>;
for he once was so in the wilderness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

though they did not relate the
history.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hide the
banished.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means the Jews, whom the Assyrians
persecuted and harassed, and whom the Moabites at the same time treated cruelly.
It was their duty to shelter and relieve the fugitives, and especially those who
fled to them for protection; but seeing that they drove them out, it was proper
that they should be driven out in the same manner, and deprived of all
assistance and support; for it is a righteous sentence which the Lord

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:2.) Now the Prophet calls on the Moabites to acknowledge their sins, so as to
confess that they are justly punished for their cruelty. Yet he rather has the
Jews in his eye, in order to inform them that God does not disregard their
afflictions, for they are told that he will be their
avenger.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let mine outcasts dwell with
thee, Moab.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet addresses the
<i>Moabites</i>, as if he were humbly beseeching them in the name of the people
at large. "You are neighbors, related to us by blood; receive and assist those
who are in distress: and if you do not choose to assist, at least do them no
harm." God, who usually undertakes the cause of his people, is represented by
the Prophet as if he performed the part of a suppliant. It is certain, that the
Moabites did not at all act in this manner towards the Jews, but, on the
contrary, that they joined their efforts with the enemies of the Jews to do them
injury. But, as I said a little before, the Prophet sets before our eyes that
justice which even nature demands, that the cruel violation of it may be the
more abhorred.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to be
carefully observed; for God shows how great is the care which he takes of his
people, since the injuries done to them affect him in the same manner as if they
had been done to himself; as he declares by Zechariah, that <i>whenever they are
touched, the apple of</i> <i>his eye is touched</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah

shows that he has heard them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore
learn from this passage to be kind and dutiful to fugitives and exiles, and
especially to believers, who are banished for their confession of the word. No
duty can be more pleasing or acceptable to God; and, on the other hand, nothing
is more hateful or abominable in his sight than barbarity and cruelty. If we
wish to obtain any alleviation of our calamities, let us be kind and
compassionate, and not refuse assistance to the needy.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When God calls them <i>his banished</i>, this may
without impropriety be viewed as referring to punishment, as if he said, that by
a just judgment they were <i>banished</i> from the land of Canaan,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052864&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:64,) as he had so often threatened against them. Yet undoubtedly he likewise
means, that they continue to be under his defense and protection, because,
though they are banished and driven out of their native country, still he
acknowledges them to be his people. That calamity which the Jews endured might
be regarded as an evidence that they were cast off; but the Lord acknowledges
them to be <i>his children</i>, though he chastises them severely. Hence we
obtain a doctrine full of consolation, that we are reckoned in the number of his
children, though sharp and heavy strokes are inflicted upon
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the extortioner hath
ceased.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F245</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He now directs his discourse to the
Jews, and proceeds to comfort them, as he had done formerly, by showing that,
when their enemies shall be removed from the midst of them, the banishment or
ruin of their enemies will also relieve their own calamities and distresses. Yet
the former statements related chiefly to the Jews, though the Prophet expressly
addressed the Moabites. But at that time he only threatened vengeance on
enemies, while here he more clearly promises consolation to his people; as if he
had said, "Thou thoughtest, O Moab, that my people were utterly ruined: but I
will restrain the enemies, and put an end to that affliction. Thou shalt
therefore perish; but my people shall at length be delivered from those dreadful
calamities."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Perhaps it will rather be thought
that there is a change of the tenses; and thus the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ki</i>,) which we have rendered <i>For</i>, will signify
<i>Until</i>;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

immediate connection with the former part of the sentence.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let my banished dwell with thee,
Moab; be thou a place of concealment from the face of the destroyer, until the
extortioner shall have ceased</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But as that
might be thought to be a forced interpretation, I have chosen to abide by the
natural meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the throne shall be prepared

F247</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Jews explain the whole of this verse
as referring to Hezekiah but this is altogether inappropriate, for the Prophet
speaks of a more important restoration of the Church, and the Moabites had not
been punished during the flourishing condition of Hezekiah's reign; and the
blessing of God again began to burst forth on the Jews. It is as if it had been
said "All the enemies of the chosen people maliciously contrive the ruin of that
kingdom, which God promised <i>should be established for ever</i>."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:13.) That the godly may not give way to despondency amidst the unhappy
confusion, they are reminded of the perpetuity of the kingdom, of which they had
been assured by a well-known prediction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
cannot therefore be explained as referring to any other than to Christ, though I
acknowledge that Hezekiah was a type of Christ, as David and the rest of his
successors also were. But they conduct us to Christ, who alone is the protector
and leader of his people,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:16,) and who has <i>gathered the remnant that was scattered abroad</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431152&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
11:52.) For this reason he sends back the godly to Christ, as if he had said,
"You know what God you worship. He has declared that he will watch over your
safety, so that under his protection you will always continue to be safe and
uninjured; and if you shall at any time meet with reverses, he has promised to
you a Redeemer, under whom you shall enjoy renewed and steadfast prosperity.
Though for a time you may weep, yet the protector of the Church will come, and
will restore you to a flourishing state of freedom. You ought, therefore, with
your whole heart, to rely on the expectation of him; even when you see the
Church to be in a confused and wretched
condition."</font><br><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully observed;
for all other consolations are transitory and fading, if we do not refer all of
them to Christ. Let our eyes therefore be fixed on him, if we wish to be happy
and prosperous; for he has promised that we shall be happy even amidst the
cross,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:10,11,) that agony and torments will open up the way to a blessed life,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

to the amount of our happiness.

mercy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah shows that this does not take
place through the agency of men, but by the kindness of God, who is the builder
of this <i>throne</i>; and therefore we ought to acknowledge that it is owing to
his undeserved goodness that this sacred <i>throne</i> is established among us.
The Prophet expressly confirms this by saying, that the cause of it must not be
sought anywhere else than in the absolute <i>mercy</i> of God. Nor can any other
cause be found; for God could not be induced by any excellence of character, or
by merits, (of which there certainly were none,) to set up again the throne
which had fallen down through the fault and through the crimes of the people;
but when he saw that those whom he had adopted were ruined, he wished to give a
proof of his infinite goodness. Now, if God build this throne, by whom shall it
be overturned? Will wicked men be stronger than
he?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will sit upon it in
the tabernacle of David.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Almost every word here
is emphatic, so that this verse deserves to be continually pondered. I do not
object to the opinion that the word <i>tabernacle</i> contains an allusion to
this effect, that he was but an ordinary man before he was <i>called to sit on a
throne</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:11, 12;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:8.) The Prophet intended to draw a picture of the Church, which has no
resemblance to the thrones of kings and of princes, and does not shine with gold
or precious stones. Though he has held out the spiritual kingdom of Christ under
a mean and despicable shape, yet at the same time he shows that that kingdom
will be seen on earth and amongst men. If he had only said that <i>the
throne</i> of Christ will be erected, we might have asked, Will his
<i>throne</i> be in heaven, or also on earth? But now when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the tabernacle of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he shows that Christ reigns not only
among angels but also among men, lest we should think that, in order to seek
him, we must enter into heaven. Wicked men ridicule what we preach about the
kingdom of Christ, as if it were some phantom of our own imagination. They wish
to see it with their eyes, and to have the evidence of their senses; but we
ought not to conceive of it as at all carnal, but to be satisfied with his arm
and with his power.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
steadfastness.
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tma</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>emeth</i>) denotes not only <i>truth</i> but every kind of <i>certainty</i>.
The Prophet means that the kingdom of Christ will be firm and steadfast, as
Daniel also declared.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270244&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:44, 7:14.) The Evangelist also says, <i>Of his kingdom there</i> <i>shall be
no end</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:33.) In this respect it is distinguished from the ordinary condition of
kingdoms, which, even when they are founded on great and enormous wealth,
crumble down or even fall by their own weight, so that they have no more
permanency than vanishing pictures. But Isaiah declares, that the kingdom of
Christ, though it frequently totter, will be supported by the hand of God, and
therefore will last for ever. These proofs ought to fortify us against
temptations which arise, whenever the kingdom of Christ is attacked by enemies
so numerous and powerful that we might be ready to think that it will quickly be
destroyed. Whatever weapons the world may employ, and though hell itself should
vomit out flames of fire, we must abide by this
promise,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall
judge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I understand
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tp&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shophet</i>) to mean <i>Governor</i>, as if he had said, "There will be one
who shall <i>govern</i>." Often do we see a magnificent throne when there is no
one to sit on it, and it frequently happens that kings are either idols or
cattle, without judgment or skill or wisdom. But here he says, that one will sit
who shall discharge the office of a good <i>governor</i>; and this is added in
order to assure us that Christ will be our
protector.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And seek judgment
and hasten righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The <i>judgment</i>
and the <i>righteousness</i> which are ascribed to him, are nothing else than
the protection under which he receives us, and which he will not allow to be
infringed; for he will not allow wicked men who injure us to pass unpunished,
while we patiently and calmly commit ourselves to his protection. By the word
<i>hasten</i> he shows that he will quickly and speedily avenge our cause. This
must be viewed as a rebuke to our impatience, for we never think that his
assistance comes soon enough. But when we are hurried along by the violence of
passion, let us remember that this arises from not submitting to his providence;
for although according to the judgment of our flesh he delays, still he
regulates his judgment in the best manner by the seasons which are well known to
him. Let us therefore submit to his
will.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have heard of the pride of
Moab.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet added this statement by way
of anticipation. It might be thought that men could not believe what he had
promised about restoring the <i>throne</i> of the king and destroying the
Moabites, who at that time were in a flourishing state of riches, and were
defended by strong fortresses, and who, puffed up with the prosperity which they
now enjoyed, were exceedingly <i>proud</i>. Besides, their haughtiness, with
which they scorned the unhappy Jews, was a disagreeable and powerful weapon for
discouraging or shaking their minds. To provide against this temptation, he
relates that their boasting was well known, but that their <i>pride</i> would
not prevent God from overthrowing them; because no array of armed forces, no
treasures of riches, no multitude of men, can withstand God. Isaiah speaks of it
as a thing extensively known, that the Moabites are puffed up in such a manner
that they dread nothing; as is commonly the case with those who are well
supplied with riches and troops, that they idly exalt themselves above God and
men. But whatever may be their arrogance, the Lord will easily restrain
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
insolence.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F248</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrb[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnebrah</i>) most frequently signifies <i>indignation</i>; but the
connection in which it stands appears to call for something more definite. This
noun is derived from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnabar</i>,) to <i>pass</i> or <i>go beyond</i>, answering to the Latin word
<i>excessus</i>; and therefore I have thought it better to translate it
<i>insolence</i>. In a parallel passage, after the words <i>pride</i> and
<i>arrogance</i> comes the phrase <i>haughtiness of</i> <i>heart</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:29.) Both Isaiah and Jeremiah, I have no doubt, mean that the Moabites, in
consequence of their stubborn and disdainful behavior, and their sumptuous mode
of living, were so cruel, that they kindled into wrath on the most trivial
occasions, and rose fiercely against others. This vice is always accompanied by
haughtiness of mind; for <i>pride</i> is followed by disdain and contempt of
others, and they who claim more than is due to them easily kindle into rage, and
become furious for the smallest offense. In short, they can bear nothing, and
are not only passionate, but likewise outrageous. They would wish that all
should yield to them, and that they should yield to none. If all do not yield at
their bidding, they think that injustice is done to them. This passionate temper
is easily betrayed by proud men. On the other hand, the humble possess kindness
accompanied by corresponding modesty, and easily forgive any one who has injured
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
lies.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>baddim</i>) denotes either <i>a mans limbs</i>, or <i>the branches of a
tree</i>, and sometimes it is put for <i>divination</i>. Accordingly, the Greek
translators</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F249</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> render it manteia, <i>divination</i>,
and it has that signification in other passages. Some think that it is here used
metaphorically for <i>children</i>; others translate it either <i>discourses</i>
or <i>thoughts</i>; and others render it <i>strength</i> or <i>sinews</i>. But
in my opinion it is rather put for <i>vain boasting</i>; for this word often
denotes <i>falsehood</i>, and we shall soon see how well this signification
applies to the present passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is quite
as much difference in the interpretation of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ken</i>,) <i>so</i>. The greater part suppose it to mean that "the lies are
not right," or that "the discourses are not right," and others, that "the lies
are not true;" and as to the substance of the matter, I am almost of their
opinion. I have no doubt that the meaning of the Prophet is, that Moab foolishly
utters his vain boastings, for he will not accomplish what he imagines. As to
the words, the meaning of them is obtained with greater certainty from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:30. After the same words which are here employed by Isaiah, he immediately
adds, for the sake of explaining them,

al</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>lo ken</i>,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his lies shall not so effect
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said, "What is determined in
their hearts shall fail of accomplishment." Yet I do not think, that in the
former clause the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ken</i>) denotes comparison, but rather confirmation, so to speak, but
negatively; for he declares that there will be no firmness or stability in his
counsels, that <i>his</i> <i>divinations</i> or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lies will not take
effect</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Proud men settle everything as if
everything were in their power, and were not subject to the providence of God.
"Such <i>arrogance</i>," says Isaiah, shall be brought down, and all that they
promise, as to their own strength, shall vanish away. This reminds us that pride
is highly displeasing to God, and that the more men are puffed up with their
riches, they are the nearer to
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

the Church is basely and shamefully trampled under foot; and, according to this
example, the end of all proud men must be mournful. When he adds, <i>Moab to
Moab</i>, he means that there will be what may be called a melancholy concert
among them, in which they shall mutually complain of their calamities and bewail
their distresses among themselves. Others render it, <i>on</i> <i>account of

is sufficiently evident that this was a chief and royal city; but some consider
it to be a proper name, and others to be an appellative. There can be no doubt
that the etymology of the word was derived from its being constructed of earthen
materials. It is also possible that it received this name on account of the
nature of the walls, which were built of bricks. It was a distinguished city in
that country. He names </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
foundations</i></font><font face="Palatino"> rather than the city itself,
because it was to be completely thrown down; as if he had said, "You shall not

The particle

Those who explain it affirmatively suppose the meaning to be this,

utter destruction of that city, and intimates that those who are left will
lament not only the distresses of others, but also their own. They, too, will be
wounded. And if such severe punishments are inflicted on the <i>proud</i>, let

48:32.) When Prophets threaten destruction to countries, they usually delineate
their more remarkable features. For instance, were we to speak of Picardy, we
certainly would say nothing about <i>vines</i>, as if we had been speaking about
Orleans or Burgundy. Now, the cities mentioned by the Prophet were the chief
cities of Moab.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lords of

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F256</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This serves to point out the extent of the devastation; for this city was
situated on the confines of the land of the Moabites; as if he had said, "Not

wasted far and wide." Some refer this to the enemies themselves; but I would
rather supply the relative

(<i>asher</i>,) <i>which</i>, and refer it to <i>the vines, which</i> were so
extensive that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reached even

these vineyards </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reached even to

passage; for it is immediately added that the vineyards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reached to the
wilderness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and even <i>to the sea</i>; by
which he means that the country was exceedingly fertile, and especially that it
abounded in <i>vines</i>. He says that they <i>crossed the sea</i>,

because, when the soil is productive, it is customary to protect by mounds what
is contiguous to the sea, in order to extend the cultivation, and to oppose the
violence of the waves by posts of wood and embankments, in order to obtain a
large extent of available soil.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I will
bewail.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet here takes upon him the
character of another person, as we have formerly remarked; for in the name of
the Moabites he laments and groans. It is undoubtedly true that believers always
shudder at the judgments of God, and cannot lay aside the feelings of human
nature, so as not to commiserate the destruction of the wicked. Yet he does not
describe his own feelings; but his intention is to give additional weight to his
instruction, that no one may entertain a doubt as to the accomplishment. He
therefore represents in the person of a Moabite, as on a stage, the mourning and
grief which shall be felt by all after that calamity, in order to hold out to
the Jews a confirmation of this promise, which otherwise might have been thought
to be incredible.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because on
thy summer-fruits and on thy harvest a shouting shall break
forth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or <i>shall
fall.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

variously explained by commentators.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>naphal</i>,) signifies to <i>fall</i>, or to <i>burst forth</i>. Those who
translate it, <i>to burst</i> <i>forth</i>, consider the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddyh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hedad</i>,) <i>shouting</i>, to refer to the enemies themselves; as if he
had said, "<i>The shouting</i> of enemies
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bursts forth on thy
harvest;"</i></font><font face="Palatino"> so that there is an implied contrast
between this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shouting</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and the <i>joy</i> of which he will afterwards speak. Others explain it to mean,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the shoutings will be
laid;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, "there shall be no more
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shouting</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and no longer shall the glad and merry voices of the reapers be heard, cheering
themselves after the harvest." But I would rather refer it to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shouting</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of enemies; and on this point I follow a most faithful interpreter of this
passage, the Prophet Jeremiah, who says that <i>the</i> <i>spoiler bursts
forth</i>,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244832&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:32,) where Isaiah speaks of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shouting</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of the enemy; as if he had said, "When thou shalt make preparations for
gathering in thy harvest and thy vintage, the enemies will <i>rush</i> in, and,
instead of joy and cheerful song, their <i>shouting</i> shall be heard, which
shall drive thee far
away."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Joy is taken away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms, by different
words, what he has now said, that the whole country shall be desolate and
forsaken, so that there shall never again be in it a harvest or a vintage. When
he threatens that God will cause the vine-dressers to cease to sing, he refers
to an ancient custom; for when they gathered the vintage, they usually testified
their joy both by dancing and by singing. Hence these words of Virgil, <i>The
exhausted vine-dresser now addresses by song his</i> <i>farthest
rows</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F259</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In like manner, the sailors, when they
approach the harbour, raise their shout of joy, (keleusma,) because, having
finished their toils, and escaped dangers, they see that they have hope of
obtaining some leisure or refreshment. It is as if the Prophet had said, "When
the produce of the harvest shall be taken away, nothing will be left to them but
to lament their
poverty."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Therefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for
Moab.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Assuming the character of a Moabite, the
Prophet again describes excessive lamentations proceeding from grief so intense
that even the bowels make a distressing noise; for by the sign he intended to
point out the reality. We have formerly explained the object of those lively
descriptions, which is, to bring the events, as it were, before our eyes, and to
lead us to entertain stronger hopes of those things which appear to go beyond
all belief. By again naming <i>Kir-Hareseth</i>, the chief city, and thus taking
a part for the whole, he describes the destruction of the whole
country.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall
be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again returns to that statement which he
formerly noticed, namely, that idolaters in their affliction betake themselves
to their idols, hoping to obtain some relief from them. Yet it means somewhat
more; for while idolaters have their ordinary temples and places of worship, if
any uncommon calamity befalls them, they go to another temple more sacred than
the rest, expecting that there they will be more abundantly favored with the
presence of their god. In like manner, the Papists of the present day, when they
are reduced to any uncommon danger, (for this fault has existed in all ages,)
think that they will more readily obtain their wish by running to St. Claude, or
to Mary of Loretto, or to any other celebrated idol, than if they assembled in
some neighboring church. They resolve that their extraordinary prayers shall be
offered up in a church which is at a great distance. It is in this sense that
the Prophet applies the term <i>Sanctuary</i> to that which was most highly
celebrated among the Moabites, and says that they will go to it, but without any
advantage. Now it is evident from sacred history that their most celebrated
temple was dedicated to <i>Chemosh</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;111107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 11:7.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall not
profit by it.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F260</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The phrase
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lkwy
al</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>lo</i> <i>yuchal</i>,) <i>they shall not be
able</i>, is explained by some to mean, that they shall at length be so
completely worn out that they will not have sufficient strength to go to the
temple. But I think it better to render it thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall not profit by
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he shuts out the Moabites from all hope
of safety, by saying that they will find no protection even in their
gods.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When it is
seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">harn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>nirah</i>,) <i>seen</i>, is emphatic. It means that idolaters are not guided
by reason, but rather by the impressions made on their senses, like brute
beasts: for as the beasts judge by feeling, smelling, and seeing, so idolaters
have no other guide than the judgment of the flesh. Accordingly, if any one
shall show that they are doing wrong, he will gain nothing by it. Though they
have often known by experience that they gain nothing by so many laborious
exertions, they will not desist from them, but will contrive new methods and
introduce new modes of worship, hoping that God will approve of them. If they
succeed according to their wish, they ascribe everything to their superstitions,
and become more obstinate. If they perceive that they have derived no advantage,
they reject their contrivances, condemn the superstitious worship, and curse
their gods. In short, they rely altogether on the events, and do not judge of
anything either by reason or by the word of God. The consequence is, that, as
they are guided by what befalls them, they are continually changing their plans.
But the Prophet appears to mean somewhat more, namely, that when their folly, in
having hitherto labored to no purpose, shall have been openly manifested and
exposed, the Moabites will come into the temple of Chemosh, rather through shame
than in the exercise of judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This concluding sentence is the
ratification of the prophecy. It means that he has pronounced the decree of God
himself, and that he has brought nothing forward that did not proceed from the
Lord, and thus, laying aside the person of a man, he introduces God speaking in
this manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Three
years.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The time is fixed, not only for the sake
of certainty, but likewise that believers may not become faint through longer
delay. He alludes to agreements among men, in which it is customary to fix the
time agreed on, which the parties are not at liberty to transgress. This is
especially the case in the labors of <i>hirelings</i>, from whom Scripture
frequently draws a comparison in this respect, that they earnestly long for the
appointed day when they shall receive their reward; for they groan, as it were,
under the burden, and grievously dislike their daily toils.

it, and thought that they were invincible. When he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant shall be
feeble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he means that there will be so
great a change, that they will have no resemblance to their former condition;

In the English version it runs, <i>as overthrown by strangers</i>; and the

A lively French traveler, Tavernier, who flourished about the middle of the
seventeenth century, in describing the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea,
gives the following account: &#8212; "There we see large beds of <i>melons</i>
and of <i>cucumbers</i>, but especially of the latter, of which the inhabitants
of the Levant are particularly fond. Most frequently they eat them without
peeling, and afterwards drink a glass of water. Throughout the whole of Asia
this is the ordinary food of the common people for three or four months. The
whole family lives on it, and when a child asks for something to eat, instead of
giving it bread, as in France and other places is the custom, in the Levant they
offer it a <i>cucumber</i>, which it eats raw just as it has been fresh pulled.
<i>Cucumbers</i> in the Levant have a peculiarly excellent flavour, and though
they are eaten raw they never do any injury." &#8212;

The temple of Janus was built by Numa Polllpilius, whose wise and peaceful
administration contrasts strongly with the bloody and ferocious wars by which
many of the succeeding emperors endeavored to make themselves illustrious. It
was expressly intended by its founder that this temple should repress the
natural fierceness of the people by discouraging warlike operations. For this
purpose the opening or shutting of its doors was made to indicate whether the
Roman empire was in a condition of war or peace with the surrounding states.
When war raged on all sides, all its doors stood open by night and by day; and
the shutting of any one of them declared, that in that direction towards which
it looked peace had been restored. Livy tells us, that so remarkable an event as
the entire shutting up of this temple, which proclaimed that universal peace
existed throughout the empire, had occurred but thrice during the long period of
seven hundred years; once under the reign of Numa, next, during the consulship
of Titus Manlius, and lastly, after the battle of Actium, in which the Emperor
Augustus gained a splendid naval victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra, queen
of Egypt. (Liv. 1:19.) Historians have fixed the date of the latter event with
extraordinary precision; and, while their only object was to pronounce a lofty
panegyric on Augustus as the peculiar favourite of heaven, they have
unintentionally recorded that the temple of Janus was shut up when the Prince of
Peace

The natural rendering of "Quoniam dies Iehovae exercituum super omnem superbum

"The Oppian Law," so called from the tribune, Caius <i>Oppius</i>, who proposed
it, was enacted during the disastrous wars with Hannibal, about 213 years before
the Christian era. It was to this effect, "That no woman should wear on her
person more than half an ounce of gold, or use garments of variegated colors, or
ride in a carriage in any city or town, or within a mile's distance of one,
unless when she was going to observe the public festivals." This law, though
extorted by the hard necessities of the state, was all along regarded by many
persons as harsh and tyrannical, and, after producing extraordinary commotions,
was overwhelmed by the tide of public opinion. Livy informs us (34:1) that
"ladies, not restrained either by modesty or by the authority of their
husbands," and neglecting the privacy which belonged to the customs of that age,
assembled in a tumultuous manner, and publicly solicited the votes of the
consuls and praetors, and other persons in office, for the repeal of the law.
Ultimately their chief opponent was Cato, who spoke with all his ability and
eloquence, but with a sternness peculiar to his character, and increased by the
nature of the question under discussion. He was overmatched by the tact and
resources of Valerius, who brought to his aid a considerable amount of
historical information, placed the popular arguments in an advantageous light,
and succeeded in obtaining an almost unanimous repeal of the law, when it had
been twenty years in force. Our author immediately afterwards refers to the
arguments employed on that occasion. &#8212;
Ed</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ft63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the speech already mentioned, Valerius wittily alludes to this antiquated use
of the Latin word <i>mundus</i> (<i>a world</i>.) "Our ancestors," he says,

Bishop Lowth's rendering is, <i>And though there be a tenth part</i>

accords with Calvin's view, that the substance of the tree will be left. Bishop
Stock renders it <i>for pasture: But yet in</i> <i>it shall be left a tenth, and
it shall recover, and serve for</i> <i>pasture</i>. He reasons thus: "The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[b</font><font face="Palatino">
may either signify to <i>eat grass</i>, or to <i>eat it down</i>. The question
is, in which sense it is to be understood here? whether the land is again to
yield food to its inhabitants, or to be laid bare and waste? That the former is
the true meaning I think very evident, as well from the tendency of the ensuing
simile of the oak, which is of the consolatory kind, as because it is the almost
constant practice of Isaiah to subjoin to denunciations of divine vengeance a
prediction of final reconcilement and happiness." Jarchi, as interpreted by
Breithaupt, renders the word, <i>et erunt in combustionem</i> (<i>sive

ancient world. For more than a thousand years this city remained unknown and
unvisited, till Burckhardt discovered it in 1812. It was afterwards visited,
with some difficulty, by Messrs. Legh, Banks, Captains Irby and Mangles, as well
as by M. Linant and M. Laborde." Those who have not access to the details of
those enterprizing researches, or who wish to see it ably stated and argued,
that "the present condition of <i>Petra</i> furnishes a remarkable fulfillment
of Scripture prophecy," will do well to read the article Petra in Dr. Eadie's
<i>Biblical</i> <i>Cyclopaedia</i>, from which the above extracts are taken; an
